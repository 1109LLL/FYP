135430,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, It was under renovation and no one informed us until check in which took almost an hour of waiting to be served We were told the renovation noise would not start until 10am but found that it actually started at 7am right above our room No room service Kept getting questioned at the door if i was a guest and needed to show proof Not what i would expect after paying that sort of money to stay at the hyatt , The view which i payed extra for but other then that not a whole lot

135432,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, The concierge was fabulous and super helpful The hotel is undergoing some refurbishment work but I was warned about it and the discounted price was fair to reflect some small inconvenience Staff very polite always saying hello every time you cross by which is somewhat unusual but very pleasant for Paris
135433,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, They don t always automatically refill the toiletteries and coffee cups minor detail but would have made the whole stay much better , Convenient location great view and friendly staff Super helpful concierge team

135440,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, staff were not attentive little consideration on comfort the building layout was confusing it s under renovation and unfortunately lifts not only got stuck but also took a long time to arrive the room was ridiculously small just no space to move and was over furnished Better off with boutique hotels, location

135442,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel is under refurbishment so afternoon naps after a long walking tour will be disturbed by loud machinery , The staff were very friendly A special shout out to Pablo the soothing voiced receptionist One of the most welcoming and well mannered people I ve ever met There was a lot of security which at first might seem excessive but they were very respectful and very helpful Of course the food was delicious Such a large selection and all so tasty The bedroom was amazing but it was the view which took my breath away The Eiffel Tower the Arc de Triomph and other golden landmarks just a glance from the bed The bathroom was modern and clean and the bidet was surprisingly pleasant 
135443,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The window opened even though we were on the 23rd floor Scary for parents with young children , I especially liked the Apple TV opinion on the television so we could stream movies from our tablet
135444,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Put a liner in the bathroom for hanging things that clients might wash , I was pleased with the location of the hotel and the price was very competitive which I liked I was particular pleased with the personnel at the hotel Everyone is courteous and extremely Ms Merher the lady who checked us in was outstanding 
135445,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Building undergoing renovation and the WiFi was very slow at times, Property presented well and the location was very convenient for a function in Palais de Congress
135446,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Convenient shops downstairs metro and RER C which brings u directly to Versailles and if you re adventurous you could walk to the Arch de Triumph 
135447,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Prijs kwaliteit Stuck in elevator 2 Times coffee not refilled etc could not go in to my room before 18 o clock because they had the room not ready so for the same amount of money I got the same room but with a doubl bed and I paid and asked for 2 seperate bed when making rhe reservation ,No Positive
135448,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, We were there for a conference so be prepared to have this, the bed was extra comfy brilliant views the higher the better Only a 5 minute walk to the Arc de triomphe and 15 to the eiffel tower Near to metro
135449,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Room service was so bad the room itself was so small for the high 4 star Rennivation made it difficult for room access and no parking, The location is excellent
135450,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, There was ongoing construction renovations , Love the location and the shops within the hotel Easily accessible by taking the bus from CDG which stops in front of the hotel 
135451,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Expect for the good location bad ambiance and overall experience Fully understandable that the property is under renovation but still many things could be managed much better, The bar
135452,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location within walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe on a direct bus route from the airport The hotel is undergoing renovations but don t let that put you off The staff have organised facilities so that the impact is minimal The newly refurbished rooms are bright modern very comfortable to stay in With great friendly staff the overall hotel experience is very good Fair play to the staff who are going out of their way to help through all the works Lovely hotel with friendly staff in a great location I ll be back 
135453,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Renovation going on over head and it makes the place noisy and uncomfortable Place is not quite at all and hammering over head is very bothersome Have to walk a mile to get to room due to renovation and its annoying WiFi is very poor and slow and disconnects without a reason Price is extremely high compared to amenities Breakfast has more Number of Items but less Actual eatable items , View is breathtaking 
135454,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, The view was spectacular and the room was clean and well looked after It was nice and simple to walk to the arc de triumph and the tube was easily accessible from the hotel
135455,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The property is under renovation so there can be little noise but we knew that and were informed about it , The breakfast was excellent with lots of choice The view of the Eiffel tower from the room was great 
135456,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Better room service menu and availability , All the staff were friendly and welcoming and the service we received was really good The location of the hotel along with superb views of the Eiffel Tower from the 23rd flor made our stay 
135457,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel was in renovations which was not communicated at any point before the arrival Due to that the hotel gym which was one of my selection criteria was closed While the hotel provided vouchers for a gym next to the hotel it was crowded and honestly quite horrible with limited opening hours so not at all suited for business travellers that need easy access with flexible time In addition there was no hot water in the shower for the 5 days that I stayed there even though I raised the point with the reception and while someone did come to fix it they did not fix anything And a cherry peak paper cups for coffee tea and water and an empty mini bar ,No Positive
135458,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Construction going on Alot of noise n the wifi signal was bad but great location and very comfortable After construction im sure it will be better Would definitely stay here again,No Positive
135459,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Will be even better when refurb is complete, Fantastic hotel with amazing views definitely worth paying for the tower view Staff were helpful and friendly 
135460,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, There were mice in the hotel in the bar in the room where breakfast was served we seen three mice in a hour and pointed it out to staff who didn t seem too bothered and continued to set up for breakfast, The location was good as were the staff
135461,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Room disappointing small Hotel under reconstruction so no fitness room and somewhat noisy during the day , Fasionable modernized room and great view Very friendly staff and fast check in out
135462,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The bed could ve had a double size mattress instead of 2 singles Found the sleep a bit hard as I sleep in the middle of the bed and found it annoying when waking up half way down the bed , I like the size of the rooms very clean and comfy The food was delicious and enjoyable I loved the location as it s 10 mins away from the eiffel tower by taxi and everything is walking distance 
135463,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Although the entire hotel is being renovated it never felt that way at all The staff were so polite and helpful and we were always greeted with a smile The rooms were brilliant after reading other reviews we weren t sure what to expect but were definitely pleasantly surprised The facilities were divine and even though the construction work was being done just below us on that level the rooms were very sound proof Definitely will come again
135464,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Current renovation activity is making the stay uncomfortable Lifts are not efficient Check out organisation was a real discomfort with lazy personnel while customers waiting Current situation does not justify the applied rate very poor value for money , Brand new room fittings just renovated
135465,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Undergoing a full revamp so some disruptions Didn t really impact our stay but be aware if you are booking They have limited the work to sociable hours so no work starts before 10am , Good rate for the location
135466,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The mini bar is not filled and the room service charges EUR 5 for an order Although I was in a refurbished room this seemed to have been done only partially The paint was coming off the walls at some points and the windows are still old ones However the hotel is under renovation and this is clearly indicated both beforehand and on site ,No Positive
135467,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, In the presentation is written as it renovates reception but they are renovating also the restaurant Breakfast can be taken in a sports bar Minibar is empty windy besides windows the rooms are destroyed , Nothing Is like a dead building 
135468,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, As if I was staying at a workshop, The hotel is under renovation and number of available elevators is 2 only In the morning it took us 15 minutes to get down 
135469,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, they was on works Noise not organised plastic cups mac donold are much better no room service no service at all no water during night Nightmare , n othing
135470,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, No facilities in the hotel Hotel under reconstruction There were no coffee making facilities in the room nor a mini bar nor water was brought to us on a daily basis until we asked The executive lounge was not nice Very poor breakfast variety and not a nice view over paris , The check in was fast and the lady was sweet Breakfast was good with a large variety The view from our room was beautiful We had a mall right under the hotel where we received 10 discount because we were staying in the hotel 
135471,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, They are doing constructions one year and more from what they have informed us but we was going for vocation during Christmas for relax for one week and it was terrible After my complain to the reception they inform me that they had mention that they are under renovation in booking site Maybe it was somewhere mention in small letters and not clear enough for understand that you will not be able to sleep during vocation from noise For me is unacceptable hotel like Hyatt doing this thinks Every day from morning they was using hammer and tools for brake walls It was extremely noisy We was waking up with head ache every day This was absolutely not Christmas vocation I am totally unhappy and disappointed from this experience ,No Positive
135472,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, The showers were great The service was excellent and very helpful We were really in good hands in spite of the renovation process It was a wonderful experience Great breakfast buffet Can t wait till it s ready at the end of 2017 Thank you for accommodating us Make sure you talk to the right personel so they can help you make your stay comfortable during the transition
135473,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Breakfast was a waste of money 9 staff in the dining room were unattentive and standing at their stations conversing with one another which could be heard over clientele Ther were never more that 25 clients in the dining room at one time isiswas there for over 1 5 hours The hot food was cold and the layout and flow of the breakfast buffet is incredibly counter intuitive I would say arbitrary One of the staff had a loud and heated argument with a client and no manager or other staff made any effort to assuage the argument or resolve the issue The first day the food was cold and theb unattentive service was deplorable service staff stood around chatting amng themselves in 2s and 3s and would did not even take away my used dishes The only thing any staff did was to get me a mug of coffee when I first sat down from a machine yes I think I could have managed that by myself A woman was having trouble with the toaster no one went to help her if I could see this from across the room why didn t they see it So I decided to give the breakfast another try my second day because there was too much construction noise in my room again Not much improvement the eggs were a bit warmer than the day before As I was leaving 3 staff were standing chatting in the entrance where the podium is none of them would move out of the way so I could get past They just stood there looking at me like deer caught in the headlights 25 euro for the breakfast was a waste of money I do not like to give bad reviews but this one was unavoidable , The new rooms and bathrooms are very well done and comfortable 
135474,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, i was held in lift number 6 for 35 minutes on the early morning of monday the second of january 2017 help was very late i was scared to death Oxegem was getting less and less overall services level is getting very bad ,No Positive
135475,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The wifi didn t work but the hotel were aware there were issues during the building work , Upgraded to one of the new refurbished rooms these were lovely Fantastic view of the tower 
135476,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, There was t any jim and pool for everyday , Hi Thanx alot for your suggestion about hyatt regency Although the hotel was underconstruction but it was nt disturbe me because it was from 9 to 18 pm that most of the time I was out The staff were very nice and I realy had a good newyear in paris 
135477,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Internet connection is horrible Construction renovation work not good if you re visiting Paris for vacation I ve complained since day 1 and got response from guest relation only at the 3rd day of my 4 nights stay No proper restaurant at the hotel No room service you re basically ordering food from a Cafe in the mall downstairs and you pay a delivery fee Price is too high taking into account you re just paying for bed without Internet and breakfast Other option like AC Marriott would be a better option and It s common and we ll know in Scandinavian countries They used to have a better staff at the lobby it used to be my favorite hotel in Paris but this time I m extremely disappointed however I still give them a 6 2 rating Maybe it s due to the renovation work , Location Renovated rooms View from the room 
135478,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I did not get what i asked for i send like 5 mails and called the hotel 2 times to be sure that my room is with a view of the eiffel tower and then they tell me that they sold out,No Positive
135479,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Renovation and the fact that we were not informed about it Very noisy Internet was very poor sometimes not available Room temperature could not be controlled , Location
135480,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Facility was so unlike standard regency we accustomed to As we were given the unrenovate room so old Only after complained we were given to a new renovate room but the quality was poor Would not go back again , Staff was good helpful
135481,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Price quality rate is too bad We booked eiffel tower faced room but tower could be seen only you get sode of the window Room was very old and equipped with old furniters ,No Positive
135482,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Construction works all around the hotel No sign of this during booking process This is not honest The construction works should be mentioned in booking com, Perfect location perfect breakfast
135483,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, No tea and coffee making facilities in the room Limited seats to sit in the lobby Consierge staff unhelpful when we couldn t get into the room The lady hostess in the vue bar was incredibly rude It is obvious people go to the bar for the fabulous views of the city below So why she insists on putting you in the crappest seats with the worst views is beyond me Then when you ask to move so you can see she shrugs as if you are the most unreasonable person in the world and is then rude, It s locality
135484,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I took my daughter for her 13th Birthday as a special treat to see the Eiffel Tower We spent a lot of money on two rooms in this hotel as it looked fabulous I thought I had booked an Eiffel Tower view however this wasn t the case I called to reception and was met with if you wanted that room you should have paid for it I had already paid 150 per night per room for a club room I asked about upgrading and was met with a nothing is available and the phone going down After another 20 minutes I went to reception and was offered to Downgrade my room for the View for the same money Firstly the room we had was pitiful for a club room When I saw the downgraded room I was disgusted Club rooms also advertise an American style waffle breakfast which I am still waiting to experience too Poor facilities poor hotel would definitely never stay here again Thankfully my daughter did get her wish of going up the Eiffel Tower Hyatt shocked by the standard ,No Positive
135485,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I requested for a room with Eiffel Tower but first they gave me a room without the view so I had to change the room once When I went to my new room there were clipped nails around the table which were quite disgusting , Excellent view of Eiffel Tower
135486,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, the hotel is really old and while its clean things are faded and the furniture is is not so great although there was a notice that the place is being upgraded renovated so i guess in future it will be much much better for the money you pay i guess the best thing you get out of it is the location and the view the club access is good but the club itself if a bit outdated place heavily needs renovation, amazing view if you take the room with the eiffel tower view and you should totally recommended and amazing location The metro is accessible from inside the hotel which is connected to a shopping mall as well on the yellow metro line all the tourist places are easily accessible the staff were very nice and we were offered the room at arrival time which was 10 in the morning although checkin time was at 1500 hrs they have a good facility to hold your baggage until your flight time on the way out
135487,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I booked a room with a king size bed but the room had 2 x singles joined together No coffee facilities in room , Easy to locate Nice bar area and view of Paris Friendly staff
135488,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Construction work which last until September 2017 We could not control temrature in our room Too hot , We were very much disappointed with the renovation work making load noise We were not informed in advance before booking about this I expected more from Booking com This impact my decision to book through you going forward 
135489,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Staff at front desk and restaurants were very Friendly and helpful Special mention on Nishanta who stepped into help when other staff were busy Great location and views as the hotel is one of the tallest buildings around 
135490,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, It was in renovation and all facilities was too old but very expensive Also the rooftop bar was very expensive 500ml water was 15 euro Location was too far away from the city and there were no good restaurant near by , Hotel has very nice rooftop bar
135491,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The whole setting is bad beginning with the point that they do not have a parking space so we had to use the public parking from the mall 40 day The entrance is currently on the 4th floor only to be accessed from inside the mall The whole hotel seems to be under construction and this is influencing the operation in a very bad way I ordered a delux room with kingsize bed I got a very small room with a double bed From 10 00 to 18 00 you hear very loud construction noise so no chance to rest or stay in the room during this time On booking com com was no information about the current situation construction And if you complain at the reception they tell you they can t do anything for you They don t even offered us a drink for free or something simple Even the room service is just from illy brought in a bag do not order , I was really happy to have my girl with me and was finaly able to leave the hotel not as you would expect through the front door as the lobby is under construction 
135492,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The corridor and the hall were super dirty because of the repairing work There was a strange smell in all of the palais not only in Hyatt and in the parking which was horrible , The location is great for a congress in le palais des congr s The view was super The room were clean 
135493,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Renovation work on reception was more disruptive than expected although helpful staff made this better , Staff friendly and very helpful location is excellent and the top bar views are lovely
135494,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Restaurant and small room , Staff were excellent Couldn t fault any of them All very helpful Very disapprestaurant and small ointing that there were no tea coffee facilities in the room Room wasn t cleaned until 17 30 Restaurant was closed due to renovations which wasn t a problem as we didn t have breakfast there 28 for breakfast is very expensive Also the new restaurant which I had booked for an evening meal had a very poor choice of menu
135495,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Surprised to see most of the hotel shut for a major refurb Nothing said on booking com on this Would have picked another hotel Poor info from Booking,No Positive
135496,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The stuff informed us that the hotel is under renovation until September 2017 and after 10 a m there was loud noises The room should have been sound proof but we could hear noises from other rooms and the traffic We had access to the club but it was not clearly explained to us what is included for us from there what kind of food and drinks The Story We only stayed one night in Paris and I wanted to make a custom request for the room but the hotel staff din not answer to it and I presumed that it will be delivered and when I got there there was nothing prepared and that affected my mood from the start Strike 1 Anyway after that I wanted to go to the hotel bar to drink a hot tea with my wife before leaving to visit the city because we was a little cold from the trip to the hotel We went to the hotel club where we has access and asked a stuff member to guide us to the bar which floor and how to get there Just to be clear the bar had the view to the Eiffel Tower and the club did not Luckily for me that i reserved a room with the view to the Tower The stuff member from there had poor english and we could not understand what he told us After he realized that he did not explain it clearly and we did not receive what he tried to tell us he made a call and after explained that the bar is off limit because it was reserved for a private event and that was the first time when we were informed about that it would have been nice to be informed earlier that the bar will be reserved so that I could plan something else Strike Two We decided to take the tea in the club and when we tried to order it after a long conversation with the member present there with pour english we realized that the only tea available in the hotel was a mixture of black and green tea both containing teine similar to caffeine and that was no good because my wife is sensible to it and its affects her sleep Strike 3 and we were out , I liked the room view because it was as I expected The breakfast was very good and had everything that me and my wife wanted All the staff that we had contact with were kind and well intended to answer all our questions 
135497,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The whole property is outdated and renovation ongoing will most likely not resolve all the deficits It is the former Concorde Lafayette Hotel from the early 70ies or 60ies of last century This is not at Hyatt standards Rooms are extremely small and noisy , Very nice staff at reception Gorgeous view of Paris from my room at 31st floor 
135498,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room was clup and explain its bigger than any room in Paris hotels but it was small the matress was two separate that just attach by nothing and me and my husband fall in a big gap I dont like the bed because some instruction finding reception was a challenge, Location was realy near Metro from 0 floor to Metro station and near attractive places view of my room was Effel Tour perfect love it 
135499,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Older facilities than I thought Staffs were kind but gave me different type of room from what I requested even requested 3 times for changing a room , View from hotel location from CDG and to from sites reachable by subway 1 and RER C
135500,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Wifi connections work The internet however does not The hotel is under renovation Because of that access to rooms is organised in a very convoluted manner The part of the hotel yet to be renovated looks rather shabby Certainly not worth the price We were asked for our e mail address because it was missing from the file Two days later newsletters and commercial offers from Hyatt started pouring in Ironically the unsolicited messages try to convey the impression that you re given the opportunity to be part of some exclusive club In reality all you get is a small room showing its age at least in that hotel I ve stayed in Paris hotels that were cheaper better equipped and much much closer to the city center , Adequate breakfast 
135501,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, No obvious entrance if hotel entrance from inside mall the hotel is very old and not well maintained many bathroom equipment not functioning , Location is good
135502,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Hotel under innovation big workshop No place for reception No Lobby enternce from back door Long corridor to reach to inside the many things broken Bathrooms broken hotel Rooms very bad dirty noisy after 10 00 am ect , Nothing m
135503,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Service was but nothing No one was helpful or capable of giving correct advice to the simplest question Toilet seat shimmered yellow Ceiling ad water cracks ,No Positive
135504,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, No complaints at all, The location of this hotel was excellent Even though there were renovations in progress this had no impact on our stay very pleasant staff on reception 
135505,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, They had a fabulous fitness suite that had non working lights and machines No notification of this when checking in Really poor experience , The rooftop bar is great fantastic views across the city 
135506,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, on the day we arrived we were advised that there are repair works going on and this was not advised when I booked it in the morning we could hear drilling and hammering and yet we were on the 27th floor the work was happening in the lobby I was disappointed that this had not been advised , the location of the hotel was excellent
135507,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, It would be appreciated if there was a kettle and coffee maker in the room, The staff was excellent The hotel is undergoing renovations which are needed as it is stuck in a time warp I found the room size reasonable for a European hotel and would stay there again 
135508,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Fridge was empty l paid for two small water for 10 Euro That s really bad It sould be free in a 4star hotel Very expensive at the bar Breakfast wasn t good We had two single beds in the room and they didn t put them together until very late in the night Room wasn t as described , Friendly staff 
135509,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The ensuite bathroom had really cool double doors made of frosted glass Unfortunately there was no lock on them and they didn t quite meet in the middle meaning zero privacy I wouldn t have liked to stay here with someone that I wasn t already entirely comfortable around On the other hand the bathroom suite itself was really nice The decor was a little outdated scuffed in places although I expect this will not be a problem when the renovation is complete We took this room at a huge discount because there were building renovation works going on Having been told that the work was being carried out daily between 10am 6pm we decided that wasn t a problem as we intended to be visiting the city between those hours However we were woken up by the sounds of hammering and sawing from what sounded like the room directly above us from as early as 7am some days We were also woken up at 8am one morning by cleaners vacuuming the hallway outside our bedroom door There was another occasion when a maid walked into our room without knocking at 8 30am This made for an entirely unromantic honeymoon In fairness when we spoke to the concierge about the noise issues they were very sympathetic offered us free breakfast and some vouchers for drinks at the hotel bar as an apology Lastly I wasn t sure what to expect from an expensive high end hotel having myself generally stuck to mid range or small independently owned hotels I left feeling distinctly underwhelmed Although it was nice other than the view there wasn t anything else for me that set it above other places that I have stayed , Bed pillows were really comfortable although on the down side it was two single mattresses pushed together and secured with velcro rather than a real king size bed As a couple who are used to sleeping with our arms round eachother this wasn t ideal as we had to either stick to our separate sides of the bed squeeze onto one side of the bed or suffer the uncomfortable ridge in the middle The view from our room was excellent and the view from the bar on the top floor was incredible Staff were very polite helpful 
135510,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Old facilities Staff took longer time than expected to check in When we asked for an adapter they requested 10 deposit I had no cash and wanted to have some rest while charging my phone I didn t like the service A bit far from champs elysee by foot ,No Positive
135511,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, For the price I m not sure I d stay here again because it just didn t have a ton to offer compared to cheaper places I ve stayed Breakfast not included and very pricey to add on not unusual for a major chain hotel I understand but I m still not going to do that with all the cafes so close by No pool although there was a fitness center at least When I went to use the luggage storage option there were at least 3 employees standing at the desk who were all texting and talking amongst themselves and didn t even notice me until I said something to them , We stayed in a room that had been recently renovated and so was in very nice condition From reading other reviews it seems that some people were unhappy with the older style of room but there was no problem at all with ours and I think the renovations will be done fairly soon The receptionist was very friendly as well Location of the hotel is good very close to a train station and an easy walk to major Paris attractions Oh and good Wi Fi throughout the hotel too 
135512,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Very basic room No water or mini bar No tea or coffee making facilities They are renovating floors 9 25 and start drilling at 10am We only found this out on check in Cocktails upstairs are 25 each View was amazing though I probably wouldnt choose to stay here again to be honest , Location was great View from the bar was exceptional 
135513,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Feeling like my room was right next to a work site , Construction right next to our room They said it would start at 10 am but they started drilling at 7 am 
135514,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, very bad no internet no water no minibar it is not for business man very poor services and very expensive we can consider this hotel maximum 3 star, the location
135515,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, We were supposed to have a double bed however they joint 2 single beds together which made it rather uncomfortable, I like the location close to a Metro
135516,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, I spent three nights in Hyatt Regency with my two 11 years old kids We had a club room on 32nd floor which was upgraded to a room with Eiffel tower view The view was fantastic The kids were amazed I couldn t take them away from the window We had an access to the Regency club on the 30th floor offering different food and drinks throughout the day It was really convenient for the pauses we were making after the hours spent visiting sites in Paris The breakfast was also served in the club for the club room guests The hotel takes you directly to a metro station through the shopping mall from 8 am to 8 pm in the evenings you should use the street access I see a lot are complaining about the price of the rooms and the hotel bar and restaurant but it was just an average cost of service you get in Paris the accommodation and food is extremely expensive everywhere in Paris We were warned by the staff about the potential noice by the ongoing reconstruction works in the hotel but we didn t hear anything I would certainly stay here again particularly after the renovation is finished next year 
135517,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, apparently upgrade to hotel and work commenced at 7am until 7pm so not happy about that The first room we were shown to was very old and worn and smelled of cats urine Complaned and was moved to a more modern room , staff were lovely and location was good 
135518,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, When I arrived to hotel at 11 am the receptionist told us that check in will be at 3 pm When I told them that I should have an early check in as a genius member in Booking com they did not consider this and told me that we can offer another room without Effie view as I reserved at the same price So do not consider any genius priority There is no double bed only two beds closed together No room facilities and should be under special request , The location of the hotel is good and easily transport to airport Metro station is close and congress center is on beside 15 20 min walking distance from Arc de Champ Baggage reservation is available Good security system 
135519,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Very long waiting time at check in Mini bar in the room empty Very old hotel undergoing renovation This was communicated on beforehand though so no issues here But it really is outdated , Location View from the room
135520,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, This is my second stay at the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile I have reserved a Presidential Suite for one night as I did in the first one On this stay I was given a different Presidential Suite from the last time The decoration on this one was outdated and cold and catered to adults and did not have the best view of Paris While on the previous one the suite was warm and more children friendly with comfortable sofas It also had a beautiful view of Paris the Eiffel Tower and other landmark The most troubling thing on this visit was when my family and I arrived into the suite While everything seemed cleaned and in order however when my wife checked the guest bathroom she immediately noticed that the toilet was used and not cleaned It was appalling I also noticed in the living area a tray with coffee and mugs I thought it was a welcoming gesture but when I checked carefully there was coffee in the mugs and it has been used I immediately went to the front desk and reported my complaint and asked for another suite Unfortunately the other ones were all taken So the front desk promised me that they will get the bathroom cleaned and the tray picked up immediately However 40 minutes later housekeeping did not show up and I had to call again until they showed up this time around Needless to say there were no apologies from the hotel management and explanation how did this happen or someway to make up for this incident Very disappointing Finally Because the king bed in one of suite bedrooms are large and the bedroom is small the passage between the bed and the closet facing it is very narrow The issue was that the bed stands are made of solid wood and are on the edge of the bed One time when I was walking and about to enter this passage my left foot toe hit the solid wood so hard it was bruised very badly and I could not walk comfortably for two weeks , The staff at the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile are very friendly and welcoming 
135521,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Hotel was a bit shabby and needs upgrading Yhe bar on the 34th floor while offering stunning views was madly icerpriced 13 for a glass of mineral water Also 25 for a continental breakfast is way over priced, Location excellent really good value for hotel clise to action Staff were very good really impressed
135522,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The size of the room the fact that the shower is in a bath no coffee making facilities and the parking is extortionate pricing, The view the staff definitely the comfort of the bed 
135523,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Property is very old with several issues in bathroom none that affected usability but wall damaged very visbily with water damage desks etc super scratched not quality expected from Hyatt, Got upgraded to deluxe king without asking as checkin lady was super nice
135524,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I wouldn t normally stay at a hotel like this because it is really big Cold impersonal atmosphere even though everyone was really nice and helpful , Great value considering the lower price during the renovation 
135525,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, non disclosure of the On going refurbishment the noise and the poor quality of the rooms, Great location but old building with no bottle of water for guests The furnitures are very old not what should be expected for a 4 stars hotel Moreover they are refurbishing so the place was very noisy from 8 to 6 pm Couldn t enjoy our rest
135526,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Currently being renovated but wasn t a big deal , The location is perfect Airport bus for all airports leave arrive right outside plus metro station is almost in the same building via a shopping centre On the 1 metro line which goes through the centre of Paris and is perfect for lots of the main attractions Plus views of the Eiffel Tower in all it s sparkly glory
135527,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Though very friendly they have very slow and inefficient staff My room was ready only an hour after check in time Luggage came in only after 2 reminders There were other issues in the room which were not fixed despite informing the staff ,No Positive
135528,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel is really old fashion Looks like 1970 s Lobby is very dark Checkin time was 15 minutes for only 3 customers in front of me A business guy came late and passed in front of everybody else thanks to his Premium Membership This is offensive and makes you non premium member feel miserable The room was OKish But the decoration is old looking and dark The table is full of bumps and glitches The mini bar was empty The airco blowing noise and cold I could reduce a bit the fan but not switch it off So the next morning I had a headache The restaurant is in the huge lobby quite dark and not cosy at all so I went across the street to the Trattoria Bellagio Last but not least the Wifi was free but useless as the speed was near to none I turned back to my 4G Overall the experience was far below expectations and not reaching the level Hyatt Regency deserves , Bed is comfortable 
135529,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Asked for a double bed got two single beds bathroom mouldy stunk way overpriced discraceful room worst place we have everstayed, Nothing worst part of 5 week holiday
135530,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Hotel under renovation so things will be better then but right now the hotel looks old Maybe what does Not need to wait renovation is hotel wifi It is really a very intermittent coverage , The property is nicely located 
135531,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Old rooms and furniture like average 3 stars Noisy you could hear the lifts from the room Gym old equipment and not enought No sauna or not indicated , Matras of the bed
135532,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Definitely needs to be freshened up Bathtub was almost falling appart Check in and out took forever at least 15 with waiting time and payment Employees at the breakfast weren t not even at par and the breakfast is a joke compared to hotels of this standing , Location
135533,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Awful traffic no parking quite impersonal it is a Business type Hotel saying that the afternoon shift was totally different Charlean I think was very helpful not sure if I would use again , Difficult one it does the job a Hotel should its walking distance to all the main attractions clean modern touch plenty of good eateries nearby 
135534,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel generally is pour including the plumbing I took pictures, I liked nothing abt the hotel it s over priced for a hotel that is still under construction
135535,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, In business trip for 5 or more days a bigger wardrobe would be interesting , It is a great choice if you are attending a Conference in the Palais des Congres 
135536,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Hotel is under renovation If you stay daytime in the room you would be mad due to continuous sound of renovation works It starts from 9am till 5 or 6pm Leave the room early and come back late or just not stay these are the options you may have , Good location to go to from airport Just next to highway exit air france direct bus stop metro stations I particularly like this hotel because it is located 5min walk from boulogne park 
135537,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Bad rooms Paint falling off Bad furnishing as always You come back after all days work and room is not even made up Then you call three times and wait 2 hours to get a room clean at a hyatt property where you have paid 300 ruros plus a night Forget about asking anything from house keeping etc wont come till you have to leave for work etc Concierge is knowledeable though and will make your reservations at very nice places for dinner or drinks All an all cant believe hyatt is putting its name on this property , Only location That is why i stay here often 
135538,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Limited breakfast choices in the club lounge , Great location with excellent access to the metro station the shopping mall Great view to the Eiffel tower arc de triumph that looks much closer in reality 
135539,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, NOISE Renovation works ongoing all day and very very very loud So I find the price payed was too high , First choice location in Paris Room had very nice view on Eiffel Tower 
135540,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The sky bar was way to expensive for a pint 15 quid , Catherine the duty manager was an amazing lady extremely helpful in everyway and went out of her way to help us Cant thank this lady enuff amazing woman thankyou 
135541,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Supposed to be a deluxe double room it was not two singles zipped together no mini bar as offered not even tea or coffee making facilities in the room walls had paint missing or bubbling off wall socket hanging off wall the so called pe acceptane of the payment card was taken right away and 150 pounds more than agreed price by book com, Location was great most of the staff were very friendly apart from the rather grumpy lady at check in the bar at the roof has a great view of the city 
135542,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, The view over the Eiffel Tower and Bois de Boulogne from the 30th floor was amazing The access to the Regency Club breakfast with a view drinks during the day was a nice perk Comfy beds Porte Maillot is on Line 1 so very easy to get from there to the main sights of the city
135543,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The so called exclusive free club lounge for club class rooms served hardly anything except fruit juices and cookies all day long and nothing after 8 in the evening Even the limited snacks menu was identical day after day a bit boring if you stay there for 5 days , The club king room had an excellent view
135544,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The concierge told incorrect info about currency exchange options and in general was not pleasant to deal with He really should be replaced Be aware that an exchange bureau with a good rate is right in the same complex as the hotel at the minus 1 floor Don t use either the hotel or the bureaus on Champs Elisee they will rob a 20 mark up from you My shower was half broken and I had to repair it every other time I took it but decided not to ask for another room my colleague asked to change her room twice due to some problems But the hotel is currently undergoing rennovation hopefully they will fix those problems , Simple but high quality breakfast A quiet and clean district 20 min walk to the Arc of Triumph where you can catch a couple of hop on hop offs at the opposite sites from the Arc to see the city I took the L Open Bus good tours along four routes Nice reception personnel 
135545,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, All sounds from the corridor could be heard in my room that is people walking and talking and closing doors and sound from the elevators I did not try to find out whether the sound came through the door with the canals in the air ventilation or maybe somehow else There was lot of noise from drilling machines and some other instruments from ten o clock in the morning but I realize that repairing work must sometimes been done so this is maybe the best time to start in the morning , The bed was like a cloud yes I slept like a child if I used ear props 
135546,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Hotel is not as expected for Hyatt level under huge reconstruction noise and in bad conditions at all , There is in the same building as Congress centre Nice view from room to Eiffel tower 
135547,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, where shall I start not a single complimentary bottle of water empty mini bar no kettle and I had to ask for an iron which I luckily got since a lot of guests were also attending the conference and asking for an iron , The location was rather convenient since I was in Paris for the Cigre conference and that is pretty much it 
135548,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The renovation works and the noise but hopefully will be done soon, As always the location is worth a lot can t find better location than having the metro station just under the hotel wether it s summer or winter u don t have to go out of the perimeter for shopping everything is available in the boutique du palais just in the basement
135549,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Was not alowed to use the computer in the business center to pring my boarding pass for no clear reason The person setting there didn t let me use the computer and instead he asked me if i can email him my boarding pass to pront it for me My boarding pass is a personal information so why would i email it to anybody , Location
135550,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, We got a little room with a real dirty carpet no coffee maker and with furnitures showing major signs of wear and tear After complaint we received a different room still small but renovated The hotel is in the process to be renovated Will last till 2017 The breakfast area breakfast offered for 25 each located in a corner of the lobby w o daylight The hotel is rated as 4 star we really expected much more for the money , Nothing at all beside the name Hyatt Regency and a 15 minutes footwalk only to the Arc de Triumphe 
135551,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The first night we were allocated a room which were very uncomfortable dirty and outdated when I complained the second morning we were moved to a room in the renovated section room 0818 however find the photos I attached from this room it show how bad the standard is even after renovation Also it is impossible to be in the room between 10 00 am and 5 00 pm as a constant thundering drilling and hammering non stop as other sections of the hotel get renovated , the staff are helpful
135552,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Pablo receptionist Named Pablo Pablo Not be as accustomed to his style of Hama hotel staff has been his style CNN And deliberately is giving me a good room Also the rooms are not clean the floor There is no maintenance work and Severe voice rang, Nishantho Location The employee s name Nishan Nishantha His style is excellent and Khellouk
135553,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel is under renovation Till the end of the works it shouldn t be called Hyatt because the standing of the rooms is to poor there for , The location is good and the view is magnificent
135554,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Our room was very run down and old The only good thing was the view Until the renovations are done it s an expensive outlay without the quality you would expect of the Hyatt Not the hotel s fault exactly but the taxi cab that they had for us didn t take card but no one told us until we had reached the location had no cash and ended up locked in the cab at a standoff until we convinced the driver to take us to an ATM to get money out Frustrating So the lesson is don t assume re paying by card , The views if you pay for those rooms are amazing And once the renovations are done I m sure the hotel will meet expectations once more 
135555,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Rooms are bad, This hotel always give me the worst room when i get it trough booking Rooms are the worst i ve been to this hotel alot coz i am airline pilot and we get good rooms but when i get from booking i get the worst rooms
135556,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Our mini bar was completely empty and we had no option to make any tea or coffee for ourselves , The view out of our Eiffel Tower view room was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable 
135557,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Hotel should be closed There is heavy construction and load jack hammer noise in many different levels Rooms and furniture are old and one star I have no idea how this hotel can claim to be 3 or 4 star 
135558,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, A bit of old hotel 2 beds instead of a large bed, Pablo front desk staff was very welcoming and very nice He offered us breakfast free of charge 
135559,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The bus to the airport has not the children s ticket it is full price, It s very good hotel of its location and easy to most sightseeings There are two famous restaurants nearby one is mussel the other not to eat because of too long lines
135560,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, When we checked in we asked reservations for breakfast but we arrived for breakfast we were denied entry For a top class hotel this left both of us very disappointed ,No Positive
135561,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Very bad experience Booked this hotel for eiffel tower view only but staff didnt gave me Very tall building but they dont have parking Very complicated location in my 2016 car gps no hyatt regency found tried to find it by phone number but no record found had a hard time I parked car infront of hotel for luggage and check in but guy in Concierge section came and told me to take my car this is the way they deal I told rexeption staff to change my room but no support I went bar for tower view and wait for around 40 minutes for someone to take order Unfriendly noncooperative staff Far from eiffel tower Not recommended , Breakfast is good 
135562,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, It is way WAY overpriced The hotel does concede that renovations will take place until 2017 but at 212 euro per night during renovations it needs to get everything right ie no scratched wood desk or bedside locker no dirty linen covering the bed base no peeling paint especially around the windows a fridge that opens the opposite way to the door covering it For 212 euro per night I expected to be up on the top stories of the 34 storey hotel but I only got 7th floor , The foyer is massive It s beside a shopping centre which has Marks and Spencer and Eat The location is not far to walk down to the main part of the Champs Elysee The staff are well trained and responsive I was allowed check in early and check out late 
135563,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Outdated decor and in some cases paint peeling or rips in rug in hallway stained carpeting However we looked past all of that and enjoyed the many other things this hotel offered , Great view of Eiffel Tower and the city Room was comfortable and we were gone during the day when construction was taking place Loved the included breakfast and happy hour on the 30th Floor
135564,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room where I lived is really small and old even the wall skill is eradicated The environment is loud because of decoration I can t image there is a Hyatt hotel it looks like a guest house , The staff service is perfect
135565,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Noice old rooms, Renovation noise but the MS kathereen was very nice to acommediate us and make us feel home and understand our request Best hotel manager i ever seen
135566,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Are you made my reservation for three rooms and I asked for a connect rooms and the deal for arrival they give me what they call upgrade it s an old suite it has a living room with a sofa bed very old and uncomfortable to sleep in at all although there is very nosy work in the hotel,No Positive
135567,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, On arrival at the hotel the reception was very slow booking in there were not enough staff We were then allocated a room on entering the room there was a terrible smell coming from the air conditioning it was a strong smell of cigarettes We were then moved to another room On booking in I was required to provide a bank card to hold against the room should I require to add any other services On leaving the hotel I paid the bill from another account On arriving home I have discovered that the hotel have blocked the initial bank card and I can t use my account I have emailed the hotel but there has been no reply I am now being charged by my bank , The staff were very nice
135568,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, i did the reservation for my family and mentioned the name of the person who will stay and pay they refused to let my family enter the room untill i send them an email to confirm the names again the suite is not suitable for a family with child ad they say in the booking the location of the hotel is so far from the center ,No Positive
135569,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Its old though under renovation Its quite expensive considering its not yet fully renovated The aisle from lift to the rooms are soo dark Breakfast has very limited choices , Location is a plus Theres a metro station right under the hotel The view of eiffel tower at night is amazing 
135570,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Maintenance starts 8 00 A M too early Suggest to be between 10 00 A M till 6 00 P M, Friendly and supportive staff They shifted our rooms to a higher level to avoid the noise during the maintenance
135571,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel is in renovation A lots of noise till 18h00 This has not been mentioned neither during the booking nor the registration but once the room was paid Otherwise I wouldnt have checked in , Locatiion
135572,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Cleaning of room was not so good Concierge for night time young person was not concierge at all However bar manager kindly took care of my reservation despite short notice and business center staff was perfectly professional I am expecting more quality to come once they accomplish their renovation from Concord to Hyatt in 2017 
135573,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, See above, Didn t used the food there Beds are okay As a guest arriving with an own car gives problems there is not a single parking space to park the car to do the check in procedure Very inconvenient They just asked you to unload the luggage and you have to leave immediately This gives not a welcoming impression Cannot make use of the fridge as it is connected with their central system If you move anything from the fridge they immediately charge you Other lower stars hotels gives you the facility to make use of the fridge and gives daily complementary two bottles of water There is no water cooker and complementary coffee or tea Lower stars hotels offers much more in room facilities
135574,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Not an issue for the hotel but when it says presidential suite on booking Com and has pictures of the room with views of the Eiffel Tower then this is what you expect In fact there is more than one presidential suite and not all have this view Be aware, The location is good the views amazing and the staff are first rate Catherine the guest services manager was just brilliant Really looked after our needs well The rest of the staff were also very attentive 
135575,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Hotel is a bit old fashion that need to upgrade on rooms decor to align with Hyatt chain , Thank you so much for the efficiency and honesty of the housekeeping and the security that kept my money in the safety box when I forgot to take it back when I check out in the afternoon The front desk manager Victoria and the security manager was so kind enough to help me while I called back at night time and kept it on the hotel safe for me 
135576,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel was under renovation and no one informed us of this prior to checking in the noise in the rooms was deafening the room has chipping and unclean spaces and smell overall a very bad experience they assured us a refund also but nothing has been done so far ,No Positive
135577,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Everything else This hotel should not be called a Hyatt it ruins the brand s reputation Everything is extremely old minuscule room old carpets decoration bathroom plugs do not work It even smells bad Very noisy construction work going on from 10 to 6pm I guess they are at least trying to resolve the old age issue They should not sell the rooms right next to the construction work but mine was right under I also found the staff to be mostly rude and not understanding as for some unforeseen reasons I could not make it on my planned night and asked them to modify the reservation to either reimburse or postpone to the day after or a later time within the same month all of these options were refused actually Booking com asked the hotel themselves and were shocked by the lack of professionalism and customer service provided by Hyatt Etoile I ended up paying double the price on another day to stay in a hotel which in my opinion is no better than a 2 stars My original fare was good enough that it would have only been a disappointing trip but the price I ended up paying and the general attitude of the staff I had to deal with makes this hotel a complete joke Booking a Hyatt anywhere in the world is usually a safe bet in terms of facilities as well as general service provided Hyatt Paris Etoile is the exception , The situation of the hotel is very convenient Rooms with Eiffel Tower view probably offer one of the most amazing views of Paris
135578,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Yes the property is currently being renovated and at check in it was explained that this would take a further two years to complete However it was not for the room I selected this hotel it was most certainly for the view , The view the location and the upgrade to a suite on the top floor 
135579,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The food was a little too expensive but nothing beyond the Paris average , We stayed at the Hyatt hotel for our honeymoon and it was magnificent we had a room on the 32nd floor with a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower the breakfast was good and the hotel staff were nice and warm 
135580,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Room was old and needs some refurbishing Peeling wall painting Stained carpet Curtains don t block light Nice view though , Location is useful and close to the tube 
135581,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel itself is extremely tired I stayed twice over a two week period for work so saw several rooms I changed because the first room was so noisy there was building work something that I hadn t been informed about In all rooms I saw 3 there was paint peeling from walls and windows old furnishing with marks It was clean but this gave the overall impression it wasn t and that you didn t really want to touch anything However the bathrooms seemed to be of much higher quality than the rooms themselves In addition although the staff were always friendly polite and eager to help sometimes service was a little slow I called to ask for the room to be cleaned which it was but they didn t remove the room service plates or restock the soft drinks in the minibar requested an iron which they said would be sent immediately but it took several hours and I d already left by then For me the gym is really important when travelling The claim was to have a state of the art gym however there was limited equipment the rower didn t work properly and one of the two running machines didn t work There were also no weights or resistance machines at all only cardio Given a choice next time I wouldn t stay here again ,No Positive
135582,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, The situation is fantastic and the very luxurious lovely commercial shopping center are very good it s located near Eiffel tour it s viewing from34 floor to all Paris
135583,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Room was not ready until 4 30 wasted my afternoon lid wifi avaliable all day Staff are dishonest don t keep their word Gym is few pieces is machinies,No Positive
135584,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room is rather small but the view from the room overlooking Paris is very impressive , Good healthy breakfast good variety and service Very good reception on check in by Mr Nishanta 
135585,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, They have an ongoing renovation project that starts in the morning I didn t know this when I booked this room it sounded like it was next door and woke us both up early in the morning after a 12 hour flight , The location and staff There is an airport shuttle bus that s first stop is right in front of the hotel 
135586,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Bed was composed from two single beds Bathroom door is almost inexistent We had booked a king size room we arrived quite early in the morning and so at the reception they gave another one available but without specifying it was a small one , Eiffel tower view from the room Mattress quite confortable Silent environment and well positioned 
135587,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, 1 The access to the rooms were dingy with old torn carpets 2 The electricity in the room was off 70 during our stay There was some issue with running an iron 3 No tea making facility in the room 4 Breakfast at the hotel was pathetic hence had to go across the street to have something decent 5 Renovation of the hotel carried out from 10 1800 every day on top of our heads , The location of the hotel was the only thing that went in favour 
135588,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room was in bad state of repair The walls were cracked and dusty The room was very noisy from 1000 to 1800 The bathroom floor had a broken tile which had been badly repaired The bar on the 34th floor is the most expensive in the city The hotel is being renovated but the price doesn t reflect the noise dirt and inconvenience, The bed was comfortable and the shower had good temperature and pressure
135589,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I felt like for the money that I spent at the place I could have gotten a better deal somewhere else This hotel did not have a pool the gym was pretty crappy and only contained cardio equipment our room did not have a view of the tower I felt that the breakfast options the club and the lounge are extremely overpriced options Overall I feel like there are much better deals in Paris where you can get more for your money , I liked the location of the place It was situated close to the metro station and it is located near lots of restaurants and stores I felt that the entire staff was extremely polite and courteous and I liked the decor of the hotel itself 
135590,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Check out took forever We were checked out by someone named Tina I believe and it took just over 15 minutes We felt negatively questioned and unhappy with this delay The room was prepaid and we had a room service charge city tax left to pay It didn t need to take this long There was no queue and when we indicated that we were in a rush it did not change anything We are extremely frequent travellers and this was the absolute longest list of questions we have ever received at check out I don t need to be asked 3 times if I left stuff in my room She asked loads of questions about our room YET we weren t actually asked by her what card we wanted to pay She processed the payment on my credit card without asking first but because it took so long we ignored this to get out on time which was not the method of payment we actually wished to pay with This was not in line with the rest of our stay which was pleasant professional and a lot of fun I am returning in 2 weeks time and hope this part has improved by then , Location and the staff bell hop check in lounge room service cleaning service were awesome 
135591,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel was under renovation until 2017 Some floors are even closed When booking our room online from Montreal Canada there was absolutely no mention of the renovations at all We had to evacuate our room early in the morning due to the unbearable noise Really unbearable When I addressed the issue with the reception I was told that the entire hotel was under reno and they could not stop the contract to accommodate us In other words my contractual agreement to have a reasonable quiet room was irrelevant I thought that the answer provided by Isabelle guest relations was silly and inconsiderate to say the least I would not recommend this hotel until the Toni s are done , The location however was pretty good One block away from the metro next to the convention centre and 10 minutes walk from the Arc de Triomphe champs lys e 
135592,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, breakfast can be richer we stopped having it at the hotel and went outside But it was nice because Paris Far from mostly all attractions building is old but under renovation so , perfect view of the Eiffel tower close to metro close to airport shuttle
135593,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Staff were super helpful advised us of the best way to site see and get around Paris given we only had one day there which was a hop On hop off bus 
135594,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, We had a club room but found the club lounge small the breakfast was disappointing , Close to restaurants and museums Loved the views of the Eiffel Tower the bar view was amazing although drinks were expensive 
135595,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Chaotic check in They gave me a wrong key twice so it took 20min before I could actually get into the room, Nice comfortable bed great view from top floors
135596,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, too basic No kettle no coffee in the rooms Long queues to check out staff oblivious to long queues keep themselves busy doing other things while queue gets longer and longer, only the location
135597,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel rooms are very old and there is always renovation happening I go to this hotel for the location , Breakfast is good and the location is excellent 
135598,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel is under renovation That means lots of noise Rooms are dirty actually very dirty I ve been in many Hyatts this one is the worst by far , Front desk and cosierge people are lovely
135599,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Poor breakfast buffet for price Facility undergoing restoration until sometime in 2017 Absolutely no convenient parking not close as advertised Very small rooms peeling paint cracked and broken tiles in bath Chipped and broken furniture stained carpets Uncomfortable bed Not worth the price , Good access to Paris Metro
135600,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The rooms seemed coldly designed and hastily put together I hate bathroom doors that don t lock but these didn t even have a latch so your practically in the same Way to Pricey for what you get , The staff where great and the bed was comfy enough The view from our room was great 
135601,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The rooms are in need of major renovation Lots of stains on the carpet It needs to be replaced and then maintained there are surface holes on the round white table at the presidential suite that needs repair and painting the rooms bathrooms are in need of major upgrade and modern look It is uncomfortable to shower because the shower water comes out of the side wall instead of the front The lobby needs major renovation and the lobby bathrooms needs to be maintained better , The staff is very helpful The view of Paris Comfortable beds and exceptionally clean sheets Comfortable rooms
135602,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room was tiny the hotel is being refurbished much needed Only the first 7 floors have been finished so far The remaining rooms are very dated and have seen better days The reception could do with a refurbishment and comfortable seating could be added as well as some lighting It is very dark , The staff were friendly and helpful The hotel was conveniently located for the line 2 air France airport bus which stops just outside and for the metro station The bed was very comfortable and the view was great
135603,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Old Dingy corridors broken tiles in bathroom ripped carpet in the hallway shoddy DIY job in the bathroom very cramped bathroom no minibar, Location friendly staff
135604,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Parking You pay 39 euros per day but you cannot enter and exit at leisure You pay for every entrance and exit Would be great if the hotel can have its own parking facilities, Excellent staff at the reception booking counter They made everything possible For instance we made a mistake in our booking but they manage to cancel and redo a new booking with a better room They supported us with all our stuff up to the 31st floor lot of baby thingy to carry They also arranged a baby cot within minutes got that into our room despite we reached there before our planned date Room was excellent with a great view of eiffel tower and paris 
135605,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Hotel under refurbishment Construction noises from 10am till 6 00pm Room painting peeling off Definitely not one of Hyatt standard hotels , Location was great Hotel connected to a shopping center and Metro station

135608,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Bit pricey but not outrageous , Location so close to Air France bus line from airport and Metro Line 1 is great Nice view of Eiffel Tower Good business hotel 
135609,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel very poor not cleaned and very old room no facilities I was soon impressed about the service this was the last time I stay in this hotel, Only the location
135610,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, We had a club king room but only had 2 beds pushed together and when we asked where the child was to sleep they sent in another small bed for her but this cut the room size down dramatically the rooms are only fit for the 2 beds really I think they maybe should have let us know the room would not be suitable for three to share , The staff where very good very descent of them to leave a small birthday cake and refreshments in room for when we returned to hotel and the same evening brought champagne and pastry plus minerals for the child They upgraded us to an Eiffel Tower view room from an Arc de Triumph view as well 
135611,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Metro is beside the hotel very convenient Room is clean and tidy Staff are friendly and patient I lived in a room with beautiful view of Eiffel Tower

135613,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room didn t come with tea coffee making facilities We had to ring room service who eventually brought one out to us but considering it s a 4 star hotel I would have expected the room to come with this as standard , Nice comfy room and in a decent location about a 15 min walk from the champs elysees 
135614,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, There s a renovation in the hotel every day from 10am to 6pm makes a lot of noise we can t sleep or take any rest you have to be out until its done also I didn t like the breakfast lack of varieties and expensive And I was staying in the last floor very close to the night club I couldn t sleep every day from the music so loud so at the daytime renovation at night the night club perfect stay indeed, Location

135616,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The only minus thing stay in this hotel is THERE IS NO SUFFICIENT INFORMATIONONHOW WE CAN DROP OFF OUR BAGGAGE AND PARK OUR CAR Luckily there was a security guy who advice us how to park and enter the hotel from parking , All facilities are superb The service is excellent Especially the front desk officer Mathilde she was very kind polite humble and has excellent response She offered us an upgrade and also breakfast for free That is an excellent service She definitively entitle as The Employee of the Month I highly recommend this hotel to allmy friends 
135617,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, We were not told the hotel was undergoing renervations when we booked also I paid for an upgrade because I was led to believe I would get a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower but was disappointed when we were on the other side , The staff were very friendly and helpful breakfast was delicious and convenient and location is great if you don t mind not being in the centre of Paris Great sunset view from the top level bar although very expensive 
135618,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, poor service at reception counter on arrival check in extremely slow renovation works ongoing and sometimes noisy , breakfast was good staff at breakfast were very welcoming room had a splendid view on the Eiffel tower

135621,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, No parking front of the hotel any longer must park at the nearby conference center Although there were plenty of parking places safe and clean It is just some extra time to drop your luggages at the reception and leave for parking again , I always stay at this hotel because of the location and value for money 
135622,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, construction work noise during the day peeling paint of the walls and damp in places , excellent location great views staff are lovely expc at the front desk
135623,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Lack of coffee station or tea coffee beverage in the room Concierge could work on customer service and sincerity as well as business centre staff lacked genuine customer service It felt like you were disturbing them Housekeeping not that good Soiled bedding nose bleed not changed on one of the days we were there Old room had better hairdryer than the new upgraded room and having a hairdryer In a steamed bathroom is problematic for us ladies For the star rating of the hotel these little things could be improved so that its value for money , Great location
135624,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Noisy after midnight due to disco on the last floor, It was amazing experience to be club resident and had spectacular Paris view Always smiling and nice staff Breakfast and lunch were perfect Waiting for the next visit 
135625,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room was disgusting extremely tatty and small and stuffy There were renovations going on and we were told there would be a little noise between 10 and 6 It was like living on a building site the drilling started around 9 whilst we were still in bed and we couldn t get out the room quick enough to escape the racket The breakfast was very average not much choice which I would of expected from a good hotel like the Hyatt The panoramic bar had fantastic views and we had a lovely drink pre dinner however when we returned later it was a different experience The waiters were unfriendly and we were made to queue to go in to be seated Whist in the queue the doorman let his mates through The cocktail was a short measure and tasted completely different we complained and the waiter was very snooty This hotel is obviously experiencing great problems , The fruit at breakfast was very tasty 
135626,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I stayed here for business 2 nights purely because the hotel is connected to the conference centre It is the most soul less hotel I stayed in dated decor broken aircon on arrival no coffee tea making facilities no bottle of water in the room Breakfast EUR25 is a rip off in a soul less cold lobby The only redeeming feature is the top floor bar It is undergoing refurbishment so there is hope , The only redeeming feature is the top floor bar 
135627,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The king club room was too small and with an extra bed we couldn t move in the room The bath needs renovation and the room decoration was very old , View to the Eiffel tower is the best especially when you stay at upper floor We were at 30th We enjoyed a lot of the view 
135628,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I look forward to returning when the rooms are re furbished , Loved the welcome from night staff We arrived very early 06h40 from the bus station Cannot express enough our gratitude for the early check in A must visit at sunset to the bar at 33rd floor what a magnificent view of the Eifell Tower Bois de Bolonge 
135629,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, asked for a king size double bed we got twin beds pushed together but when we mentioned it they did apologise, comfortable bed every one of the staff was helpful and friendly very good breakfast and evening meal
135630,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Nobody told us before check in that the hotel was under renovation and that there was too much noise all day Was given a room on 28th floor right below where rwnovatikn was happening The concierge desk guys were royally ignoring me Seemed to be the case due to my color it seems because the same guys were super attentive to Caucasians Really guys Being a luxury hotel Nobody came to pick up my luggage from reception to room and vice versa No opening of doors for you Nobody asked me for a cab when I was checking out While they were doing the same for other guests Worst services ever amongst all the hotels I have stayed in Trust me I have stayed in a lot There were other smaller things No toiletries when I checked in Two single bed blankets kept on a double bed Room service guys opening the door and coming in without knocking or ringing the bell , I don t think Anything was good considering the kind of monies we were paying for this hotel 
135631,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Small very shabby worn out , Very little to like The staff tried hard but the hotel is well beyond its sell by date The whole place desperate for a total refurbishment and should only be marketed as two three star That is to say basic travel lodge standard Definatly over priced and not value for money 
135632,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Rooms were dated apart from the lobby carpets were worn and rooms needed some modernisation , Hotel lobby and views from the room impressive breakfast and staff good 
135633,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Dated rooms, No coffee or tea facilities Reception area was great felt very dated and forgotten about on the 28th floor Heating controls didn t work
135634,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The rooms are tired despite being clean and there is construction happening with the renovations We had a noisy room to begin with but were moved within an hour once we let the staff know , The staff of the hotel were incredibly friendly and accomodating and even appeared to remember individual guests despite the size of the hotel The location is perfect Central to main tourist sites with good restaurants and even shops all located within 200m The air France airport bus stops literally outside 
135635,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room wasn t to the standard we had expected from the brand Would be great to go back when the renovations are completed , Obviously loved the view of the eiffle tower The staff were super lovely Location was great too 
135636,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Small delux rooms No coffe machine or complementary water, Everything Excellent location connected to shopping metro station cinema bus station Walking to champs elyse
135637,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Rooms had very old smelly furniture and small too Very load noise all day they work on 10th floor and am in 33 floor I icouldn t relax after a working day even in the weeknd its not Haytt as I knew , the lobby only
135638,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, the door and Windows are shaking we can hear the wind perfectly we can smell the smoke from the other rooms Although the other rooms in the floor are for non smokers ,No Positive
135639,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room was a disgrace its not what was sold to me on website I feel I have been conned and ripped off Also hotel is in middle of being renovated and is noisy in day time which we were not made aware of before we booked , The staff are very helpful and friendly
135640,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Outside to drop baggage there staff was not so cooperative no vallet parking they dont allow u to park the car there even five minutes by the time u go inside check in and then park the car on the otherside in public parking , Only the location was realy good panoramique bar nice view 
135641,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I didn t like the room service little choices and food I order wasn t good especially sea food pizza, I like location service staff very good
135642,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, the restaurant is to expensive comparing to the others around the hotel , when I reached the hotel I was immediately welcomed by the reception and the way I was treated by the receptionist called Mahala he made me feel at home it was phenomenal 
135643,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel is going through extensive refurbishment and the noise is unbearable from 8 30am to 6pm Nobody warned me when I made the reservation At least telling me before would have allowed me to make a conscious choice to book there or not , I liked the location and the staff was really friendly 
135644,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, the room very few plugs no usb ports shower water temp unstable outdated loud construction heard in room everyday and i was not notified at booking, the location
135645,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, A kettle in the room would have been nice but overall it was a great stay and we d definitely return , The view It was totally amazing to see the tower from bed 
135646,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, There is work going on the top floors of the hotel and hence a lot of noise during the daytime , Hotel is centrally located Rooms are clean and well maintained 
135647,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, noisy under construction I sent an email saying that I m arriving early morning to book a room he surprised me the front reception by adding 160 euros to find an availability room at 9 am hyatt will never accept the conditions of this hotel coffee shop too dirty bathrooms very noisy extractor plugs useless you name it the front reception was sorry for the construction works and he said that he will reduce the amount when we check out nothing happened ignoring any promises I paid 254 euros by night and 160euros extra anyway i will never use it again , I like the business center staff
135648,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, No tea coffee making facilities in the room The fact that our King sized bed was prone to drifting apart during the night , Being offered a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower was much appreciated although we did pay extra for this it was worth it Pablo on reception also offered us free breakfast each day and was extremely helpful Close to both Metro and RER stations and many restaurants 
135649,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Not fare If we accepted staying in this hotel during the noise of renovation work at least they have to upgrade customers room or give them Tower view or at least putting a bottle of complimentary water didn t like how do they manage the renovation period It reflects the new owners management mentality For this I will never step a foot in again , Amazing and cooperative staff at concierge and Front desk Although at the people check out time ALL front desk staff were busy eating and talking at the room next to front desk finally found one of them to help me 
135650,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room I was staying the AC was not working it had very old furniture and due to some renovations daily stay at the hotel is not a good idea , The location of the hotel is very good just 10 min walk to champs ellyses 
135651,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, No thing, Realy was a good stay there and they gave me a very good room furnetur and every thing was good and I had a good reciption from emmilaet manger and meher the one who made check in and out realy thanks to them
135652,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Hotel needs renovation especially the rooms Housekeeping is not as efficient as other hotels tub not perfectly clean , Location is ideal with a spectacular view of Paris Rate was suitable Hospitality was great Also location is convenient with all means of transportation available and readily reached 
135653,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room was on the 33rd floor There was renovations going on which I was not told about when booking The noise levels were unbearable and could not rest during the day The bathroom had a constant running water sound and the Aircon could not adjust The hotel did offer to move me to another room on the second floor but it had no view and it was not a smoking room That was not what I paid for , The lady at reception Meher was totally awesome and friendly Extremely helpful Feels good that there are people like that in the industry Her attitude was basically the only reason I stayed at the hotel and accepted the room 
135654,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room was given to me was very old not renevated and noisy due construction in the upper floor i have asked the reciption to change and after several trials i was able to get another room, Location
135655,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The amenities compared to the price is not on the same level Needs major update No usb charger ports Add a American plug for a charger Better tv channels It s like I went to 1986 rooms need update, the staff was above par they answered every question And cared when you asked
135656,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Emails prior to check in were unanswered A request for a travel cot in the room was ignored The rooms were not cleaned properly The decor was terrible and the property was in a visible state of decay throughout The gym was the worst I ve seen in a hotel Woken up every morning by construction work in the hotel Kept up every night by the night club in the hotel The concierge made mistakes with requests The room service staff forgot items we d ordered The food in the hotel was very poor quality and very expensive This is a 2 or 3 start hotel at best , Hotel was well located on the Metro line 1 with relatively easy access to several major attractions 
135657,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Very old rooms no pool old decorations Staff member at the reception was almost rude to us while checking in Rip off , The view on the Eiffel Tower was great
135658,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Firstly the lady at the check in desk was quite unfriendly she did not greet us She didn t prompt us to provide any check in information once I said would you like the booking reference she then sighed and said ok She asked for my card and passport and then gave me the room key Considering I have never been to this hotel before she did not advise what floor I was on or where the lifts were never mind wish me a pleasant stay I then asked her what floor she said 9 I asked if she had a map she simply said you have to go to concierge for a map It was not a friendly welcome and this lady made a bad impression on us for the hotel and our holiday Room was quite small for a twin room and beds were together so although we paid for twin it was just enough space for a double No kettle for tea or coffee no water bottles which for a 4 star hotel I would expect , Location is good down the road from Arc de Triomphe and close to metro 
135659,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The rooms were SO small and outdated It hardly had any facilities the yellow wall was so ugly to look at and there was leftover hair and dirt in the bathroom from the last occupant It was a decent enough hotel but them calling themselves a 4 star hotel and being overpriced is NOT worth it , The staff I encountered were friendly 
135660,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, I have choosed a room with Eiffel tower View and the room and stay was so plesant The hotel location is very accessible and easy transportation to all the tourist locations We were welcomed by an Indian lady Meher and the way she recieved and helped was Awesome She helped us with the information like how to travel and best restuarents around to eat Felt like home and I will recommend this for tourism
135661,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Room is very small and old Not very clean Staff is not friendly and not helpful At 9 AM it was very noisy because there was some renovation work going on We were not informed about it when booking or checking in Tried calling reception I could barely hear them on the phone because the noise in the room was VERY loud they said there is nothing we can do about it , Reception area is nice and spacious Location is ok we could see Eiffel Tour from our room 
135662,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, I enjoyed my time there specially the location is excellent was near to the metro station porte maillout and also near to champs elysee And the view was amazing where u can See tour effel and arc de triomph The staff was helpful and friendly people
135663,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Rooms were tired however I have been informed that renovations will be underway shortly and I look forward to staying again once they are finished , Fabulous location views of Eiffel and close to Arc lovely staff Prompt and friendly service Overall a fabulous experience 
135664,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Nothing , The customer service was amazing The staff were always friendly and helpful The breakfast was excellent I especially loved our room that was high up and looking out over the stunning views of Paris It felt magical to wake up to It made my whole Christmas trip there incredible as we were so happy in our hotel Can t wait to go back this year 
135665,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The Hotel seemed quite old all the furnishings and paint seemed like it had seen better days and isn t feel well maintain As a result the place felt pretty average and wasn t the nicest But it sure made up for it with the view Amazing , Great View of the Eiffel Tower
135666,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I was first given a room near renovation work taking place I complained about the noise and was given an upgrade The hotel looks drab and is in need of total refurbishment The rooms have scuff marks on the walls and the furniture is also marked I first stayed here more than 20 years ago and it s been going downhill since then , The restaurant on the ground floor The food was tasty and the staff friendly and attentive particularly at lunchtime 
135667,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Rooms are small breakfast is very poor , Hotel location is great by metro you can reach any where loopy if very nice and staff were very helpful From floor 8 and above the rooms are small and old the hotel is in renovating stage which will take 1 and half year despite that there is no noise
135668,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Service was dreadful In particular the room was never cleaned well it appeared they only changed the sheets and towels sometimes not even touching dirty dishes ,No Positive
135669,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The only negative of being on the 3 2nd floor was the sound from the rooftop bar However the view of the room compensated for this , The room and view was fantastic I could see the whole of Paris The view of Enfield tower was amazing The staff were fantastic and the facilities were excellent I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend 
135670,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Rooms are very old fashioned and need redecoration size is not very spacious Shower water alternate and doesn t stay constant No tea coffee facility available in room , Location is brilliant Staff are amazing specially the customer relationship team Wifi is very fast and free Eiffel Tower rooms have great view Sky bar is excellent Breakfast is acceptable Metro is very close to the hotel
135671,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Me and my partner went here for New Year s Eve We loved everything about our stay It was everything we wanted and more Staff are so friendly and accommodating with everything they can help with If we ever go to Paris again this is where we would stay 100 Close to everything and the metro Loved it Can t fault it 
135672,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The un refurbished rooms higher floors very uncomfortable beds all round Lift cards don t work very well top floor bar outrageous prices , Variety of breakfast very helpful staff bathroom in deluxe rooms 
135673,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel is a little outdated with regards to furnishings The prices were extortionate , The view of the Eiffel Tower and the city was incredible Probably one of the best views of the city 
135674,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Decor cupboards in the bedroom is VERY outdated bordering on the tacky However I believe these will be renovated soon so it wont be issue for others in the near future , Great view Comfy bed Good Bathroom
135675,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The shower in my room kept changing temperature it went too hot and too cold without adjusting the tap, Everything was really good staff are really helpful 
135676,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, One of the worst hotels ever No no complementary water at the room You have to pay 17 to get one The room was last renovated maybe in the 11th century The floor was broken walls messed up unfriendly staff at the reception Nothing was good, Nothing 
135677,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Reception staff were amazing and very accommodating The guest relations manager was also very nice and caring in ensuring that her guests were catered for Bar stuff on the 33rd floor were lovely Would definitely be my first choice hotel when I return to Paris 
135678,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The staff were mostly unhelpful and not very polite The manager of the hotel was nice enough when we complained about the rooms that they first gave us Fact is they claim to be a 4 star hotel but offer 3 star rooms and it is not acceptable Either lower the prices or raise your standard , The hotel is in a convenient area and the beds are comfortable 
135679,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Nothing, Location was perfect you can see this hotel from the top of the Eiffel Tower Hotel was beautiful and clean perfect for 3 nights in Paris even though hotel is going to be renovated I don t even see why as its modern and clean Food in Paris is very pricey however breakfast is worth having at hotel as so much to choose from Love Paris and will be back again 
135680,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The fact that I only stayed one night, The staff was just marvelous and made us feel so at home I would highly recommend this hotel to friends family and anyone reading this 
135681,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, The hotel was good offering a good variety of breakfast I would like to thank specially to Mrs Meher She is very very helpful and generous lady Overall experience was good with 4 stars and a special star because of the generous staff 
135682,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room had no heating even though I was promised everyday that this was going to be taken care of The floor was dirty and the breakfast was of poor quality , Security 
135683,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Really terrible arrival experience with heavy unfriendly security at the entrance really rude and aggressive I don t mind security for obvious reasons but make it professional also each time you go in and out of the hotel really unprofessional front desk staff , Good location for Paris easy to get to
135684,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The elevators are not enough in the morning This is a business hotel and mostly hotel guests use them in the morning hours and so there is a big waiting , The view of the Eiffel tower is amazing The location is perfect there is a subway which is connected to the hotel by the shopping center and it was a very convenient option The room was clean and tidy the receptionist Mrs Meher so kind and very professional The hotel is very well run It can be said that the hotel it is about 3 stars but the staff makes it a four star The largest and most important part is the staff They deserve to be rewarded Tips The bar on 34 floor is incredible 
135685,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Breakfast buffet is limited in terms of choice The beds are very uncomfortable They don t add a converter to join the two single beds and they don t have a flat sheet The staff is very lazy and unwilling to help , It is very clean and secure The Regency club is a nice place to unwind 
135686,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Outdated furniture dull walls colors On daily basis noise no respect shown to guests since they sometimes were prevented from entering the Caffee in the roof for few euros more some people from outside reserves the Caffee don t get shocked once you arrive if you have to carry your luggage by yourself , Taxis were always available 
135687,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Lots of things no bellboy when I ve arrived so I had to carry my luggage by myself There is a nice view in the Caffee in floor 33 twice at least closed for private for guests came from outside Imagine the hotel guests were prevented from entering Three or four days in a row I woke up in the early morning because of noise drilling work The furnishings is out dated Small room , Taxis are always available in front of the hotel 
135688,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I was at the club level the rooms and bathrooms could be improved for the price asked , the location is great if you are going to the palais des congres I had a room with a view on the tour eiffel outstanding if you are at the top level of this hotel the club access is interesting to have a place for working separately from the room a good breakfast and a cosy place to take an apperitif 
135689,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, One small gripe and its only small no tea making facilities in room , Staff were excellent with a special emphasis on Nishantha who checked us in when we arrived quite simply excellent 
135690,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, No way this hotel deserves 4 stars Rooms are ugly lifts get stuck all the time no water kettle in the room long queues for checking in and out ridiculous prices for drinks and food Luckily I got a very good rate through booking early through booking com , Staff was extremely helpful friendly and professional
135691,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The corridors were narrow and bit run down The windows were dusty marring the view For the price the rooms were small and overall feeling from the room was of small and run down It did not feel like you are staying in a 4 star hotel There is construction going in the building and they were using the heavy machines from 8 in the morning After all the partying we did not like to be up at 8 , The view from the hotel was excellent The eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe 
135692,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Rooms are very small beds is smaller than the room if you turn one side you would fall down on the floor Towels are not clean no air conditioning room was very hot even if I open the window, Only the location is not Bad
135693,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, rooms a little tired looking in need of a facelift but very clean and well maintained room fitness room no showers only cardio machines i didnt want to get back in the lift all sweaty, very polite and helpful staff great views well serviced rooms great location i would stay here again
135694,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, We had to ask to move to a different room because the originally assigned room was dirty and the sink in the bathroom was broken Overall furnitures look old, Nice staff
135695,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile,No Negative, Stayed here for two nights while on our honeymoon and it was amazing Great view of the Eiffel Tower photos do not do it justice Excellent buffet breakfast Attached to large shopping centre which was good because I got terribly sick and it was nice not to crawl too far to the pharmacy Walking distance to all major tourist attractions and metro Looked after our luggage on check out so we could have a good look around the city Bertille duty manager was very nice and helpful Great standards all around 
135696,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, breakfast quite dull Too big hotel , Very close to the the conference hall very nice view of Paris Service of hotel quite good very nice hotel staff
135697,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Extremely badly maintained Waited 14mn in the morning to get an elevator on the 11th floor Never came I finally broke through the service area to get a service elevator in the middle of the maids , The location
135698,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, I have received my luggage from concierge after 1 5 hour of check in even after chasing twice went to downstair by myself, B fast food room amenities wifi view were fine

135759,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The price of breakfast is extortionate 25 per person per day It s much better value to go to the local deli patisserie a few minutes walk from the hotel The bar close to the top of the hotel has superb views but the prices are ridiculously expensive , The location of the hotel is excellent It s close to the Metro and conveniently close to a range of good restaurants The views are incredible 
135760,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, For a 4 star hotel there was no tea coffee making service provided in room nor did the hotel make arrangements for any , I was travelling with my mother and decided to stay at this hotel for one night as it was close to the les cars bus stop direct bus to the CDG airport Even thought the check in time mentions 15 00 the staff were kind enough to check us in at 13 00 as there were rooms available 
135761,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The hotel is old from inside we requested a double bed before arrival but they put twin beds the hotel is far from main paris attractions the customer service is averge nothing exceptional, The view from our windows The nearest metro station was in the main line Good Free wifi

135764,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The space between the closet cabinet and bed was too close Because of this the door for the cabinet with the safe in it presented a real problem in that one person got conked in the head when the door would not stay closed , The staff were exceptionally helpful and courteous 
135765,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Breakfast was poor you have to ask for a kittel , At the reception Mr Mohamed was so helpful and kind all the informations can you have them and tickets the view was fantastic to see Eifel Tower Supermarket Mall Metro just beside under the hotel
135766,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The minibar in the room did not contain any specifically French item such as cognac French wine champagne There were very few places in the panorama bar and in the dining room so it was difficult to find a sitting place for breakfast and for have a drink in the bar Employees at the Consierge Information desk were not friendly and polite There were no slippers shoe brushes and bathrobes in the room toiletries were only for one person , The view over the city is splendid breakfast is very good waiters are helpful Access to the main attractions is easy 
135767,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Prices we went out all the time for food and drinks if you lower your prices on very wet days you would have a full bar and resteraunt as it was the bars were empty ,No Positive
135768,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, the price of food and drink in the hotel is laughable and having no hot drinks facility in your room is poor for this standard of hotel , location is right on metro so easy to travel around and the Paris sky line at night from the bar on the 34th floor is stunning 
135769,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, No coffee tea in the room Lack of a proper iron Corridors in the hotel needs refurbishment gives a complete dull look, great location and super view with many restaurants within the vicinity good concierge service access to 2 good super markets easy access to airport shuttle Easy access to metro station Super view at the 35th floor bar

135772,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, the hotel room was dated and dingy and in ill repair We eeee moved when companies however room was not value for money , The location of the hotel was ideal for our holiday everything within walking distance 
135773,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The rooms were not as pictured on the website I emailed the hotel several times before our stay and did not get any response from anyone Will most certainly not be staying at this hotel in the future I will be paying the extra and staying at the hotel directly opposite And I most certainly will not be paying 25 for a pi a colada , Views of Paris from the sky view bar were good 
135774,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, We stayed on 21st floor and carpets were a bit worn stained and a bit dirty But I think they are in the process of upgrading all rooms , Great location Close to shops transport and eating About 10 minute walk to arc de triomph and then a further 5 mins to champs lys es Les cars air France stop is right next to hotel which makes a convenient stop for airport drop off pick up for reasonable price of 17 per person View was fantastic from our room with Eiffel Tower view 
135775,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, the long queuing when we got their to check in at our rooms , their room service an algerian guy who was so welcoming and the information center who were so happy to provide us with the needed information about where to go and how to go in Paris 
135776,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The first room I was given had not been cleaned so I had to go back to reception to change rooms When ordering room service due to being ill I was told that I was unable to put the cost of the meal on the bill and that I needed to pay by cash as I didn t have enough cash on me I had to leave my room and get cash from an ATM Normally this would not be a problem but as I was feeling unwell it was a total inconvienience Breakfast was poor in standard over cooked dry and very un appealing , Staff were very helpful and friendly
135777,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Old rooms and they did not gave us a better room even though we are repeat customers in this hotel for the last 5 years The only reason we stay in this hotel is location , Location
135778,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The lobby looks like a souk very noisy Rooms are very narrow The bathroom is good but we can not sleep in it No paper letters envelopes to enter the bannio you need a ladder although I am not short , The very near transport facilities 
135779,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Bed 2 singles pushed together and a gap kept forming Restaraunt food wasn t the best especially for the price Booking said soundproof walls could here the neighbours taps coming on talking and t v, Location of the hotel Shops very close by View from the room was perfect
135780,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Not good value for money the room was not exactly spacious the air conditioning was very weak the shower went from scalding hot to ice cold in a hearbeat without moving the temp control the bidet blocked continuously the tv remote was missing on arrival there were only two small pillows provided although we did recieve two more on request the decor was dated and in need of refurbishment the easy chair only one of them in a double room was stained no stationery provided on the day of departure room service knocked our door continuously from around ten am onwards although we didn t have to vacate until noon all in all not the kind of things you would expect from a four star hotel, The hotel was perfectly located for the plans we had
135781,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Room was awful not to mention the pillow Arriving at 3 00 am due to breakdown the staff was awful towards us As soon as we reach in our room the staff call to say remove your car and park it some where and definitely no manners at all Though it was paid well before hand they say we paid only one room and didn t do the bed or cleaning in my children room till 6 00pm when we complained When we told them check your system properly then they acknowledge that we paid not even an apology Very strange and shameful for a 4 5 star hotel It s definitely loss its touch which once had , Only location
135782,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The housekeeping is deteriorating badly it was better run when it was concord Lafayette it s a shame reputation for a regency hotel when we checked inn the room was a in a bad situation dust everywhere the bathroom door wasn t cleaned since ages hand spots everywhere bits of hair everywhere the next day after we came back to the room the house keeper lefts all dirty glasses bits of Kleenex on the floor I complained to the guest relation manager and she was very cooperative she even sent the housekeeping manager to the room to check it out she was speechless when she saw the above and was so sorry next day the room was spotless with a bouquet of flower plus lots of toiletteries that wasn t available befor my complaints then room service wanted to charge for ice cubes , The location
135783,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, Everything The walls and ceiling were broken the style is from the 90s the air conditioning was not cool enough The parking people were not professional and very slow , The view only

135788,Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, The room is small i have spoken with the hotel earlier and they told me that the differences between the deluxe room with the eiffle tower view and the king room with eiffle tower view is the deluxe one is directly view to the tower And it is Not The first room i was stay was very smelly and stinky and the carpet and the floor were full of water The reception can t be that professional , The wifi the breakfast
