158466,The Chesterfield Mayfair, The room was extremely small and the television didn t work from the bed you had to get up to change channels or to turn the volume up and down , The staff were lovely but after booking I messaged the hotel through their Facebook page explaining that it was my husbands 40th birthday surprise weekend and could they arrange to have a bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room I can see that they had read the message so didn t think to double check but unfortunately they hadn t arranged this and for the cost of the room it was extremely pokey with stains on the ceiling and urine stains all under the toilet in the tiles

158476,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Almost impossible to note anything I didn t like as there was nothing I did not like about this hotel Perhaps if pushed I would could comment that the piano was a tad too loud in the Terrace Lounge Bar it tended to distract and make conversation a little difficult but that is being pushed to say something I personally could say I didn t appreciate , The location was perfect for me the hotel staff were polite well informed courteous friendly and simply just down right as good as it can be The room was to my tastes clean with a good work space comfortable chairs with excellent WiFi the bathroom was clean bright with all the attributes and facilities one wishes to have a trifle on the small size but I wasn t intending to have a a dinner party in the room so ideal The hotel just oozed quiet quality quintessential English from the moment the taxi door was opened by the doorman the rest just flowed like a dream

158486,The Chesterfield Mayfair, I guess the hotel caters for North American visitors mostly as it was a bit Old Fashioned They like that kind of thing with regard to d cor Fully functional and clean but lots of dark wood panels etc which dates it although I suspect they have gone to great lengths to recreate this look , The location

158527,The Chesterfield Mayfair, The elevators are super busy during morning and night so you usually have to use the stairs , Breakfast was brilliant and it feels like you are in an old English cottage The rooms are nice and has all you need 
158528,The Chesterfield Mayfair, I found the beds quite uncomfortable and the bathrooms were very cramped and awkward I wouldn t recommend staying in this hotel if you had any physical mobility issues , Great location Nearby restaurants and bars were nice

158531,The Chesterfield Mayfair, No complaints , Great location and courteous attentive staff The hotel is lovely and well maintained Because it is an older property the rooms tend to be smaller but they are well appointed and in great condition I would stay there again without hesitation 
158532,The Chesterfield Mayfair, We didn t experience any negatives , Staff were excellent and very attentive Jason at the concierge desk was extremely helpful and Jade in the bar always made everyone feel welcome with her great attitude 
158533,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Nothing I just wish I could stay longer , This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed Besides the normal cons of a good hotel such as location service etc this hotel stands out as it pays attention to details and really think from a guest perspective to make your stay comfortable each room has its own decoration with good taste and they offer turn down service which is not quite usual for a 4 star hotel and they offer you the facial mist which is quite handy in Europe as it is usually quite dry at night And do include breakfast if you can choose this package Full English breakfast is amazing They offer hot dish like egg benedict freshly cooked from the kitchen plus small buffet for bread and cheese cereals etc The last hotel impressed me in a similar way is Penisula Highly recommend everyone who stay at London downtown to try this hotel 
158534,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Rooms are a bit small but that s to be expected in an older place in London There was a mishap somewhere so the elevator and hallway smelled awful for a few days , The Gin tasting at the bar was really interesting highly recommend it Staff was great 
158535,The Chesterfield Mayfair, the hotel is a bit old style and sometimes dusty in places, very nice staff the room was clean everytime i got out with small nice presents on my bed 
158536,The Chesterfield Mayfair, The value or lack thereof of the breakfast and quality of food served at the continental buffet Was very happy that we didn t buy the breakfast package , The staff and the size amenities of the room outstanding 
158537,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Decor is a little tired in spots though that gives it a certain British charm , The people were wonderful Everyone we encountered was super nice and helpful 
158538,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Didn t get King bed we booked and the reception told us we had when checking in but too much trouble to complain or change Room so small barely had places for our luggage, Service excellent and fast and some nice amenities in the room Food decent 
158539,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Bathroom I prefer a shower head that is detachable , Excellent location 2 mins walk from Green Park Tube and a 5 minute walk to Bond Street shops Lovely Afternoon Tea and delicious freshly cooked breakfast Wonderful piano player in the cocktail bar and very tranquil and unrushed atmosphere Very comfortable bed and Aircon TV IT facilities in bedroom Good wifi included Exceptionally polite and friendly staff from arriving to departure 
158540,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Not a thing , The air conditioning the bed the water pressure in the shower all of the important stuff Also the location the value the staff the overall condition of the property in a nutshell this the best hotel I ve ever stayed in while in London 
158541,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Not much , Upon arrival late morning staff were friendly and welcoming and our room was ready Room was impeccable bed was large and comfortable Will return
158542,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Rooms are small Hotel food is expensive We stay here at least once a year but are never recognized as frequent guests , Very convenient for area of London we wanted Very accommodating staff Good value
158543,The Chesterfield Mayfair, The decor of the corridor and room was not to our taste and appeared a little tired It was probably right up to date at one time but unfortunately it wasn t timeless like the foyer The bathroom was compact to say the least probably the smallest en suite hotel bathroom I ve come across and although I never thought it would be possible the shower is too powerful so you have to modulate the flow with the taps The hot water is far too hot but thankfully they have mixer taps on the basin also The bathroom decor was looking a bit tired like the room There was a wedding on the night we stayed and the music could be heard in our room on the 2nd floor This could obviously be an issue for some people The door staff weren t very observant and seemed obsolete but maybe they are just there for the posher looking guests As a treat for my wife s birthday I was hoping for something a little more special than a Premier Inn which is our usual choice but unfortunately the Chesterfield didn t live up to expectations or the price tag then again it was Mayfair location location etc Perhaps the hotel s other facilities bring the standard up , The foyer of the Chesterfield was luxuriously decorated as you would expect and looking through towards the bar and lounge areas everything looked well thought out and appeared impressive irrespective of the age The bed was comfortable and everything was very clean The towels were thick which is always a nice touch The receptionist was friendly and efficient and the cleaning staff seemed friendly also The location of the Chesterfield is superb being a short walk from Green Park tube which itself is very well linked to the areas we wanted to travel to 
158544,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Asides from having to leave on our last day I would like to mention maybe leaving more toilet roll in a cupboard rather than one in the bathroom My partner had an upset stomach and I had to go and but more due to there not being more available , Upon arriving we were greeted by lovely friendly professional staff We were able to book in for an afternoon tea which we enjoyed immensely The room itself was beautiful and extremely comfortable The staff had no problems giving us directions or recommendations and all were knowledgeable about the area Breakfast was delivered to our room and was delicious Every single thing about our stay was perfect Thank you

158550,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Not staying longer , Everything This is a traditional hotel with luxury and good service at its heart The room was plush and comfortable Everything was top quality from the sheets to the toiletries Breakfast was tasty and varied not just the usual full English All staff were attentive and helpful Excellence in the old fashioned style 
158551,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Nothing, Friendly staff and very helpful We had a problem with the tv and they gave us the room next door to watch tv in the evening after a long day out in London And also let us keep the original room so didn t have to pack away all our things Tv was fixed first thing the following morning Excellent service
158552,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Nothing, Very comfortable room ideal location for visiting Buckingham Palace also the Theatre was in walking distance at Shaftsbury Avenue wouldn t suit everyone to walk it takes a good 25 mins 
158553,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Cannot really fault the place the standard rooms are quite snug but I guess that s fairly normal for London hotels , Responded really well and efficiently to an issue with my room I had a leak in the bathroom and they instantly upgraded me to a better room

158563,The Chesterfield Mayfair, There was some minor noise from the street below my room even though I was on the fourth floor Some of the decor is getting tired with one picture which had torn the fabric on the walls with its weight was no longer straight and risked falling off in my colleagues room , On arrival I received an upgraded room to a double from a single which was a great start to the stay The staff were very polite and well organised even when faced with an extremely difficult guest on my first night who spoke terribly to some of the staff members for no fault of their own the bar team James and Antolio were great very friendly and both were good company whilst I had some time in the bar making me feel extremely welcome during my stay Food was excellent and the breakfast was fantastic My room was large and comfortable very quiet and made for a perfect base to go to work from with all of the nice extras provided like slippers and dressing gowns The location was perfect for my meeting on St James Square but it is also ideally located for some high end shopping on bond street and fortnum and masons with plenty of places to eat ranging from the restaurants on Curzon Street to Chinatown which is only 15 minutes walk I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the hotel and will be staying there again for any further trips i have within the area

158581,The Chesterfield Mayfair, The table surface in our bedroom was rather dusty The cooked breakfast was OK but nothing special especially the toast tough and the coffee lukewarm , The staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble The room was comfortable and well appointed The central location was just what we needed 
158582,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Could be better with a gym, Very high standard staff and central located in one of the most upscale locations of London The hotel is indeed a 5 stars in it s quality 
158583,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Maids make too much noise outside the door early in the morning with such thin walls There was construction outside our window we were told they don t make noise Not only did they make noise but they started at 7am , The staff were very helpful personable The breakfast room and buffet are lovely Beds were extremely comfortable 
158584,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Ham sandwiches off the bar menu were poor value for money being a bit meagre with the filling , Very comfortable bed choice of pillows Breakfast lovely if you can get it included otherwise it s 22 Excellent service
158585,The Chesterfield Mayfair, I truly cannot think of a single thing that I didn t like , The breakfast was excellent such a variety The staff are so attentive with invading ones space and the everywhere is comfortable and spotlessly clean

158588,The Chesterfield Mayfair, TVs are terrible for the odd hour or two you would want to spend in front of one The building is quite old so if you re a history buff you would find something to admire not so much for a modernist , Very very friendly staff especially Gabriel from reception who was very kind Overall a nice hotel but nothing supreme about the location or decor

158594,The Chesterfield Mayfair, As Americans we re used to a lot of space unnecessary space so we felt as though the room was a little tight even with the upgrade Not their fault as we did quite a bit of country hopping throughout Europe and other rooms were comparably sized it s just a cultural difference and shouldn t be held against the hotel just be aware Plus the room was immaculate , Great location Close to the tube close to lots of shopping nightlife and tourist attractions On a side street so the hustle and bustle isn t right at the front door but just two blocks away Staff was extremely courteous accomodating and gave great directions Also we received a free room upgrade on arrival

158602,The Chesterfield Mayfair, The rationed breakfast I asked for two cumberland sausage but was only allocated one The cost of drinks in the bar 40 for three drinks Normal for hotels in London I know but you could start a revolution by being reasonable , The overall feel of the hotel Great staff great location lovely breakfast very comfortable room

158604,The Chesterfield Mayfair, The bar lounge area felt very dark , This hotel has the quaint British feel while also delivering luxury cleanliness and quiet I enjoyed the refurbished room on the 6th floor and the nice tea service handily available in the room The bed was comfortable and I liked the hotel slippers 
158605,The Chesterfield Mayfair, I would have liked a walk in shower as not able to climb in the bath couldn t get the tv to work but perhaps this is not for technophobes, superb quality and not a touch of minimalism in sight a step back in time but with all the mod cons lovely comfy bed and fabulous eggs benedict
158606,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Nothing, Staff were helpful and friendly Lovely spacious dining area for breakfast the tables were placed to ensure privacy for diners Very clean and a welcoming atmosphere 
158607,The Chesterfield Mayfair, My second visit to this hotel and I have got both times a shower that dripped all the time, Service and the interieur reminds you of Downton Abbey nice to be treated like that
158608,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Room was a tad small and didn t have a iPod dock, Staff ultra friendly and attentive mood lighting in bathroom was great making for very relaxing bath room was refreshed completely and bed turned down whilst we were out for dinner even had pillow mist sprays
158609,The Chesterfield Mayfair, New staff in training not as helpful They lacked the welcoming spirit of the more seasoned staff The breakfast spread was a little simple Breakfasts in all the Red Carnation hotels could be improved upon , The location room cleanliness and comfort Lovely decor Concierge was very helpful

158611,The Chesterfield Mayfair, I can t think of anything to improve our stay, All the staff were super attentitive My wife was given a special birthday cup cake Breakfast was cooked to order and wonderful The G T in the bar was perfect with a really nice ambience Our room was lovely and spacious
158612,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Somewhere to put the used tea bags We had to use bits of paper and sandwich wrappers to stop the old tea bags marking the spotless rubbish bins A plastic bag would have been good Just a minor thing but still an irritant , The bed was comfy and the overall service was very good
158613,The Chesterfield Mayfair, We reserved a Classic room and the only issue was the size of the bathroom Very small so two people in there at the same time was difficult This on its own would not prevent us staying again as everything else was so good , Excellent Service and Facilities
158614,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Not much The bathroom tiling and plumbing could do with an update and was a bit small but pressure and temperature were excellent which is much more important , Staff genuine friendly and attentive Room well decorated with thoughtful touches throuought Instructions and information in room excellent and clearly written Breakfast was so so good 
158615,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Nothing all perfect Really , Best hotel I have stayed in for years Excellent room wonderful staff every detail perfect for a great price The style is boutique traditional with great style and finishing touches 
158616,The Chesterfield Mayfair, 1st floor Classic Room should only be used for B ness person on own Definitely NOT for a couple the bathroom the bed very small Shower in bath sprays all over floor due to bad design of tiny bathroom Building works right outside the bedroom window breakfast room , Great Staff Location
158617,The Chesterfield Mayfair,No Negative, Loved the quiet location and the coziness of the hotel The bed was very comfortable and the linens nice There was great lighting especially in the bathroom which often is not the case As a female traveling alone I felt very safe And the neighborhood has good coffee shops take out places a juice bar and mini mart within a block Would definitely go back 
158618,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Bedroom was small the king sized beds are out of proportion with the rest of the room making it difficult for 2 people to move around at the same time Furniture and fittings somewhat dated , Friendly and efficient staff in all Departments Excellent breakfast in relaxing setting Hotel well situated for easy access to all Central London activities 
158619,The Chesterfield Mayfair, The rooms are small compared to other Mayfair hotels The check in was at first handled by an ineffective sarcastic receptionist who passed on the buck to an intern I guess someone has to bite the bullet everyone and then hence a long delay It was very difficult for a couple to move around in the same room,No Positive
158620,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Our room 406 was comfortable but looking a little tired and the outlook to the back was not good, The location of the Hotel is great for shopping or looking at the sights Very quiet area but convenient

158624,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Felt so at home can t fault a thing, Stayed in a newly refurbished room lovely quality decor Bed very comfortable nice touches in room to provide all you need ie bathrobe slippers bottled water good selection for hot drinks in the room too and the list carries on
158625,The Chesterfield Mayfair, The room overlooked a large bank of air conditioning heating units and was noisy enough to prevent me opening a window at night not good I wasn t asked at reception whether I had enjoyed my stay or would have pointed this out to them , The overall quality of staff attention especially in the dining room and from the concierge service 
158626,The Chesterfield Mayfair, there was no mini bar in the room, very professional and helpful staff they can give solutions to any matter problem with no delay free wifi free coffee and tea in the room
158627,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Even if I were smaller the Classic Double was very small and the bathroom and facilities even smaller The hot cold shower was never balanced and there was the inevitable building work outside For this price I would expect more space It was also an insult to be told I could get a bigger room for more money , THIS IS A CLASSY HOTEL Although all things are expensive once you cross the doorway things are done with style The Breakfast was superb and the Service even better

158659,The Chesterfield Mayfair, Our only slight disappointment with our stay is that we are not used to cleaning staff picking up our personal belongings and putting them away think toothbrush which was drying in its case on the counter taken out of its case and put in glass travel pillow moved etc Perhaps this would not bother other travelers but we did not like it We asked to have no service to the room but housekeeping told us that was not an option So if something like this would bother you be sure to put your belongings away before leaving the room , The staff was very friendly and helpful the hotel was very clean well appointed and comfortable If you choose the breakfast included option you may choose from all of the breakfast options something we did not find out until our 3rd day The location of the hotel is very quiet and safe
