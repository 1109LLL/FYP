471444,Brunelleschi Hotel, I was robbed while sleeping in my room then double charged upon leaving hotel took zero responsibility could not wait to leave Milan many thieves there,No Positive
471445,Brunelleschi Hotel, A small gym and most of the equipment was out of order Staff were effective and helpful that is we got what was needed but not overly friendly Rooms are dated but for an inner city location in Milan this is a reasonable trade off , Very central location Sensible check out time of 12 noon Generally prompt service 
471446,Brunelleschi Hotel, The room was not cozy exactly as on the Booking picture Although there was everything we needed Absolutely not friendly elderly administrator at the reception , Excellent location good breakfast and superbly equipped bathroom
471447,Brunelleschi Hotel, Rooms were dark and outdated Air conditioner did not work The room configuration was not correct Breakfast was very average too much oil , Well located That s all 
471448,Brunelleschi Hotel, SERIOUS problem with the WiFi in the hotel and especially in the rooms It made planning and researching excursions difficult as the connection was very bad , The location is ideal The hotel is clean and the staff friendly and helpful 
471449,Brunelleschi Hotel, the staff seems cold especially at breakfast no one greet or smile the serving is late but plenty food and choices just they seems like working by force not by heart thE staff not really helpfull fr information the hotel is great just i dont feel welcome during my stay in the hotel the shower has no lights and very dark n small cant even close the door ermm nway the room is cleann i wish the ppl cm b more frendly and helpfu so i feel that im wElcoming during my stay at the hotel overall ok , i love the location near to duomo and trains the room soo comfy and excellent fr single traveler like me 
471450,Brunelleschi Hotel, The rooms are very outdated and badly in need of a refurb The TV didn t work had no channels and no instructions but I didn t ask as I wasn t that bothered The first night my air con was so noisy I couldn t sleep They couldn t fix it that night so I went and spoke to reception again in the morning and they sent a maintenance man who repaired it quickly It was disappointing that this fault had not been checked and repaired as part of the room inspection cleaning work before I checked in No discount was offered despite my complaint about being unable to sleep and they could not give me another room instead Overall this hotel is cheap for a 4 star and there are very good reasons for that I wanted the central location so I got that but for the same money you can get much nicer a bit further from the Duomo I think , It is very well located
471451,Brunelleschi Hotel, Very dated decor and room bathroom not very clean Mediocre breakfast good choice but food wasn t great quality Good proper coffee though , Good location and huge room 
471452,Brunelleschi Hotel, WiFi is an absolute disaster in this place We didn t have any connection in our room at all but also in the lobby it was very very very bad Also no wifi in the breakfast room Pretty disappointing to have this kind of an issue in 2017 , Excellent location 
471453,Brunelleschi Hotel,No Negative, The breakfast was good and staff were friendly The location was amazing right in the heart of Milan We loved the fact that we could walk to anywhere we wanted to go 
471454,Brunelleschi Hotel, Nothing , The room was excellent the location is perfect for sightseeing centrally located Perfect for a short city break to take in the best of Milan 
471455,Brunelleschi Hotel, A few of the staff had a little bit of an attitude but not bad overall There was a strip club directly across the street , Very modern hotel exceptional We were upgraded to a superior room that was terrific Still a little small though The usual in Europe Had a wonderful dinner meal in their restaurant 
471456,Brunelleschi Hotel, We would of liked a friendlier welcome at reception and more help with maps and finding places , The breakfast was very good and you could choose from a large range of food Staff very friendly and efficient 
471457,Brunelleschi Hotel, The room was dirty Around the toilet and the carpet was dirty when we arrived Dust everywhere , Ok location have a reception helpful staff Clean sheets and towels daily 
471458,Brunelleschi Hotel, From the second we arrived until we left we were made to feel completely unwelcome by the front desk staff and the Bellhop at one point the Bellhop literally tossed our luggage into our room The problems started when we arrived by car it was not clear where we should park to unload the car When I ask the front desk clerk a tall grey white hair man he gruffly stated that was the Bellhop s job then in a loud voice said something in Italian and a portly Bellhop appeared from wherever he was hiding The Bellhop was clearly not happy to be disturbed With the Bellhop providing instruction in Italian I don t speak Italian I manage to pull the car onto the sidewalk in front of the hotel to unload The Bellhop was clearly not happy with the amount of luggage I do admit we packed way more then needed But the Bellhop did manage to begrudging get us to our room and I gave him a generous tip The room was very stuffy and humid but we could hear the air conditioning was on so decide to allow it to cool the room while we walked around Milan for a few hours Returning to the room it was just as stuffy and humid Using a chair I placed my hand in front of the air conditioning exhaust it was blowing very little air and what air there was was warm Because I know we would not be able to sleep in such a stuffy room I reported the problem to the front clerk the tall white hair fellow He gruffly said they would look into the problem while we were at dinner I strongly suspected from his attitude that the problem with the air conditioner was already known After returning from dinner I stopped by the front desk before going to the room the white hair fellow informed me that they had looked into the problem and hopefully the air conditioner was working better We returned to the room to find it was just as stuffy and humid I again placed my hand in front of the exhaust to discover there was no change , We had a great dinner in the hotel restaurant The restaurant staff was very accommodating and made for a very pleasant meal 
471459,Brunelleschi Hotel, Garage was an underground public garage with small stalls and 25 Euros per night We stayed here twice The first time rooms on second floor were small and AC in one room didn t work They made up for it second time by giving us two great rooms on sixth floor , The second time rooms were great Good size clean and comfortable If you have a choice get rooms at higher levels Location is great close walking distance to many site seeing places Two main metro systems are close by plus many trams and buses cross in front of hotel Restaurants and cafes are close everywhere Staff were mostly friendly and helpful One receptionist was not as good as others Although garage was a public underground but was safe It s best not to drive in Milan Navigation is hard and confusing Breakfast was decent and plenty They even let you pack a good portion to take with you if not hungry at that time The room service was great very helpful 
471460,Brunelleschi Hotel, Basic hotel was ok but staff were unfriendly and unhelpful Lack of iron available and then charged for ironing service Area felt safe but a lot of dubious nightclubs in the area ,No Positive
471461,Brunelleschi Hotel, We have travelled all over Italy for the last 4 weeks and found hotel staff and others wonderful warm and accomodating not so in this hotel It s like every single one of them has been taught to be rude and condescending , The hotel is very dated but comfortable The rooms are very large and the location is unbeatable around the corner from the Duomo 
471462,Brunelleschi Hotel, The breakfast is not very good The pillows are not really confortable Overall very nice hotel , The vintage style of the hotel without televisions and other electronic devices The location the staff the services and the price 
471463,Brunelleschi Hotel, The property is quite worn but still clean , The staff are helpful and attentive Very good location too We are merely 5 minutes on foot away from the Duomo 
471464,Brunelleschi Hotel, The staff at the restaurant was no friendly We arrived at 20 00 without any booking and the restaurant was full We asked if we could come back later we were willing to wait even untill 21 00 if needed but the staff did not seem to want us arriving so late and preferred to tell us that they did not know when they would have a free table The restaurant was supposed to close at 22 30 The room are very poorly isolated There was a lot of noise from the street especially with the tram passing right in front of the hotel The wifi was extremely weak in the room or non existent , Breakfast was really good Location was amazing only a few minutes walking distance from Duomo Staff at the front desk was always available and helpfull
471465,Brunelleschi Hotel, The room was a bit warm and had to sleep with window open careful with mosquitos , Nice location very good hotel excellent breakfast and wifi working 
471466,Brunelleschi Hotel, Had a less comfortable room than usual on the side of the hotel where it is noisy because of the tramway Room was also a lot smaller than the ones I ever had before Staff was o k but nothing more than that , Location close to center of city
471467,Brunelleschi Hotel, Everything was fine, 3 minutes walking distance from Il Duomo Great hospitality of the staff everything clean and comfortable Very good breakfast and quality of the food in the restaurant was also good Free Wifi was correct 
471468,Brunelleschi Hotel, Try to improve the shower area as the whole bathroom gets wet everytime you get a shower Longer curtains rail doors must be some alternatives available,No Positive
471469,Brunelleschi Hotel, 70 style the staff with the exception of one was snobby and serious Breakfast on the basament with bright light not the best way to start a relaxing day, location
471470,Brunelleschi Hotel,No Negative, Very good breakfast Perfect location close to Duomo Galleria Emmanuele II Teatro alla Scala Hotel has no parking but 100m away is an underground parking available 
471471,Brunelleschi Hotel, Quite worn down Nothing special For that price I would expect to find a much more decent place , Location is excellent Just around the corner from Duomo 2 mins But sadly that s about it what s really good with this hotel 
471472,Brunelleschi Hotel, Generally the staff were courteous except for some at the front office reception who sounded as if they were doing their guests a favour , Well located in the city centre Though hotel does not have parking facilities a public park house is available in its vicinity Good proximity to Shopping food and night life 
471473,Brunelleschi Hotel, At first the staff was a bit stiff but as the 2 days passed we realized that Americans can be more gracious on the first impression , The breakfast was very good coffee is a must here and order by the cup 
471474,Brunelleschi Hotel, The decor is old and out dated We found the surrounding area in the evening a little de centralised no restaurants caf s bars in the immediate proximity in the evening although there is a restaurant in the hotel which is good , The proximity to the Duomo and the shopping areas is a great advantage The breakfast selection is perfect to start the day and the staff are friendly enough The rooms are big enough and quiet and the cleaning is good During our stay most clients were couples and some families 
471475,Brunelleschi Hotel, The check in was not welcoming The staff at reception seemed to be very casual without even a decent smile on face This gives a very uncomfortable feeling The hotel was absolutely Old Fashioned The room was very small to even accommodate a single person with his luggage Looked like a hostel bunk bed There is no complimentary water bottles provided No coffee maker in the room The Hair dryer in the bathroom is 10 years old and with old technology hence doesn t serve the purpose While I was checking out I asked for a taxi and told I have a train to take to the airport the guy called for a taxi and told me it will be here in 5 minutes and then he disappeared and neither did the taxi arrived He turns out after 15 minutes and I miss my train There were also signs of racism towards Asians with a very rude behaviour Not worth the money you pay, Only the location
471476,Brunelleschi Hotel, Always had to ask for more things to have a cup of coffee or tea in room if we used the coffee or sugar tablets the next day we had to ask room service to get us some more cos the person who cleaned the room always forgot to put some more satchets etc, The breakfast was fantastic 
471477,Brunelleschi Hotel, The most unfriendly staff on reception I ever met in 4 hotels although guys on breakfasts were very nice Ruined the experience completely No wifi in rooms but it works on corridor When I gently asked to fix it I was recommended to use whatever works since it s free and won t get any better Soundproofing isn t good to we heard TV from the nearby room , Location is very good indeed It s few minutes away from Duomo tube and trams At the same time street is quiet and not busy Good breakfasts 
471478,Brunelleschi Hotel, The decor of the rooms it s rather old the moquette doesn t give a feeling of cleanliness, I liked a lot the location incredibly convenient for the city center yet quiet and easy to reach
471479,Brunelleschi Hotel, Outdated interior design stale room window to backyard so no fresh air available , Quiet location still very close to Duomo Fresh squeezed orange juice at breakfast 
471480,Brunelleschi Hotel, Unfortunately the hotel seems to be falling behind on general maintainance The facilities looked worn and staff encountered proved less than friendly and willing to help So many prostitues and right by a strip club altough not their fault one has to admit it definately destroys their appeal to families with young girls ,No Positive
471481,Brunelleschi Hotel, The meal at their restaurant was a bit bland , The location was an easy walk to the Duomo The room was a nice size and very clean The breakfast was well done and there was a nice variety The staff was extremely helpful and cheerful The hotel provided complimentary waters and some snacks in the room 
471482,Brunelleschi Hotel, The worst most unprofessional reception front desk customer service I ve experienced in my entire life The receptionist on 25 March 207 had zero customer service skills and shouldn t be in the hospitality business After driving for five hours we reached the hotel s area and all the streets were blocked because of the pope s visit Being not from Milan we called to hotel for advice on how to get to the hotel The moment I asked the question of how to reach the hotel the front desk only told one thing with his voiced raised on us I DONT KNOW i explained that we just need recommendations of where to stay because it seems like we are in a residential area and we don t want to waste our time their specially that we only had the weekend to explore Milan He wouldn t even let me finish a sentence and would interrupt me with I don t know how else can I explain to you that I don t know As I don t want to engage in such unprofessional conversation I said thank you And then he hung up We ended up parking somewhere and had lunch at Alice Restaurant When we asked the waiter at Alice about the road blocks she explained to us the roads that are close told us the open roads and gave us recommendations The point is the waiter at Alice was able to give information no excuse for a supposedly 4 star hotel reception staff I m pretty sure it wasn t the first time the Pope visited Milan If this hotel is okay with a receptionist who do not have people skills management should at least write them down a script or give them a brochure they can read to their customers when in situations like that The unprofessional behavior didn t end there When I checked in this receptionist was stone cold and already irritated when I asked the question on where we can park The way talked to me was so condescending that it sounded like he had 20 years of grudge against him , There are only 2 things that made our stay okay in this hotel location and decent breakfast selection
471483,Brunelleschi Hotel, The room was a bit too warm and we had trouble regulating the temperature One employee at the reception was a bit grumpy although the others were congenial , The location couldn t be better The breakfast was excellent There were sufficient electrical outlets in the room and a data connection I didn t use the wifi but my husband did and he said it was adequate 
471484,Brunelleschi Hotel, D cor of the room was a little dated in style and colour but was clean and comfortable WiFi in room was not great not very strong signal not good enough to have video call etc but was better downstairs in public areas of hotel , Nice hotel with a fantastic location 5min walk max to Duomo and 2min walk to Missori metro station Bed was very comfortable and everything spotlessly clean 
471485,Brunelleschi Hotel, Fridge did not work , Excellent sized room superior room but looking tired Excellent location 5 minutes from Duomo All the staff were very cheerful and helpful especially the older gentleman in the white jacket who was at breakfast 
471486,Brunelleschi Hotel, There was a shower curtain instead of a shower door affixed to the shower cubicle , Finding gluten free products for breakfast and having soya milk with my coffee 
471487,Brunelleschi Hotel, The internet was so slow and unstable There is minibar fridge has only a couple bottles of water The room lighting was not good at all There was too much noise from outside too expensive for an average hotel , Good location in walking distance to Duomo 
471488,Brunelleschi Hotel,No Negative, Bar staff anotonio older one was lovely and all were very friendly and helpful Have us helpful information and recommended good places to eat and drink 
471489,Brunelleschi Hotel, The hotel decor is tired and dated , Staff were exceptional and anyone would say the same for the breakfast It really is central an arms length from La Scala Piazza Duomo Galleria Vitorio Emanuele Museo Novecento
471490,Brunelleschi Hotel, The bed was a bit too hard for me I think there was perfume in the air conditioning or used in the room cleaning I have perfume allergy and I did not like the perfume smell in the bedroom But I was able to open the window so that helped The dining room did not open until 7 30pm so I had to wait from 6pm and I was hungry The food prices are not cheap but its similar to other hotels much cheaper to eat outside the hotel, It was raining on my arrival A staff member came out with an umbrella as I was getting out of the taxi and took my bags The reception staff were courteous and helpful The double room was pleasant and had everything I needed I got a wake up call on request I got late check out at 6pm for a cost of 50 euros 
471491,Brunelleschi Hotel, The only issue I had was with the Free WiFi Even though there was WiFi it was Very annoying because every 2 minutes it was throwing you out No internet connection , Everything was perfect in All respects 
471492,Brunelleschi Hotel,No Negative, The hotel fully deserves the 4 stars The personnel was very friendly and polite the room was comfortable and just as shown on the photos Besides it is located in 5 minutes walk from the Duomo Cathedral The breakfast was remarkably good The selection of hot breakfast food eggs bacon sausage etc was wide there was a range of Italian typical foods like mozarella and ham also fresh fruits and a wide range of pastry plus good coffee and fresh juice 
471493,Brunelleschi Hotel, Can t think of any , Excellent location near the Duomo and a public underground parking staff at the reception and the bellman very professional and helpful excellent breakfast even with fried rice for Asian guests rooms very clean and comfortable Excellent value for money and will be our choice for next visit to Milano 
471494,Brunelleschi Hotel, Although I indicated that on booking com that I want an invoice for the company they did not give it to me They said they invoice issue immediately on our name to get the money asap , The location is good 
471495,Brunelleschi Hotel, It seems to be an old hotel with the furniture and all being there for a v long time , Location was fantastic Size of the room was good and staff esp at the breakfast area and bar were very courteous 
471496,Brunelleschi Hotel,No Negative, So glad I changed my hotel last minute to stay at this one Beautiful hotel with very friendly and welcoming staff The room was spotless everyday and the maids were very patient and polite when I accidentally set off an alarm twice The breakfast was gorgeous I loved the fried eggs Wifi was brilliant and very fast 
471497,Brunelleschi Hotel, We didn t realise that on the website it said it had parking This was at a fee of 25 per day at a local car park which was never stated , Staff were friendly and had a very enjoyable stay Central in Milan and was able to walk everywhere 
471498,Brunelleschi Hotel, Not comfortable pillows and blanket made of bedsheet , Great location the very center and metro stops also near Good choice of food for breakfast Spacious room comfortable big wardrobe place for suitcase bathrobe few big mirrors many power sockets 
471499,Brunelleschi Hotel, VERY poor wifi connection disconnecting every minute and making working at the hotel an impossible experience Very diverse quality both of product and staff at the breakfast area Sleeping in a single bed in 2016 looks and feels a bit quaint , Excellent position for tourists as well as business travelers Kind and professional staff at reception 
471500,Brunelleschi Hotel, The shower tap mixer had to be in perfect location to completely stop water drops Not a big problem though , The location is just super Duomo is essentially almost around the corner Perfect 
471501,Brunelleschi Hotel, pillows hold too low 2 of them feels too high had a street sided room and noise from the trams and such early morning, elite breakfast super staff super professional clean rooms super location
471502,Brunelleschi Hotel, Everything was perfect Enjoyed our stay , The hotel location was on spot so close to the Duomo Vittorio Emmanuelle Galleria Most importantly it was in a quiet neighborhood beside the Duomo unlike other hotels There is also the Duomo Metro station beside the hotel if you don t want to move around the city by taxi The receptionists were VERY friendly and helpful The Breakfast buffet had everything The Wifi was strong in our room would definitely stay again at this hotel when visiting Milan 
471503,Brunelleschi Hotel, The staff was not nice and seemed very annoyed when we asked for help Someone was robbed while we were having breakfast and no one seemed to care , Location
471504,Brunelleschi Hotel, Some of the workers in the reception was not good in English and that is very important when you are a hotel A specially one man in the reception was not very service minded When we ask for some information help about a car pick up we had booked for the hotel The man couldn t understand English and was not very friendly when he didn t understand He just said in poorly English that no car can stop outside the hotel and we had to go to the bus station He then ignored me and then just started to help some others , The room var Nice ande Clean The breakfast was very good 
471505,Brunelleschi Hotel, I have to ask about the coffee maker it wasn t already in the room the hotel needs renovation, I liked the location it was great walking 2 minutes to the Dome every thing within hand the staff were amazing very helpful very clean
471506,Brunelleschi Hotel, Front desk staff very rude No Hello no Welcome no greeting no please no grazie We arrived during check in time and they told us to wait in lobby because our room wasn t ready No Please no sorry Room s not ready that s fine and understandable Lobby is 15 feet away and they could see us waiting Waited almost an hour no one came to get us Didn t offer us anything while waiting I went back to front desk and they had forgotten about us No apologies given Don t blame this one on the cultural differences or language barrier because we were 3 weeks in to our 6 week Italy trip and never had treatment like this Get some training for your front desk staff , Great Breakfast 
471507,Brunelleschi Hotel, Really could not fault this hotel, The hotel was ideally positioned 5 minutes walk from the Duomo but in a relatively quiet area We received an upgrade to superior the room was spacious and very well equiped A kettle in the room was a real bonus in Europe The little things like umbrellas to borrow were a nice touch 
471508,Brunelleschi Hotel, Hotel is rather old but clean My colleague had mosquitos in her room , Perfect location in the very heart of the city Duomo is just 5 min walk Breakfast was standard Clean and large rooms 
471509,Brunelleschi Hotel, Price quality The bathtub didnt work so I had to shower during 2 mornings under dirty cold and stagnant water because the water wouldnt go away I warned them the first time but they didnt solve it until last night in which I left the hotel at 4 AM to take a taxi Also we hired a transfer for the airport and didnt come It was 4 AM Fortunately the staff at that time was kind enough and called another taxi Now I got a cold , location 
471510,Brunelleschi Hotel, One of the most important criteria for a hotel is to provide a quiet environment for a good nights sleep Unfortunately i was in a room on the 4th floor facing the main road The noise from the street was intrusive So much that i thought the windows were open I could hear peoples conversations outside They should invest in soundproofing their windows Also as a business traveler i travel light and need to refresh a shirt and suit trousers They do not have an iron and ironing board in the room or available at reception They charge for ironing services which for an overnight stay is asking too much since the turnaround time ie i need to refresh my shirt in the morning before breakfast but they can not provide the service to do this , Location is great 15 euro taxi from Linate airport Breakfast very good 
471511,Brunelleschi Hotel, Nothing really, The room was very comfortable and generously stocked with toiletries Breakfast was excellent and the staff very efficient and helpful The free papers were also appreciated 
471512,Brunelleschi Hotel, Booking com website promised kettle there wasn t one dressing gown yes but why only one in a double room , Very comprehensive selection for breakfast including fresh fruit juices lovely Central location parking underground in adjacent square expensive but convenient Toiletries were good 
471513,Brunelleschi Hotel, The water in the shower was tepid not as hot as preferred , Location vis a vis my conference at the university 2 blocks away could not have been better Also near the duomo and many other sites The breakfast included was excellent 
471514,Brunelleschi Hotel, On our first day out our room safe was opened by a staff member for reasons I could not understand It was locked back and we were given a new code in an envelope strange , The location is amazing less than a 5 min Walk from the Domo The room for two was large and clean We asked for softer pillows and were immediatly given such We arrived at 3am and were promptly greeted and accompanied to our room
471515,Brunelleschi Hotel, They razor was really cheap and gabe me razorburn Nicer shaving supplies would be appreciated , Hreat breakfast roomservice and very helpful consierge spoke Spanish Italian English And German 
471516,Brunelleschi Hotel, No view, What a great location just a short stroll to the Duomo La Scala and street market Whatever you do book a room with the breakfast included It is just amazing There is something for everyone If you can t find something you like it might be time to stop travelling Our room on Level 4 was a reasonable size quiet beautifully appointed with lots of little touches of luxury The staff were very helpful and spoke English Beds were good but firm 
471517,Brunelleschi Hotel, Breakfast was not up to standard of rest of hotel Would have expected better tea coffee service from a 4 star Not as good for breakfast as 3 star hotel we stayed in immediately before , Beds very comfortable and location good Lunch good and reasonably priced Liked tea and coffee facilities in room but cups far too small to make tea Staff helpful
471518,Brunelleschi Hotel, Room decoration looked dated Some areas showing wear and tear Lacked external space but ok for a city centre hotel , Room very comfortable Food very good Location excellent 
471519,Brunelleschi Hotel,No Negative, Small room had to back into the bathroom and close the door to use the facilities Curtains were hanging from the window not attached The staff at the front counter were very curt 
471520,Brunelleschi Hotel, Room was pretty small although I had gone for the cheapest Gym was also quite small , Friendly and very helpful staff Clean comfortable room Good breakfast Amazingly well located right by the Cathedral 
471521,Brunelleschi Hotel, When I arrived it was 5 30 pm I called the room service they said it will open at 7 30 There is no restaurant also So if you need to eat something you have to go out Some boxes served in bathroom like sanitary kit toothpaste set was empty Also the shaving set makes my face too bad , Location
471522,Brunelleschi Hotel, Rooms have not been updated since the hotel was built Staff at reception need to improve their relations with clients Some breakfast items were of poor quality , Location Large rooms
471523,Brunelleschi Hotel, Rooms needs to be renovated Seeling is very old and need to be painted Furniture is way to old, Hotel is few minutes walk from Duomo Parking is near by
471524,Brunelleschi Hotel, The room was small and could do with a refurb update of d cor , The hotel location was very central perfect for access to all the main tourist spots Duomo museums fashion quarter etc 
471525,Brunelleschi Hotel, Decor in room as shown in photos is a bit dated but room itself is very comfortable Don t let that put you off , Spacious room Large comfortable bed Electronic shutters Excellent extensive breakfast both cooked continental Excellent location 
471526,Brunelleschi Hotel, the bed was comfortable but the pillows were like bricks and only three of them As for the light switches there were so many options we ended up leaving on a dim light in the sitting room so we were able to find the bathroom during the night , we had the luxury of a sitting room as well as the sleeping area which made us very happy The air conditioning was very controllable and quiet and the fridge didn t keep charging all night The staff were very helpful The amount of choices for breakfast was enormous and varied All freshly prepared and cooked 
471527,Brunelleschi Hotel, rather cold reception but helpful in the end Lighting system in bedroom complicated and sometimes blocked ON Also air conditioning too cold and difficult to adjust , Very comfortable lounge area and bedroom Excellent breakfast restaurant for evening meal good food and reasonably priced 
471528,Brunelleschi Hotel, It would be great if they renovate the hotel and work on the interior design And train the staff on keeping the smile because you don t feel warm greeting once you enter the hotel , The most thing which I liked about this hotel is their location it is 3 4 minutes walking to the Duomo and other active places 
471529,Brunelleschi Hotel, We booked two rooms In my son s room air conditioning did not work properly I have read in the Trip Advisor reviews that other people also had similar problems Reception staff looked slightly aloof There were no tea facilities in the single room I also did not like their peculiar system of light switches where I pressed a room service instead of lights by mistake , You absolutely cannot fault the location of this hotel Also you have to look hard to find a hotel of this class where they would serve you a freshly pressed orange juice for breakfast 
471530,Brunelleschi Hotel, This time the room wifi had some issues but this was not the case when I stayed at the hotel before , Somewhere it feels like time travelling to 1980 s Milan but this hotel is still the best value for money in the Duomo area At breakfast there s freshly squeezed orange juice and good Italian coffee 
471531,Brunelleschi Hotel, The red coloured bed sheet cover and no drinking glasses plastic cup was provided instead otherwise everything is good , The location was excellent as it was very near by to Duomo Milano Staff at the front desk was very friendly and helpful They even provided fresh orange juice for breakfast 
471532,Brunelleschi Hotel, Our stay was for only one night during which we found nothing to criticise , Good decor Very pleasant and helpful staff Rooms well furnished and comfortable 
471533,Brunelleschi Hotel, Beds are hard AC does not work very well stuffy rooms warmer than I like , Great breakfast staff Bright breakfast area and preparation is great Loved the people working mornings 
471534,Brunelleschi Hotel, It was very hot and the air conditioning wasn t very cool but it was enough , Location service premises breakfast and the restaurant very honest price 
471535,Brunelleschi Hotel, This was the first time I couldn t fault anything , Everything I don t know where to start I can t begin to tell you how much I enjoyed my sty in this magnificent hotel This is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in in my life I had to take pics of my room because you wouldn t believe how great it is It has all facilities plus Jacuzzi and that was a standard room The colours are bright diverse and wonderful The location is a few minutes walk to Duomo The service is impeccable I truly don t know what to want more I wish every city had a hotel like this for this amount of money When coming back to Milan I will only stay in Brunelleschi 
471536,Brunelleschi Hotel, The decor was very dull The fridge barely worked , breakfast was very good The location was close to the Duomo and public transport We found an excellent restaurant nearbye which we could highly recommend 
471537,Brunelleschi Hotel, The reception is not really helpful and not kind During showering the bathroom is like a swimming pool , Very close to the Duomo Comfortable bed quite big rooms very clean rich breakfast Second time here 
471538,Brunelleschi Hotel, Bar could be bigger Bed was good but needs better pillows, Great location very close to he Cathedral area and wide range of shops and restaurants Staff very helpful
471539,Brunelleschi Hotel, Gym equipment was busted Hotel felt a little old but not in a historic way , Front desk was helpful when I had questions Breakfast was better than average Location near Piazza del Duomo was excellent close to great shopping and tourist attractions and close to the metro

471550,Brunelleschi Hotel, In spite of being on the top floor it was inevitable that some street and city noise could be heard However one should not be visiting bustling downtown Milano for peace and quiet , Wonderful large room magnificent bathroom with tub and shower and dual washbasins large and comfortable bed all clean and high grade yet with its own interesting style The breakfast buffet ran the gamut from continental to full English and everything was tasty

471559,Brunelleschi Hotel, It wasn t the hotels fault but since it s in the center of downtown the stores and shops close very early If you want dinner or even a large bottle of water you have to walk back into the more expensive touristy areas , The location was absolutely perfect for getting around to all the important must see s and the metro is less than a block away 
471560,Brunelleschi Hotel, I thought the front desk staff were a bit supercilious , The room was very nice chic The bathroom mirror which default it self was one of the coolest things I ve ever seen I may try to get one for my home

471573,Brunelleschi Hotel,No Negative, This was my first trip to milano i wanted to have a hotel near Duomo the choice was right The hotel is very close nice staff breakfast good big choice Maybe next time i ll chose a hotel in another area to discover it This hotel was a good choice
471574,Brunelleschi Hotel, very rude front desk and staff we were rudely refused an extra 30 minutes we asked for late check out could have been politely refused but the front desk had huge arrogance i wonder they showed this because we were from non European country from India or maybe this is their usual attitude they should learn from good hotels in India, room was great breakfast was good much better than italian standards

471578,Brunelleschi Hotel, Air conditioning just did not work We complained but they couldn t fix it As a family group we had 4 rooms all were the same I got the impression the management thought not need for a c in March Could not open window as just off a main road with noisy trams from 5a m to 2a m Would have given the hotel 10 10 for value and high rating for comfort but could not recommend unless a c is fixed, Reasonably priced accommodation in the centre Very pleasant staff Very clean Good breakfast Coffee service great
471579,Brunelleschi Hotel, the only thing I did not like we decided to have Sat dinner at the hotel restaurant there was one waitress on duty and one waiter and we were only four small tables occupied our table X 2 were totally ignored while the waiter spent the whole evening chatting to a couple with young children he was so rude the waitress although not as bad also busy chatting to a woman eating on her own while we were ignored never had such bad service in a hotel restaurant Also they only give you one key to the room so if you are not with other guest when you return to the hotel you have to ask reception to come up with you to open room , Location was perfect luxury bathrooms comfortable beds excellent reception staff a very honest cleaner who came running after us after we had checked out of room to return my daughter s mobile which she had forgotten in room

471601,Brunelleschi Hotel, The Reception Staff were stiff and rather unhelpful when approached and We felt rather uncomfortable asking questions or their suggestions about any matter we had I being Pregnant we came on this holiday to feel relaxed and if possible I would have enjoyed more warmth from them The room they gave us was dull and windows on looking to other rooms So we had no choice but to keep the curtains closed the entire duration of our stay On a another note I was very disappointed that booking com could either help us with the cancellation of our booking or help us get the best price which it promises with its best price guarantee policy , The only thing I found comfort which was why we chose the hotel was due to the location as I was pregnant
