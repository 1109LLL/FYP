452196,Sloane Square Hotel, Rooms are very tiny and cramped although our friends that we were meeting with were fortunate enough to get a complimentary upgrade we were not as lucky , The location was amazing Bed are very comfortable 
452197,Sloane Square Hotel, N A, Great welcome on arrival Really appreciated the complimentary glass of fizz Room requests dealt with promptly in a professional friendly manner Bedrooms well equipped with Super comfy beds mini bars safes Nespresso Machines Kettles are not provided in the bedrooms but you only have to ask and one will be delivered Good easy to operate heating system being an old building room could be a little draughty Adjoining Cote Brasserie very good value no shortage of good places to eat but as a treat book a table at La Familigia Worlds End great atmosphere great Italian food service busy busy busy you won t be disappointed Overall Sloane Square is a Friendly welcoming hotel slap bang in the best area in London Safety transport shopping restaurants theatres etc S S is not perfect where is but for me it has got the feel good factor which comes from years of experience of welcoming guests Will not hesitate to stay again So Worth It Thanks to all for a nice experience
452198,Sloane Square Hotel, Can t think of anything , Comfortable bedroom good bathroom pleasant breakfast bar overlooking the square Price reasonable for London and the pre theatre menu in Cote brasserie very good value Great location for bus tube and shopping yet not a crowded area 
452199,Sloane Square Hotel, This time the room I was given was very dark and uncomfortable Normally the room are small but comfortable , I love this hotel It doesn t have a restaurant but there is a great restaurant next door which serves a very good breakfast 
452200,Sloane Square Hotel, Bathroom was tiny we were amazed that we couldn t get a drink in the hotel cafe bar at 10 20 on Friday 4 11 on our return from a theatre , Friendly staff excellent location Very good attached restaurant 
452201,Sloane Square Hotel, No complaints at all , We were upgraded to a club room and enjoyed the extra space Central location meant we were in good walking distance to all our destinations
452202,Sloane Square Hotel, Nothing really though perhaps there could be more instructions on how to use the various gadgets in the room , Beautiful and comfortable hotel in an ideal location
452203,Sloane Square Hotel, I ve had a double room which couldn t even fit 1 person properly The wardrobe was so small I couldn t get most of my stuff out of the suitcase There was a very small window which didn t allow ant light in the room The shower was leaking then they repaired it I think they give the worst rooms to booking com , The location was good 
452204,Sloane Square Hotel, The walls were very thin and it was difficult to get to sleep due to noise the person next door to me was either on his phone or banging his door all night which kept me awake , The location was great staff friendly and rooms were nice
452205,Sloane Square Hotel, Room size but I booked a small one so liked all except that my budget Will go back, Superb Staff amazing Helena was a top professional She should be promoted I might got her name wrong but she s the suisse or French receptionist 
452206,Sloane Square Hotel, I was only staying for one night but if I was staying longer there wouldn t have been a lot of space for my clothes and I was in a double room by myself The shower was very small , The staff were lovely The bed was very comfortable and I was impressed with the choice of channels on the TV Very good location on Sloane Square Close to underground 
452207,Sloane Square Hotel, Really poor value for money no justification for the 200 per night we paid which doesn t include breakfast Rooms were clean but basic The hotel does not have a bar , Great location friendly staff
452208,Sloane Square Hotel, The double room and bathroom were small but well appointed and clean This was fine for a one or two night stay but not longer , We only stayed one night but the Reception staff were very friendly knowledgeable and helpful 
452209,Sloane Square Hotel, They charged my card automatically on my home currency dollar This was done without consulting me and they were not able to undo it This resulted in a 5 5 fee from the bank for the favour of allowing me to pay in my currency This fee is expensive making the hotel more expensive as my bank in the US charges far less than 5 5 , The bathroom and the bed were great 
452210,Sloane Square Hotel, I had a small room which was ok nice and clean but the bed was terrible Their was not a real mattress and it was really uncomfortable I woke up every morning with a back ache ,No Positive
452211,Sloane Square Hotel, the doors to the rooms are too heavy and you can hear whenever your neaighbours in and out, The location is oerfect near underground and buses not far from the center and parks also shopping street kings road is near by 
452212,Sloane Square Hotel, Rooms can be tiny many years ago when i started staying at this hotel the attention to detail on the fabrics furnishings and design were excellent and this appealed as an interior designer myself Over the last 5 years the hotel has sadly lowered its standardards on the design detail Curtains bed cushions look cheap and the hotel feels grimy Please raise you game again , I love the convenience of this hotel The staff are friendly and efficient The cote restaurant is handy if need a meal Transportation links are good Bed was comfortable 
452213,Sloane Square Hotel, Cant really think of anything for the price it was really good value for money , Breakfast was excellent and the coffee really hot which is quite unusual 
452214,Sloane Square Hotel, No kettle just an espresso machine Coffee was complimentary but the biscuits were not 2 for a pack of 2 The bathroom could have done with a heated towel rail , Very friendly and helpful staff Great value through booking com for a central London hotel Superb breakfast 
452215,Sloane Square Hotel, The room was very small Also the shower cubicle was tiny But i would stay there again, The location was perfect for our needs It is very central and has a good atmosphere in the area 
452216,Sloane Square Hotel, Only niggle was that breakfast could have been included or had a reduced rate for restaurant As it happened we couldn t use the restaurant as there was no chef I am a northerner and an English Breakfast is very important , Really good location comfy bed and room was a reasonable space good for London though Hotel is inviting and comfortable staff were knowledgeable about pubs and restaurants nearby and more than capable of pulling out a map and showing you where and how to get about 
452217,Sloane Square Hotel, The outlets didn t work without playing around with them a lot Seems unsafe , The rooms were nice and clean for price we paid Location was really good Staff was pleasant 
452218,Sloane Square Hotel,No Negative, The position of the hotel is excellent and the staff were very helpful and friendly We were staying for my birthday and a card and bottle of bubbles had been left in room very nice gesture 
452219,Sloane Square Hotel, Staff attitude disengaged and poorly trained A huge drop in service levels and staff competence compared to 2 years ago when I stayed about 25 nights at the hotel over one year Breakfast room closed directed to a cheap version of a continental breakfast temporary set up on the first floor canteen feel , Excellent location on Sloane Square 
452220,Sloane Square Hotel, When we arrived they only had on record a small double reserved when we had booked a superior double Even when we produced the Booking com confirmation they still tried to palm us off with a standard double In the end they checked us into a superior double What was annoying was that the check in process took 25mins and made us late for dinner ,No Positive
452221,Sloane Square Hotel, I ve booked a small room after that I make an upgrade because my wife have decided to come with me but my room is too small and I believe they didn t the upgrade but only take my extra money, Hotel is in the middle of Sloan Square great position
452222,Sloane Square Hotel, Well prices are high in London so we got a small double room It should really be just a single It was a lovely little room but just too small for two people , It is very nice and the location is excellent for connecting to various stations for day trips I don t think we ever had to take a taxi because we were so close to the Tube and that station was an easy connection to Paddington and Victoria 
452223,Sloane Square Hotel, Would have liked an iron ironing board in room but I could probably have requested one if needed , Comfortable bed good sized bathroom Nespresso machine in room yay very nice staff at front desk
452224,Sloane Square Hotel, I spilt coffee on the bed sheet and it wasn t changed when room was serviced Not a big problem though Room snacks were very expensive 2 50 for an Alpen bar I couldn t get shower to give warm water but I suppose it is good to experience a cold shower once in a lifetime , Mattress super comfy Air con was quiet and on a perfect setting Great to have access to Cotes restaurant from inside the hotel 
452225,Sloane Square Hotel, The room was teeny Needs a refurb Not great value for money but location superb Strange that not even a complimentary bottle of water is given to guests as this is standard in all hotels Tried phoning reception a few times to check when my bags would be brought up but no answer Eventually the phone was picked up Perhaps they were particularly busy at that moment No British staff at all ,No Positive
452226,Sloane Square Hotel, My room was tiny and the carpet smelt I didn t want to touch it with my bare feet My bathroom looked old and there was a hole in the tap section in the bath and a black mark on the bath itself The hotel is getting a little grotty I have stayed there three times and really noticed a drop in standards Obviously the location is fabulous ,No Positive
452227,Sloane Square Hotel, The room and bathroom size isn t great but that s standard for London The food is expensive for what it is but there are a load of good local options around so that s not a blocker So getting breakfast on your booking isn t necessary , Room was comfortable the hotel was quiet The location is fantastic and very convenient for Kings Road Knightsbridge Chelsea and there s a tube stop and a taxi rank 1 minute walk the Hotel Heathrow is under 30 in an Uber Victoria is 1 stop from Sloane Sq for the Gatwick Express 
452228,Sloane Square Hotel, taps were difficult to use and the rooms need some TLC corridors look great tho, comfy bed good shower good location Air con was excellent Elemis products Botanist next door fab brekkie
452229,Sloane Square Hotel, I had the small double room 116 very clean and comfortable for a small room only problem was it was facing the back off hotel with a big generator under the window so didn t sleep very well due to the noise it was constant through the night so for the price of the room it was a big let down but everything else was fine would go back there but would have to have a different room not one at the back, Staff were excellent very polite and accommodating
452230,Sloane Square Hotel, Teeny tiny room only for sleep and batheing no way you could work in it The air freshener comung through the A C was overwhelming couldn t change room so had to switch it off on a hot London night , Nicely appointed great location
452231,Sloane Square Hotel, Extremely Noisy with traffic outside Had to wear ear plugs Room was super tight so trying to manage two large bags was cumbersome Had to ask twice to put some pillow covers on two of our pillows , Close to the train station Restaurants around the area Location is walking distance to most attractions Staff were nice 
452232,Sloane Square Hotel, Hotel a bit too expensive but maybe bad timing as it was a Bank Holiday long weekend and the Chelsea Garden Show was happening Our last 2 nights in the UK it was just too busy and a bit up market for us , Very central to everything staff were lovely and friendly Room comfortable and very clean 
452233,Sloane Square Hotel, The shower did not work correctly I could not adjust the temperature and as a result could not use it Additionally the size of the bathroom is inadequate It is hardly big enough to get into which seems ridiculous bearing in mind the size of the room , Good location friendly staff and comfortable room
452234,Sloane Square Hotel, Nothing, The thing I liked the most is the service and the care of the staff As we stayed at the Sloane Square Hotel with my baby everyone was extremely attentive and friendly Also as our BA flight was delayed because of the global IT glitch and we missed our first night at the hotel the management offered us a very late check out exceptionally to compensate for British Airways fault And in addition to everything else when I realised that forgot something in the room upon my arrival home and called the hotel to check if they found the item they were extremely helpful Aude at the reception in particular and searched everywhere and found it Dear Sloane Square Jotel crew thank you very much for your hospitality I will definitely stay with you in future 
452235,Sloane Square Hotel, The Hotel was holding a pre authorisation on a credit card through booking com which is usual and took a second pre auth from a second card when we booked in and then insisted that we pay in full for the 5 nights in advance Very poor hotel management decision and we did not experience that anywhere else All other hotels we stayed in took a pre auth on the credit card and then we settled the account at the end of our stay which is normal practice around the world But not at the Sloane Square Hotel It didn t change what we paid obviously but is a bit insulting as a visitor and not handled or explained well by hotel staff at the time It is also expensive when compared to other similar hotels in the city, The Hotel is in a fantastic location particularly for visiting the Chelsea Flower Show just a 10 minute walk away The room we had was a reasonable size and quite comfortable 
452236,Sloane Square Hotel, The only thing which was a little problem was that I kept knocking into the frame of the bed which was very prominent got a few little bruises , The hotel was very convenient as we were going to the Chelsea flower show plus we were so near to the shops on Kings Road and Sloane Square underground
452237,Sloane Square Hotel,No Negative, Concierge service was excellent When I wanted to find a theater show to go to the staff were amazing at helping me find a show and booking it for me Plus giving me directions on how to get there Thank you 
452238,Sloane Square Hotel, Was a little pricey for my liking 225 for a night but to be honest not bad for London prices, Room light and clean bed was huge pillows were sooo soft Free soft drinks in the mini bar was a great surprise and the hot chocolate bowl of grapes and curtain draw waiting for us on our return 4am was a lovely touch Sorry forgot about the free room upgrade on arrival
452239,Sloane Square Hotel, I felt the cheese and yogurts needed a re think to keep them cooled and fresh for the continental breakfast On the first morning my friend s wrapped cheese had gone greasy with a speck of mould and on the third morning my yogurt had started to turn BUT it is a lovely setting and the cereals meat fresh juice bread fresh fruit and decent tea and coffee are a great start to the day so lots more positives then the slight hiccup , Gloriously soft pillow and a slightly firmer pillow and fresh sheets and towels every day Great location with a taxi always available just outside Well stocked mini bar The cleaner left a bookmark on top of my newly purchased books one morning and I was so touched by this thoughtfulness 
452240,Sloane Square Hotel,No Negative, Really well run hotel Supper friendly staff Excellent location in beautiful square and metro just across the road Bed was really comfortable Will def be staying again 
452241,Sloane Square Hotel, I have been given a 2 single bedroom and one of the two was very uncomfortable The other one though was ok , After several times spent at this property i can say it confirms itself as a very good hotel SPacious room very quiet
452242,Sloane Square Hotel,No Negative, The convenience of the location for fans of Chelsea like myself and the magnificent view of Sloane Square from my 3rd floor superior room I should add the quality of late morning snacks and service at the hotel s caf brasserie 
452243,Sloane Square Hotel, The breakfast is good but overpriced at 18 pounds , A really good hotel in central London in a nice area in between Chelsea and Westminster Soho etc We simply had a great stay 
452244,Sloane Square Hotel, The bed was a bit too soft bit this is really a matter of taste Further nothing to mention , We booked a superior room it was very nice and just comfortable of size Breakfast was very good there was a big variety of a la carte dishes Staff was very friendly and helpful We loved the location right on the circle line and Buckingham Palace and Royal Albert Hall within walking distance 
452245,Sloane Square Hotel, Nothing much I was very happy with my stay there , The room was larger than expected based on previous reviews The bathroom was small tiny but ok for 1 but spotlessly clean which made up for it being on the small size Nice touches like robes and slippers in the bathroom nespresso machine in the room and good quality sheets 
452246,Sloane Square Hotel, room bed matress needs deifnetely improvemnet the windows wooden frame were forblong time not maintained at all for the rate at this level 4 star no slippers shower drain on arrival 2100 hrs surprised my by blocking so i had to get out of shower the day after reported this to th front office staff but i did not get any maintenance completion as follow up at all safe box placed under neath mini bar so i had knee in order to open it or use it for business people who move fast thisbis not ideal , location and local traport access the room amenities ELEMIS espresso machine very good idea free water at mini bar slot area food idea
452247,Sloane Square Hotel, I had a package arriving one day and had asked that it be left at front desk for me to collect but a member of staff put it in my room despite a do not disturb sign being on the door Only expensive water options available there need to be some cheaper options on the menu , Vegetarian breakfast is very good if a little expensive Free wifi is good Location is excellent right by Sloane Square tube station Also easy to get cabs right outside the hotel Gave me late check out 12pm 
452248,Sloane Square Hotel, Room was not cleaned on the first day but rectified after talking to reception We had a superior double and was not very spacious and limited room for hanging up clothes however found two divan drawers underneath the bed for clothes, The location was excellent 200m from underground and plenty shops and eating places The room decor was very nice with comfortable bed and well stocked mini bar and complimentary tea and coffee bathroom was spacious enough and very clean 
452249,Sloane Square Hotel, Bathroom was well set out but slightly cramped , Hotel is extremely pleasant and very conveniently located for shopping sightseeing and the theatre Access by taxi and public transport is equally good

452401,Sloane Square Hotel, there was quite a lot of noise from the hallway when guests passed by , Super comfy bed and a great shower just what I needed after a day at a trade show
452402,Sloane Square Hotel, My only criticism is that there were no high back comfortable seating in the waiting area by the reception The two existing low red chairs are a joke a child might consider sitting in one but no adult , The room was very good clean and comfortable A shoe horn would have been nice

452410,Sloane Square Hotel, I was offered an upgrade and I said I was more interested in a quiet room than the size of the room I was given a room at the back next to the extraction fan vent for the restaurant next door Even with earplugs in it was sleeping in an aircraft hangar until it was turned off in the early hours It was back on again at 8 00 as I was leaving I wouldn t choose to stay here again as I really didn t sleep well , Location was great Good shower and bathroom products Comfortable bed I enjoyed breakfast although it was pricey for what you got Unfortunately Cote was closed for refurbishment which I think would have been a better option

452414,Sloane Square Hotel, Bar closed at 10 00pm must have been a good reason Can not comment on the food as we ate out , Good location and really handy for the tube Staff helpfull and friendly Quite rooms 
452415,Sloane Square Hotel, It is such a nice bathroom but why do they still have a shower in the bath , I like the location with lots of nice places to eat close by Kings road is great for shopping but it is still nice and quiet The bus is just around the corner 
452416,Sloane Square Hotel, We checked in around 7PM annd went straight out so we did not noticed that our Room 105 was extremely noisy Noise from an outside shaft stopped at 12 00 and started again 08 00hrs Furthermore there was no daylight in the room making it extremely claustrophobic on a very hot day I complained in the morning and was told that if I had done so in the evening sorry did not feel like doing it at midnight they would have given us a better room as some were free It s never pleasant to hear you were deliberately given the worst room was also told that the Manager would be in touch this has not happened,No Positive
452417,Sloane Square Hotel, Be aware that when you book a small room in this hotel this is indeed a very small room This was not an issue for us but our room did had a window but blocked by a mirror effect in order to hide the very ugly courtyard It was also very noisy because of all the AC in this courtyard In conclusion if you hesitate go for the normal rooms which are 3 times bigger and I guess with a proper window , The location of the hotel and professionalism of the staff
452418,Sloane Square Hotel, Reception desk staff very pleasant however speak English with difficult accents Suggested 95 pound ride to Heathrow airport taxi immediately outside charged 55 pounds , Access to Underground excellent however not on the most useful line I had two rooms one double with view of square one twins for older children The location is for those with a lot of money that like to shop in very high end shops If you own a Ferrari this place is for you If not stay in Covent garden

452420,Sloane Square Hotel, The room was very small to say we had been upgraded I dread to think how small the room I booked would have been Also the instructions for the coffee maker within the room aren t the best It took me a while to work oit how to actually get coffee out of the machine not just hot water You have to get the placement of the capsules just right or it falls through into the collection tray, Location friendly staff the view into the square from my room the place was great and we ll decorated and clean 
452421,Sloane Square Hotel, Nothing, I couldn t fault this trip we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who asked us about our plans and then upgraded us to a club room as it was our aniversarry The room was amazing a massive bed wardrobe safe fridge and TV and a fantastic view of the square We also loved the modern bathroom The staff really made our trip enjoyable they treated us to a bottle of prossecco and a card followed by a bowl of cherries and hot chocolate Their hospitality continued beyond this and made our stay extremely easy and comfortable Deffinetly recommend the Sloane hotel

452426,Sloane Square Hotel, Noisy spot but that s part of the convenient location However they don t mention that there is a nightclub next door , Comfortable if small room overlooking Sloane Square Very convenient for tube station restaurants Peter Jones and Chelsea Flower show Would stay again 
452427,Sloane Square Hotel, Bedroom was unacceptably small as difficult to get out of one side as too near the wall Shower difficult to get in and out off Breakfast was in a scruffy club room Too noisy outside Couldn t book a dinner table in the restaurant we had to queue outside in the street with outside customers unacceptable , Location and staff excellent

452430,Sloane Square Hotel, The breakfast It wasn t included in my room but I wanted to try the hotel breakfast and just for convenience However there was very small selection cereal coffee and tea especially for the price The bathroom just needs a little decor update , The location was excellent especially because I attended the Chelsea Flower Show 
452431,Sloane Square Hotel, I am 6ft tall slender I struggled with the shower is was too small for a tall person and very narrow I think a man the same height as me but possibly larger would struggle to fit into it They could have made the shower room bigger , The bed was comfortable for a single and the room was good even though it was small it was very quiet as it was at the bad of the hotel Good for a Saturday night

452434,Sloane Square Hotel, Central London prices It was no worse than anywhere else but you do pay top dollar for everything in Chelsea The road noise was constant all day and night our room looked over Sloan Square You can t expect it to be silent in central London but the window didn t block out much noise Leo the hotel is right next to a very busy wine bar with customers spilling onto the pavement Had to navigate round them each evening going out and coming back , Location was excellent for us Clean comfortable room Friendly staff Ideal for what we wanted

452441,Sloane Square Hotel, I found the room to be cold and the air conditioning didn t have any instructions and the room phone didn t work , Having said that the overall room amenities were good it is clear that they are trying to pitch the hotel at the higher end market and on the whole they seem to have achieved this 
452442,Sloane Square Hotel, The room could be a touch bigger but for this kind of money in that location it is still a great deal The shower contraption not great could be upgraded to avoid cold dripping water from the top bit waking you up too fast Good coffee machine beware not to have too many , Great location dedicated staff easy and practical

452455,Sloane Square Hotel,No Negative, From the moment we were greeted at the Reception desk until we left we found nothing to fault the hotel its location its facilities and the prices charged We felt very at home A good choice all round

452457,Sloane Square Hotel, Room on first floor was located above a nightclub with extremely loud noise on a Saturday night Impossible to sleep in that room Given that this is known this room should not be used to have paying guests stay in , Very nice location friendly staff were very helpful to transfer us to another room when we could not stand the noise in our room 
452458,Sloane Square Hotel, Reception staff were generally unhelpful and slightly condescending Room was very small Multiple holding amounts taken and unclear why with no satisfactory follow up , Location

452462,Sloane Square Hotel, Rooms very small even by London standards and staff seem to wish they were somewhere else Booking com reservations seem to be treated with less care than direct reservations, Fabulous location and love the restaurant 
452463,Sloane Square Hotel, The cote brasserie which is next door and appears to use the same kitchen as the hotel offers breakfast for 7 95 while the hotels is 14 95 I think the hotel breakfast options need to be clearer for the customer , Lovely location mins walk from the tube and Pheasantry venue we were attending Cosy bar area Great full English breakfast at the Cote brasserie next door

452468,Sloane Square Hotel, I was really disappointed with the staffs empathy and reaction to us when we stated that our stay wasn t what we expected They did not ask us how our stay was and when we explained we were disappointed she didn t even ask why she just said sorry to hear that therefore this is the only way you would have received the feedback She didn t want to for fill the customers needs, The hotel was in a fantastic location although sadly we were right above the nightclub so we could not get to sleep until 2 30am The staff at the time brought earplugs up for us but it made our stay not as enjoyable

452481,Sloane Square Hotel, VERY noisy fan outside our window A small double room turned out to be a small single Not ok as we are repeat guests and that there were several small doubles available , Best location in London Nice breakfast staff 
452482,Sloane Square Hotel, I have stayed at this hotel a few times and have always been more than pleased however this time very disappointed with the tinee tiny double Room for one person it is small for two positively poor and I could barely get in the shower would be good if I was a size 10 5 ft individual So not impressed as I think 210 for the room is excessive The only way to change it would have been an upgraded however the hotel was full , Location and staff very nice room clean

452485,Sloane Square Hotel, the location of the double bedroom at the back of the hotel with an outlook over the fire escape The website is misleading in this respect it refers to the Square or the church as the 2 options Quiet but depressing , The location the speed with which queries were dealt with the 1st floor Cafe Bar made a huge difference 
452486,Sloane Square Hotel, Read the small letters You must check out by 11 00 in contrary to most hotels being 12 00 noon And London is not famous for offering complimentary late check out to hotel guests I found rooms to be overpriced and no breakfast included Tiny bathroom Reception staff were too stiff yet polite , Great views to Sloane Square Very convenient location if you want to shop around the area Kind s Rd Harrods Sloane St Big rooms compared to standard London hotel rooms

452488,Sloane Square Hotel, I was overcharged on my stay My booking was made in US dollars and they overcharged me almost 300 dollars after the hotel converted it to pounds Furthermore the staff seemed to throw the responsibility from one person to the other with no solution , It was close to King street
452489,Sloane Square Hotel, Room was not good value It was so small To say it was a double was not a valid description although it had a double bed the remainder of the room was difficult to move around in because of the size The shower was so small it was impossible to turn in it , Location

452493,Sloane Square Hotel, Nothing but the safe location , The location was fabulous staff went over above the normal to help us Only down thing is the safe on the floor Makes it a bit hard for older patrons to use 
452494,Sloane Square Hotel, There was a serious plumbing problem which prevented us to have a proper shower or bath for 5 days There was no cold water in our room Although they tried they could not fix it It turned out that it was not the first time Before getting to this hotel I suggest you call them up and make sure that you will get the possibility to wash yourself , The location and the staff were perfect
452495,Sloane Square Hotel, Hotel did not have the rooms available that we had booked We had received emails to confirm that one room would have a king size bed and the other 2 single beds but on arrival the hotel only had one room with 2 single beds and one room with a miniscule double bed We were told that we had to upgrade the second room at our cost in order to get the room we had originally booked There were also only upgraded club rooms available at the back of the hotel and we had to change room 3 times due to the noise from the aircon extraction systems at the back of the hotel So we paid extra to have a room at the back of the hotel with no view and unbearable noise Considering the mixup made by the hotel the upgrade should have been complimentary Unfortunately the attitude of the staff in this regard was disappointing I am left wondering whether this is the modis operandi of the hotel To sell a room on bookings com that the hotel does not actually have and then force the clients to upgrade and pay a premium to get what one originally booked , Position 
452496,Sloane Square Hotel, Had a problem but was well taken care of My shower was steaming hot couldn t get it colder It was Sunday morning and only on Monday the maintenance people would be in again Receptionist showed me 3 different rooms to which I could change but preferred to stay in my room On Monday everything was fixed without me having to ask again , Very friendly staff Wonderfull lady at the breakfast Cafe Wifi worked great small but very cosy single room nr 102 Great location just across the underground Sloane Square 
452497,Sloane Square Hotel, The room I stayed was good size however I don t know how small it might have been if I didn t get an upgrade I booked for standard doubles To be fair this was my first time in UK and I didn t have a frame of reference to the size of the room I mostly travelled in Asia and I understand rooms in UK and Europe are quite small comparatively, Great location and staff is friendly and helpful As I stayed for 7 days the hotel offered me a free upgrade which I really appreciated
452498,Sloane Square Hotel, could not leave room window open and very warm in the evening had to prop window i open with magazines, great location welcoming friendly staff Able to leave luggage
452499,Sloane Square Hotel, Bed was very hot I presume because of the mattress protector which had a waterproof backing I understand why but this on top of the mattress topper creates a lot of heat , Great location Helpful staff 
452500,Sloane Square Hotel, The water was so hot that I could not take a shower in the morning The hotel was experiencing a problem with the plumbing and hot water was coming out of both the hot and cold taps The staff knew of this before I checked in but didn t mention it , Location
452501,Sloane Square Hotel, The lift was broken when we arrived so we carried out cases up several flights of steep stairs to the second floor although this was quickly resolved by tea time Even with the booking com discount the room seemed overpriced for a small window with the view of a grotty courtyard and extractor fan which hummed all night There was no kettle in the room only a coffee maker The facilities in the room were limited and after one cup of tea we had to go and find more supplies of milk for tea in the morning There was no information in the room about room service although luckily we didn t need it this time There was no heated towel rail , The location in Sloane Square is unbeatable and having Cote restaurant next door is a great asset We liked the express breakfast in the first floor cafe and the foyer has been improved so that there is a nice waiting area there now We loved the little spot reading lights by the bed most hotels have very poor light for reading in bed Liked the Elemis toiletries 
452502,Sloane Square Hotel, Not a Nespresso fan Have to request kettle , Nice room with good air con and window that opened Good shower although small Friendly helpful staff Requested kettle was in room Very close to tube

452507,Sloane Square Hotel, If teddy bear in the room had been complimentary our stay would have been even more lovely , Very convenient for tube and Knightsbridge shops Liked the style of the hotel Comfortable room and bed Enjoyed the first floor cafe bar overlooking Sloane Square 
452508,Sloane Square Hotel, The only annoying things was that the bathroom door would not stay closed unless you locked it not ideal And the safe was on the floor in the cupboard asking it hard to use , The hotel room was large and very clean Loved it and would recommend it to anyone travelling to London So handy to the tube and so many other places 
452509,Sloane Square Hotel, We woke up after one night with red bumps that very much resembled bed bugs The staff followed up with us and let us know that an investigator examined the room and no bed bugs were found However this does not explain that we woke up with these bites all over our body where our skin was exposed For 150 pounds a night I was not expecting to be bitten in my sleep Moreover our room was not ready when we checked in at 2 30PM The room we were eventually given was tiny and far from luxurious Besides the excellent location there was nothing positive about our stay and I would not recommend this hotel to other guests ,No Positive
