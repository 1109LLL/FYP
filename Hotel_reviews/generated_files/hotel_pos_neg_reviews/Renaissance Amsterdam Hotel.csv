355356,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Room location very poor right above the nightclub reported it and was offered room change at 1am which was never going to happen Manager reduced fee by 50 but i felt it should of been complimentray other than the brerakfast as we were kept awake till 03 30am and then was told their was alternative rooms Why weren t we given one of those rooms in the first palce , Bed very comfy Breakfast excellent
355357,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Can t think of anything , The breakfast would suit everyone A great choice and a good start to the day But make sure it comes with the room The hotel is in a good location for shopping museums and attractions There are plenty of places to eat and drink at a price to suit everyone Full of atmosphere A high end hotel in a prime position and worth the money 
355358,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, After paying 300 for one night to have to pay for wifi was extra as well as city tax, Loved the check in and been able to leave our bags everyone smiley and very helpful
355359,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Bedroom carpet could have had a better clean as some bits still on carpet , Great Location excellent Breakfast The staff can t do enough to help 
355360,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Very noisy in the centre of town throughout the night but that is the price you have to pay if you want the fight location for ease of getting around , Excellent service from the front desk and concierge plus breakfast was very good however the major plus is the location
355361,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Staffs in the hotel are friendly especially the Front Desk Navigator who give accurate and detail information about travelling around tourist spots in Amsterdam You won t find any better than this 
355362,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We had prepaid for breakfast and they tried to charge us again receptionist was very reluctant to remove the charge from bill, Service in restaurant was poor staff didn t seem to know what they were doing tables were left littered and durty
355363,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Unfortunately because we had a quad room it was some distance from the lifts, Breakfast and Dinner in the restaurant were very good Lunch in the caf was also good 
355364,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No stationary in the room no q tips in bathroom that s all , I am guest at this Hotel when it was Sonesta I think I stayed at a few Hotels and the Ren is my first choice 
355365,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Check in Was denied my mariott gold benefits due to booking com reservation Had to complain to the management in order to restore these benefits ,No Positive
355366,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Very disappointed that WIFI was not included in the rooms In this day and age WIFI inside your own hotel room should not be charged at 10 a day , Location is 5 minutes from Station Centraal
355367,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I booked two rooms expecting our sons to be with us Because their passports were to expire in August Delta would not let them come to Amsterdam Big disappointment at the airport in NY Since I booked non refundable rooms with Booking com I guess I am just out the 1500 for the kids room Also big disappointment but I am sure the hotel booked the extra room since I cancelled the reservation upon check in Can only hope for the goodness of Booking com for a refund , The hotel was in a great location with good restaurants nearby In fact most everything was nearby or walkable 
355368,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, I would really recommend the Renaissance hotel It is right beside the train station and in a beautiful location All the staff are so helpful and welcoming We had requested 2 single beds however when we arrived there was only a superior bed available We need not have worried thou as the bed was huge and so comfortable The hotel was spotless 
355369,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I had to remind them to replenish the mini bar and hot drink items and even then they did not update everything , The property was ideally located for exploring the centre All amenities were near by 
355370,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Nothing bad to say about this hotel I would just point out that its basically a 5 star hotel price for a hotel that feels more like a very good 4 star one But it s in line with the other hotels of similar level in Amsterdam , Very friendly staff the room is not to big but the bed was really comfortable The breakfast was amazing with a lot of variety and everything tasted really good I stayed only one night so I wasn t t there for long but I liked pretty much everything about the hotel 
355371,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, A double bed when 2 singles booked , Lovely hotel great breakfast selection staff super friendly Only negative was we d booked a twin room and had specifically requested 2 single beds 2 ladies travelling but the hotel only had a double available which was disappointing It d have been better that the hotel had contacted us in advance to advise us of this 
355372,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I expected a little more from a club room and from the club lounge , Property was in a good location a short walk from central train station Staff were friendly and helpful
355373,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Poor breakfast no free wifi in rooms dirty floor in lobby bar at check in we were deceived by receptionist regarding costs of breakfast and internet General impression it s a 3 star hotel not more and too expensive , Good location close to railway station Dam square central tram line
355374,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Room size varies sometimes you get lucky with the bigger room sometimes you get a bit small room at the same price , Comfy bed close to public transportation good hotel if you like to walk around 
355375,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, N A, It is our first time coming to Amsterdam Nethland and we enjoyed it very much We have requested for the Superior room so more spacious and it allowed us to open all the luggages in the room Very convenient to all attractions great location staffs were very helpful and freindly they helped us reserved taxi to pick up to airport the next morning advance booked all museums so we don t have to get in line to buy tickets 
355376,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, N A, I love the location very convenient to places near to tram and easy access to airport Very close by to the tour meetup point Especially very near to taking a cannal boat Close by to shopping area Staffs were excellent very helpful to help us arrange taxi pickup advance tickets booking to all museum It was our 10th wedding anniversairy trip and everything went well We will definitely come back again 
355377,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No free WiFi in the hotel room No separate shower WiFi was available in the lobby and the hotel cafe , We had breakfast in the hotel cafe which was accessed from the street The food was good and good value 
355378,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We booked a delux room due there being a seating area to relax in the room provided was not large enough to have two chairs only one was provided and that was not what the online or brochure images suggested The sound proofing was simply abysmal as at between midnight and 4am the drunken people passing by outside the hotel may well have been in our room and we were 3 floors up , Location was good staff were good breakfast was good 
355379,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Room accessories were poor we had one tea bag no milk one mug no refills of shower gel bottles and soap Breakfast 30 per person too expensive,No Positive
355380,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No free internet in the room in this day and age You could have it for 9 99 day but I didn t need it all day Free internet is a given these days when paying hotel bills , Nice well located hotel Would certainly use it again Quite pricey
355381,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Bathroom very poor the shower had an odd pressure and temperature Hotel not cozy despite the wanna try modern lobby and bar Poor welcome desk it is mainly a hotel for seminar people The room deluxe was not comfortable no attention to details We asked for 2 beds instead of 1 double which we asked in advance through booking but they said it was impossible and it was anyway not guaranteed with the booking The breakfast is additional and expensive almost 30 euros the Wi Fi is additional Very expensive for the level of service and quality Honestly for your stay in Amsterdam go some place else, Not much Good location next to Jordaan and train station very central Easy access to taxi service Quiet
355382,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Room size was a double room with 2 double beds in far too small for four people at 1350 euros for two nights Terrible value for money with no breakfast in the room the kettle didn t even work ,No Positive
355383,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The fact that they could not give us rooms on the same floor as our kids even though requested at time of booking but apparently because it was booked through booking com that information does not go through to them , Great location 
355384,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Room was terrible as was right on the high street so could hear everything constantly At check out I would of told staff but no one actually asked how our stay was Okay hotel but I would not class this as 5 at all , Great location nice staff 
355385,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Room 122 too small and uncomfortable Bath facilities too poor Hotel staff very riendly and competetent Location is perfect , Coffee is horrible Considering the 499 euro night I think this could be better 
355386,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Our room was in the 900 areas which is the family rooms You need to take an elevator for the second floor walk for around 50 meter inside the hotel and get to another elevator to the 900 area In addition awful view directly to a parking loot And I mean the building is aroun 4 meters from our window Also in our 6 days stay 3 days there was yelling talking we heard all night long It doesn t seems like the crew care that much , Good location nice crew 
355387,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, We were in room 942 which is at the top of the hotel and across a walkway It was a bit of a walk from reception but the room came with the added bonus of a balcony Sadly the roof started leaking on the last night so we had to put towels on the bedside table We reported this problem the next morning 
355388,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No milk sachets for tea Too few hooks in bathroom to separate towels We didn t want towels washed after first night and it was difficult to separate and identify them without more hooks Tea coffee was self service Self service food is fine and it was a great breakfast but having to queue for a small mug of tea coffee was a spoiler Usually in hotels of such standard pot of tea coffee is brought to your table and milk is on the table , Professional helpful staff especially doorman Printer to print boarding passes Comfy beds Good shower Great central location 
355389,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The bed had not been made and the towels not replaced when we were first allocated the room , The Scottish cleaner who was sent to our room to make the bed and replace the towels was brilliant and very helpful providing us with her recommendations on where to go in Amsterdam and sorting us out fresh milk for our tea 
355390,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Room size terrible especially for the hotel rating there was hardly any space to walk by the bottom of the bed Cost to stay there is really expensive and is not matched by the standard of the room Will never stay here again,No Positive
355391,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Bar and lounge seemed too light weight for such a fine hotel , The concierge service was especially commendable Breakfast was first class Ideal location 
355392,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, There was no common terrace for the hotel The mattress was ok at first last day we both had servere back aches Maybe a combo of the cold weather and the mattress , Centrally located to all the Trams cars and the Central Train station 
355393,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Small showers water was not consistent hot cold by itself Beds were very small not adult size Could hear other rooms walking up stairs and water noises ,No Positive
355394,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We paid for bed and breakfast and ended up not getting any breakfast because apparently we didn t pay for breakfast when we have proof we did And they charged us city tax at the end of the stay that we wasn t made aware of at the beginning of our stay when we had spent all our money already It was around 7 per night on top of what you have already paid Also be aware that when you get in they ask for a 50 deposit just incase you use the minibar They give it back to you at the end of your stay but it s such a faff , The bed was very comfortable 
355395,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The property has mould around the windows The room was smelling of stale cigarette smoke It was not what I paid for Never a 4 Star hotel 2 Star at best , This is not a 4 star hotel It is deceptive to rate it a such My daughters Apple MacBook laptop was stolen from our room 
355396,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The original room was not ready on arrival so they offered the deal to upgrade I think they probably offer this to everyone who arrives early and is definitely a sales technique targeting weary travellers , This is a lovely hotel which is minutes away from Dam square and the central station We upgraded to the club room package on arrival The room was very comfortable and wifi was included in the club package at a cost of 65 extra per night The club package also gave us breakfast afternoon pastries and even drinks in the club room This was great introduction to the hotel 
355397,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, charge for EVERYTHING extra even a cup of milk for tea Room just only just big enough and decor tired for such a ridiculous price, location location
355398,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We got this 5 star hotel for a relatively reasonable price Slightly deceptive wifi was so expensive robes were not provided and some of the counter surfaces were dusty , The beds were extra comfortable The trip advisors at the desk were very friendly Very good location
355399,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Hotel should provide a photo map of walking direction from amsterdam central station to hotel location , The receptionist lady from Thailand she is excellent receptionist She was very nice to me and very friendly I really thanks everyone working at this hotel for their hospitality Very recommended hotel to stay good breakfast hotel location is within walking distance to amsterdam central station 
355400,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Thought one staff cheated me when I got the family room initially It was not what was promised to me when I booked Only after repeated push they changed to the one that we had booked Also although people talk to you but their behaviour is biased to where you come from that is your origin It was obvious , Location and hotel
355401,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Wasn t keen on how far our room as from the lobby 2 lifts and a very long walk I wouldn t class the hotel as 5 but would easily be a 4 , Love the location and grounds of the hotel Very stylish and sleek Clean comfy beds friendly staff
355402,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Facilities wasn t 5 star level and they made us pay for wine we didn t take from the minibar as we don t drink wine also didn t tell us that you Have to pay city tax each day you stay , Clean and helpful
355403,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, It wasn t made clear about us being charged for breakfast We got charged 60 When we spoke to reception they basically said tough It was a very special trip for us and I am very disappointed ,No Positive
355404,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Typical old style accomodation no windows with not much room between beds Everything extra costs money including wifi breakfast My son stayed down the road at a hostel for half the price facilities were comparable all inclusive , Well located friendly staff lovely reception clean good facilities
355405,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, This is my third trip to Amsterdam with family last trips were excellent with double tree Hilton but this time unfortunately very bad experience at renaissance We had booked the club room via booking com for me and my family 2 adults and 2 kids paid euro 814 50 in advance for 4 nights the moment we entered the hotel michael at the desk while checking in told us our booking is only for two adults and while booking through booing com it was cleared mentioned we booked for 2 adults and 2 kids we even mentioned the age of the kids Also I had sent email requesting for two twin beds Michael called booking com and made me speak to merwan that too after holding the call for 15 mins but michael spoke the same language and said our booing is for two adults and we should pay extra to the hotel if we want to stay with the kids Then a lady at the desk named Sarah came in and told us we should pay extra euro600 so that she will give us another room to accommodate with the kids I requested her a lot to consider us since we already paid euro814 50 it will be too much for us to pay another euro 600 but invain Since we flew a long over night flight we were exhausted and ended up paying euro600 extra thinking that we could get a better room But when we went to the room 959 which was almost half a km away from the reception and it was kind of haunting room with some odd way with cracks all over the beams and ceiling chilly air passing in from the windows and our sleep was so disturbing since lot of sound coming from the clubs outside people screaming and all I went to the desk again to Michel requested him to change the room but he was only interested in collecting additional money rather than helping he said we should pay additional money if I need to change the room which I refused and ended up staying in the same room 959 ruining our holidays I have booked many a times with booking ,No Positive
355406,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The club room was less than expected, The club lounge was very nice Location is good close to the central station The room was not more than OK but the bedding were great Staff very helpful
355407,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The receptionists that checked us in on arrival were passing judgement and making sarcastic comments throughout Please note there was 8 people to check in therefore not each person would have been able to hear the instructions We were abruptly ordered to hand in passports and a bank card per person without any explanation I guessed it was to cover city tax room service etc however as I had already paid for the four rooms upfront last month my 7 other guests were confused When asked if our 4 four rooms were in close proximity the response was Certainly Not One member of staff asked another who are these people directly in front of me They were quite frankly rude patronising and stuck up I would have said potentially racist however the male seemed to be of an ethnic origin Thankfully we did not have to interact with these two members off staff after Friday evening and all the other members off staff were fantastic and overly helpful , The bed was much more comfortable than expected for a single bed the rooms were cleaned to a good standard and it s always nice to have complimentary toiletries The communal areas are bright airy and feel luxurious 
355408,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Hotel breakfast was too expensive considering you can walk out of the hotel and within 20 meters there was a fantastic cafe that served full English Breakfast at half the price the hotel would charge for one person for a Continental breakfast , Location Location Location
355409,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Could have had free wifi included as the price of the room was not expensive but also not cheap , The bed was amazing 100 found my hotel for every time i visit Amsterdam Will be booking again without a doubt 
355410,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I have stayed here over 20 time and this time the staff were awful and they consistently harassed me for money for 2 days I will not go back, I liked the location 
355411,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Great location Short 8 10 minute walk to central part of Amsterdam Dam Square This is our third time staying at this hotel and we have had excellent service every time We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Amsterdam 
355412,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, free wifi in all areas would have been good also I think that breakfast was a little expensive lovely eateries at half thr price nearby, Beds were extremely comfy location perfect for visiting all tourist attractions easily
355413,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, A lovely Hotel whats not to like, We are regulars to Holland and Amsterdam this was our first stay at the Renaissance we checked in late on the Friday evening and after unpacking we had a slight issue with room after mentioning it to reception we were moved and problem sorted with out any fuss it made us feel very welcome and valued as customers 
355414,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The room was a torturous walk 2 lift rides away from the main reception It was also above a some sort of Club Not a nightclub but maybe an events centre Music chatter banged into the early hours We were not warned about this Pillows were awful We all agreed they needed up grading they were lumpy uncomfortable , The location was excellent Right in the heart of Amsterdam Our family of 4 shared one room with two queen sized beds The room was spacious well equipped for multiple occupancy Bathroom was on the small side for a family room but adequate The toiletries towels provided were not worthy of 5 stars in my opinion Robes slippers were not provided Housekeeping was excellent Concierge service was very efficient 
355415,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We were led to believe that breakfast was included only to find out at check out that we had a substantial bill to pay, The staff was friendly and helpful and you couldn t beat the location
355416,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Lot of walking from elevator to room beds could have been comfier , Right in the heart of things yet removed enough to feel secluded Walking distance from central station The concierge was v helpful and had prepaid passes to almost any museum you wanted to see Saved us a lot of time 
355417,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Insufficient tea coffee spoon and milk supplies in the room Prebooked breakfast was more expensive than pay on the day More seating in the room one comfy chair between two , Location Bed Concierge
355418,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Bed was small and room very noisy hence them giving you ear plugs Bathroom also had many hairs from previous guests , Location staff were polite 
355419,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Cold room single glazed window whitnessed valet driver abusing my sportscar sewer leak causer whole hotel to smell including rooms blackmailed by staff for money wasn t asked how my stay was security let himself into my room and went through my things , Bed was comfy Food was ok but over priced 
355420,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Very noisy neighbours group of males watching soccer shouting and swearing through the night not ideal for our children Adjoiningg door to the noisy room made it worse most expensive accommodation on our trip compared to better hotels and locations in Paris Berlin and London , Great location comfortable room great staff
355421,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, A little expensive for what you received and in comparison with some three four star hotels in the same area Notwithstanding the has a lot to contribute but asking to pay for wifi is retrograde and demeaning it is free just about everywhere , Staff were very helpful 
355422,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Noisy at night had to pay for wifi and late check out no water in room Overall didn t feel very welcome just there to pay up for extras , Good location and good breakfast 
355423,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We had no complaints , Great location near the train station and the port Convenient to transportation but within walking distance of many major attractions American style amenities and a great bar 
355424,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, That we had booked and paid for 3 people but were not welcomed questioned about booking had to prove I had called and paid and showed confirmation of 3 but made to feel like I was lying, Location
355425,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The room rather average but more important it was not fresh and even though we left the Windows open the entire day it remained rather dank , The breakfast is good
355426,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, The location was convenient to the central station and an easy walk to the tram Busy streets close by but very quiet The staff were helpful and the Navigator desk was new to me but a great idea 
355427,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The way they nickel and dime you No free coffee in the room If you touch the items in the fridge you get charged Expensive breakfast not included Wifi charge unless you sign up for Marriotts point system , Quiet comfortable room Fantastic help from the concierge he is smart and has great suggestions 
355428,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, View from the bedroom was directly across from someones office rubbish tv overpriced wifi but money shouldnt be an issue if your going to stay here, Beds are great and the location too
355429,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The construction of the building made it cumbersome to go from the entry to our room , The staff was always quickly and effectively helpful Room was clean and well appointed Many nearby eating options 
355430,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We required a room with 2 beds that was given away after we checked in We left our bags at the desk as our room was not ready yet and by the time we returned from sightseeing the room was no longer available We paid a handsome fee for one of us to sleep on a cot No compensation was offered after its request due to the booking being placed from a third party site Needless to say policy trumped service The experience of Amsterdam is always very special The room experience was needless to say unpleasant ,No Positive
355431,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We travel around Europe quite frequently and generally are not picky travelers but I did have some gripes about this hotel First of all as soon as we walked into our room a family sized room it smelled as if someone had just smoked a cigarette As nonsmokers with our young children 3 and 1 traveling with us we decided to request another room as it was bothersome We waited in the given room for about 15 minutes for a staff member to come escort us to our new room which was conveniently located right across the hall We walked into this room and it almost smelled worse like actual garbage spoiled fruit or something We tried to find the source of the smell but could not It was clear that someone knew of the smell because the window was open when we came in We also requested a baby crib to be in the room and luckily it was already in there and set up nicely when we arrived Unfortunately one of the slates was clearly broken and the top of the crib which was cloth was covered in stains boogers slobber etc The carpet and walls were filthy and the bathroom door was VERY difficult to open from the looks of the wood on the side of it something was broken which disrupted the functionality of it For the price that we paid close to 450 euros a night we expected much better and were very disappointed , Every interaction with staff members was lovely the location was perfect and the beds were very comfortable Also I loved the toiletries provided We are Marriott rewards members so we had free Wifi as well which was very convenient Such a shame that the hotel room itself was less than ideal 
355432,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, We stayed one night prior to a cruise We unexpectedly discovered we could get there by train from the airport saved and great train We walked about five blocks to hotel They accommodated us well increasing our room size for a rollaway bed 
355433,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Even with our most critical eye we can find NO negative in our experience , My expectations were again met and exceeded for our stay Your desk staff and bell staff were exceptional The Bell staff provided excellent directions several times recommended a pharmacy loaned an umbrella arranged for a cab to the Ijmuiden Cruise terminal all flawlessly We selected your hotel because of the quality during a previous stay We will recommend to others without hesitation Good work 
355434,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Loved the lounge you have to pay extra for it but it comes with drinks and all kinds of things to munch on in the evening and breakfast in the morning Well worth it It is also close to the train station and tram line 
355435,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The bed and especially the pillows should have been firmer as requested The shower controls were somewhat difficult to figure out A card with pictures would have helped We were billed for unused snack items just rearranged so we could store our preferred items purchased offsite We were double billed for the prepaid portion of our stay The bill was promptly revised All together the nuisances were minor , For a compact space the room accommodated the two of us and too much luggage The Navigator concierge was very helpful in finding dinners Lucius was one of the finest meals we ever had Their local map was better than the guide map I bought at home Getting from the hotel to various sites was easy We walked everywhere The location was touristy local enough that we could get what we wanted breakfast croissants readily 
355436,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Club lounge not restocked quickly enough and tables not cleared Nite turn down did not always check and refresh towels These little details are expected in a 4 5 star property , Bed was excellent Location is the best easy walk from the train station and within walking distance of all of central Amsterdam 
355437,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Could have done with more pressure in the water in the shower and some more milk in our room but these are very minor negatives on a beautiful hotel experience , Very friendly staff thorough and detailed welcome upon check in The room was Spazious and comfortable The location of the hotel was excellent and the navigator service offered next to the reception desks was a huge positive for us as they recommended is several good restaurants and bars Very good hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here 
355438,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Rooms could be better maintained but good overall Breakfast was the same for the 5 days could do with a little variety, Service location Club floor
355439,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The breakfast was nice but pricey for what was available , The staff was wonderful the accommodations were great the location was perfect Loved the view of the street from our window 
355440,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, This was our second stay in a week first room we considered to be too small This we mentioned on leaving and the second stay was an excellent size 
355441,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Rooms are very small The walls are too thin we could hear a baby crying from updtairs throughout our entire stay Phone needed to be fixed and the toilet wash basin drainage needed to be fixed ie rooms need maintenance We booked a club room assuming there is something different but the only thing different was that you get free wifi this should be a standard in all hotels by now and you get to eat breakfast in the club lounge which in reality provides you LESS options than the normal breakfast area Additionally being a club room guest you are not allowed to have breakfast in the normal breakfast area , Location of hotelis good
355442,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, There was a mouse in the bar and the staff tried to say that was quite normal for Amsterdam , The hotel was not far from the centre The beds were really comfy 
355443,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Had to call for maid service at 2200 because they never cleaned our room Random knocking all morning even with the privacy sign on the door , Location was excellent About a 5 minute walk from Central Station Very close to major attractions The breakfast was amazing well worth the hefty price Relaxing bar atmosphere for a late night cocktail 
355444,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No swimming pool, Bed was amazing We opted to upgrade our room since we arrived earlier and in doing this it included the pleasure of the club lounge The drinks and snacks were fantastic thankyou Wish we stayed longer We ll definately be staying again at our next visit
355445,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, The room was so spacious and comfortable with everything that we needed the bed was so comfy too good location aswel as most places were walking distance 
355446,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Breakfast was over priced as were the drinks It would have been pleasant to enjoy a nightcap in the hotel but very pricey , The location and the really friendly navigator who was extremely helpful The hotel was spotless 
355447,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, We booked a Club Room which while on its own wasn t particularly better than others was well worth the extra cost as it included breakfast which was excellent use of the Club Lounge which was a great benefit offering free drinks snacks afternoon tea etc all day and free enhanced wifi throughout our stay If wifi is important to you the normal cost of this was 20 night so is well worth the Club Room cost The staff throughout the hotel were extremely helpful and pleasant making a huge effort to make the stay a good one The location of the hotel was perfect with Central Station Canal Cruises Dam Square all within minutes walk 
355448,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Nothing to complain about except for the price of the parking , Perfect location the most comfortable beds in a very long time nice breakfast and fresh room Straff is very friendly We came by car and could park in the garage under the hotel 58 per day 
355449,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No complaints it was great thank you, The staff were very friendly and helpful they couldn t do enough to help with directions etc The lady that checked us in to the two gentlemen on the concierge and the young bellman that took our luggage to our room all gave excellent service they are a credit to your hotel 
355450,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I didn t like the fact the staff took over 1000 of me for 2 nights this was due to me offering to oh early because I didn t want to carry the cash around with me or leave it in the room the check in assistant Alonso had charged my card for the stay before we even discussed this I then paid in euros and he failed to mention that he had already took the funds from my account I asked 3 times and be confirmed the hotel was only taking 70 for a deposit it s been 5 days I m home and still no sign of my money , The location is perfect Not to close yet close enough the hotel is beautifully kept and you feel like your paying over the odds for a reason 
355451,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Couldn t check in until 4 30pm on the Friday which I think is very poor No room service after midnight and all bars were shut Expensive for what it was , Great location good restaurants over the road Bar staff were very good 
355452,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Our room 957 was too far away from lobby low ceiling very noisey ear plugs were provided for that reason We were staying 2 nights only and were offered a different room for the second night but found that just as much of a hassle to pack up again for one night There was no 24 hour room service for food or drink for what is a 5 star hotel that s very surprising We wouldn t recommend this hotel , The location was good bar area was inviting 
355453,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Too crowded The club room has different sizes Some smaller and some good and spacious , Rooms are spacious food is good wifi is very good Location is good quiet area and location is good within walking distance 
355454,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The general decor of the hotel was shabby and in need of updating One also had to pay for any TV and internet WIFI Its alos necessry to pay 8 per day city tax which was unexpected , The bed was comfortable 
355455,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The room was a bit small but most hotels in Amsterdam are like that Not much international channels available English channels , In general the hotel is good staff very friendly and helpful Unfortuabtley some problem with my reward card and the hotel said they will follow up to solve it but nothing was informed or updated to me
355456,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The double family room was small I thought the hotel was expensive for what we got It is a business like hotel I would not call this hotel luxury by any means , The location is terrific right in the heart of the city Hotel is modern and staff friendly 
355457,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, A Saturday night and there was apparently no food at all for room service disgusting Mini bar was not refreshed on the second night and upon arrival a chocolate bar had been opened in there I paid an extortion for a movie which kept jumping throughout and was practically unwatchable the room itself was expensive and I didn t expect this , Comfy bed generally clean SOME staff were good 
355458,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We stayed for 5 nights but were given the smallest room on the floor walking around the furniture could only be done one person at a time Also we had to pay extra for wifi in our room and even more for high speed wifi despite it being available all over the city for free I think the hotel scrambles the signal in the hotel so you can t get free wifi unless you sit in the lobby , The hotel was central and easy to walk to from the train station and all the tourist services hop on hop off buses and cruises etc 
355459,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The layout of the hotel rooms When we first checked in we were given a room that requires us to get through a maze of corridors and taking 2 elevator rides to different floors to get to the first room The first room size was excellent but we found getting to the room very very challenging In fact we thought the check in staff could have alerted us if we mind the walk thru that maze before giving us our keys If i were younger and have a family in tow I may still take that room but with my heavy luggage from travelling thru Europe before arriving into Amsterdam I wasn t in the mood to take that room We were than given another room that was still a long walk down the corridor to get there but at least it didn t require us to remember the maze that we need to walk thru to get our rest , The location was excellent and the concierge were helpful in pointing places that we could try visiting by asking all the right questions Furthermore the porters were always ready to help when they can spot a lost guest Also the hotel location was ideal to get to many of the places of interest which was great Lastly around the hotel are many convenience stores and eateries if you need a quick fix for a meal or snack but mind the magic mushrooms though if you are not into it 
355460,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Nothing, Nice room clean comfortable good size Club room with Lounge access Staff were pleasant helpful Something I was impressed by was the Guest Relations personal Bronwyn when asked an awkward question use her common sense and resolve it without a fuss great 
355461,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Hotel is now a bit old The room had a really low ceiling over the desk which despite the warnings on the ceiling above caused a bump on my head for the last week Bed was soft at one end Room was about 15m2 literally nowhere to put my suitcase Obviously some rooms are bigger and don t have a low ceiling I stayed here about 5 years ago room was bigger and newer then There are better hotels in the city which have recently been refurbished I checked out and stayed elsewhere for 2nd night , Location is good 
355462,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Was the best hotel out of our entire trip The room was so spacious and comfortable The breakfast was great just enough to get you started in the morning to go out all day An added bonus of the cocktail hour and the afternoon tea time int he lounge as well The staff themselves were simply wonderful There was one concierge that was so helpful to us while we were that it truly made the whole experience that much better since we didn t have to worry about getting tickets for tours or anything He even remembered the fact that we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday after just one mention of it They gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate that night plus a little note It was the little stuff that made us love this hotel We will not be staying anywhere else when we go back to Amsterdam An added bonus is that they are right there next to everything we never had to walk too far to go somewhere 
355463,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, The concierge staff were extremely helpful with the car parking We checked out early in the morning and again the check out desk was very helpful efficient 
355464,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Check in was a little difficult initially as the Hotel asked for further proof of ID Drivers Licence etc in addition to our Passport ID we had not been notified previously and did not have this to hand over We did not have any milk in the room during our 3 night stay The Hotel were unable to provide us with a final receipt of payment and stated this would be emailed due to problems with their computer however this has still not been sent , The location was perfect only a short walk from the central station and close to all amenities It was a quiet hotel and a very comfortable and clean room The Restaurant staff were all very friendly and the food really good 
355465,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Check in time is at 3pm but they will work with you to get you in as soon as possible There s a daily deposit that should of been mentioned in the listing , Great location next too almost everything The hotel restaurant is great and there is a bistro immediately across the street that opens early and it s fantastic best bitterballin Dutch dish is the best in the city there 
355466,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We were rather disappointed with the deluxe room we had booked given the price we had paid for a special anniversary The room was very small However having raised our complaint with staff they handled it very well and accommodated us well , Lovely breakfast choices but pricy Staff very helpful Walking distance from railway station 
355467,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Room was clean great location for shopping near center Housekeeping lady was kind and always asking if they could do anything for us a credit to the hotel 
355468,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, no swimming pool our room 928 too far a walk from Lobby elevator and required 2 lifts first time I have ever experienced this View from room crap non existant , All round excellent hotel and staff 
355469,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Only 2 issues in what was overall a pleasant stay 1 Curtains in room don t fully meet therefore there is a light coming in from early morning through the window 2 No hand towels left in the room on second night of stay had to call down the reception to ask them to drop up towels Which reminds me it took ages to get through to reception As I have stated overall is was a pleasant stay but these above issues are fairly basic requirements that need to right all the time PS just thought of something else charging for WIFI in rooms in this day and age is a complete rip off Seriously , Great city center location close to Central Station Room small but comfortable
355470,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, It was our 16th wedding anniversary and the staff at the hotel made our stay very special The concierge made excellent meal reservations for us Left with fond memories Thank you 
355471,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Windows in room not sound proof breakfast not included and we paid quite a good some of money for 5 nights breakfast is expensive too compared to other hotels in Europe who normally include breakfast in price , The interior is nice most of the staff are friendly especially the navigators 
355472,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We had booked 4 rooms We had paid the same rate for all the 4 rooms The size of the rooms were not the same infact one of the room on the 7 th floor was really small , everything was perfect except the different room size and very late check in 
355473,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We were in room 950 and it was a very long walk and 2 different lifts from Reception It would have been more convenient to have a mirror over the desk to be able to use a hairdryer It was difficult to find anyone in the lounge bar to serve us on Sunday afternoon , The location was good and it is a nice hotel although perhaps not 5 star 
355474,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, General generic appearance and feel overpriced, Good location secure and clean but the hotel was very generic and soulless Given the price not exactly good value for money 
355475,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Perhaps the fact that on arrival we were promised wine and fruits as a welcome token but they never came , Although we spent only a nite the hotel was quite comfortable We arrived at about 7am yet we were not charged extra That was quite considerate of them 
355476,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The hotel looks very dated and old fashioned There was an awful smell of frying in the corridor on the 2nd floor which was very off putting , The hotel is in a great location ideally situated for Centraal Station the canal belt and the centre of town The staff are very friendly and courteous especially in reception The beds are comfy and the pillows good 
355477,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Corridors were a bit run down and in need of decor , No complimentary water in room Was travelling with a young family Complimentary water or nibbles on arrival would have been nice 
355478,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No free wifi in rooms Check in slow and required senior staff member as other staff having issues with our booking Having to pay for the music channels in the room No milk in room only powdered stuff Asked for proper milk but never came Stayed in better 3 4 star hotels , Liked that the room had air conditioning Good shower 
355479,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, There was only one bath robe in our room The maid walked into our rook without knocking and saw my boyfriend naked , Bed was very comfy and the breakfast was great Great location

355481,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Nothing I would book this hotel again , Good location with bar and restaurant on site The Concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful and staff were generally helpful and pleasant throughout 
355482,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Nothing, Lovely hotel in a good location Staff were super friendly especially in the club lounge The snacks were fantastic in the lounge too Enjoyed staying there and would stay again
355483,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Rooms are pretty basic for the price I was disappointed when I entered the room for the first time Rooms need to be refurbished or modernised The breakfast area is too small I came for breakfast one morning and there was absolutely no seat available I had to wait for 10 minutes before being able to access the buffet , The location is very good next to the Centraal Station and close to a tramway station It is perfect to visit the city The breakfast was very good Very friendly staff 
355484,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The bed was comfortable but i asked and paid for a deluxe room but the room was extremeltly small 550 seems a but steep for a room smaller than my bedroom the majority of the staff were lovely bar one very rude blonde guy who was on when i was checking out he shoudlnt work in a hotel if he hates his job so much apart from the noise of the surrouding streets all night and the size of the room everything else was ok , The bed was comfortable but i asked and paid for a deluxe room but the room was extremeltly small 550 seems a but steep for a room smaller than my bedroom the majority of the staff were lovely bar one very rude blonde guy who was on when i was checking out he shoudlnt work in a hotel if he hates his job so much apart from the noise of the surrouding streets all night and the size of the room everything else was ok 
355485,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The hotel was utterly ordinary and could have been anywhere No character or style It took more than 5 minutes to get hot water at the tap or shower in the room which was at the end of the line The ceiling n the bathroom was so low that I could not raise my arms whilst showering It was poor value at over 200 per night without breakfast and then hotel tax on top , The tulips in reception were pretty 
355486,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, THAT THE BREAKFAST WAS NOT IN THE MAIN RESTAURANT ROOMS ARE SMALL HOLDING SUCH GREAT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THE CHECKING IN 75 EUROS PER NIGHT, THE CLUB LOUNGE THE STAFF ARE VERY KIND AND HELPFUL
355487,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Pillows were hard and uncomfortable Sewer like smell as you walk into the the check in lobby , All of the staff that were very nice and helpful Convenient location 
355488,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Wouldn t honor Marriott membership since I booked thru Booking com Hotel wants to charge 30 for early check in or we had to wait three more hours for our room but That was a lie We were told three hours later that the only room available is an executive room with club lounge benifit at the cost of 100 per nite What a scam , The location
355489,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Hotel staff not friendly and sometime arrogant when they talk limited answers It depends on avilability we can not promise Worse hotel ever in cleanness Parking cost is too much ancient isolation system almost 60 of the noise outside you can hear it in your room, Location Comfort bed
355490,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Lobby is designed wrong to many people at once in and out at the same time and lack of traffic flow the different levels are a problem as well Specially for luckage overall not comfortable to enter in a hotel of 5 stars , Comfortable rooms spacious good bathroom reasonably quiet for center city
355491,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, When we checked into our room there were half consumed drinks left in the mini bar from the previous guests We had the Ren room which includes a free mini bar We ask for our mini bar to be restocked every day Unfortunately the staff never restocked the mini bar even after several requests per day We eventually got fed up with nothing being done that we stocked the mini bar ourself with items from the local shop , Great comfortable bed Good location 
355492,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, There are no extras and is expensive i would have expected a SPA The breakfast is good but could be much better for the kind of place I am vegetarian and options are limited , Very luxurious and an amazing location More of a family business place than group of friends I was travelling in business so it fit my needs 
355493,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, the breakfast restaurant was horrible too many people they had to extend the breakfast to the bard lounge to accommodate The room was way too small , clean
355494,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Front office staff attitude blas to totally indifferent Room small and Loud especially due to early morning deliveries delivery wagons dragged over cobble stone path Room entry key card system problems resulting in cards no longer working and having to be re initialized All in all an experience not to be repeated ,No Positive
355495,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Coldest hotel room ever heating not working properly and only by ventilation system No radiator in the room or bathroom Floor freezing and towels cold and humid Very noisy too ,No Positive
355496,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Rooms a bit on the small side Constant problem with the electrical door key Had to make several trips to the reception as I could not get into room Breakfast ridiculous price 30 euro , Fantastic location 
355497,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Milk and spoons could have been supplied with tea making facilities in the room , We had fish and chips in the lounge bar restaurant closed on Sunday being which we thought we thought were the best we ve ever had 
355498,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, My room was facing the street and on Friday and Saturday you just can t sleep with noise until 4 5am drunk people cars etc Although the hotel location is central is too close to the noisy area of Amsterdam The room was small and it was basic for a 5 hotel , Location is good Staff is friendly and professional Hotel facilities are good 
355499,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Super overpriced wi fi is and breakfast are not included even though the prices are very high More like 4 stars hotel then 5 rooms are tiny we traveled with 1 check in bag and 1 carry on hardly found the space for them in our room Traveled with big group of 10 people everyone has the same opinion , Location is great 2 min from central station where the trains and buses from the airport arrive Old city and all tourist areas are very close 5 20 min walk 
355500,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I found Scossa little weird compared with the excellent restuarant on my last visit Hotels who serve orange juice from concentrate get a very very black mark from me Cheapens your image and in my case would make your customer violently ill , On this visit the staff ould not have been more helpful The room was clean and comfortable but with no outlook The location for getting about was excellent
355501,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The rooms are not as modern and as smart as they look on the photos They look quite dated when you actually see them Therefore I thought I was paying for a extra for fancier room and was disappointed Also our air conditioning and tv didn t work Plus we were originally checked into a room that had a lot of maintenance going on it in and no view So we had to wait to change rooms , The lobby was lovely 
355502,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Lack of free WiFi except in lobby was poor for hotel of this standard Breakfast was also too expensive but was transparent in room rate when booking , The location and the staff helpfulness was excellent Also very comfortable 
355503,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Conflicting information at times from staff re Internet use Check out was a little chaotic with other guests jumping the queue , Family room was really comfortable in size They weren t able to give us adjoining rooms which was unfortunate as family next door were pretty loud Beds and bathrooms also really clean and spacious Location wise it was fantastic just a few minutes away from centraal station We were surprising one of the girls in our group so needed some assistance from the Front Desk team to co ordinate They did a fantastic job helping us execute our plan They were also incredibly kind and arranged for a bottle of champagne and card to be sent up Overall I would 100 return and recommend to a friend 
355504,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, i was quoted 321 pounds and 360 was taken out of my account will not be using your hotel again and i would much obliged if you would refound the difference back into my acount,No Positive

355506,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No breakfast for the price Offed a discound at the register for breakfast at 20E per person They keep a 70E extra deposit I didnt know that just in case something is happen to the room They will return the amount after you leave Also I had to pay an extra 19E for city taxes Also didnt know never happend to me on other Amsterdam Hotels I thought the price I payed in bookings com was final Not the case here NO wifi in the room and if you open mini bar more than 30sec you might charge There is a warning for that , The location nice room
355507,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, During my stay the housekeeping did not even clean my room The room does not have any room slipper cotton earbud nor any shaver provided , The bed is very comfortable and the hotel location is situated quite close by the Centraal station about 5 10mins walk 
355508,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Were unaware of the 75 per night deposit and the fact that this and the room rate and city tax were all charged to your card prior to check out regardless of how you were paying, Beds and the pillows were amazingly comfortable
355509,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, the room is a little small and I book a queen size room they can only offer a two beds room without informing me , Very good location with a good staff team 
355510,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, There was a power cut on the Saturday evening of our stay This was really fustrating as a group of 5 girls getting ready for an evening out for a Birthday celebration with NO electricity what so ever was almost impossible After sitting in our rooms for over an hour in the dark with no idea when the electricity would return we were forced to get ready in the dark using just the lights from our phones Needless to say we most certainly didn t look not feel our best We checked out early the next day as had flights back upon check out there was no explanation apology or compensation I did not have time to address my disappointment as had to queue for quite some time to check out airport taxi was already waiting outside , Location brilliant staff extremely helpful Requested early check in which I know is not always guaranteed but upon arrival rooms were ready for check in straight away Staff were available to assist us with tourist information arrange taxis etc 
355511,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The room was not properly cleaned two times They didn t refill the minibar and charged us for things we didn t take Also the staff was helpful yet cold and dismissive when we complained or asked for something , Extremely confortable bed and shower The breakfast was delicious The hotel was beautiful and was conveniently close to Amsterdams s Centraal and many other attractions 
355512,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I greatly disliked being charged for wifi in the room Thankfully i was a rewards member and they took the charge off when i checked out The 3 previous hotels I stayed at on this trip provided lower speed free wifi in the rooms , Great location and a very nice property All the staff we came in contact with were very professional and nice 
355513,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, On the whole the service was impersonal and superficial I stayed in this hotel for a weekend mainly because it is near the railway station so I could get to the airport and another town easily There are much more charming hotels in the city with similar rates , Cleanliness and proximity to the Centraal Station
355514,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, well this was a 5 stars hotel I was expected more luxury and extra care of fine details room was really tight no luxury items there when I first checked in they told me no internet available as I have to make a membership it was really silly trick to ask me for filling a form of membership to have the Wifi which suppose to be free in one star hotel, location is really good near the main station staff were friendly easy check in and check out hotel is quite
355515,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The restaurant costs were rather pricey , Bed and also shower brilliant Large very comfie bed Double cubicle shower area good water temp and pressure no clambering over bath side all hotels would be wise to head towards this mini wet room concept 
355516,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Location in city centre just a short walk to Dam square or if arriving leaving by train the hotel is 5 mins away The lounge and bar area are fantastic Restaurant dining was fabulous Large spacious bedroom with large double comfortable bed The staff are outstanding I became ill in the late afternoon before leaving for the flight The concierge looked after me for several hours got me drinks and arranged for a car to pick me up at the appropriate time as I was not capable of doing this at the time I am so grateful to them for this as I was alone and their advise and care to me was outstanding I was really happy that I had chosen this hotel to stay in 
355517,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Rooms are extremely small hotel is old and a bit smelly in the room I ve been in many hotels in Amsterdam this is one was in the worst state in terms of cleanliness and freshness , Location is very central breakfast is very good
355518,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Can t fault in any way what so ever Everything was perfect , Everything was amazing I have to say though the beds are the most comfiest I ve ever slept in I ll defiantly consider coming back to this hotel and will defiantly recommend 
355519,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The price of the parking 58 EUR for 24 hours , The staff is gentle the breakfast is really nice more bio products would be nice however the beds in the room are really comfortable The location is great 2 min walking distance from the public transports and a few minutes from the city center View giving on the back of a church not too bad 
355520,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Their wifi internet policy is outdated for this level of hotel nowadays should be free and unrestricted to all guests Really annoyed that Netflix seems to be blocked when I have no problem in other nearby hotels , I stay in many different hotels in Amsterdam picking the Renaissance when I need good access to station it s tucked away rather than being one of the grand hotels which for me is preferable Booked an REN room this time free minibar was good 
355521,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Its missing a homely feel a bit too modern and clinical for me , Staff were very friendly and helpful The room was lovely and comfortable The location was good 
355522,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The hotel was nothing spectacular and although it was nice it was very basic Also the payment process was very confusing and they initially charge you more which wasn t mentioned when booking , The hotel was in a great location and the room was very comfortable
355523,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Booked club lounge access for a renaissance it was lacking the usual selection of drinks and food items The eggs at breakfast could have done with being hotter A better equipped serving area would probably help Also no slippers or robes in room , The room size and location of the hotel was good Staff were also really nice 
355524,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, At my check out the manager tried to make me pay extra charges for which I never signed Read your bill guys It s a big tendency at this location , The MARRIOTT reward lounge staff were very helpful and vey professional 
355525,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Very disappointed I have stayed at the Renaissance many times over the years period this year they put us on the second floor with our window next to the sidewalk where we were pleasantly surprised at the gentleman standing outside a window vomiting all over the ground and we could listen to every last drop period moving to a second room on the fourth floor we had the pleasure of listening to a metal gate slamming all night long worms word 221 m 468 avoid these rooms , Always a nice staff 
355526,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, One of our party got stuck in the elevator for over an hour as it lost power they couldn t get her out Then the whole of the 4th floor lost power and we had to maneuver around the room in complete darkness It was like this for hours So it wasn t a good experience especially when you are only there for 1 night , Location was good 
355527,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, A little noisy at night as you can hear people talking as they walk down the corridors, Comfy bed and the club lounge was great especially for a solo traveller
355528,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, The bed was possibly the most comfortable we ve ever slept in BBC1 on the telly which made a nice change Great location Close to the train station and sites Wonderful weekend stay here 
355529,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Staff goes through the hole check in procedure twice despite having already made that 1 hour ago wanted to bill my card twice for 75 euro deposit even Internet in the room needs 10 euro deposit to use and they call it free of charge Bad policy for such an expensive hotel , Great room and facilities in general Excellent location Quiet and confortable Nice room services 
355530,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No milk in the rooms for making tea coffee If you pay to have the club room facilities the bar is only open 5 30 9 30 not great times if you are out enjoying Amsterdam , Beds were really comfy as were the pillows so a great nights sleep A good location to access Amsterdam Staff very friendly and helpful 
355531,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Had to pay a 30 euro city tax at the end of stay which we were unaware off just add it to the price of hotel, Friendly staff warm welcome clean and excellent location
355532,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I didn t like having to pay additional 75 euro as a deposit when I checked in Also not being able to have breakfast in the restaurant and having to eat in the club room which didn t have as much choice, Bed was comfy room was spacious the club room was great the breakfast in restaurant had a really good choice Staff attentive
355533,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, There was a misunderstanding about breakfast I signed up for the room which includes breakfast but when I went down in the morning they said it doesn t include breakfast Luckily I had my booking printed out and showed the front office lady which states includes breakfast and they cleared the misunderstanding Also the tv was broken for 2 3 days with the red introduction screen from the hotel I mentioned it to the people in the lobby and allowed them to enter the room anytime because I was away anyway but when i came back it was still broken I got the 2 twin beds which was a bit disappointing because I was checking in alone but since the hotel was fully booked i can understand , the chocolate i get at night when i come back to the room The hotel location was quite nice Walking distance to central station dam square kalverstraat etc Nice food around the area too so its easy to get dinner Breakfast was quite nice for the first few days but it was the same thing everyday which kind of made it a bit boring 
355534,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, overpriced for the rooms the safe did not work required the curtains of the room because my view was the room opposite which had no privacy bathroom without hairdryer but it s all, great location comfortable beds and super friendly staff
355535,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, So many rooms Hard to find your room but that may have been down to 1 2 many wines ha , Location great Beds were unbelievably comfortable Staff lovely 
355536,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Sink plug didnt work in room safe constantly malfunctioned noise from trams passing frequently Upon arrival you have to pay 75 security deposit which wasnt mentioned previously refunded of course if not used at check out , Bed comfy navigator service good Bar area good Very clean Food good Express check out 12 noon check out time 
355537,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, the staff not helpful at all tried telling me i haven t paid upon arrival when i had then wanted a further 75 per night as a deposit what a joke they were not happy at all ,No Positive
355538,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The price per night is slightly expensive and the restaurant could offer more options for their set menu , Staff were very friendly and helpful beds were extremely comfortable and the entire hotel was always spotless 
355539,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Took so long to check in and out also no bar snack menu and on Sunday afternoon there was no one serving at the bar from 12 until 1am, Comfort of the beds were excellent
355540,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I ve stayed in this hotel 3 times last year liked it this year I requested 4 double rooms to be near to each other as it was my 40th birthday the reception staff were hopeless mixed all the rooms up gave 2 of the couples twin beds Location is fantastic but that s about it ,No Positive
355541,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The room was hot and small I could have opened a window but I was given a room on the second floor above a rather noisy street The above resulted in the price being rather high for the level of services received , I liked the location and the bed is really comfortable 
355542,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We booked a family room for 4 adults parents and 2 older children The bed size is a bit too small for 2 adults sharing , Location is perfect walking distance from central station and the dam 
355543,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Wifi should of been completely free in the room If you didn t pay for wifi then you had restrictions which I thought was a bit tight, Room was very clean spacious and comfy Staff were very charming helpful Location fantastic 
355544,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Lack of spa area pool sauna or hamam single bed could be a bit larger older tv only few channels, Great location good size room trendy decoration confortable linen good fitness
355545,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Central location with very helpful staff at reception I consider it was good value for money It was also very clean and quiet The breakfast was superb 
355546,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Room s cleaning is overall mediocre with dirty wallpaper spots on the floor carpet dust on furniture Unacceptable for a 200 per night hotel, Excellent position Common space well designed
355547,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I think the price is overrated the breakfast isn t included you need to pay for WiFi I wouldn t choose it again in this price The staff didn t try to do more than they needed , The location the room is ok but nothing outstanding 
355548,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Was bad smell out side of room like urine And in morning when in shower cleaner came in and walked out saying sorry an then walked back in 30seconds later while I was drying myself off witch left me feeling rather embarrassed,No Positive
355549,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, There is only Trt Turk turkish channel on tv but nobody watch this tv in turkey TRT1 Kanal D Star TV ATV should be there internet connection why there is no free wifi in the room hotel generally and the rooms and scossa ala carte restaurant was really cold in the room heating only 25 degree but was cold and i am sick now , location was good 
355550,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, There wasn t anything I could put my finger on that I didn t like, I fully enjoyed my stay and will always come back there whenever I m visiting Amsterdam
355551,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The staff members attutide when it came to payment wasnt good enough I was not shown a receipt invoice of the total amount which included city tax I then made a payment on my debit card which showed on my online banking as authorised I was told it did not go through despite seeing the money leave my account A friend then had to use her card As it stands we both have transactions from this hotel and I havent had the funds released back to my card I am not impressed at all and will contact my bank Also may I add they charge 19 euro for breakfast per person , I liked the location room size and cleanliness 
355552,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Not worth upgrading as larger Room was odd in shape with about 8 corners which is not my style and very dark with very poor view I did ask to move rooms but they said they had no other rooms available Was disappointed the only response I got was that other people liked the room and found it quirky If it is common feedback about the room shape they should let people know as had I seen a picture of this room I would not have booked , club lounge is really good 
355553,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Poor service overhaul at check in I requested help with my luggages I was told to go to my room and the luggage would follow but 30 mins later nothing I called but nothing happen so I had to go back to pick up my own luggage I was never helped very corporate environment the reception doesn t t make you feel welcome it rather feels like the reception of a hospital room service food was disgusting I ordered the burger the fish chips the mushroom soup and Mc Donald food is much better , Location is good close to central station 
355554,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Our room had no heating the bathroom windows were broken and the windows were so thin we couldn t sleep at all with all the noise The new years eve event was overpriced and overrated they didn t even have a countdown to midnight I also made the hotel aware that I am disabled and am using a wheelchair on and off yet the room they gave us had steps from the bathroom to the bed If this were a 3 hotel I would be understanding but it cost a lot of money for a very poor hotel stay for us unfortunately If you want your money to be spent appropriately there are many other hotels cheaper and better , It was in a central location and had friendly staff 
355555,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Hotel is like a labyrinth Cheaper the room harder to reach Rooms are cold Amenities limited for a 5 star , Good location Nice cafe Friendly personnel 
355556,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Having to pay a deposit when getting there and when checking out being told I m not getting all my deposit back which was never explained Was unable to control heating in the room Got a twin room instead of a double Television come at an extra cost and so did wifi in the rooms , We liked the location
355557,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, To expensive for the what the rooms actually are we payed around 420 for 2 nights and the room we had was very very small I d advise staying at a boutique hotel as you would probably get your money s worth, Great location right in the centre of everything 
355558,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, don t think the size of the room or the facilities reflect the price room was small and dark paid EUR 240 night for it Don t know how they are in business but won t come back , good location minutes away from amsterdam centraal station puts you right in the middle of the action if this is what you want
355559,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, A little bit expensive, Rooms are clean and modern the room service is fast and their apple tart is amazing The breakfast was fantastic you have a lot of choice the situation is perfect quiet but not far from the Centraal Station 
355560,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Quality of furniture Outdated rooms Bad smell in lobby and Corridors Bathrooms needed facelift, Location Delicious food at ground floor Resturant
355561,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The food and extra services were quite expensive so we did not eat there You pay extra for parking and wifi which I was not expecting , It was a lovely hotel and deserved all 5 stars we were well looked after 
355562,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, This is my 6th time staying in amsterdam and ive never had a bad hotel until now The reception area was lovely and that was about it As soon as we went up in the lift there was a funky smell and our room did not feel look or smell clean We went in a group of 6 lads and all of us have come up in bites and are really itchy from staying here I didn t even put my bed shorts on and decided to sleep fully clothed The room service was disgusting and also charged 5 for it to be delivered I ordered homemade chicken nuggets and they deliver some sort of slippery squid like stuff We were also then charged an extra 400 euro on top of our booking fee for city tax that was not stated on the website when booking also charged at their own currency rate This hotel is also very over priced concidering how unclean it was definitely not a 5 star and very over rated I will never be returning to this hotel and I would not recommend it to anyone ,No Positive
355563,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We booked a Deluxe Room online but when we checked in were told they only had a twin room or disabled room available The bed was a very small double and there was a lot of noise from the room above and hotel corridoor, Location is fantastic and very near to Centraal station nice shopping streets cafes and bars
355564,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I stayed at this hotel last year and had a fantastic experience This time was different however It started with being told that we would have to pay extra for Wi Fi access I find this disgusting especially from a hotel of this class When I questioned this I was told its because we booked through Booking com therefore implying that people are better off booking direct It got worse when we were taken to our rooms they were tiny dark and claustrophobic We stayed at this hotel last year and they were definitely not the same rooms Again we were told this is because we booked through Booking com We then decided to pay to get upgraded We were travelling with another couple so it was 2 rooms that were being upgraded we were told one was ready but the other would need more time which was all fine as we moved all our luggage into the one room and said we would go out and pick our key up to the new room on our return When we did return we were told that nothing had been done as we had not confirmed our request even though we had relinquished our old room etc Anyway the location is fantastic some of the rooms are great but if you want to go by the implications provided by their staff don t book through Booking com as you will get an inferior service Certainly not what I would expect from a hotel of this quality and class , The location is fantastic 
355565,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Beds was more comfortable than usual Smoking area located outside the hotel and sometime it become dangerous late at night They don t have a free Wi Fi ethir if you joined some kind of membership for free , the location was close to central station helpful staff for a visiting places advice A bit far from Dam square and Red Light streets which I like it that way 
355566,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The staff weren t great The barman on both evening was quite honestly offensive and appeared to make up the prices We were also woken up by a member of staff clutching a piece of paper at 8am in Amsterdam , Location and cleanliness but it should be because it was expensive 
355567,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, Couldn t fault anything The staff are amazing so helpful and treated us like VIPs The club lounge is a sanctuary very peaceful and calming Breakfast was excellent Our room was gorgeous and plenty of fresh linens 
355568,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The rooms are way way smaller than they advertised not up to the standards you come to expect from Marriott The one we got was more a closet than a room ,No Positive
355569,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Booking com is seen as third party to the hotel Eventhough the high amount of revenue created through your bookings The room was advertised on your website as a twin deluxe room and the bed preference was put as two However this was not honoured by the hotel I do appreciate it is subject to availability However I do feel if a twin room is not able to be allocated then the guest should be informed and on the marriott website twin rooms were available and obviously they were allocated to more important guests then booking Com It s is a shame as I am a returning guest to this hotel and it seems that when booking through booking com you are made to feel less important Which should not be the case as many times your rate is higher or on par to the hotels rates , The location of the hotel and senior management
355570,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Having to pay for wifi other than it been free in the lobby The bar prices are crazy 10 for glass of wine it wasn t anything special at that Family rooms were not as they advertised on website at all Disappointed with that, Location is very good Hotel is really lovely inside and is kept very well 
355571,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, You have to pay nearly 10eur for a wifi that doesn t work properly I forgot my toothbrush and the hotel had none to spare for me It s a good hotel but certainly not a 5 stars , Location is very nice Rooms are clean and showers are good 
355572,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Hotel stunk of Weed throughout our stay I complained to the hotel staff twice and didn t offer to move rooms or do anything to help not acceptable from a 5 star hotel should have stayed in a hostel and it would have probably smelt better I get it is in Amsterdam but they should police their no smoking policy more effectively and respond when a customer complains , Good location Nice rooms 
355573,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel,No Negative, The staff was very helpful and they always looked great They represented your property fabulously You guys should be proud of yourselves I always feel safe and well taken care of while staying with you in Amsterdam Jonathan Caine
355574,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I was asked to pay my bill when I checked in which I found strange but paid anyway and then when I checked out was accused of not paying When explaining I had the staff were extremely rude , Location room
355575,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The family rooms we stayed in was very far from reception and we were not told that we would need to get an addition internal lift to access these rooms , The location was good and the staff were helpful 
355576,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Had to wait for the room to get ready for quite a while although we indicated expected time of arrival Others who came later managed to get their rooms earlier We had to ask to change the room Superior Club room as first given room was poorly located isolated and in a corner part of the building , Location Internet Service
355577,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I didn t like that I had to pay for every channel on the Tv , My stay was wonderful The staff the cleanliness of the hotel just 5 minutes walk from the train station and ofcourse a fantastic location 
355578,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, One of Your concierge actually dented my rimova luggage I was really upset as it s an expensive steel luggage , Sarah your front desk personnel was really helpful She was great 
355579,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, The fact that there weren t any normal channels on the television to watch You had to pay for everything There wasn t a pool steam or sauna to compliment the hotel , I liked everything about the hotel The staff hygiene It was very organised to the highest standards 
355580,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I was in for short stay and was very difficult to say I have seen somthing I don t like, This was my first visit to I think the hotel location was excellent and the hotel as well from all aspects
355581,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, We were told we had a complementary breakfast with the Club Room but not told that this did not apply on the weekend , The location is great in the heart of the old city 
355582,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, You had to pay 21 99 to use the wifi in a 5star this should be free There were no slippers or robes like other 5star hotels, Location and hotel was great rooms are ok but bit small
355583,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, WIFI was for 24 hours but after logging in again had further 24 hrs with no charge Only thing we didn t like during the 3 days we were there was that it rained and rained the whole time but we still go out and saw what we wanted , The hotel was very handy to facilities we wanted Close to city centre so no need to catch taxis 
355584,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Club staff was not at all friendly at all in fact they seemed put out that people came in Two of them were even on the computers rather then working , Location was great 
355585,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, There is no high speed wifi in the room Hotel of your reputation must keep the world standard of IT connectivity by providing a free access of a high speed wifi for all guest especially in the rooms , The house keeping was good with a daily change of towels The friendliness of staffs especially at the front office and navigators are really excellange 
355586,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, having to complain about our room which e booked and paid well over normal price as a conference was in town they fobbed us off with a small room until i got very annoyed as it was our wedding anniversary too , I loved the location and clean spacious room even though we had to complain that we booked a club room and we got a broom cupboard to start with we were told it was our fault for booking when an international conference was on and the hotel was full they then moved us to a decent room staff very friendly except one misery a girl on reception with blondish hair and glasses
355587,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Found red light establishments spreading near the hotel Families with children might find it problematic , The location is nice and quite and close to the central train station dam square and the shopping locations The staff are helpful and friendly 
355588,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, No free WiFi Check in receptionists were not very helpful with general questions but Navigator staff was , Location clean and comfortable room gym
355589,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, Although hotel is relatively expensive no free wifi in rooms and no complimentary coffee in am This may sound like small stuff but a few reasonable amenities make for a happier customer Likewise the breakfast at the main restaurant was ridiculously overpriced 27 for cold breakfast buffet and 30 for hot The concierge was not helpful when we asked about restaurant reservations for dinner in city , The room was average size and nicely furnished Clean and comfortable temperature Nice bar and excellent bartender When the fitness center was reopened last 2 days of our stay it was excellent The temporary fitness room was adequate 
355590,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, reception is so slow for both check in coming back later to get room key and check out There were 2 people working and it is a hub hotel it seems for cruise ships Surely they can gauge traffic and add some manpower 15 min wait to get my room key Also the door handle in bathroom was lose and came off so we pushed it back on EUR460 a night for a quad after more service , really good location and very comfortable beds 
355591,Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel, I made resveration wrong date as I would visit in August but they charged me and didn t agree me to cancel the resveration That is disappointed , Breakfast is wonderful
