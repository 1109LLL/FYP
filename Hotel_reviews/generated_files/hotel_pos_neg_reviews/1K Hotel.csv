43148,1K Hotel, Air conditioning in room didn t work and despite complaining wasn t fixed Carpets walls and public areas all felt dated and in need of refurbishment Was perhaps a 4 star hotel once but not anymore, Location good close to le Marais and 3e arrondissement Fitness room not great but adequate
43149,1K Hotel, On a main street so can hear the traffic booked double room but bed was 2 single beds pushed together , Comfortable beds welcoming staff cleanliness was very good
43150,1K Hotel, The carpet in the lobby and elevator appeared to be dirty all the time , The hotel is good The personal was nice and the installation very good The breakfast time interval excellent 
43151,1K Hotel, The location is very noisy as it is on a main boulevard Also the showers are impossible to use unless hand held i e you can t stand underneath them as they are not properly fixed , Great location almost next to the metro station a ten minute metro journey to the centre of Paris
43152,1K Hotel, The location while close to the center is still quite far away from the main attractions Rooms are nice but common spaces have a very dark and boring design , Nice staff clean rooms with a decent service Close to metro and bus to reach the main tourist areas of the city but not much else nearby Well equipped gym that almost nobody uses 
43153,1K Hotel, The shower bath didn t have a curtain or glass to stop the water from over splashing out over flowing so we had to use towels to clean up the mess on the floor after each shower however the bathroom was a nice size and very clean , The position for public transport was excellent the metro is right there So we could get around Paris super easy the room was very small but had everything we could need the staff where very helpful and even arranged to change our room as the first one was on the road and we like to open our windows at night while we sleep There where quick to change and the new room was perfect they had an awesome restaurant on the premises and a funky little night club at the back which was an awesome surprise 
43154,1K Hotel, It is expensive for what you are getting No support from front desk when asked about activities Rental of tennis court and bicycles , Room design was very nice good bed and nice bathroom However showering in the bathtub is a bit old fashioned Plus the shower head holder didn t work All in all ok room
43155,1K Hotel,No Negative, The staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful Room was quite spacious for Europe our room faced the courtyard which was nice and allowed us to leave our window open at night The location is excellent metro station is just outside lot s of good restaurants in walking distance We really enjoyed the La Marais district it s safe and close to most major sites I would definitely stay here again 
43156,1K Hotel, Swimming pool above us on roof very noisy No door on toilet area Water in tub never got hot although it did in the shower Very limited room service menu, Very friendly staff Nice breakfast buffet Clean modern room
43157,1K Hotel, The only thing I missed was a large bottle of water in the room This in itself is a big compliment to this hotel , A nice small hotel in the 3rd arrondissement which is a great area to explore with lots of small restaurants nice bars The market place in the area is an absolute must go to grab an amazing lunch amongst the Parisiens The staff in the hotel is without exception all very polite and ensure your stay will be very comfortable The rooms are equipped with large comfortable beds and the bathroom has got all one needs when traveling 
43158,1K Hotel, The wifi was very patchy throughout Only stayed a night so I wasn t too fussed about it , Great location Wonderful hotel Loved the lizard in the lobby Room was spacious and very comfortable 
43159,1K Hotel, Got stuck in the elevator and the personnel didn t even apologize or try to make itup to us The very next day some people also got stuck I honestly expect it to be repaired right away , The location is great very central and easy access to the public transportation The fitness center is just a small room but adequate if you know what to do with the equipment The food was an amazing experience 
43160,1K Hotel, Besides the bedroom very pleasant clean with great free wifi the overall decor is terrible nightclub meets Peruvian very dark and a bit on the cheap side Bathroom has no emergency alarm nor plug for hair dryer Staff helpful but quite confused , Quiet
43161,1K Hotel, i found everything perfect, huge rooms beautiful natural light big lobby i stayed in three different hotels on the same trip to paris and found that this hotel was the best by far even though the other ones were more expensive and better ranked 
43162,1K Hotel, The toilet in our room had no door part of the design but a bit much for those who are shy , The lighting in the rooms were my favourite it was just a lovely extra touch 
43163,1K Hotel, While we were there in January the heating system for the restaurant was not working so Dinner there was a frigid experience Not fun as it was a very cold January , The staff were excellent very accommodating and knowledgeable The location is also great very close to the Metro and in the Marais yet quite close Le Bastille 
43164,1K Hotel, It could have been more comfortable The beds were so hard The heater was not working and the wifi was not working practically Breakfast is very weak , The staff is helpful 
43165,1K Hotel, No room service menus left in the room or do not disturb signs left either Cleaners were also quite loud , Nice rooms good size Amazing location would definitely stay again and have stayed before 
43166,1K Hotel, elevator a bit archaic slow and moody , The location is ideal close to metro and taxi Very clean and large rooms quiet good value for money decent breakfast
43167,1K Hotel, None of their deluxe rooms have a good view and when I am saying that is that you will actually see a very large wall of some other building in front of ur window no matter the level u are staying at Of course the rooms look way bigger than what u see in the pictures They will never make a refund even they lied u by showing those beautiful pictures and never wrote about the horrible view We were deeply disappointed Totally not a place for a romantic holiday They have parties in the lobby and even u are at last floor u can hear them The restaurant seems to be always empty and breakfast looks very poor and uneintresting Just 50 meters down the street are 2 excellent restaurants worth trying so why u will stay in an empty space with the almost nothing on the plate , Close to the beautiful streets and some good restaurants around
43168,1K Hotel, Small things that werent in order like a broken light no mini bar price list streaming to tv option did not work elevator broken Nothing really bad but not perfect Staff offered me free breakfast for the inconvienience though Good solition Also the interior design concept a mix between peruvian and design was kind of lost on me , Cool speak easy cocktailbar Great location for shopping restaurants and Republique subway station is a great hub to take you in any direction 
43169,1K Hotel, Bed was hard as a rock Room service was odd I asked for tea before bed and was told only one person was on staff downstairs at the front desk so It could not be delivered and I would need to come downstairs to pick up my tea I got dressed to go pick it up and the guy was coming out of the elevator with the tea Mini bar was not stocked the entire trip No iron or coffee machine in the room and no complementary water in the room TV kept cutting out One of the towel heaters was broken Called for a wake up call for my departure since I had an early flight Thank god I set my alarm the wake up call was 20 minutes late The elevator smells strongly like urine I had to hold my nose everytime I took it ,No Positive
43170,1K Hotel, Both lifts out of order i was on 1st floor but there 5 floors No water in the mini bar over a 4 day stay , Location is great central walking distance to Marais district front desk staff very friendly 
43171,1K Hotel, Tell nearly always the same I need always hanger and shelves in a hotel room no offense , Good location and reasonable price of the room This hotel is on a bissy street so wonderful what the big windows isolated traffic sounds Very friendly staff Best coffee we had in Paris for breakfast 
43172,1K Hotel, Location This is an expensive hotel set to 4 stars BUT the hotel and its services does not justify the price Although it was indicated that its located in the Marais area they failed to mention it was in the outskirts of it Services and Staff The room service didn t apply the basic needs such as toilet paper The breakfast was very poor The buffet offered low range of products and their amount was relatively small The manager of the hotel claimed that we were supposed to ask one of the employees to add more from fridge since it s a small hotel and they can t put it all outside poor and unconvincing excuse in my opinion and generally speaking it felt like they were cheap about everything they offered Interior Design The hotel interior s was depressing dark and unfriendly Rank In one word DISAPPOINTING I would highly recommended not to go there 4 , 
43173,1K Hotel, I didn t like leaving , The staff where amazing especially phillipe who checked us in nothing seemed to be a problem for them and they seemed to be able to answer our questions before we could ask them 10 10 best hotel I ve ever used 
43174,1K Hotel, The room service was very expensive small portions and lacking in flavor, My room was nice and big for Paris and very modern and clean The area is great with loads of nice restaurants and close to Republique
43175,1K Hotel, floors are slate and there are no slippers provided its freezing when you get up in the morning or in the middle of the night not the end of the world though, big spacious rooms
43176,1K Hotel, Floor was dirty needed to constantly remind them to clean the used glass and refill coffee machine Food from room service was VERY bad and so was presentation No salt and pepper no bread no glass of water Noisy sound on weekends , Staff was very friendly Convenient bar with lively atmosphere Great location 
43177,1K Hotel, Couldn t think of anything , The excellent reception service who were very accommodating and friendly Hotel decor is quirky features on the cover of Hip Hotels 
43178,1K Hotel, Hottest week in the year and we had to request a change of room as the air conditioning wasn t working in the first room we were given and we could not leave the windows open as the music in the next door bar was so loud Air conditioning wasn t working in the second room we were offered either Third room was fine very nice in fact , Friendly and helpful staff Very clean Quiet room after we complained about the first not so quiet room we were given 
43179,1K Hotel, Whilst I would stay again There were lots of small problems which this hotel should aim to improve There was only a curtain on one of the two windows one was simply missing The TV could not get reception and I couldn t turn it off so the room was never dark There was simply not enough shower gel provided just 1 small tube per day just sufficient for 1 shower The reception is staffed 24 hrs but they shut the door sometime after midnight and there is no night bell So on two occasions I had to wait outside for about 15 minutes before reception noticed I was outside , The hotel is in a great location my room was very comfortable and large for Paris The bathroom was well sized with a large bath tub The room rate when I stayed was also very good value for money I liked the decor of the hotel and they have gone to some effort to have clean modern rooms 
43180,1K Hotel, Floor was dusty It should have been cleaned before our arrival although we arrived around 6pm which is long after official check in time , Location design concept of the hotel and the size of the rooms especially knowing how small are the hotel rooms in Paris 
43181,1K Hotel, As it was a base I think you done good , Very easy to access the centre Friendly and helpful staff A little poor for breakfast but we were late down I loved the theme Thanks for having us 
43182,1K Hotel, the bed is awful lot s of noise from the frame the shower broked entrance not welcoming elevator and the Corridors is so disgusting, The location it s the only reason i staid there otherwise there is nothing else make you to go there maybe also the size of the room
43183,1K Hotel, Breakfast and any extras expensive Breakfast 18 euros per person not even eggs served Bed was built on some kind of altar very dangerous with risk of hitting feet Hallways dark and always cluttered with cleaners trollies beds etc , Great location for visiting Paris
43184,1K Hotel, Saturday night seemed to be disco night full bore until 3 00am totally unacceptable little apology All the clever trendy things in the room were not working or impossible to use Air conditioning very noisy and uncomfortable loose tiles on the floor safe didn t work shower hose had to be hand held etc This hotel needs some tender loving care , Room size was very good 
43185,1K Hotel, The breakfast is not brilliant value for money but it is good , The staff were lovely and the location was fantastic The rooms are very modern but have everything you need Great showers 
43186,1K Hotel, Breakfast start 7am too late for me Some noise in the evening from their restaurant and bar Corridors elevator too dark Old style keys if you loose it you pay it and they don t have a double , Modern room decoration Enough space in the room Location Clean Kind personal
43187,1K Hotel, Scandalously overpriced breakfast poor choice Utterly disappointing Don t have breakfast there but rather somewhere around , Location staff friendliness
43188,1K Hotel, As animal lovers we weren t too sure if the pet lizards were that happy in their glass enclosure in the lobby don t lizards need sunlight , Rooms were large bright and clean 2 sinks in bathroom and lots of mirrors Good lighting and lots of well lit wardrobe space Good room temp control options Friendly and helpful staff and good service at breakfast Lovely selection of food for breakfast and not too busy Well located being minutes from subway and a few stops from Gare du Nord 
43189,1K Hotel, The door to the room and the door frame were not tight so it there was a lot of noise coming into the room from the hallway Neighbours cleaning etc , The staff at the hotel offered a supperior service They were very helpful and effective in all matters 
43190,1K Hotel, Very small hotel for its price and rating of 4 stars Way below what was expected Old lifts narrow corridors tiny nearly none existent lobby, Modern design room Was given a upgrade on arrival Clean
43191,1K Hotel, No air conditioning so the room could get quite warm at night and if you opened the windows it can get quite noisy from the traffic outside , Loved everything The staff are really helpful venue and location is superb and everything was of a high standard We were made to feel very welcome food was great and the rooms are amazing I will definitely stay here again 
43192,1K Hotel, I asked for a quiet room with a bathtub but the TV was not working in this room so I had to change and the new room had a shower and was facing the street so there was a lot of noise during the night and I couldn t sleep very well So noisy Room service I asked for a snack and all they could propose was the day s Special which was pretty particular insects However they suggested some cheese but it was not possible to have a regular snack I thought this was pretty annoying after a long day travelling AND the issue with the first room The rooms are fine but I think there could be some improvement to be made it seems like they focused all their attention on the design of the restaurant bar rather than the hotel rooms which is a shame However the staff was very nice and helpful I can t deny it, The location is great In the Marais area between Republique Bastille Very convenient
43193,1K Hotel, Room was quite loud due to main road traffic Breakfast was a little overpriced for what was offered Breakfast staff were a little hostile , Room was very clean good facilities available 
43194,1K Hotel, I got stuck in the elevator which was quite scary , I enjoyed the new design of this hotel it has a very interesting theme yet the bedrooms are spacious neat and sleek It is perfectly located at the entrance of Le Marais and I walked everywhere I did not use the tube or a cab once I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel Worth it 
43195,1K Hotel, Very dark corridors a design feature and a rather dilapidated restaurant with a poor breakfast Also the screen over the bath was nowhere near the shower so water went all over the bathroom when I took a shower , Central location and stylish comfortable bedroom
43196,1K Hotel, 4 There is no coffee and tea maker facilities Price expensive compared with the nearby 4 star hotels without breakfast , The room is clean Great TV Internet good
43197,1K Hotel, The shower was wird You have to seat in the bathtub to shower otherwise you would make a huge mass in the bathroom For a elderly person it would be really complicated , The location was just perfect close to a metro station as well as walking distance from good restaurants bars and stores The room was big and very comfortable
43198,1K Hotel, There were some issues with the shower and the water faucets and frankly being able to understand how they work properly It would ve been better if there were some more English speaking channels on the television cable network , TVs are very good at all and 3 D A lot more space for the value in this hotel versus a place like the Crowne Plaza 
43199,1K Hotel, While the design concept is quirky and unusual it does have some practical drawbacks e g dark lifts dark corridors including objects to trip over noisy air conditioning or water sounds effects couldn t tell which was causing the noise , Location is fine quirky interior design concept
43200,1K Hotel, Staff is badly organized Value for money is poor a design hotel with cheap furniture night side table wheel broke of lighting concept is inadequate only one lift worked during our stay we were on the 5th floor The Halloween party in the lobby was a disaster we waited to order a drink for halve an hour since it took the bar tender about 30 minutes for two drinks he was also all alone to serve the entire bar When we finally could order they didn t have mint to make Mochitos we pointed out to them that there was mint but then they didn t have knives to cut the limes so again we waited for 15 minutes In between a waitress took an order for a Cuba Libre but it never was served The bar was messy and the staff clearly totally overburdened This hotel is way too expensive for what they have to offer , The location of the hotel 
43201,1K Hotel, Very noisy at night the hotel has a restaurant that stays open and play loud music until 2am making impossible to rest we had to exchange room at 2am Elevators were broken at check in and check out 5 floors up and down No AC only heater No kingsize bed it was 2 single beds united not comfortable Shower design is terrible it s very small and open and the bathroom floor is always soaked due this poorly layout Hotel was in maintenance in the morning again making impossible to rest due noise Horrible experience would not recommend it , Good location and next to the metro Good decoration and good space in room Staff is friendly 
43202,1K Hotel, The Pitch dark corridors and lifts I stayed at 1K with my friend from 7 11 august Our otherwise excellent stay was marred by a disturbing accident whichI wanted to share as I feel it poses a risk for serious injury The corridors are pitch dark with no light On my my girlfriend s last day of stay in Paris we were returning to our room it was the last room at the far end of the corridor and due to darkness she couldn t see and judge the end of the corridor kept walking and walked into the end of corridor wall door hitting her face hard and falling to the ground with bleeding swollen nose Being a doctor I could see the nose fractured I called the staff straightaway they brought some ice right away But no follow up calls were made by the staff to enquire about my friend s wellbeing or to offer any assistance in finding out if she needed medical assistance in a foreign for us city I am Australian and my friend is Belgian Due to this accident my Belgian friend who was to leave for Brussels that evening Had to cancel her Trip back to Brussels and stayed an extra night As we didn t feel she was okay to travel with the swollen nose face and a risk of developing concussion from the head injury She had a nose fracture but we were thankful that there was no concussion It took few weeks for her nose to heal The hotel staff did put a lamp outside in the corridor but it was gone the next day As a medical doctor I feel its not safe to have such degree of darkness in the corridors I have stayed at similar themed hotels around the world with dark corridors but this is a new level of darkness they usually have the room numbers illuminated which provide some light to see and find the room I understand the hotel has a theme and the dim lighting is a big part of the styling There should be some light atlas for safety purposes so that no one else suffers in future , The excellent sophisticated baths and the oh so comfy bed 
43203,1K Hotel, Noise Construction during the day music from hotel s own lounge until after midnight , Spacious room for paris standards king sizee bed lux bath

43211,1K Hotel, THe variety of breakfast menu could be better in order to attract guest to have breakfast in the hotel with the price provided American and continental breakfast can be options for the future We did not have breakfast in the hotel because of this but maybe it is only taste issue , Great service upon arrival Elisa and Diogo were very friendly and professional They managed to explain details of the hotel This is brand new hotel for 1 year now with great concept We stayed for 4 nights and feel so comfortable with the large bed they have It is highly recommended if your preference is Le Marais district The hotel has great concept Bright rooms and with dark coridors Fabulous front desk and reservation hotel staffs
