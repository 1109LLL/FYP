493136,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan,No Negative, Friendly staff at reception that were very accommodating and knowledgeable We received a free room upgrade to the business class room excellent rooms The tram and train station are almost put the door and connect you to Milan central with ease 
493137,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, No shuttle service to airport Expensive fixed rate of 95 euros by taxi or private car to airport that can be arrange by the hotel Not a lot of open places shops restaurants around the hotel area, Staff were friendly Rooms comfortable Location is accessible to major sites by bus or train 
493138,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, The staff can afford a smile , The rooms are really good Spacious and quite comfortable We also got an upgrade to a suite for no extra cash Close to a bus to town and not far from airport in Linate 
493139,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, On the second stay Nespresso capsules were not automatically replaced at the suite But done immediately under request , Special attention at the reception about a specific request Giannandrea was very kind to honor the request even though was not guaranteed Those little things make you go back to the hotel next time 
493140,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Very difficult to get downtown There is not metro but needs to make a few changes to go downtown When I arrived I was not asked if I wanted a bath or shower and was assigned a bath which caused that I had to change room Staff at breakfast not so friendly the manager lady was not so helpful I had asked for poached eggs and after 15 min when I asked for this I was told the machine did not work No consideration whatsoever for the customer , Big room nicely decorated
493141,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Again this is a particular beef of mine having travelled for many years staying in high end accommodation around the world For some travellers like myself l choose a particular hotel because of its amenities In this instance l chose the Radisson Blu which is not ideally located nor close to any great features for the fact it had a pool Given the time of year you would think that is one amenity the hotel would have available I was disappointed to learn on arrival that the pool would be closed for the duration of my stay due to maintenance Don t get me wrong l am all for maintenance I understand maintenance it needs to be planned and organised to keep everything nice and working well I also believe management of hotels have an obligation to inform guests well in advance at the time of scheduling maintenance that a certain feature won t be available so that guests as is their right can choose to stay somewhere else In my case l would have cancelled my booking and booked elsewhere It goads me that hotels feel it s just OK to put some sign on their counter and apologise for any inconvenience That is simply not good enough Even if it can t be helped management could offer a free drink to compensate or a reduced rate given the rate is based on the hotel s amenities It s a bit like ordering a car with heating and finding it doesn t have it because maintenance was being carried out in the heating component area I m sure management at the Radisson Blu will shrug their shoulders and do nothing as l ve noticed with high end hotels in the past That s cool l ve come to expect that but if l can put 1 2 people off staying there then l have achieved my objective , In fairness the hotel s business room was nice though it wasn t vacuumed on the second day of my stay nor were the coffee tea items restocked nor was a bottle of free water provided on the second night of my stay The gym was good allowed for two workouts with some variety and the breakfast menu was sufficient 
493142,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, It s very far away from the city center The local bus takes you all the way to the center and close to Duomo but it does take a good 30 40 minutes to get there We were also unfortunate to not be able to use the swimming pool for 3 days of our 5 day stay due to maintenance But we were informed that it was an unforeseen maintenance meaning we couldn t get any of the money back even though that was the selling point , The hotel is very clean and the staff is knowledgeable Nice gym area together with sauna and indoor pool 
493143,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Location but if you want to stay in a quiet area and away from the city center it s a good choice There are tram and rail station near the hotel ,No Positive
493144,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, When the room was cleaned the dirty coffee mugs from the previous day weren t swapped out for clean ones , Very nice bathroom the shower was especially good 
493145,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, I loved just about everything about the hotel The only thing I wasn t particularly fond of was that during breakfast 10 15 minutes prior to the end of the service the wait staff informed us repeatedly that breakfast would be ending shortly This was to imply that my partner and I should leave soon While I understood I expected Italian hospitality to be a bit more relaxed seeing as they would be cleaning up the space for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour after the service ends In any case still great food with great selection and a lovely atmosphere , The hotel is beautiful The service was generally great and the food was fantastic The room was large and spacious and the gym pool was a great perk Perfect hotel if you don t mind a 20 30 minute commute by bus and or subway into the city centre 
493146,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, The location is great solely for business purposes or for travelers with a car The neighborhood is quiet and safe but VERY remote from the center it takes 1 hour on foot to get to the closest tourist attraction With public transport its 20 minutes but it is rather uncomfortable Taxi costs around 15 , Amazing stuff cheerful and always willing to help The design of the hotel was quite good it was really pleasant to stay there All the facilities are extra clean

493150,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, We just so happened to have a handicap friendly room or else there would have been no stand up shower Breakfast was expensive I ended up upgrading my room to include breakfast Some of the guests were obnoxiously loud in the hallways We had the do not disturb sign on our door and the front desk called at 7am asking if we want the room clean thus disturbing us anyway The restaurant opens really late for dinner which was a bummer having travelled all day it would have been nice to grab a meal around 5 530 pm , The hotel is about a 5 minute walk for an amazing very authentic Italian restaurant and close to the train making it easy to get around 
493151,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, The parking was a bit odd You have to check in before you can drive to the underground parking Without the room key card you cannot open the door to the garage and the garage is at least 150 m from the hotel reception It s not so clearly marked and if you reach late in the evening like we did could be a bit confusing , It was a really nice hotel with friendly and supportive staff Good location and nice pool Though the view wasn t so great given that it s the middle of the city it was a nice hotel The junior suite was spacious and comfortable The bathrooms were fantastic and spacious Breakfast was excellent as well with a lot of varieties

493171,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, The water in the swimming pool was fairly cold it was kind of disappointing to see that the men s Suana Steam Room was separated from the Women s one obviously being a couple staying here we would of liked to enjoy this experience together rather than alone or with strangers , The bed is so comfy the staff are so no nice helpful 
493172,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Staff did not communicate what was included in the suite s costs and therfore I feel the suite was overpriced Location is awful at the price Parking is expensive , Great deluxe rooms and very good breakfast
493173,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, The hotel was a bit out of the way of city but was easy enough to reach with a 5 minute walk to the nearest train station and a 2 stop train to the main city , The staff at the Radisson were so polite helpful and friendly We had to book this hotel on the day we arrived in Milan due to complications with our other hotel and they couldn t have been more helpful The gentleman who served us when we first arrived was very patient with us knowing how tired we were after the day we d had The breakfast was lovely they had a very wide variety of foods drinks and the staff in the restaurant were very friendly and smiley Would definitely definitely book here again

493175,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Breakfast has so much variety but did turn my stomach a little Im very sensitive to freshness of food , So comfortable and clean great value for money 
493176,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Can be noisy in the night outside because of the road and some weird noises happen sometimes and I think that because of the industrial area near by , Very good hotel with nice facilities The hotel near a tram link to the city centre and there is two train stations within walking distance to the hotel Any one traveling to and from malpensa airport there is bovisa train station within walking distance to the hotel or you even can get a taxi The Villapozine train station serves trains to lake como as well

493181,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Heating in rooms uncontrollable and stuck at 25 celsius Had to sleep with windows doors ajar Bar prices and food prices overly expensive, Spacious bedrooms and facilities
493182,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, I booked a double room with breakfast included When we arrived there they told us that the breakfast buffet wasn t included at the room price and that we had to pay 35 per person per day in order to eat breakfast Their heating was not enough so it would take a lot of time to heat the room up But the most important is that we read in the description that the hotel was 10 minutes away from the city center but in reality it was 35 minutes Also the pool was not what we expected from the pictures Furthermore we were unsatisfied with the hotel bar because it was extremely expensive For example a cup of coffee and a bottle of water 1L costed us 10 We weren t satisfied from this hotel and I would not recommend it for your stay in Milan , The staff was friendly and polite They also helped us a lot by giving us all the information we needed

493188,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Housekeeping need training Every day we had to request replenishment of milk which should be automatic The steam room was nowhere near the right temperature and the pool is cramped if more than 3 people attempt to swim There are cheaper and good quality restaurants nearby as the hotel restaurant and bar are expensive , Well equipped room and the bed was extremely comfortable The bed linen was top quality which added to the comfort The room was spotless

493191,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, I had booked a non smoking room and the first room I was given was a smoking room This was however sorted out swiftly The staff in the reception gave different kind of information about the public transportation and the area When we asked second time we got a nice map where the take aways were marked The sauna in the spa area had a broken step which felt a bit scary Also the showers in the spa area didn t seem very clean and the pool steps lacked a hand rail , A room mix up was fixed promptly The room was very clean and comfortable

493200,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, When checking out a staff helped us order a taxi however he ordered a regular saloon even though he could see we had two rooms four persons and four suitcases saloon car was too small , Excellent staff service particularly during check in at the restaurant and breakfast

493207,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, The artwork on the wall it s not to everyone s taste Also breakfast was ridiculously expensive so we didn t have it A little far from the centre of Milan so not always easy to get back late after a night out or to leave early for a flight , Clean room nice furniture and decor lovely bathroom with tub and shower separate Staff very friendly and helpful when needing things printed Not far from the train station 
493208,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan,No Negative, It was nice to have hotel s own parking place as we took our own car Very spacious room for the business class but little cold Even we adjusted room temperature to 26 degrees Nespresso machine was nice So we enjoyed using it We were wondering why hotel did not have any order for omelet Then our last breakfast at the hotel they set the memo on the table that guests can order it It seems they just started to serve egg meals 
493209,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan,No Negative, Apart from not picking the breakfast option this was a great stay To get from Malpensa airport to the hotel we used the metro which wasn t difficult as the lines are numbered Although you can get the overground to the hotel which takes 35 minutes Hotel staff were fab informative and helpful Would stay here again Not many places to eat around the hotel but there is a small essential store near the hotel 
493210,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan,No Negative, hotel was beautiful elegant and clean and the staff were extremely helpful they couldn t do enough for you Rooms nicely decorated with gorgeous bathroom The bath was huge and the separate shower was very powerful The rooms had everything you needed TV Safe Hairdryer UK Adapter in the safe good quality irons available We had a lovely Balcony too Staff English was great and they couldn t do enough for you Bar Small for the size of the hotel but it wasn t busy and had a lovely atmosphere Pool didn t use it but it looked GORGEOUS Although not right in the centre it was in a good location in that just around the corner there was a supermarket and some cafes that were all very cheap if you are on a budget 
493211,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, We got a smoker s room we couldn t get another as the hotel was fully booked but we would have appreciated a remark upon check in It takes a while to get in the city center but the tram station is right in front of the hotel , Very spacious room great design very good breakfast buffet
493212,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan,No Negative, The room was very comfortable the food was amazing very clean hotel with good facilities and a great staff I would definitely book this hotel again Loved it 
493213,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Location is a bit far from city center air conditioning was not the best and also pillows not comfortable , Breakfast was great food at the restaurant also good facilities good enough 
493214,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Reception could be a bit more friendly , The quality of products for breakfast is very high The room was hu uge very very clean bed is soft silence 
493215,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, I chose this hotel for a city break and i was disappointed compared to other hotels at same star level in different countries First at my arrival they asked for my card to block the amount for the staying the actual pay being done at the end at the checkout After some minutes when my bank announced me on my phone on the amount blocked i realised it was 30 euros over the price I had to go back at the reception to find out they charge 20 over the actual price of staying in case you d consume from the room bar I think this is something you need to specify when asking for my card so i don t have to come back and ask for details That s really poor customer service Then i realised there were no slippers or bath robe in the room in a hotel that offers pool and sauna for free so i had to go back again and ask about it They sent slippers to my room free of charged but i was informed the bath robe was just for luxuries room So in a 4 stars hotel you need a luxury room to get a bath robe And about the sauna i had to find out on the spot that sauna is actually separated for men and women and they are to be found in the lockers for each gender I could survive that though i find it weird but the steam sauna i used was unclean and on the ceiling you could see very bad dampness to the point i was wondering if that is safe for my health And also nearly to be called a steam sauna as i had to stay for 20 minutes to have a feeling of a steam sauna And now comes the prices which are way than expensive 7 euros for a small bottle of local bear and 25 euros for a breakfast At the end of my staying i had the sensation that this was just an overpriced place with no service for the money attitude I noticed that hotel usual replies to each comment but unfortunately they don t actually acknowledge the feedback nor improves , Rooms are big and clean Personnel is pleasant and professional 
493216,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, The temperature in the room was quite hot but we ve noticed that is common in Europe Upon request the staff adjusted the thermostat for us overnight , The room was very nice large and clean WiFi worked perfectly and the staff were very friendly and helpful Convenient tram into town 
493217,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Breakfast was not really good The taps and door handles were not really clean The staff are not really friendly The internet connection was poor The location is far from the center without a car it s difficult to reach there , The deign is different and innovative
493218,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Ridiculous prices for in house services breakfast 25 for basically coffee plus simple bites if you want a fried egg it s 10 extra I travel a lot internationally I have never seen this kind of price level in this segment anywhere Bar 7 50 for a beer of course the place was deserted It feels like you are being forced out to look elsewhere for anything else than sleeping , Clean and modern
493219,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, Location was a bit out of the way but relatively simple to get into town by bus train or tram Area is a little bit dodgy at night though so not great if you re on your own Hotel seems to be mainly targeting corporates and seminars but just means better value if you re willing to be off the main track , Very friendly welcoming and informative staff Great room and amenities Very comfortable bed 
493220,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, The shower was horrible almost no water coming out The pool supposed to be heated but it was very very cold , friendly staff good breakfast parking outside free 
493221,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan,No Negative, Everything the location is quite convenient the room superb the breakfast great with excellent choice of food and drinks the staff very welcoming 
493222,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, The staff was too cold or maybe shy The breakfast was very expensive we do not use to eat so much in the morning and we gave up to have it There was nobody at the bar to ask for a cup of coffee and a brioche We do not appreciate the policy of charging a higher price at our check in even if we know that the balance is refunded at our check out I presume it is an usual policy in several hotels , The hotel is comfortable and you can surely get different useful services 
493223,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, House keeping could have been better Glasses weren t cleaned on a couple of occasions and towels not replaced I had to ask for shower gel as it wasn t replaced Air conditioning wasn t working and winter quilts were on the beds It was very warm and uncomfortable at night , The breakfast was excellent The bar staff waiters were very friendly and courteous 
493224,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, All good , Gaja and the staff I was injured on my holiday and had to spend 3 days in the hotel waiting for a return flight Gaja excuse spelling made a terrible situation much better Please thank her for both my husband and myself 
493225,Radisson Blu Hotel Milan, This hotel property is located in a suburb of Milan about a 30 minute trolley car ride to the city center For the d cor location and services provided I thought it was a bit pricey If I was rating it by German hotel standards I would put it somewhere between standard and first class that is about 3 5 stars , Very friendly helpful and professional staff
