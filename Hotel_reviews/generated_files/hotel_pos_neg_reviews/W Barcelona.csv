412777,W Barcelona, The really high prices few staff members not very accommodating , The view more often than not friendly staff the food the wifi and definitely the sky rooms 
412778,W Barcelona, Check in can be a wait They say 4pm but I heard people were still waiting for their rooms at 7pm I waited a couple of hours but it was ready by 4pm so I cannot complain Value for money is questionable especially on the breakfast I believe 33 euros per person for the buffet is a bit over the top Staff professionalism could be improved although they do have to put up with some rude clientele which is often unnecessary The staff seemed quite stretched low on numbers in the outside areas Obtaining a sun bed can be very difficult People arrive early to put towels on the sun beds and then disappear for a couple of hours I think the staff should monitor this more closely and remove the towels after a curtain amount of time , Comfortable newly refurbished rooms Excellent location for the beach The gym facilities are great very well maintained with a lot of equipment The lower pool area is nice for sitting in the sun and relaxing The upper pool area does not receive much sunlight in the afternoon as the hotel blocks the sunlight A good selection of food is served in the outside area The wet deck parties on Sunday evenings are quite lively free for guests I will book again next year 
412779,W Barcelona, Overpriced but it was a once in a lifetime experience Cleanliness at the vanity could be done better the vanity amenities packets of soaps cotton pads had an oily residue on it minor issue but I expected better from a W hotel , Automatic and electric curtains and TV mount Bos Bluetooth speakers in room rain shower was amazing and made up for lack of bath tub mini bar was extravagant and plentiful 
412780,W Barcelona, During my stay a terrible in de Ymir happened During the night of 20 07 my child vomited on her sheets and covers The next morning I removed the sheets and placed them outside of the room next to the cleaning trolley ON THE FLOORwhich was far away from my room my room was 334 and the trolley Next to room 331 On my return to the hotel at night I found the same sheets back in my room Disgusting I was offered breakfast in return My check out took very long My bell included a tequila costing 229 Imagine we don t even drink alcohol Apparently they didn t reAlize that we just moved the bottles to the table away from my child The experience is questionablel , The atmosphere Family friendly
412781,W Barcelona, There s no hotel in the world that would charge 5 euros for room service it s abseloutely inconvenient For example If somebody wants to order yogurt they will add besides the vaat and the amount of the yogurt another 5 euro for bringing the plate to the room plus there is no varitey in the food menu,No Positive
412782,W Barcelona, The restaurants in the hotel were frequently booked out for private events We occupied 4 rooms for a week and could only book one lunch at Bravo restaurants We were met with a very unfriendly staff at Bravo the only unfriendly place in the hotel who just cut us of it s fully booked They never tried to suggest alternatives totally uninterested One should have been informed when checking in that it was necessary to book the restaurant as soon as you arrived The hotel should also always have a a few tables for the hotel guests otherwise it becomes a very different visit at W Hotel They are marketing the hotel showing nice restaurants and then you cannot get in and need to go outside the hotel where you only have two often fully booked restaurants nearby , The localtion facilities the different pool areas are fantastic Breakfast is very good and as there are three different restaurants to serve breakfast it s never crowded The staff in general is are very kind and helpful specially the italiens 
412783,W Barcelona, The rooms are old and looks like a 2 stars hotel no luxury at all The hotel is extremely crowded you can t sleep from the music if you are in the lower floors , They have pool party every Sunday 
412784,W Barcelona, Would not waste your money at this hotel After staying in other W hotels before this holiday was an utter disappointment Terribly rude and unaccommodating staff as well as being very understaffed did not help the situation Rooms that weren t being cleaned The lack of any available beds at the pool beach area for their own hotel guests The old and broken pool beach side furniture that blew away broke every day The hundreds of conference attendees wandering around the small pool area making for a very uncomfortable and disgusting stay All in all NO RELAXATION whatsoever , The location is the ONLY thing it has going for it 
412785,W Barcelona, Everything else The staff and service were terrible The food at the Wet Bar is mediocre The service is unprofessional they re always rushed so orders are botched and forgotten The reception was the worse part with a very unfriendly greeting We had issues with our fully prepaid reservation and thus had to wait to sort it out and were never offered a drink of water although its July Also there was a taxi strike upon our arrival in Barcelona and this five star hotel was incapable of helping us find transport to it The rooms lack luster and are in need of refurbishing because the shower leaks into the bathroom and there is water everywhere This hotel is not worthy of its five stars period I say this having stayed at other W hotels such as the one in the Maldives incomparable There are obvious and grave management issues here , The view is honestly the only thing worth while in this hotel and the fact that it has direct access to the beach 
412786,W Barcelona, It felt a bit like Vegas The Hotel is huge with some very expensive Suites Rooms so there wasn t much interaction with the staff unless you were a VIP guest They seemed very busy with little time for you Our room wasn t cleaned until late in the afternoons and the quality of toilet paper toiletries was below par for a hotel at that price point The guests were a mixed bunch some less pleasant than the others Be aware there is a dress code for entry to the Sky Bar called Eclipse men can t wear shorts even when its 30 degrees , The W is a great hotel the sea views from the Sky Room were superb as was the Shower no sunset view but nonetheless enjoyable The hotel is right on the beachfront so is a great location in close proximity to restaurants and bars The Infinity Pool was great a much more relaxing environment than the larger pool Sunday nights during summer hold a wet deck party and that seems like the place to be Breakfast was expensive for what it was but adequate The Hotel gym is probably the best hotel gym is used 
412787,W Barcelona, waited 2 hours for my room than minibar empty after refill the fridge didnt worked and was not repaired during my stay I was compensated a bit but I prefered to just have no problems as the hotel was very full everywhere long waiting times on bars etc I felt pity for the bad working conditions of porters receiving the guest outside from the Dressed in black no shadow for hours Terrible , Fabulous Sky Room is great breakfast to room also great bar and hangout area 
412788,W Barcelona, The VIP exclusivity You were classed as a guest and communication to explain the way things worked was very poor Drinks and snacks were poor value Not enough bar staff , Location roommate
412789,W Barcelona, Slow service Expensive breakfast Infinity pool in wrong place and loses sun in middle of afternoon, Really comfy bed Great DJ Nice room with great view
412790,W Barcelona, The staff is unfortunately terrible The hotel was booked 100 and we would get the food drink orders that we gave at least 1 2 hours later ALthough we wanted a king size bed we had 2 queen size beds in the room The changing rooms that the hotel gave us before the room was ready was terrible and dirty F rst day we had to go around the pool for over 45 minutes to find a bed to sunbath The next morning we have to get up very early in order to reserve a place For the money that we pay we should not struggle with the avaiable spots both in the beach as well as the pool area Last day after the check out we have been told that there was a line of taxis avaiable at the entrance but there was a huge que for the taxis and we could not get any Generally only good 2 things about the hotel was the beverages manager in pool area Maribel who was very helpful to quicken things and the room was clean It was a disappointing experience, THe rooms were nice and that was the only thing
412791,W Barcelona, The service in the restaurant at breakkfast was appalling I lost count how many times we had to ask for a pot of hot water for the tea and then forgot to bring milk by the time the milk came the hot water was cold then they attempted to replace the hot water the tea pot went but failed to come back so no tea Very busy round the pool area no space for residents residents only pool was totally in the shade in the afternoon tried to ask to move sun loungers was point blankly refused Service was slow for drinks , The food was average was expecting a little more for such an expensive hotel The views across the beach and sea are amazing 
412792,W Barcelona, Myself and several friends friends of friends were in Barcelona for Sonar festival and my birthday Saturday 17th June in total there were well over 10 separate room bookings with the W for 3 4 nights with thousands spent and yet it felt like we were paying for the look feel of the hotel but not much more service was lazy and extremely slow drinks would take 15 20 minutes to be received food orders even longer and the overall quality of the food was below par drinks were great Staff were on the whole friendly and majority helpful but the hotel for me was a huge let down Other than a free cocktail I received no special treatments for my 32nd birthday and it just felt like a huge disappointment Deep tissue Massages were 55 minutes of being creamed by complete amateurs and had we not of used the jacuzi after would nto have even been worthwhile plus EXTREMELY OVERCHARGED for this The lifts were always slow and when the nightclub upstairs would be open the queues were a huge inconvenience in the main lobby plus the club was far too full of people crammed in like cattle with nowhere to dance or sit Pool was tiny more a show pool than actual enjoyment and always busy with people so could not be enjoyed just rubbish , Cocktails were good and rooms wer enice shame about the view of the sea and shipping containers when we specifically asked for a great view of the other sid eof hotel beach pool etc The gentlemen who assisted with luggage were great and always offering water and assistance I think Louis in particular was outstanding 
412793,W Barcelona, Check in at 3 00 is quite late When you pay that kind of money per night you expect the service to be impeccable It is far from that Wifi internet very slow and didn t even work and for a higher speed had to pay seriously We re in 2017 internet should be widely available free of charge , Only the views were fantastic 
412794,W Barcelona, The main pool area can be very busy and noisy With a lot of posing hotel guests and the constant smell of the restaurants below Fried fish , Beautiful room Very comfortable We were on our honeymoon It was nice of the hotel staff to surprise us with champagne both in our room as at the pool The breakfast was lovely The sun deck pool area was nice and quiet The hotel coffee was amazing 
412795,W Barcelona,No Negative, excellent location during summer time just on the beach great outside spaces with two stunning swimming pools very good spanish restaurant 1 Michelin star and skyline bar on the top with superview
412796,W Barcelona, Hard to fault this hotel music too quiet in the pool area , Best views in the city right from the huge extremely comfortable bed Friendly helpful staff Breakfast of kings Lovely spots next to the pool with easy access to the beach and sea Genuinely the nicest hotel I ve stayed at in Europe 
412797,W Barcelona, Cold water tap was not working Toilet with glass door facing the room is not very comfortable Hotel looks a little bit old You expect more preservation for that room price , the view is simply amazing The stuff recommended a wonderful restaurant in the city Taxi service 24 7
412798,W Barcelona, Facilities for children are poor though the hotel is right next to a wonderful beach which would appeal , The bed was extremely comfortable and we had fabulous views of the harbour Facilities were excellent lots of poolside loungers and we spent most of our day in a free cabana type structure Good breakfast plus excellent service staff were always helpful and polite Fabulous bar on the 26th floor plus exciting Sunday disco in the summer months 
412799,W Barcelona, The food in all the restaurants was only average nothing spectacular The service is really friendly but slow The pool area beds etc are not very clean , The location is great and the facilities are excellent several pools and restaurants Staff were friendly and its a fun lively hotel
412800,W Barcelona, Bit disappointed in a couple of very small things First wi fi was not entirely free Secondly it may have been a mistake but the teabags were not replenished once we had just two cups of tea the first morning Now as I said it might have been a mistake on the part of those who cleaned the room but I paid 816 for the two night stay so on both counts we feel that this was a bit churlish on the part of the W hotel , Architecture sites Famila Sagrada in particular food seafood vibrancy Catalan culture modernism
412801,W Barcelona,No Negative, We first came to the hotel for our wedding anniversary we returned with our 9month son it was just as fabulous as last time Staff are all great location is prefect room was brilliant everything was soft in the room for my baby Would highly recommend 
412802,W Barcelona, Some items at breakfast were cold instead of hot but other than that all great, Bed very comfortable in a spacious room with amazing views Staff all very friendly and helpful Hotel decor beautiful
412803,W Barcelona, Took one hour just to check in as short staffed and busy weekend We booked a cosy room through booking com When we got there staff told us that the cozy rooms are on the first second floor which wasnt clear on the website which defeated the point as we wanted to stay in a room that was higher up and in the main tower with a better view After much discussion they upgraded us to the 11th floor in a twin family room when we specifically requested a double The room was only available at about 4pm so they made us wait an hour They told us each twin was more than queen sized which didnt seem to be the case The family room was connected to another room with a very noisy family, Beach was nice
412804,W Barcelona, i didnt like the fact that you have to wait for a while at the reseption in the check in cause is really crowded Also to find sunbeds you have to wake up early , they staff was wonderfull and the vibe amazing the rooms also amazing high style and tec 
412805,W Barcelona, The fact I have to leave , Every year I come here amazingly friendly people Especially around the pool area Service is top level Four days W and I m totally reborn 
412806,W Barcelona, The atmosphere in both bars has changed and found it quite hard to get served at times Breakfast in this hotel was just ok for a 5 star hotel and the price I v had better , I have stayed at this hotel for four years now and this year was disappointing for many reasons Will definitely look for an alternative next year 
412807,W Barcelona,No Negative, Def has the WOW factor Staff went above and beyond I took my Dad to watch a game in barcelona and El Clasico in Madrid Dad is a Barca Fanatic The bartender went out of his way and presented this see photo to my father upon his arrival Welcome to Barcelona We hope you enjoy the Hotel the City and the Classic Match with your daughter Nicole Jacobo Obadia Such a thoughtful gesture An unforgettable moment thanks to a wonderful Bartender who takes pride in his career Made my dad feel like a celeb 
412808,W Barcelona, Almost nothing negative to say Selection of food and drinks at the pool bar could be expanded a little , Spacious modern suite with outstanding views and facilities location right near the beach overlooking the coast line but walking distance to city center friendly and accommodating staff choice of decent restaurants great pool lounge 
412809,W Barcelona, No complaints at all, Staff were amazingly friendly and nothing was too much trouble Treated us like royalty and on our last night there made two special drinks for us and a tray of chocolate covered strawberries can t wait to go back again in September 
412810,W Barcelona, About a 20 minute walk from the tourist attractions tour buses 20 minutes to harbour and restaurants The glass toilet door Pools small and cold , Rooms modern and spacious Great views 
412811,W Barcelona, All wonderful room have a view of construction so you need you consider it before booking When I entered the room i dissappointed with the view No tooth brush kit Poor eng skill for conversation, Good facilities
412812,W Barcelona, The service at the wet deck upstairs was awful nobody came to ask if we wanted drinks so went up to the bar myself when I did get hold of someone the drinks never turned up The food arrived promptly however with no cutlery I asked for some but didn t arrive so had to go to bar to collect ,No Positive
412813,W Barcelona, Staff very unhelpful and lazy We was on a floor and had noise of a party in the main reception all night Hotel staff only agreed to move us to a new room after calling 4 times and threatening to go down and stop the party at 3am myself , Good hotel and good size
412814,W Barcelona, Some of the staff doesn t have enough bandwidth and practice to handle the W promise for traveler experience Waiting time for everything except check out service not well organized ability to find you a place at the bar or on the terrace One afternoon on the terrace which wasn t full we waited 30 min to be able to place an order 20 to be served a beer and a coffee which arrived without spoon and sugar then 15 min to have our changes the waitress forgot so we had to remind her Be ready the place welcomes a lot of show off people so if you have issue with it better to avoid it Indeed the W nightclub is famous and at one point Clubers and hotel customers are in competition to be served or just to enter the hotel Last they didn t keep any of our requests we did at the booking one single bed High floor despite we booked 2 months in advance They explained us that whatever is done through booking com cannot be guaranteed and we d better go direct to their own website Found it a bit harsh Finally It required 25 min of strong discussion with senior management to have what we booked , The location was great and the design of the hotel is aligned with what you can expect Room are really well equiped and full of innovation The sea view is fantastic good music by live DJ performance at the bar 
412815,W Barcelona, The service was very bad The cleaning wasn t good It takes 30 mon to room service to deliver a pizza or a bottle of water Same problem for the service at the bar The rooms have no opening windows the rooms have no air and the odor are very bad The prices were VERY high for everything and the service wasn t following the price level , The beds are extremely comfortables and the design of the hotel is very nice and modern 
412816,W Barcelona, The only thing I don t like is the shower gel and shampoo I think they can use a better brand other than Bliss for the price of the hotel, The staffs are very nice and very welcoming I got a room on the 24th floor and the view is literally amazing 
412817,W Barcelona, The weather but I can t blame the hotel for that , The staff were superb From arranging restaurant reservations sorting a champagne breakfast for our first day down to providing an umbrella at the first site of a cloud the staff were attentive and quick to respond to all our requests A complimentary upgrade to the suite was also a fantastic touch as it was my girlfriends birthday The views from the rooms are amazing and the eclipse bar is a must 
412818,W Barcelona, Work was going on in hotel at our time of stay Was trying to have an afternoon nap after early flight but difficult with building work drilling banging Was offered a change of room to lower floor but I was too tired to pack move unpack Offered breakfast as compliment due to disturbance for 2 mornings only went First morning Disappointed with breakfast so ate elsewhere 2nd morning If we had paid to have breakfast included It would of cost 33 each per day I only had coffee orange juice couple of slices of ham cheese My partner left half of his cooked breakfast Huge let down 2nd day pool had been drained a few foot due to work being done around pool area Half of pool seating area was blocked off to hotel guests for conference meetings Half of decking area you could not sit around sun was in area which was reserved for conference area Also noticed our 1st day waiters waitresses seemed to favour the more upper class elite guests for table service around the pool area We had to go to the bar for our own drinks but eventually did manage to catch a passing waiter who brought us a drinks menu so we could order When you go away to a nice luxury hotel you want to be able to relax not possible with workmen around restricted areas Top sun deck was closed off due to maintenance works so we spent time away from trying to relax at hotel For what we payed for our stay it was not worth the money Disappointed as was a short honeymoon stay If we return to Barcelona I would not stay at W again unfortunately , Friendly helpful staff who aim to please Comfy beds Fabulous views
412819,W Barcelona, A little confused staff at the pool bar location far away from the city center, Beach location modern clean and spacious rooms beautiful view wide range in the minibar super restaurant comfy pool area helpful and always smiling staff delicious breakfast
412820,W Barcelona, The free wifi is limited to 3 mb otherwise its chargeable disturbance from the house keeping even with the DND sign noisy atmosphere outside the room nearest metro is about 20 mins walk requested the room to be cleaned but no action taken , The view the room the food 
412821,W Barcelona, See above, We had both dinner and breakfast at bravo and we both times disappointed the dinner was not good value for money considering it s fine dinning and breakfast was slow and food that ran out was never replaced Most disappointing food of our honeymoon however the rest of the hotel was absolutely excellent especially the wet area staff and service and cleanliness Very impressed and also a big thankyou to the staff at the front desk and eclipse bar Made our honeymoon worth while 
412822,W Barcelona, My own bad but I forgot to put the do not disturb sign up before going to bed the first night and the cleaning personell knocked on my door at 10am , Very comfortable pillows and very large room Cannot get a better location 
412823,W Barcelona, Check in time was 3PM arrived at exactly 3PM and the room wasn t ready for over an hour which was frustrating , Bed was incredible with incredible views
412824,W Barcelona, The room was too noisy by renovated construction I was no choice to take a rest at the room with the sick in noisy sound Finally I asked them to change the room The next room was quiet but They should told us about noise sound before our check in Normally they need to give us the information about it , The staff were very attentive and helpful They look all happy which made us happy 
412825,W Barcelona, For a hotel in this price range there was definitely not enough attention to detail like 1 We only got one small shampoo shower gel per day even though we were two in the room 2 One of the cupboard doors hinges was broken loose and door did not properly close has been like that for quite a while apparently 3 The door stop was taken apart on the second day its parts were lying on the floor until we left, The view was great The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful from reception to restaurants and bar Breakfast buffet was awesome 
412826,W Barcelona, Prior to our trip contacted hotel to check if both pools and pool bar are open We were told yes Once there infinity pool closed due to the painting of the deck other pool open but bar closed hence slow drinks and lunch service Also on our second day as we were sunbathing and enjoying sunshine when asked to leave pool as very important corporate guests had to use it for an event I guess we weren t that important Also couldn t use w lounge for lunch Advised we can use spa not free or go have lunch in the Eclypse which is closed dark club instead of being sat by the pool enjoying sunshine Left hotel and went to the beach restaurant for lunch , 3rd visit to the hotel Facilities are good staff helpful great location 
412827,W Barcelona,No Negative, arrived at 15 15 check in is at 15 00 room was not ready were told that the room would be ready in 30 minutes and that we would be called after an hour no call so went to check then waited another 15 for the room then the room cool corner suit had an obstructed view most of the view was the roof of another building The room wasn t cleaned the next day so we had to call reception and only then did they come and clean it WhatsApp service that was offered for 24 7 service was bad used it once and didn t get a reply for over an hour Room service did not bring all the requested items overall disappointing for a 5 star hotel at this price
412828,W Barcelona, Be asked to leave Eclispe night club we felt that the cost of the hotel per night should include being allowed into Eclispe for as long as you wanted, We loved the location and the hotel decor was beautiful good atmosphere the staff were friendly professional and couldn t do enough for you
412829,W Barcelona, Apart from having to ring every afternoon to get our tea and coffee replenished all was great , The staff were amazing I went for my birthday and they game me cake They couldn t do enough to make my stay wonderful 
412830,W Barcelona, To be honest the high price doesn t match the quality It needs urgently renovation All the facilities doesn t seem like a five stars hotel If you still want to try it one night is enough , Staff of room service is nice 
412831,W Barcelona, I had a Suite with breakfast followed the sign for Breakfast but were thrown out of the restaurant after we got served UNBELIEVABLE , The new corner suite is very nice and with great views funny design etc 
412832,W Barcelona, The bathroom sink is disgusting It is old and needs to be redone Mouldy and the sink was clogged and had a smell like a sewer when the water was running ,No Positive
412833,W Barcelona, Breakfast very expensive 33 euro each Pool area service not great seating and beds damp and customers having to wipe before could sit down and service overall very slow, Bed extra comfy great location close to everything bars restaurants and shops
412834,W Barcelona, Breakfast was overpriced 30 euros per person you get a complimentary coffee downstairs but cheaper to grab something to eat from one of the beach bars Also 20 euros per person to use a jacuzzi , Excellent location great bar and good choice of restaurants Some nice seating areas inside and outside to relax in and chill out 
412835,W Barcelona, Took me a while to find out how to turn off the lights under the bed and under the basin had to ring reception , Lovely comfy bed as always at the W Glorious view from the windows Spotless bathroom and excellent laundry service
412836,W Barcelona, The room had a weird smell like the one you get when the window hasn t been open for a while Can t open windows of course There is a lounge downstairs and a line for the bar upstairs and the rooms on floors 1 6 face the inner court so there is noise till very late at night If you want quiet ask to be on the 7th floor and above, Really nice big room Very comfy bed Nice views though we got the first floor
412837,W Barcelona, I didn t spend much time in the room but if I had to it would ve been boring as you only have a few hours of free radio after that you have to pay quite expensive as well I thought that s ridiculous to be charged for radio Also limited free wi fi There is no window you can open so at some stage I felt quite claustrophobic I wasn t impressed with the food either I wouldn t recommend their eggs benedict , The view was superb The staff very friendly and helpful The bed was very comfortable 
412838,W Barcelona, It was IMPOSSIBLE to work or to sleep in the afternoon due to very noisy restructuring work Simply NOT acceptable for an hotel of this standard To note I alerted it to the customer service every single day but nothing happened, Good location very good facility and very good food drinks
412839,W Barcelona, There was a construction in the hotel I think above my room and after I reacted they promised me to change my room but never happened Also when i tried to use the swimming pool they wanted to charge me beside no written heads up in my reservation , The breakfast was great and also the breakfast manager who was extra friendly and helpful 
412840,W Barcelona,No Negative, Everything about W hotels are amazing I always look for W hotels whenever I travel ever since my first W experience I love the hip and trendy feel I experience during my stay 
412841,W Barcelona, There s no inside pool To use sauna steam room guests pay 20euros per hour , The attentiveness of staff was second to none whether it be reception the restaurants or eclipse Breakfast was great loads of choice fresh requests honoured Great ambience in the lobby bar if you thought Sunday s were for relaxing they actually do RETOX to get you in the party mood for the new week Bliss spa was lovely and relaxing Staff again great 
412842,W Barcelona, Spa entry should be free for guests at this level Some breakfast items should be warm fresh i e Pancakes waffles, Fabulous room great views good breakfast buffet Great gym facilities
412843,W Barcelona, Cant think of anything , We got an upgrade when checking in and it turnt a brilliant stay into one of the best weekends we have had From a 9 to a 10 All the little pleasures add up to an amazing stay Need to return 
412844,W Barcelona, No indoor pool to enjoy during the colder period of the year, View from the room is worth the price you pay and helps that the beds are so comfortable you dont want to get out of them
412845,W Barcelona, The location is not good There service was very slow We waited 20 mins before check in There is no tea or coffee or kettle in the room The furnishings looked old with marks and scratches , The bed was very comfortable The staff was very friendly 
412846,W Barcelona, I used Booking to book a room with a double bed but when I arrived to the hotel they told me that there were not rooms of this type left and that they could only give me one with two twin beds They informed me that the problem was that thru Booking the type of beds selected are not confirmed and that I should use directly their website next time Concerning the cleanliness I moved a bench that was next to the window for getting closer to the views and there was some garbage under it the floor was very dirty , Great views 
412847,W Barcelona, Doesn t have a swimming pool and some rooms without a bathtub Not much options on the menu , Excellent views from the rooms facing the sea and very comfortable beds Spacious twin beds in the twin room 
412848,W Barcelona, Use of the spa area jacuzzi steam room Sauna is not included and costs 20 per person per hour Room should have been cleaned better there was dust on the shelves of the closet and bath room Service personnel during breakfast was very slow and had difficulties to understand English The concierge service gave us twice wrong information regarding the ticket buy for sights tickets for all sights have to be bought in advance in the internet obviously they weren t as good informed as it appeared at first impression You have to ask as precisly as possible because the concierge service answers only your question but doesn t give further information , Location of the hotel directly at the sea is great View to the sea out of the bed was amazing Great bar at the 26th floor with awesome cocktails and very good recommendations of the hotel for Tapas bars There was good modern music in every floor and the average age of the hotel guests was quite young 
412849,W Barcelona, Well to start I stay in hotels many All over the world This is a 100 200 euro one not a 400 The staff are not surely organized nor 5 professional the room we couldn t stay in was way to hot sun blazing through the large windows Unbearable for a quickie in the day The whole place is not that clean warn furniture and finishing a rough Not what I was expecting my faults explained to staff made no difference when they asked how was my stay I normally stay elsewhere in Barcelona and will continue , The view from the rooms on the other side from us The beds are great though 
412850,W Barcelona, Some of the counter staff weren t too helpful They kept on telling us to take a taxi to wherever we wanted to go However there was this lady named Melinda who did her best to help us find our way and to understand the transport system We saved quite a fair bit of money taking the train to the different places instead of a taxi The train system is efficient and there is really no reason why one had to go everywhere only by taxi unless time is not on one s side , Location is by the beach Not too far from the city centre One can take the bus V15 from the bus stop in front of the hotel View from the room can be nice depending on which room one is allotted Taxis are easily available at the hotel Not cheap though It cost 20 euros from Barcelona Sants Station to the hotel and 40 Euros from the hotel to the airport 
412851,W Barcelona, Expensive but this is what i had to pay to please my fiancee whos dream was to stay in the w barcelona hotel , Beautiful location We had the city harbour view which was amazing The room was fantastic comfortable and was very private 
412852,W Barcelona, Nothing at all, I loved everything s on W Hotel and I can say my favorite hotel will never choose another hotel in Barcelona and I really recommend anyone going to Barcelona to sty in W Hotel
412853,W Barcelona, It is a pity the hotel doesn t have any indoor pool , The location and the view from the rooms is amazing The staff is always smiling and very helpful 
412854,W Barcelona, The eclipse bar We went up and thought we could have a cocktail I never knew it was a disco club As it says it is a bar The music was loud obviously and full of people and you couldn t even pass , The BED We slept so well The upgrade the staff made us The views where superb The pool outside and the views are beautiful we re definetly going back in summer 
412855,W Barcelona, we were absolutely disgusted by the fact that in the lobby shop they were selling clothing made of real fur That should be removed immediately In a province were bull fighting is not allowed shops should not sell real fur , Beautifull room with great views
412856,W Barcelona,No Negative, The incredible view of watching the sun set n rise from the room How friendly helpful and polite staff were Definitely made my stay more enjoyable 
412857,W Barcelona, bar at the top was a bit crowded and blokey a bit of walk into town as it s on the harbour district and would have preferred to pay less , very clean modern cool rooms and comfortable beds friendly staff great views from the 17th floor attention to detail is excellent 
412858,W Barcelona, Staff was a bit too casual for my liking outlook is bit too modern plain no indoor pool is a drawback for families , Excellent location on beach staff is helpful spacious room we stayed in a suite with 2 toilets modern hotel Cable cart to Montjuic is walking distance 
412859,W Barcelona, I would prefer to have a solid bathroom door rather than a glass door but that s a small thing , The hotel rooms are gorgeous and the views towards beach and harbour are amazing specially on the higher floors The bed was truly exceptional you could really sink into it and when combined with the views if felt like sleeping in the clouds 
412860,W Barcelona, No heated or indoor pool additional charge for spa jacuzzi So not much to do in the winter months Eclipse bar open at six then became too busy and they couldn t cope with two bartenders Waited 20 minutes for drink then left Really nothing special apart from the view , Beds view shower
412861,W Barcelona, Room was too hot when the sun was beaming and the door made a noise every time someone closed or opened their room door , Loved the view and the way the curtains opened facilities were great staff were friendly
412862,W Barcelona, No complaints , We want for my partners 40th birthday and the service was impeccable all staff were polite and very helpful The hotel was clean and stylish with spacious bedroom The meal at the Bravo 24 was costly but overall excellent service The Eclipse was fantastic just ensure to make reservation and have lots of Cash for VIP We also received a free shots and little cakes as it was my partner and complimentary breakfast due to delays which was dealt with promptly 
412863,W Barcelona, More free TV channels Internet was intermittent , Breakfast choice was amazing with a great view to start the day Staff were very friendly and helpful in all areas of the hotel Our room was spacious and luxurious A great hotel 
412864,W Barcelona, Breakfast 32 euros per person per day do me a favour Close to a nudist beach so not ideal for young families Generally a young hip and trendy hotel so maybe not ideal for families full stop, Very modern stylish rooms with amazing views Nice pool bar areas Extremely nice and helpful staff concierge
412865,W Barcelona,No Negative, The hotel has a luxurious feel about everything from the bars and restaurants to the pool and private beach areas The view from the bedroom was magnificent The staff were without exception very professional helpful and friendly 
412866,W Barcelona, Unfortunately the twin room request on Booking com did not make it through to the hotel and one member of reception staff was rather unhelpful , Excellent facilities and plenty of staff willing to assist with any requirements Lots of choice of eating and drinking places 
412867,W Barcelona, A reasonable room fabulous room is over 300 per night not sure if that s great Booked a twin as I was staying with a female friend but got a double Bed was more than big enough to not require pj s though , Everything Mind blowing views from the room Was just testing it for my upcoming Primavera trip next year I will definitely be staying here then good ish club but there are better in town but hey it s just upstairs Posey beach bar and pool area Staff believe in the product Multilingual accent free Kirsten on reception embodies the place Lots of options for a drink in various watering holes bar staff mega friendly Walk through the hotel straight onto the beach Once you head out onto the beach lots of bars restaurants and a nice walk into town ramblas through some interesting sites Don t think it s good for small kids as it s really brash I mean that in a positive way lots of Kool People there looking for an good time and an experience that s not so traditional but with an exceptional level of quality I hotel a lot and would put this place suitable for leisure 75 business 25 unless you re like Yahoo or something then you can business here all day and night
412868,W Barcelona, Spa was only available if you book a treatment and the steam and sauna were very very small , My wife and I always choose 5 star hotels when we travel and this one lived up to expectations The location is perfect right on the beach with easy access to downtown Barcelona Great staff super facilities and very nice all round 
412869,W Barcelona, This is a conference hotel No customer care service This was our 3rd visit and our last The hotel has changed since it opened they only want conferences now it was our anniversary a special occassion no regard from hotel even though we were returning customers The hotel is beginning to look very tired it needs a refurb, Location
412870,W Barcelona, Location far from city center Lobby experience is like Eurodisney So many people that it is not possible to ask something unless you queue for 15min Breakfast if massively overpriced for average quality food served in a cantine 2 bedrooms when you specifically ask for one , Size of the rooms Bathrooms View
412871,W Barcelona, It was hit and miss with the staff 50 were fantastic they went out of their way to help and we re very friendly Unfortunately half of the staff we met were the opposite These staff need updated customer service training They acted self important and aloof the type you get in designer clothing stores who believe they designed the bag themselves For such a high quality hotel the service should be impeccable 100 of the time , The hotel is stunning inside and out The standard is impeccably high We were a group of 4 2 of us stayed on the 20th floor wonderful room and 2 on the 1st floor cosy room Both were equally as luxurious with the only difference being the Wonderful Room was slightly larger with a full view The view on the 1st floor was 80 visible so still great I would definitely stay again 
412872,W Barcelona, Literally nothing Worth every penny, Amazing staff and breathtaking views Best place to be in Barcelona Especially good service at the Wet bar near the pool Alfonso was superb 
412873,W Barcelona, The toilet Rather than have a wooden door it had a semi opaque frosted glass door which meant the person on the toilet could be seen and heard by others in the room The wet room for the shower leaked into the room so not a great design , The view from our room on the 10th floor was amazing Cocktails at Eclipse on the top floor was great Staff very friendly and informative Very grateful for the complimentary Cava for our honeymoon 
412874,W Barcelona, Tea and coffee facilities available in the room would have been a plus Very surprised and disappointed about that , Bed was v comfortable room spacious The restaurant Bravo was SUPERB 
412875,W Barcelona, Nothing, Bed and bedding amazing and friendly staff would do anything and always service with a smile Second time we ve been and already planning our next trip It s the only place to stay in Barcelona
412876,W Barcelona, At the check in they told us it is better to book through their webpage not through booking com no queen bed for us but 2 single beds a part from each other because we booked through booking com room first floor was very noisy We asked for another room they told us they were totally booked Toilets in the room were only seperated by glass from the sleeping area Room looks old , location
412877,W Barcelona, The decor which was cool 5 years ago will be dated in a few years , Jorge who checked me in did a great job of arranging for a higher floor view room at an excellent additional fee I was also able to check in to this room earlier upon my arrival 
412878,W Barcelona, The location is quite far from the city and not easily accessible The personal from the hotel was quite rude and always in a hurry Special note to be made to the unbelievable rude manager of the security who treated us like animals when entered the eclipse bar We booked a king size bed but we have been told that was a failure on booking com and the king size does not exist in the type of room we chose so we were offered a king size bed in a more expensive room with a 100 euro extra charge The bathroom is terrible there is mold on the shower ceiling and the WC usage was a bit odd We were a couple and found it very strange to use the glass WC Overall you would expect more for the money you pay especially the cleanliness should not be discussed at this level , The view is amazing but does it worth the money There was no noise in the room even though when opening the door to our room the hotel was very loud The rooms were very big and felt the was a lot of attention to details to make your stay as pleasant as possible you could easily stay there for few weeks with all the comfort The lightning was great and we had sufficent light which is not something normal nowadays in hotels The beds were very comfortable There is a lot of space deposit your clothes and belongings Very good amenities 
412879,W Barcelona, Small pool but it s ok the sea is a bigger pool few meters away Burgers by the pool were awful but weren t billed , Location Friendly staff Trendy 
412880,W Barcelona, We were on honeymoon but we were given a twin which is apparently something to do with booking with booking com so we had sepetate beds Girl on reception could have tried harder to get us an alternative We were given a room with an adjoining door and on our last night there was a party next door So we had no sleep hotel gave us some compensation but it wasn t the honeymoon we had hoped for for nearly 300 a night, Location Comfortable rooms View
412881,W Barcelona, you can not get a drink at the bar you wait up to 20mins on the sunday of pool party you cannot use parts of the hotel we have paid for girls being sick all over the floor walls of toilet and not cleaned up for hours , beds view food 
412882,W Barcelona, The only thing we got disappointed was that we couldn t check out even half hour later than the check out time , Nice hotel in general great location 
412883,W Barcelona, Thme manager Khosee is very rude unprofessional and discriminating to arabs I got a 40Sqm room which is quite spacious and when I checked in the manager told me I have to get another room for my kids or I go out of hotel I strongly reccomend for all arabs not to go there ,No Positive
412884,W Barcelona, Rooms a bit pricey should include breakfast for the price you re paying but I would deffo go back again and pay the same because it was that good , Amazing hotel with beautiful views of the beach and barcelona Staff were very accommodating and friendly odd how all the staff were good looking but no one would complain about that The eclipse bar on the top floor was incredible and the pools and the pool views are the best Would deffo return again tommorow if I could 
412885,W Barcelona, The lockerroom to the poolarea A hotel like W Barcelona should offer the hotelguest that have checked out something better than this , The sun terraces and the pool areas were fabulous 
412886,W Barcelona, The path room wasn t good in a way that you have to jump between glasses to move from the toilet to the shower, The location and the staff friendly behavior
412887,W Barcelona, Service was mixed which I didn t expect for a hotel of this standard instances of poor service included no towels in the room one evening no towels in the downstairs changing area and took 30mins to retrieve some following numerous requests and awful management of the taxi queue when trying to catch our flight Lots of employees hanging around with relatively little interest in being of assistance Toilet Shower was only separated from the wider room by glazed window with no sound protection 20mins walk to the metro so not great for exploring Barcelona, Good beach and pool facilities with fun atmosphere Great views 
412888,W Barcelona, Bathroom The red color of rooms corridors They charged my credit card a lot more what they supposed to which caused me a lot of hassle and time to fix it , Lobby Sea view
412889,W Barcelona, Staff were not well trained and did not know how to handle matters properly the hotel was fully booked and it was busy so it would ve been much better had there been well trained and experienced staff , Location and beach access
412890,W Barcelona, 1 we could not sleep because the noise from the lobby bar was so loud that we can hear the music people talking in the room 2 the hotel is far from everything you need a taxi to go anywhere and sometimes there is a long line to get a taxi 3 the room is not comfortable the bathroom has no privacy if you are traveling with someone, 1 The hotel is on the beachfront 2 nice pool
412891,W Barcelona, The only thing that let it down was the club on the top floor A bit snobbish and contrary to the feel of the rest of the hotel, Great hotel with cool vibes lovely food amazing views beautiful pool and incredibly attentive staff
412892,W Barcelona, Transparancy glass tualet in a middle room with echo effect Very strange , I liked the hotel the beach the bed Look like american business hotel Taxes are cheap about 8 euros to the centre Food is very good
412893,W Barcelona, I had make a reservation for a double bed and we had two single beds Also the room view wasn t something that I was expected They didn t make any change at the room Everyday the hotel was crowded by many people cause everyday they are doing a party Also We were waiting 2 hours for the check in , The staff at the pool is the Best And the location of the hotel is really top 
412894,W Barcelona, Check in and check out are a disaster for a five star hotel I expect much better service and attention to detail I arrived at the hotel at 2 30pm I didn t check in until 4 30pm Unacceptable frankly No sympathy from staff and the response to waiting for 2 hours to check in was there s nothing we can do , Facilities are great Bed very comfortable
412895,W Barcelona,No Negative, If you want to be by the beach this is a perfect spot but it was far from downtown Also it s so busy all the time that service is slow and the reception is always so crowded and noisy 
412896,W Barcelona, The beds were so comfy that getting out of them to seize the day was a challenge, Hotel was amazing from start to finish The hotel looked stunning from a distance and then once inside it didn t disappoint The staff were all very attentive and the whole trip was worth the money Views from the bedrooms of the beach are extraordinary You could tell this was a 5 star experience from start to finish Whatever whenever service is a great edition both for planning your trip and during 
412897,W Barcelona,No Negative, Spa facilities are great After checkout shower changing room facilities are useful if hanging around waiting for a flight Food on the whole was good but not great
412898,W Barcelona, The night time bar staff that worked during the Sundaze party were really slow and didn t acknowledge that most people were standing around waiting for them The Wet Deck bar staff during the day were really lovely and attentive but also a bit too slow it wasn t a huge problem they just need to show a little more urgency , I couldn t speak more highly of this hotel The view from the Fantastic Room facing the beach and city was out of this world and the bed was super comfortable The service we received was some of the best I ve ever experienced staff were always friendly and attentive The facilities were great we really loved the Wet Deck especially the Sundaze party that was held there on Sunday night We would definitely stay there again and will highly recommend it to anyone else 
412899,W Barcelona, Though the poolside menu could have been a little more appealing the food sounds better than it tastes Also the poolside seats are snapped up from early morning with nobody appearing to sitt in them until later morning , Hotel is in a very good location at the end of the beach Facilities are excellent rooms are spacious and very comfortable The gym is worth going for the view of the beach and palm trees Takes your mind off the task 
412900,W Barcelona, The culture of the place is dreadful Being busy is an excuse for not providing good customer service , Not much about this place Very poor management and staff attitude The hotel and its staff are bigger than the needs of the guest 
412901,W Barcelona, The bad thing they charge money without your knowledge from my credit card and i complain but no one replied and they charge again after checking out it is very bad and still waiting for the hotel reply , Good location
412902,W Barcelona, Room wasn t ready when we arrived despite it being 30 mins after the check in time and ended up not being ready for almost 2 hours after check in We had also requested a King Sized bed but instead were given two very small Double beds Generally we weren t that impressed with the service , Great location 
412903,W Barcelona, Good for a one night experience not worth the money for a longer stay Many hotels in the area are nice and less expensive We stayed a Wednesday and Thursday tried to extend it by one day due to our flight and the price doubled to 1000 for a Friday so we had to leave and find a different hotel for one night , Friendly bi lingual staff Nice restaurants good food Very easy to get a taxi everywhere Room service 24 hours 
412904,W Barcelona, Not all staff are that helpful poor service around the pool and most beds are reserved before 9 30 and you struggle to get a bed after this time The TV in the room is not for English speaking guests with only 3 english american channels all news channels , i love this hotel great location and a little luxury whilst on holiday Best for people in groups couples its a party hotel at night so not the best for solo travellers wanting a relaxing break 
412905,W Barcelona, The sun is blocked out by the hotel itself between 11 2pm on the upper deck Meaning hotel guests are wondering about looking to carve out a space for themselves to sun worship A deck on the other side of the hotel would be possible A little investment on that side would make it easy albeit the view isn t as good It s better then being offered loungers in the shade , The bed was amazing I slept on a cloud The view from our Fabulous Room was brilliant Totally worth the price tag The manager of the whatever whenever desk helped us with a few room problems and her attention to detail and service was exceptional and appreciated We hope to return very soon 
412906,W Barcelona, breakfast could use more variety and also had a lot of flies or top of the fruits hearing alot about the W I imagined the pool will be huge and amazing it was lower the average I dont recommend this hotel for families at night it is very very loud with parties downstairs even the lobby is too loud to walk in with a sleeping baby the beach outside is nice but its a nude beach again its not family friendly, the room was amazing it over looked the ocean and it was one of the nicest rooms ever when staying in the W you have to get a sea view room amazing staff
412907,W Barcelona, Delivery charge does not make any sense the hotel already makes huge profits from all items sold through room service sales why delivery charge of upto 6 euro per order , Excellent room with very comfortable bed good pool and beach facilities helpful staff Oscar the pool manager is extemely hands on 
412908,W Barcelona, Check in was a disgrace for a 5 star hotel Didn t get to room until 5pm supposed to be from 3pm we arrived Barcelona at 4 00am and paid to stay at airport hotel to avoid issues After complaint about delay we finally got to our room only to find that despite booking for 3 people there was only one bed Went back down and complained to manager who gave me a poor response I e bed gets set up after guests arrive He sent one up but the regular service arrived at 9 00pm Completely spoilt our first day , The staff other than check in were fantastic Exuberant and friendly The system whereby you text chat queries was great and the people on the other end wee extremely helpful One staff member Carlos was unbelievable and completely turned around our first impressions of the hotel 
412909,W Barcelona, The service is shocking everything takes an age The variety of food is poor there s only so many club wraps one can eat , factilities are lovely
412910,W Barcelona, Service was very poor wasn t worth the money Charged me for a triple wonderful room when the hotel doesn t even have any triple rooms passing off a double with a camping bed as triple,No Positive
412911,W Barcelona, everything first of all when you pay that kind of money per night you expect the service to be impeccable it is far from that you have the impression of being in a disco club all the time the property is dirty the floors are filled with empty beer bottles and cigarettes the staf is extremely arrogant and not at all customer minded Most of the people present in the hotel are not hotel guests they come for the party and swimming pool when u want to go to your room since half of the elevators are used by the club going customers there is always a annoying long waiting line the food is bad the water of the swimming pool is dirty you font want to go in there unless you don t care for diseases I hated it and will never in my life go back there , Nothing at all
412912,W Barcelona, There was nothing to dislike , Brilliant weekend stay Pool party was amazing Perfect weather and great service checking in and out Superb breakfast
412913,W Barcelona,No Negative, Absolutely everything Hotel is beautiful Pool area amazing Rooms super clean with spectacular view But the 10 points go to staff Always smiling helpful Everyone working there is amazing caring about the guests making sure that everything is ok Young people full of energy It was my husband s birthday and they just made it so special unforgettable Also the Salt restaurant is awesome and people working there sooo amazing Thank you so much for making it so special for us We will be back for sure My number 1 hotel in the world 
412914,W Barcelona, Having to make reservations to eat at restaurants within the hotel And house keeping did a bad job all through my stay, My booking was skewered but the staff resolved the problem I loved the ambience within the hotel
412915,W Barcelona, The meal we were served in room service was awful the fries were dry and cold and may have been a couple of days old The entertainment system was not what I would have expected for a 5 start hotel Not sure about the layout of the bathroom complete glass front meant a lack of privacy and you have to have a towel on the floor in your room as the shower opens directly into the room , The room and fixtures were of the highest quality the staff we re excellent and the facilities such as pool and restaurants were excellent The view even though I was on the first floor was great a real luxury experience 
412916,W Barcelona, booking com sold it as a beach view but was put in a room with a port view on other side when I complained the hotel said it was because we did not book direct and that Booking com cannot guarantee beach view rooms Very disappointing for 700 per night , wet deck pool area overlooking the beach was amazing great rooms beds bathrooms 
412917,W Barcelona, The hair dryer at the room was horrible and in the rooms of my friends too , Very friendly employees Very helpful concierge Very efficient house keeping Met a lot of celebrities
412918,W Barcelona,No Negative, The W hotel in Barcelona one word WOW From the second we arrived it was like a dream Thank you W staff for making my best friends birthday so special cant wait to come back 
412919,W Barcelona, Attitude of staff Cleaner did not come until the evening once we had asked Unable to call reception from room so had to call on our mobile phones , Bed extremely comfortable Very modern Ice pops around the pool Pool party
412920,W Barcelona, View from room really disappointing considering we had paid for a more expensive wonderful room View of harbour sea obscured by the building and was not great Possibly unfortunate as I am sure other rooms offered better views Pools also very small for the size of the hotel , Staff very accommodating and outstanding service Interior of room excellent Breakfast had a wide choice of options and of an excellent standard Overall a lovely hotel and a great base for a weekend in Barcelona 
412921,W Barcelona, The bathrooms in the room have limited privacy The price was slightly high but the treatment was great , The staff was amazing especially Alonzo in the pool area Olinda in the night club on the rooftop and George at the front desk Nicholas the beverage manger was very attentive One word Amazing 
412922,W Barcelona, There was not enough light in the lifts to see your floor number, Excellent service people extra nice helpful Breakfast was a treat The pool area was really nice
412923,W Barcelona, Did not manage to sleep because of the noise of pool parties until 5 am You should warn people when booking I felt unwell with lack of sleep and when I complained I was told it was a hotel for young people ,No Positive
412924,W Barcelona, Bathrooms were terrible no water pressure and need an engineering degree to use shower and we are constant travellers in Europe We requested double bed but not available even though we booked months ago Requested beach views but given view of the construction site This is a business hotel not designed for a vacation Located too far from the city and requires a taxi to see any action The W is too expensive unless you have a totally great experience The Las Arenas Resort in Valencia a level above this Hotel Go there first, Staff were great Breakfast good Bars were good outdoor areas good
412925,W Barcelona, Breakfast is madly expensive and no alternative close by Also watch out for parking charges if you are arriving by car The class walls around the loo in the bedroom take a bit of getting used to , Location overlooking private beach Spectacular view from our room Plenty of areas with comfy beds to sun bathe and 2 pools Choice of restaurants below the hotel overlooking the beach offered a convenient and excellent selection of evening meals 
412926,W Barcelona, As we were travelling with young children there was building work directly outside the hotel which was extremely noisy and started at 08 00hrs and woke us all up Although this work wasn t related to the hotel we would have liked to have been informed prior to arriving that there was continuous drilling noise and construction work directly outside our bedroom window , The staff were very attentive and helpful in the hotel and around the pool area 
412927,W Barcelona, service in the dining room I only went there once but I wouldn t go back again because the waiter was really not helpful and a bit rude or non attentive, location facilities
412928,W Barcelona, The pool area is too crowded but it s due to the summer season , Very comfortable bed amazing room view from 17th floor The beach is not privat but the hotel has their own sunbeds and towels 
412929,W Barcelona,No Negative, It was just like a dream From location to perfect people it was marvelous and we are coming back for sure Great job and thank you for making our holliday and perfect one 
412930,W Barcelona, Poor communication between staff The great staff are let down by the inefficient staff not enough consistency , Bed is gorgeous Breakfast buffet delicious Location great 
412931,W Barcelona, The food was terrible and the swimming pool is too small to accommodate all the guests The rooms need a deep stain removal cleaning The housekeeping need to be reminded everyday to clean the rooms and all they do is change sheets and towels , The staff were very helpful the Conceirge were very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations Fun hotel which has easy access to the beach 
412932,W Barcelona, Club music on throughout the whole hotel 24 7 can be heard from the room small swimming pools, Location by the beach comfortable sun loungers good food great view from the room trendy
412933,W Barcelona, There were always events at the pool so you would be getting moved from sun bed to sun bed and the pool bar upstairs closed too early even though there would be lots of people still sunbathing, Loved the bed Super comfortable 
412934,W Barcelona, Communication on arrival due to a friend unable to go due to father having a heart attack the day before So I telephoned bookings com and the hotel to notify to see if we could reduce the rate so my friends didn t have to pay for the extra bed On arrival at the hotel the front deck receptionist didn t understand our request not to have the third bed in the room But all he kept saying was we have to pay taxes We had to have confirmation from bookings com to say we didn t have the third bed I then had to ring bookings com to confirm and remove the bed from our room before they would do anything and bookings com asked to speak to the receptionist He then explained that reservations were going to confirm and not charge us for the third bed On arrival to our rooms which wasn t ready til 4 00 our cases were not there and both rooms we had booked had the third bed in So when we came to check out we were charged fully for 6 people instead of 5 To which I know it was short notice but under the circumstances we asked not to put a third bed in one of the rooms So in all 5 of us had to pay for the 6th person very expensive The hotel had a nightclub to which we accessed On departing the nightclub we were followed by a male to our hotel room He had got in the lift with us from the nightclub and got out on our floor and followed us right to our door Fortunately we are strong and capable ladies and was able to push him back to the lift My friend notified reception But nothing happened I felt this was a serious security breach And needs rectifying immediately If people are leaving the night club the need escorting away from the lift All in all a good weekend but very expensive , The views were fantastic The hotel and pool was brilliant and served a duel purpose for entertainment Food could have had more of a selection on wet deck menu 
412935,W Barcelona, Beach staff were all over the place and inattentive they were stressed and slow It felt like the hotel management has slipped since our visit last year Two mess ups with housekeeping on two consecutive days failing to clean our room and for the cost this really wasn t acceptable , Breakfast beach ambience
412936,W Barcelona, Horrible reception staff rude and unwilling to assist The room we booked was not available and we had to change halfway through our trip we stayed for 4 nights The argument was that we did not book via W Hotels but via Booking com and therefore the reservation details got mixed up Really bad start , The pools of the hotels are very nice and the pool staff there is nice The bed is amazing 
412937,W Barcelona, food is very bad, location for beachmand thats all
412938,W Barcelona, I paid cash and I asked if all are OK They told me yes but they went inside to check at the machine They came back and told me that are missing 500 E I checked again and there were missing 60 E My concern is regarding why they did not checked in the front desktop why they told me first time that it is OK Bad experience , The restaurant personal was very friendly and the services were very good there 
412939,W Barcelona, Restricted space in the night club on the top floor even for hotel guests was not appreciated, Excellent room with an amazing view over the ocean and up the beach As always the facilities and staff at the W were exceptional
412940,W Barcelona, The staff were friendly but very disorganised meaning most things resulted in a very long wait, The room was great with a fabulous view and a super comfy
412941,W Barcelona, Our waitress at breakfast wasnt helpful We wanted to sit outside where there were numerous free 2 seater tables but were made to feel this was an effort to get them dressed ready , The beds were the comfiest we ve slept in Staff were fantastic Can t really fault the hotel 
412942,W Barcelona, No turndown service at night which should be standard in a hotel at this price Toiletries were ok should be better Rooms a bit tired , Rooms are a great size view was amazing 
412943,W Barcelona, Bar prices were expensive in comparison to the rest of Barca, Fantastic experience staying at this hotel and the Sunday night pool party was off the scale
412944,W Barcelona, Too busy for the facilities reception bar etc Too many non hotel people gatecrashing hotel facilities Had to wait 35 mins to be served a drink in Eclipse bar, Great statement hotel Beach club excellent Hotel and rooms just starting to look a little tired in places
412945,W Barcelona, I was really nicely surprised that the prices were no more expensive than if we had have been in London however the only time I felt like we had been ripped off was on the Sunday club night where we were charged 28 euros for 2 gin and tonics That was def over priced , Everything was just perfect it was definitely worth the money the staff couldn t do enough for you the location was amazing too Both meals in the Wave restaurant on my 40th birthday and in the Salt restaurant were lovely the waiters were very attentive Pool attendants and pool bar staff were also amazing they seemed to work long hard hours but never tired of offering help or smiles especially the lovely pool man on the roof top pool bar 
412946,W Barcelona, Slow waiter service at pool bar in evenings Very expensive drinks served in dirty old plastic glasses spilled by waiting staff and no napkins provided ,No Positive
412947,W Barcelona, Don t don t drink the tap water as it tasted like pool water , The beds are the best in Barcelona for comfort Subliminal experience Love it 
412948,W Barcelona, Too big and impersonal and tries too hard to be trendy so much so that its almost trashy The foyer and passages fail to dazzle as does the room s cleanliness Traces of people before us was evident shower door dirty Only cleaned our room at 3 pm after we had phoned to ask when they would be there You have to show yourself to room nothing is explained from how things work to charges Very disappointing for what you pay , We made a mistake regarding location we should have remained in the centre so for us the beach was not a great choice but if this is what you want the location will be tops Sea view was lovely to wake up to The pool deck is fabulous and the service there is great 
412949,W Barcelona,No Negative, Great location by the beach Modern room with stunning floor to ceiling glass wall view of the coastline Huge shower with rain shower head Pool and bar overlooking the beach plus nightclub on the 26th floor More than we usually spend but absolutely worth it Would love to stay there again 
412950,W Barcelona, 1 The rooms are very small and not ergonomically designed so it was not very comfortable 2 the hotel is like loud and lousy so u don t feel acquainted or resting 3 Too many conferences guests security was not top 4 ordered in room dinning last day ravioli with ricotta cheese next day I was with food poison spent time at medical center indeed I reported it to the hotel and they did not charge us the food fees also they mentioned that they will investigate which I appreciate In the end I think it is price is over what you get for value I will not stay again in W but others which are much calmer and dissent , The staff were really helpful and the location was ok the food was average didn t eat in the restaurants though only the bar outside at the pool and breakfast 
412951,W Barcelona, The room service was below standard the food arrived cold with items missing The lobby toilets were also disappointing they were not clean and not well stocked , The bed was fantastic the staff were very helpful and friendly 
412952,W Barcelona, The hotel allows non residents to pay to use the facilities which included stag parties It is basically a conference hotel so as individual travellers we felt pretty unimportant particularly when the deck area we preferred was closed off for a private function On 2 days our room was not serviced when we returned at the end of the day Overall not the experience we expected for the 5 star price we were paying , Staff were generally very good particularly the deck team who tried hard to improve our stay after we shared our concerns
412953,W Barcelona, Not enough staff They kept forgetting our orders or getting them wrong Commenting only on the staff we encountered bearing in mind hundreds work at the W Half of the staff were professional others were damn right rude including one manager such a shame because these ones really let the other more concientous staff down No tea making facilities in the room we had to request every day and even then only one tea bag each poor for a five star at expensive prices Room a bit tired looking Service has gone downhill since our stay in May 2015 April 2016 not so good , Breakfast has a great selection although quite pricey Shower is huge but lacked bath sheet and only one robe between two Great location for beach but long walk for Las Ramblas so taxi everywhere if you don t like walking House keeping staff are first class 
412954,W Barcelona, I was traveling with a large group 700 ppl and I heard many of them complain about the costs to stay I guess breakfast was expensive and the service in the restaurant wasn t that smooth This is all second hand but I figured I would pass it along , The staff was always there when you needed them Caroline at the front desk was incredible helping me adjust some plans at the last minute The txt message service was great The spa was one of the best I ve visited 
412955,W Barcelona, Bathroom is not separated from the room , Great food room service breakfast everything Perfect place to stay if you want to have fun Amazing views 
412956,W Barcelona, We missed our morning coffee in our room The hotel does not supply a coffee making machine in the rooms, Location setting modern and comfortable rooms
412957,W Barcelona, On arrival the went to the check in desk and was told by one of you staff that he would put a block on my partners card of 200 Euros just in case so we agreed as the card I was using to make the full payment didn t have the sufficient amount Checked in fine went to our room when we got to the room only one robe was available in the shower the other one in the closet was one to take home with a charge of 50 Euros Later on in the night we decided to go to the club we lined up I was disgusted by the security swearing at hotel guest coming out of the lift what kind of service is that making guest feel threaten anyway enjoyed the club The next morning we got ready to go out and have a wonder around Barcelona got back to the hotel our room was not cleaned no new towels no tissue no new glasses no shower gels or shampoo we had our pizza box from friday night still in the room it was disgraceful the amount of money we are paying to stay in a this alleged 5 hotel the care for customer was poor we had to call reception and request for new towels glasses and so on in the end we got what we asked for then the cleaner was told to come and clean our room we stayed in the room while she cleaned Why should we be taken out of comfort for the hotels incompetent service The spa is so pricey and the sauna you have is located in the changing rooms so you can t even go and relax with your partner in there you have to be separated Sunday 24th April we checked out in total I paid about 907 Euros on my card I then told the lady I would use my partner s card that we blocked the 200 euros when we checked in to pay for the multimedia which was around 24 25 Euros I signed the paper I was given great checked out We got back to London and my partner checked his account and 866 was taken from his account the payment was taken from the W Hotel , Location was beautiful some of the staff were helpful and nice hotel but over rated no proper sauna or steam room sauna is separated by by gender changing rooms pool is outside so if it rains you cant really go inside the pool spa was way to pricey Breakfast was okay but 700 for 2 nights and still have to pay for the breakfast 
412958,W Barcelona,No Negative, View was spectacular Food was top notch Dinner on the beach and Breakfast was the best we had on our stay Location was excellent and the hotel went out of their way to make the last night of our honeymoon very enjoyable 
412959,W Barcelona, Bathrooms in general open not soundproof and large roof shower did not work Eclipse Bar did not allow my spouse to enter for having sandals model flipflop , Location by the beach
412960,W Barcelona, Construction works are deeply intrusive noise totally unacceptable and seemingly of no interest to the reception staff Food in hotel restaurants is grossly overpriced and menu selections are beyond most tastes Portion sizes minimalistic at best Found best option to get a taxi into town and eat out every night , Superb hotel amazing location superb bed and view from 20th floor over the Mediterranean 
412961,W Barcelona, The inexperience of some of the staff they are all so young The elevators are so dark The hotel is based around young people swinging chairs in the bar and such , The room was spectacular the bed was the most comfortable bed ever The view from the room really great 
412962,W Barcelona,No Negative, Amazing hotel with fantastic rooms Absolutely loved the view and spa Very cool place with a ber cool feel and very friendly and helpful staff The spa treatments were a great way to avoid a rainy Barcelona
412963,W Barcelona,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was perfect The beds were extremely comfortable the staff was all very helpful the pool area was fantastic and the view was even better 
412964,W Barcelona, The Ventilation of hotel and room was bad and glass doors of toilet is so fun and ridiculous The logistics of room is just crazy large room made useless by all the furniture All the smell from toilet comes to room that made my stay in this hotel unforgetable breakfast wasn t good There where two days old Vegetables some cheese and poor service Basin wasn t clean yelow dirt in when I checked in This hotel is definetlly not five stars as it pretends to be max 4 stars Need to work a lot to improve clenness smells and service , Location and view is amazing 
412965,W Barcelona,No Negative, Thie hotel W far exceeded my expectations You may pay for what you get but it is so worth it Only advise is the cava is great and the champagne is s 
412966,W Barcelona,No Negative, Javier our waiter was the best He brought us champagne when i proposed on the terrace in the evening The team is wonderful and it makes the beautiful hotel and location even better

412969,W Barcelona, The location is quite far from any public transportation and the only convenient mean of transport is taxis , Amazing hotel with amazing view and 5 treatment 
412970,W Barcelona, Everything Is absolutely perfect and the breakfast is amazing , It was our first weekend as husband and wife The staff upgraded us in a beautiful corner suite and as our room was not available on time offered us a credit to enjoy the facilities bar spa of the hotel it was a perfect moment of happiness Thank you to the W team
412971,W Barcelona, Nothing could ve been better however the location isn t central but taxis during the day are cheap , This Hotel is very Trendy and cool but also suitable for any age group and meet lots of people from all over the world enjoyed the pool and the Bar on the top the most going back with my husband next time as is also quite romantic 
412972,W Barcelona, There was a ticking noise from behind one of the walls My girlfriend couldn t sleep that night we stayed there terrible Breakfast was good but nothing special and was definitely worth the price , The hotel has a very cool design Our room was big and had views to the beach and the sea Cool pool bar Valet parking is comfortable 
412973,W Barcelona, However the service at the wave restaurant was awful Had to wait 35 minutes before they took the order and service at the bar was the same , Beautiful hotel comfortable great location and very nice staff at reception Very accommodating and wanted to make sure we had the best room 
412974,W Barcelona, The services provided by the hotel are not up to the standards of a 5 hotel Average food and in room dining certainly below the 5 standards poor spa no inside pool staff were friendly but not responsive to our requests Way too expensive for what it offers Slightly a disappointment especially for the amount of money we spent , Perfect location breath taking view modern hotel architecture 
412975,W Barcelona, Wifi internet very slow and didnt even work and for a higher speed had to pay seriously We re in 2016 interent should be widely available free of charge, Great location Amazing views from the room very comfortable beds and the rooms had good amenities the staff were very friendly and helpful would definately stay here again
412976,W Barcelona, Nothing it was fab However complimentary drinks on arrival would be wonderful and make it 6 , It was absolutely beautiful and we were kindly upgraded from our room on the 2nd floor without even asking Kirsten on the front desk was so helpful 
412977,W Barcelona, Took too much money I agreed with reception I would pay for 2 nights but have looked at my bank and have been charged for 3 nights this was not agreed so very disappointed, Nice hotel
412978,W Barcelona, Ugly view construction side from the originally booked room wonderful double Waiting time for change to another type of room was long When coming back from town one evening 12 3 at 21 30 the room was not yet done 12 3 in the morning the keys did not work anymore Bad smell in elevators 10 3 the dinner in the Bravo restaurant was very disappointing Dish with 3 grilled gambas without any sause or rice bread or anything else for 30 is inacceptable Small portion of Zarzuela served without any creativity again without any rice or bread 36 , Extraordinary view from the room cool corner suite 
412979,W Barcelona, The rooms could use a bit of a touch up in some areas , I really really loved the hotel It has a uniquely fun trendy vibe to it The location and the stunning Sea view s from the hotel rooms are amazing I also really enjoyed the Bliss Spa as well as the Bliss products Breakfast was superb as well All in all a pleasant experience I highly recommend the hotel 
412980,W Barcelona, Toilet is not well isolated otherwise the room was soundproof Hotel is located on beach not close to sights , The view was superb whole room was built around that The bed and the desk were facing towards the window Make sure you check the room type upon reservation as some rooms do not have view Shower is spacious All funtcions are well thought trough and built using quality materials 
412981,W Barcelona, 3mb of free wi fi is mean Expect free wifi in a hotel of this calibre Very outdated trying to create a profit centre from wifi Not so keen on frosted glass toilet cubicle onto the bedroom But too late to change that Otherwise absolutely everything was brilliant Restaurant and room service too well priced for a first class hotel Will return , Wahetever Whenever button for service was brilliant I hate when you call a front desk and they grumpily say you need to call Concierge or vice versa There they just take care of it Rooms are fabulous huge attention to detail in quality of appointments modern facilities for charging working wonderful ligting great bed linen huge shower really first class Location is spectacular great restaurants walks and the beach close by 
412982,W Barcelona, first room with great view at 18th floor was noisy due to renovation work at the floor above But staff managed to move us to less noisy room but the view was not as great, Views from the room was amazing
412983,W Barcelona,No Negative, Incredible hotel in a beautiful location and the perfect place for a proposal The W Insiders are incredible in particular Jorge who made sure our stay at the hotel was incredibly special and magical 
412984,W Barcelona, The smell in the living room lobby and sky bar was awful It was like mix of cheap food and chlorine The spa Well they can t say that they have spa Just few rooms for massage No any water area pool jacuzzi sauna is about 1 5 sq m and located in the gym changing room Moreover there isn t a bathroom itself Washbowl is located near your bed toilet is separated from the rest of the room by glass walls there is no any ventilation I can t imagine how just friends or shy people will be able to use the toilet Bed is uncomfortable and not king size , The view service The view is the only reason to choose this hotel
412985,W Barcelona, Maybe a bit overpriced but we didn t mind when you go to that type of hotel you know what to expect , Everything Staff very helpful the food the room was nice Nice atmosphere and vibes 
412986,W Barcelona, Dirty carpets stained badly also dirty marks on furniture broken window blind dirty glass by bed our first impression ruined even though views incredible After complaining we were moved to another room with even better views but unfortunately this also had stains on the furniture carpet We gave up complaining just decided to make the best of it as now it was 9pm on Xmas Eve However not a great first impression Hard to find garage car park on arrival No signs to help guide you Frustrating after 8hr drive Room decor both rooms tatty Overall feel that it was tired Bedroom walls badly marked damaged Did not feel luxurious as expected for 5 This was Christmas our anniversary DISAPPOINTING , Views awesome Location great Staff very helpful friendly 
412987,W Barcelona, old facilities and far from city centre on new year s eve it was noisy as well I could hear the sounds until 2 00 a m and the Whenever whatever is not that useful in my opinion on new year eve the were not able to provide us private car services , the room service was good
412988,W Barcelona, When comparing the breakfast buffet to some other European countries at 5 start hotels I would say this is average There aren t too many healthy options and the fruit selection is very limited The value is not there for the 35 euro price per person breakfast The staff at the front desk and the concierge were very friendly and helpful There is a club at the top of the hotel called Eclipse It is very trendy and is open to the public Guests do not need to wait in line However when I am paying almost 400 night for an 8 night stay at a W hotel I expect to be treated as a guest and not as a person off the street having to deal with bouncers and security That takes away from the 5 star guest appeal I must say that I had an issue with them and discussed it with management Instead of sucking it up and giving me the customer is always right treatment they gave me a series of excuses while apologizing I don t want to hear excuses Training is required and the W really needs to focus on standardizing the guest experience across the board at all of their hotels My personal preference when traveling is to have a great spa to relax in after walking all day or working out The spa is non existent They have a bliss spa and it is very limited So it all depends what your expectations are and mine are pretty high since I have to travel for work all the time and really want a different experience when traveling for leisure , The location was great since there are only a couple of high end hotels on the beach If you like to get exercise this is the perfect place to run and the gym at the W was above your average hotel gym The rooms were spacious the view was great the showers had hot water and water pressure The mini bar was also complete with what you would need to make your own drinks if necessary The prices on the menu were reasonable in comparison to some other hotels at this level The staff at the Bravo restaurant was very friendly 
412989,W Barcelona, You cannot open windows The location of the A C unit openings made me invent the method of changing the air stream direction I had to figure out how to turn off additional lights in the room which I didn t want and there was no apparent way to turn it off , Location The fact that they allow pets 
412990,W Barcelona, Maybe a bit pricey , Really enjoyed my experience with the W Barcelona Staff really helpful thank you Guillermo Clean comfy room lovely food from both restaurants 
412991,W Barcelona, The toilet is glass sided the toilet and the basin are in the room The shower design not waterproof The breakfast cereals dispensers quite useless breakfast buffet excellent but coffee rationed by the busy staff The bed is low to the floor , The location the view the staff attentiveness
412992,W Barcelona, The hair dryer need to be checked as the inlet has been blocked by the dust So the power is reduced , Excellent location for seaside and fabulous view from the building Recommended 
412993,W Barcelona, Pay for TV channels pay for wifi in rooms I expected to have these as the norm in a 5 star hotel not as an additional cost, Excellent staff service good breakfast buffet menu extremely clean trendy bar club contemporary rooms
412994,W Barcelona, During Breakfast getting the Bill as soon as you commenced eating While the interior design look mice the finishes truly were quite cheap toilets cleanliness questionable , The view was excellent 
412995,W Barcelona, On our first night at the Wave restaurant they gave us rock hard cold bread and only after we asked for it to be changed did they give us soft warm bread There was such a difference so it made us question why it was given to us in the first place The service was slow as well they took a while to take our drinks order After returning to the room from a long day out we came back to find our room remained Uncleaned , The view from the room was amazing the eclipse bar had an excellent vibe and great music as well as music The Wave restaurant and bar had delicious food and cocktails 
412996,W Barcelona, The servise is very very very very bad All of the staffs are very rude I can t uderstand why there are so rude And not friendly decline our requires I have been to other W hotel before the staffs all very good , The location is good 
412997,W Barcelona, To charge 20eur per Hour per Person for a tiny spa with a tiny pool and and tiny sauna and steembath is not ok And there is no relaxarea where you can lay down after the sauna only a room in the ladies changing room, Beautiful designed hotel Excellent sushi at Eclipse Bar The breakfast is ok for the price of 32Eur pP you get a good range of items Nicely located directly at the beach 
412998,W Barcelona, One slight thing I would question is prices of tapas at the restaurant there ham was like 20 euro which is crazy as 5 min walk same dish is 3 euro a plate , view from the room is incredible everything about this place was class
412999,W Barcelona,No Negative, ubicacion vistas arquitectura dise o la atencion excelente preguntad por Jordi room upgrade early check in late check out we will be back for sure 
413000,W Barcelona, Misunderstanding as to whether I d paid for breakfast in advance Still not quite sure what happened there but reception staff sorted it out to my satisfaction so credit to them , Great views Classy and stylish with downstairs buzz and upstairs calm Early morning breakfast bar is best 
413001,W Barcelona, Breakfast is very expensive and not included The bathroom is inside the room a square area in the middle of the room separated by a simple glass with no acoustic isolation which is very embarassing The hotel has 2 towers one short with few floors called the cube and the tallest one with nice ocean and city view I have booked the room many months in advance asking for a high floor I was given a 4th floor room because they said I had booked through booking com which didn t allow me choose it I got a higher floor room with better view only in the other day after complaining a lot Restaurant in the pool area is not good expensive and bad food It was a shame they didn t replace amenities in the bathroom everyday We had to use the same soap to take shower and wash hands , Localizated on the beach good only if it s summer because the hotel is far from most touristic points as Paseo de Gracia museums and churchs The club on the roof is excellent good music and nice people
413002,W Barcelona, This is my 2rd stay at the W in Barcelona now and while the food for room service is exceptional the breakfast is really quite poor Well the cooked breakfast anyway ,No Positive
413003,W Barcelona, Nothing at all , I made a mistake and double booked two rooms the hotel management fully understood and dealt with booking com on my behalf Very understanding 
413004,W Barcelona,No Negative, Beds were awesome Rooms were spacious with great views whether on the 5th or 21st floor we stayed twice at the beginning and end of our cruise Breakfast was a little spendy for light eaters and drinkers but the food was really great especially orders off the menu and staff was uber pleasant and attentive Everyone and we mean everyone went out of their way to make sure we knew where we were going and had everything we needed We would definitely book again 
413005,W Barcelona, Dealing from the reception is very bad crew Delay in any request The hotel is upgrade my booking and but the room it is not clean I think it s an emergency room, The hotel is clean and comfortable Wi Fi is fast Arab television channels available and many options The rooms look great on the sea 
413006,W Barcelona, It s looking a bit tired now fan in bathroom didn t work and that is crucial to an unventilated hotel room so smell of damp in the shower cubical not pleasant , Very hip hotel amazing location and views 
413007,W Barcelona, None , Absolutely amazing view Gym is large and posh facing the sea Modern and fashionable interior design Two wonderful swimming pools Easy access to city centre by taxi Efficient and pleasant customer service It s definitely somewhere you can t miss at Barcelona 
413008,W Barcelona, The way bathroom was designed threw me a bit off , Perfect location just at the best part of Barcelonetta beach and yet walking distance to the Gothic Quarter Much better air noise quality outside comparing to the hotels in the city center Many choices for an evening night entertainment Very nice pool bar area 
413009,W Barcelona, Check in experience was not in par level for such a prestigious hotel chain We waited 45 minutes extra for the room to be ready our luggage was misplaced air condition was not working and the room was not clean , Rita at the front desk was great support The sea view was amazing 
413010,W Barcelona, Did not get bed choice as we had used booking com apparently Did not get requested late check out again as we were not booked direct through hotel they said Very busy reception always queue, Beach location Pool
413011,W Barcelona, If you re sharing with friends the frosty glass door to the loo could be interesting , Warm welcome fantastic customer service and amazing views from our room The room was quiet the bed was squishy and sumptuous and we just couldn t stop staring out the windows 
413012,W Barcelona, No coffee facilities in room Decor tired Over crowded communal areas Bathrooms small and not seperate from room Lots of boozey guests Need taxi to get to any shop or restaurant outside hotel, Room views Good for stag parties
413013,W Barcelona, Service was not always up to scratch long wait for a drink and once it didn t come at all We also visited the Eclipse night club on the Friday night the DJ wasn t the best , Amazing views across Barcelona and very stylish surrounding to enjoy a few drinks 
413014,W Barcelona, We re disappointed with how unexciting everything is from boring colours and furnishings in the room to rather depressing sitting area at the entrance TV is tiny restaurant atmosphere is cold not to mention the overpriced everything Overall happy to have tried it since we live in Barcelona and wanted to try it for a special day but not staying again there are much more stylish hotels in Barcelona in better areas , The view from the room is great and the bed very comfortable Personnel nice 
413015,W Barcelona,No Negative, I came to Barcelona for my 30th birthday The W hotel did not dissapoint the food was amazing the massage I had was amazing the room we had had a view overlooking the ocean Staff were all really friendly The only critised I have is when we arrived a guy took out cases and gave us a ticket we asked there members of staff if we needed to do anything with this ticket to get our cases and they all said no We then proceeded to wait nearly two hours for our cases I rang down to reception twice they said the begs would be 5 minutes I eventually had to go down and speak to The manager who told us we needed the ticket to get our bags But he have us complimentary drinks whilst we aired for them to be delivers to our room Other than that the stay was sensational I will definitely be returning 
413016,W Barcelona, Didn t like the d cor in the corridors outside the rooms the red was a bit too much , Loved the room and the lovely views the restaurants were superb 
413017,W Barcelona, very slow housekeeping service I stayed for 3 days first day the room was not cleaned until 1pm although I left it at 9 am second day I left at 11 am came back at 4 pm and was not cleaned I had to call several times for housekeeping to clean the rooms, view from the rooms
413018,W Barcelona, bed mattress it wasn t clean when i checked in but they solved it on spot Allowing a lot of visitors to use the pool area chairs and bar , Very friendly staff nice pool area The verity of restaurants my WOW sweet was so good with nice view 
413019,W Barcelona, Night club was too loud and needs to be split into one half cocktail bar with music at lower volume and the other solely for dancing , Breakfast pools and facilities were amazing 
413020,W Barcelona, We travelled as a young couple with out 7 month old daughter We are not prudes at all but were only disappointed at the inappropriate display of nude sunbathing and by nude I mean fully nude Men and women If my daughter was older I would have been very uncomfortable with her witnessing that all day This is the ONLY thing that would stop us perhaps staying there again But if it was just me and my husband then I would But families Could feel uncomfortable I feel , Everything about this hotel is fantastic but especially the staff They were beyond amazing The walk to nearest metro was a beautiful one Lots of amenities and restaurants on the way The hotel has a whatever whenever service which is literally what it says on the tin Fab 
413021,W Barcelona, there is a not good smell in the bathroom maybe cuz there have moist in it and the door always keep close but it doesnt matter when u enjoy the service and the facilities, location is good there is a long beach besidethe hotel easily walk to the restaurants Nice view if ur room is high and the sofa beside the window is fantastic All the staffs in the hotel are friendly and helpful I will choose here again next time when I come 
413022,W Barcelona, The entrance hall looks like a disco club with lots of people coming in and out There is plenty of space for a bathtub in the room but they have chosen to go only for a magnificient shower , Facilities are superb Decoration and design is awesome room distribution also very unique The landscape from windows is simply amazing and breakfast though a bit overpriced is very good indeed 
413023,W Barcelona, We had dirty bedding which we removed until it was put back onto our bed Had to resort to leaving it in the hallway in order for them to realise it had what looked like dry vomit on it , The staff were lovely and friendly We did however feel they gave a lot more to the day guests as opposed to those who had paid to stay at the hotel 
413024,W Barcelona, The food was very disappointing in all areas sadly The place isn t cheap either so you expect better Service good food bad , The staff were fantastic Especially Daphne she really made the hen weekend for my friend and was genuinely one of the nicest people who couldn t do enough for you A real credit to the hotel The pool area and private cabana we hired were also lovely
413025,W Barcelona, The cost of breakfast 31 per person is astronomical and very hard to justify the cost especially when maybe not everyone wants to eat that much I have never paid more for breakfast than an evening meal How does the hotel come up with that price , Everything about the hotel was 1st class from the staff service facilities and the hotel room the best hotel I have ever stayed in 
413026,W Barcelona, No concerns of note, Great hotel W Barcelona provided not just s venue but an experience and we loved it Everything from the fantastic room excellent staff facilities and Bliss Spa made for a memorable stay Thank you W Team
413027,W Barcelona, Nothing The whole stay was fantastic, Everything The staff were fantastic the decor was funky really comfortable room great views excellent toiletries
413028,W Barcelona, the air conditioning wasn t working correctly also the shower leaked into the toilet area the hotel did compensate for not being able to get the AC to work , liked the staff and location 
413029,W Barcelona, Pretentious image Staff are very polite try hard but don t appear to of received adequate training in how a 5 star hotel ought to be run Breakfast choice is not good for cost Booking in chaotic Reception area not very inspiring , Room beach front location Great entire design 
413030,W Barcelona, Upon arrival to hotel I lost whole day i get room key only at 18 10 They gave me ticket for free drink in the bar I was nervous about all of this But they also informed me that check out time at 12am Rooms are terrible bathrooms are in the room It s so uncomfortable if you are not alone Thanks to W that they installed glass door between toilet and bed ,No Positive
413031,W Barcelona, We stayed at higher floor witch is amazing view but little bit noisy from the rooftop nightclub, Location Stuff are amazing beautiful sea view Wonderful atmosphere
413032,W Barcelona, We had some troubles with Wifi all staff were very friendly but not all were well trained Not the kind of hotel you want to visit with kids, Location and Hotel facilities were superb The view from the room we had was amazing
413033,W Barcelona, I have rated the staff highly because I presume this wasn t their fault policy but when I checked in I was asked for a credit card for extras eg mini bar restaurant which was approved and then half way through my stay a pay for movie was declined and I was told there was a problem with my credit card It turned out that they had tried to charge something on my card in sterling which was declined I had a Caxton card with only Euros on it I was in Spain And aren t they only supposed to charge at the end of your stay and then I was told that I had reached my limit and had to approve a higher limit nobody told me I had a limit in the first place This meant I spent my Saturday night at reception feeling defensive about my declined credit card , Great location great food great views
413034,W Barcelona, We woke up to construction sounds coming through our walls at 8 30 am and continued to have the problem in the morning The staff was able to give us a discount on our room which was enough to satisfy our complaint Other than that we absolutely loved this hotel , This was hands down the best resort that we have ever stayed at in our lives 
413035,W Barcelona, They would not move our room even after we explained that we were only visiting for two nights and the view was obstructed by another building The reason for not making us a priority to get a new room was because we booked through booking com therefore they could not move us as stated by their manager ,No Positive
413036,W Barcelona,No Negative, Fantastic location on the beach with excellent facilities and friendly multi lingual staff who were always courteous and there to cater for every whim The room was large luxurious and very well equipped with fantastic views The food was very good and service outstanding 
413037,W Barcelona, Becuase it is located at the end of the beach it is quite a walk to the La Rambla and do sightseeing , The hotel is located on the beach with a perfect view of the city and sea The staffs are attentive and courteous We had a room facing the sea which was amazing There is plenty of space in the room and toilet are neat and posh The Bliss spa is highly recommended 
413038,W Barcelona, I had to pay for the wifi This service should be included in the price of the room I had to wait 30 min and ask 3 persons for a cappucino at breakfast , Friendly staff nice accomodation 
413039,W Barcelona, I booked king size bed and got twin room even though I was travelling solo stuff didn t help with the issue and I had to stay in twin room The view was supposed to be seaview but given that it was 3rd floor the view was mainly the huge concrete square under the windows with sea at the back again misleading room description Crowd is very tacky especially at the eclipse bar upstairs Room was nice but very weathered stinky shower sink area need to be refurbished Clearly lack of stuff to deal with requests from rooms asked for water and had to wait for 1 hour for someone to bring it Location on the beach is nice but that area of the beach is very dirty and the walk from hotel to city center takes ages and is not very pleasant as area around hotel is quite poor and dirty Had to take taxi everytime to save myself 40minute walk to the city center Also It would be nice if they could remove all the tons of unhealthy sugary and overpriced snacks that they put in the minibar and put something more conducive to healthy lifestyle like fruits and yogurt , Gym is excellent fantastic sun beds but the swimming pool picture on the website is misleading because pool is very shallow and small very comfortable bed and the twin room was huge 
413040,W Barcelona, The noise of the people going and coming out of the night club you should find a solution for the club entrance , Excellent is the exact word the staff are kind and professional the decor is exquisite I will recommend it to all of my friends 
413041,W Barcelona, Pools too small and don t think filter system is very strong and water looked murky Didn t like waiting until 4 30pm to be able to get room wasted afternoon, Great sun beds
413042,W Barcelona, shambolic systems shambolic check in we got our room key at 8 30pm slow responses to everything no pool side space available overbooked and poorly designed, The staff and their personal commitment to service
413043,W Barcelona, Nothing that I can think of , Fantastic place We were there for 4 nights and found the staff to be super friendly and will to cater your every need The food we had round the pool was exceptional with the tuna salad coming up top for me Drinks prices round the pool are slightly higher than the norm but not too high that you feel you have to hold back I think a beer was 6 There is a short walk to the main restaurant area of Barca but it s a lovely one along the promenade Would I go again Oh yes
