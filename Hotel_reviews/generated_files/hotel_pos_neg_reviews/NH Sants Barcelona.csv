389623,NH Sants Barcelona, Had hoped for a cup of tea after we arrived before bed but no facilities in room and no obvious place to have one though we didn t ask , Arrived late at night booking in was straightforward staff welcoming When we realised we had left a phone charger in our room I contacted them by email then phone and they found the charger and put it aside for us to pick up at a later date Comfortable bed Really handy for Barcelona Sants railway station for our onward trip as well as metro into central area of Barcelona 
389624,NH Sants Barcelona, The room in the first floor had vis a vis and we coud not open the window by day While the light spots are not sufficient So I had problems reading , Good place to stay in Barcelona and relax afar from the very crowded and noisy places It is 15 minutes away from the touristy la rambla be it by bus metro or train La Illa shopping center is a short walk from the Hotel The personal very helpful 
389625,NH Sants Barcelona, My non smoking room had a cigarette smoke smell and the bathroom could have accepted a little more thorough cleaning There were stains and dirty spots here and there , This hotel is located in a very convenient location close to Barcelona Sants railway station This comes in handy if you travel by train from Barcelona airport to the city It s just a 5 minute walk from the railway and subway stations to the hotel The hotel lobby and reception are very modern and appealing The rooms are functional Over all good value for money
389626,NH Sants Barcelona, It would have been nice if there was a complimentary bottle of water in the room The bottles of water in the mini bar were 3 80E each , The bed was amazingly comfy slept like a log The staff were very friendly helpful We enjoyed breakfast there was a lot of choice even lactofree milk 
389627,NH Sants Barcelona, Noise cancelling room was a lie everytime the cleaner or someone else moved a bed on ur floor you heard it early morning Smell of smoke from people smoking in other rooms came right into my room through the passage way under the door That was the worst ,No Positive
389628,NH Sants Barcelona, Poor view from room natural light restricted however this was not a major problem , A few minutes walk from the station convenient for rail travellers Would be happy to use this hotel again

389630,NH Sants Barcelona, People doing botellon drinking and singing in the park in front of the facility till 7am I highly recommend not to stay in this place if you enjoy your sleep ,No Positive
389631,NH Sants Barcelona, A cubby hole of a room with very very little natural light, The staff especially for phoning around when I asked for help Iwhen requesting to stay an extra night
389632,NH Sants Barcelona, The air con in the room didn t really work very well and the room was stuffy and hot Could imagine it would be unbearable in the summer , It s close to the bus and train station You can walk to Barcelona football stadium 
389633,NH Sants Barcelona, We had to ask twice for changing of the room before we got a good one First one had twin beds rather than a double bed that I booked and the second one was extremely noisy I booked this hotel specifically for soundproofed rooms the room we got had an entire wall made from old windows facing the street and I could not sleep the first night at all Luckily they allowed us to switch the room and the final one we got was quiet and nice The breakfast was extremely expensive for a 4 star hotel more than 20 EUR per person so we did not take it even though I would have wanted to , The room service we used for dinner was very nice and handy The position of the hotel to public transport connections is fairly good The staff was professional and friendly 
389634,NH Sants Barcelona, Like many foreign accommodations no tea coffee making facilities, Appeared to be newly renovated room was modern Reception staff were friendly and spoke excellent English Lots of local caf bars and only a short walk to the bull ring and magic fountain area
389635,NH Sants Barcelona,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and helpful willing to answer all our questions Also they didn t disturb us at all with the cleaning process when we were in the room Very professional and clean hotel nice and convenient location 
389636,NH Sants Barcelona, The bathroom was covered in hairs The bath sink and toilet all contained long dark hairs Calling reception immediately they said they would send up cleaning staff within 5 minutes which the did We had only beem in the room 30 seconds I would have expected to be offered another room perhaps an upgrade as an apology But we weren t and after a long trip we didn t have the energy to make such a request and potentially cause problems The bathroom was cleaned within 10 5 minutes with an apology from the cleaner stating the previous girl must have been rushing I love nh hotels but this will definitely make me think twice if cleanliness suffers when staff are pushed for time ,No Positive
389637,NH Sants Barcelona, Very very noise hotel you can easily hear what the people in the neighbor rooms are talking and doing Big street around I left my towel on the floor to be changed it was taken but never replaced It is a business oriented hotel whatever you want to do you have to pay no complementary coffee or tea facilities in the bedroom , The room was clean quite good located 400 m away from metro station supermarkets around 
389638,NH Sants Barcelona, The marble floors mean that you can hear everything that is dropped and every foot step i had a person walking around moving chairs from 1am to 5am agggh,No Positive

389640,NH Sants Barcelona, There was some sound transmission between rooms so we were disturbed by a noisy snorer nearby Everything else was was excellent however , Very attractive d cor in the reception lounges and in the room A quiet atmosphere in the room and a well controlled temperature Room very clean and well appointed Very friendly professional and helpful staff

389645,NH Sants Barcelona, There s nothing that I didn t like , The staff were very friendly and helpful The location is ideal there is a metero station near by The cleaning staff cleaned the room properly We had no problems with our room I would highly recommend this hotel 
389646,NH Sants Barcelona, No english speaking channels on tv, Clean hotel nice staff cozy room healthy breakfast comfy bed 3 minutes walk to the metro and a bus stop opposite to the hotel door
389647,NH Sants Barcelona, Popping noises from the wall behind the WC were quite a big problem they kept waking me up in the middle of the night and in the morning before the alarm clock They were quite loud comparable to the noises of popcorn popping in the microwave It must have been the water dropping somehow from a large height in the pipes and splashing against some surface The staff offered me another room but I was already unpacked and didn t know whether the same problem didn t occur in other rooms The room had also very little sunlight as it had a window looking at a narrow backyard During the day it was almost completely dark I had to turn on the lights Breakfast buffet lacked vegetarian options e g vegetables or veggie sandwich paste if you wanted to put something on the sandwich there was only cheese and jam to choose from , The staff was extremely polite and helpful The room was cleaned quite thoroughly every day I haven t seen a single spider or bug not even a fly Location was good very close to the metro station Breakfast buffet had a quite good choice of fresh and dried fruit nuts cornflakes It was clearly visible that the last renovation in the hotel had been a few years ago but still the interior was quite fresh and comfortable 
389648,NH Sants Barcelona, Seems to be NH Hotel Group policy to provide slow internet connections in order to achieve extra revenues by getting people to sign up for the premium wife I paid the extra surcharge for faster internet 9 99Euros per day however internet was still not properly working Would expect more from a 4 star Hotel Design rather dry not recommended for couples Businesshotel , Spacious Room Very Clean Staff friendly Location close to the city center good connections

389650,NH Sants Barcelona, Single bedroom was extremely small hardly enough space to sit at the desk just behind there was the bed and bedside table TV not working no main room lamp but just a bedside one Also the shower not draining well All in all it could be much better Staff in the dining room is rushing to remove dishes from table I went to make a coffee and all the rest I left on the table disappeared twice This does not make the experience very comfortable , Breakfast was good bedroom and bathroom were clean and staff at the reception was fantastic 
389651,NH Sants Barcelona, Breakfast was extremely overpriced 20 per person per day So opted to eat elsewhere locally for breakfast although would have enjoyed it at the hotel, Location was perfect outside the hustle and bustle of the city center but seconds walk from the closest metro before a 10 min ride to the center there was a selection of lovely bars and restaurants around Rooms spotless and beds were like clouds to sleep in

389653,NH Sants Barcelona, I found the walls were very thin You could easily hear what was going on next door The cleaners seem to start very early around 6 00am and would pull beds chairs and tables very noisily along the floors I found it hard to sleep The staff were nice but there was no information given at check in in regards to breakfast times or where the bar or gym facilities were Also the city tax was a bit of a surprise charge when checking out , We were attending an event in the Nou Camp and the hotel was in a good location for that easily within walking distance close to metro stations 
389654,NH Sants Barcelona, Although in a silent corner not towards street side of the hotel there was a lot of noise from other rooms Even in middle of night it wasn t silent , Good location not too far out of city center and close to the main train station of Barcelona 
389655,NH Sants Barcelona, Breakfast replenishment a little slow bread ran out quickly Very small choice of fresh fruit mainly kiwi and oranges I asked for some bananas but they had none , Our double room was very comfortable comfy bed just what we needed after a long day sightseeing maid service excellent Friendly staff throughout
