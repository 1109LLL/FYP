275602,H10 Marina Barcelona, Every extra had a cost Very limited no extras other than the room For example no tea or coffee in the room only paid for at the bears Not a huge issue but would have been a nice touch , Good location and very comfortable bed 
275603,H10 Marina Barcelona, Small pool terrace not a lot of room around the pool If you re not that bothered about having a pool in the hotel go for a cheaper option City Tax added onto room price not stated on booking com, Staff were extremely helpful and friendly
275604,H10 Marina Barcelona, They argued with us regarding the city tax which said paid on your receipt that we received they said it was our problem and we had to pay again The nights we stayed we could ve booked direct for 200 less than what we paid using booking com so we re not happy The front Desk didn t know the right hand from the left many new people We headed up to the roof top bar only to find an unmanned vacuum cleaner sitting in the elevator leaving little room Once we arrived two people were playing football in the pool on an open top rooftop that was narrow causing concern for those around them to get hit or the ball to go over the edge and hit a person down below The beds were awful They were sunk down The shower glass moved and the tub is narrow with no mat The glass moves leaving risk for slipping or falling The tub had rust all around , nothing it was not worth the monies paid 
275605,H10 Marina Barcelona, I thought the shower was problematic because of it s open design It allowed the whole bathroom to get wet The staff s command of the English language was weak so there direction to near by locations were vague or hard to understand The breakfast options should exclud some American options like French toast or waffles , The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean I liked the design and how the room was decorated The spa services were good 
275606,H10 Marina Barcelona, I specifically contacted the hotel to ask for something special as it was a honeymoon They replied saying that they would do this and then arrived with nothing I was a little dissapointed that they had agreed to do it so I didnt bother myself and then was a bit let down , Very clean and nice hotel
275607,H10 Marina Barcelona, Our bedroom was directly opposite the lifts which meant that we were woken up every night and morning by people in the corridor More so on the last 2 nights as there was a party of around 10 men who had arrived and were staying on our floor so at around 3am each night we were woken up by them But luckily it was the last couple of days and not for the whole stay , Hotel was in a great location and the staff were really friendly 
275608,H10 Marina Barcelona, I really disliked that I was billed 425 euros for getting my clothing cleaned I only wanted some items to be thrown in the washer instead they ironed and cleaned each piece and handed me a huge bill during checkout I feel that I should have been informed of the price before hand 425 EUROS when I only wanted clean clothes ,No Positive
275609,H10 Marina Barcelona, Expensive I have seen puddles bigger than the pool Booking com lowered the price after my booking so I paid a lot more, Great rooms and nice breakfast Staff very friendly Close to port Olimpic with great bars and restaurants
275610,H10 Marina Barcelona, Gym way too small Air con in the room not working during our stay, Pool area is great Roms are clean andcomfortable location is very good Staffan is very friendly 
275611,H10 Marina Barcelona, When booking we chose to pay a little extra because of proximity to the beach and the design the pools looked amazing Much farther from the beach than we thought What was described as an 11 minute walk was in actuality more like 30 minutes through some winding parks and confusing cross roads No facilities in room and no shop no ice machine no vending machines at all When my partner needed ice for her ankle I had to go buy some from the gas station We had to steal coffee from a business convention as there were no coffee facilities in the room or in the lobby and staff were often absent It was hot but we had no fridge and no way to keep drinks cold The skyline pool looks fabulous but in actuality it only looks over a small portion of the skyline enclosed on three sides and the pool was only open to 7pm which was impractical The indoor pool cost extra 16 euros per day , The design was modern and appealing The hotel was easy to find 
275612,H10 Marina Barcelona, Unfriendly staff Room not ready on check in at 1 pm despite Privilege status Most TV channels do not work Grinder noise in the corridor from 9 am I was working in my room despite Do Not Disturb sign on the door Unwilling to extend check out by one hour Bottom line never again ,No Positive
275613,H10 Marina Barcelona, Air con in room was poor Spa changing rooms very basic but did the job , We were fortunate to be Privileged guests and had access to the Club Lounge with added benefits was worth the extra money Lovely food and cocktails Roof Terrace pool and bar was lovely though city views were not outstanding in my opinion 
275614,H10 Marina Barcelona, It was a little bit off the beaten track and I think the hotel would benefit from its own little shuttle bus to take guests into Barcelona We had quite a long walk with a disabled person to get to the city tourism buses There is a taxi rank by the hotel which is good but it becomes a bit expensive when you have to use them all the time and we did use them a lot especially when it was raining , The hotel was beautiful and had a lovely spa little gym roof top terrace with pool and bar and the staff were above excellent in manner and helpfulness The park nearby was lovely and had a spectacular water feature with a statue of Bodecea on top The zoo was also just two blocks away 
275615,H10 Marina Barcelona, The lack of taxi facilities and being able to call a cab from the hotel, The bed was comfy The hotel finishings were modern and sophisticated The bathroom was nice and spacious
275616,H10 Marina Barcelona, Immediate locality was mixed hotel backs onto large industrial building our room faced this Beds were fairly hard , Hotel is clean and modern good service Very much a business type hotel with facilities Free Wifi was good throughout the hotel Pool and sun terrace on roof provided sea views Close to public transport metro bus station Good value considering it was F1 weekend 
275617,H10 Marina Barcelona, Views from the hotel are not great Hotel name says Mariana thinking it would be near but its not , hotel is in the local residents area so away from the tourist area 10min walk to the beach 2min walk to the underground station
275618,H10 Marina Barcelona, The window in the room can not be opened because it s fixed , Location is really good The beach and the city centre are also easily accessible Really kind staff 
275619,H10 Marina Barcelona, Only thing we were disappointed with was our room wasn t cleaned on our second day meaning we didn t have fresh towels until we notified reception Also our room wasn t cleaned until 4 5 o clock everyday and it made it more of an inconvenience as we were getting ready to go out for the night , We loved our stay and couldn t be happier with our room and facilities We felt so luxurious and looked after very well from the staff 
275620,H10 Marina Barcelona, The rooms were old No douche just a douche bad combo Warm water was not working properly Location was in the middle of a residential area with very limited shops or restaurants ,No Positive
275621,H10 Marina Barcelona, The buffet breakfast could have been to a higher standard , The staff were considerate and very professional The evening dining options were excellent 
275622,H10 Marina Barcelona, How can this establishment be a 4 hotel This was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at You can hear everything from outside from the neighbors and from the corridor The door to the staircase was right across my room The hotel should use some grease on the door as it creak like it has never seen any lubricant Dampening the noise of the door when it closes would be advisable too The bed was lumpy the bath tub dirty ,No Positive
275623,H10 Marina Barcelona, Bed was so comfortable although asking for 2 single beds and being given a double was dissapointing The prices at the bar are so expensive also Only other thing was the location was in quite a residential looking area but within a 15 minute walk you can be at the beach, The spa is lovely the staff are friendly the hotel smelt so nice the bed was so comfortable the rooftop pool was a great area It was an overall great hotel 
275624,H10 Marina Barcelona, Rooftop under construction and supposedly still useable but the bar was closed and construction equipment littered everywhere unusable Woken up from Construction noise from above my room in the morning Housekeeping staff was very loud in hallway starting from around 8 despite the sleeping sign we hung on the door facing the hall Not offered the standard welcome drink at check in , Recently Updated room in modern style Comfortable pillows 
275625,H10 Marina Barcelona, First of all this is not a 4 star hotel The furnishings in the room looked old and has poor facilities The air condition in our room didn t work and after complaining to the reception they didn t fix it We had to sleep in a sauna While we were resting suddenly housekeeping entered the room unannounced Moreover there were hair all over the bed and the floor was dirty We had to keep the window open for some air because it was suffocating There was no kettle or coffee making facilties neither sleepers on the floor I have paid lesser and got much much better facilities in other hotels Don t be tempted by the offer its a sham , The lobby was nice The room was big and the bathroom was very big and clean We got an early check in and the reception staff was nice 
275626,H10 Marina Barcelona, Surrounding area and very thin walls especially with very drunk neighbours who keep you awake till 5am, The hotel itself was lovely nice and clean with nice polite staff the only downfall is a H10 should not be located where this one is there is nothing nearby also the area is quite scruffy there is the metro 5 mins walk away which is easy enough to use and takes you everywhere which is great however the surrounding area is still not what I would of expected for the location of a H10 I personally would not of liked to walk from the metro to the hotel at night on my own
275627,H10 Marina Barcelona, Nothing , Everything Recommend getting a privilege room lots of good extras and benefits Service was all amazing Anti stress massage also very good Only 30 from airport 
275628,H10 Marina Barcelona, Tea and coffee facilities We had to hire a kettle We would have loved a balcony especially as roof terrace not open all the time We would have loved the pool on the terrace to have been heated , Lovely room and lovely bathroom We left our converter plug at home and hotel offered us one to use Nice clean bed linen and room cleaned each day Had a lovely hour in the spa 
275629,H10 Marina Barcelona, Too noise The corredor floor outside the rooms should have carpet I started to hear people walking since 6 00am specially the girls with heels I couldn t sleep , Well located Nice staff Clean and fair price 
275630,H10 Marina Barcelona, Rooms need updating Only thing that let the whole hotel down other than that it was top notch , Spa is great the hotel has a great look Breakfast was comprehensive and very nice 
275631,H10 Marina Barcelona, The nowadays normal machine made coffee at breakfast boring but acceptable Otherwise nothing to grumble about , Generally efficient and comfortable modern hotel near seaside 10 mins to Port Olimpico and around 15 20 mins walk to Cathedral and other city centre stuff Nice medium sized room big bathroom little stuffy but I didn t use the a c Breakfast very comprehensive and obviously geared to tourist market even running to an acceptable British breakfast if needed Staff helpful and friendly There is a spa and bar but didn t have time to try either 
275632,H10 Marina Barcelona, There is no kettle in the room and u have to pay extra fee for it and I have never seen something like that before but the fee is very simple 2 5 , Comfort clean and in good location and near to metro station and u can access the centre easily
275633,H10 Marina Barcelona, The artificial lighting of the room is weak at night need to have more light but the natural light is great in the room Some of bathroom accessories are of poor metal quality, Staff are very cooperative very nice and very helpful Location is good 10 minutes walk to the beach and tourist bus station Location of my room in the six floor with city view in front was great Shower was great
275634,H10 Marina Barcelona,No Negative, H10 hotels are somewhat expensive in high season but in the winter they are almost unbeatable in price quality Compared to a generic 4 hotel this one delivers fantastic service Welcome drink is a nice touch for example 
275635,H10 Marina Barcelona, the privilege room in the evening the food was cold and little options , The jacuzzi in the junior suite the food in the breakfast was excellent and Marc from the reception is very helpful 
275636,H10 Marina Barcelona, The walls are quite thin and you can hear everything going on the next door or in the corridor , Staff was extremely friendly and helpful Rooms are a good size comfy beds and the bathrooms are very clean 
275637,H10 Marina Barcelona, Bathroom and shower need renovating Tea and coffee making facilities available at small extra cost and we asked for them twice and were told each time that they d run out of them, Beautiful spa Room and bed nice
275638,H10 Marina Barcelona, The floor from the shower zone and the bathroom from the spa were kind of a mess not really clean Even the cost of the spa is not high I think that it should be lower for the hotel clients , The breakfast was really good plenty of options even diet ones The room was really nice with three different types of pillow to choose The bed is super comfy the mattress would need a replacement though The staff is really kind The pools jacuzzi and the saunas from the spa and the gym are highly recommended 
275639,H10 Marina Barcelona,No Negative, The beds and pillows are ridiculously comfortable The tv was very big which you dont normally get in other hotels The staff are very helpful I even got a birthday even though i didnt tell them its my birthday which just go to show the level of service at this hotel 
275640,H10 Marina Barcelona, Having to pay 16 per person for the Spa everyday Would be better if it was 16 per person per stay , The spacious room The cleanliness of it all The helpfulness of staff
275641,H10 Marina Barcelona, They could improve the cleanliness of the room The sheets were not changed when they were dirty First day I found hair in the bathroom the tables were quite dirty and the minibar full of dust Also in the morning about 9 10am the cleaning staff was really loud we heard a lot of noise and we couldn t sleep longer When I booked I asked for an earlier check in because our flight arrived at 7 am and they told us we can only check in at 2 pm However after 4 hours waiting at the airport we could check in at 12 I really hoped that a 4 star hotel can manage an earlier check in Unfortunately the Skyline Bar from 8th floor was closed so we couldn t enjoy the view , I really liked the location of the hotel the room was really spacious for a Standard double room the bed was big and comfy We had minibar but no coffee or tea facilities We had tasting menu for New Years Eve which was delicious and the staff payed really good attention at our table 
275642,H10 Marina Barcelona, Flight was cancelled and we had to get a flight the following day so we missed one night The hotel weren t very accommodating or helpful in refunding the one night stay or offering any form of compensation , Privilege suite and amenities were great 
275643,H10 Marina Barcelona, HAVING TO COME HOME, THE LOCATION WAS EXCELLENT 2 MINUTE WALK FROM THE MAIN RED LINE FOR THE METRO AND A TEN MINUTE WALK TO LA SAGRADA OR THE MARINA THE HOTEL FACILITIES WERE 1st CLASS 
275644,H10 Marina Barcelona, Money is spent on the glossy communal areas and the rooms are sub standard There is no sound insulation between rooms paper thin walls We had to change room due to noisy neighbours Next room sound insulation no better This hotel would be a classed as less than a budget hotel in the UK no sound insulation between rooms room was not clean and beds were uncomfortable Booking com assured us that this room accommodates 3 adults but there is only a put up bed for the 3rd which was horribly uncomfortable with absolute minimum bedding and no duvet Nasty , Barcelona is a wonderful city However the area where this hotel is situated is covered in graffiti looks run down and feels unsafe The staff were friendly and helpful unfortunately not a good enough reason to stay at this hotel 
275645,H10 Marina Barcelona, Reception staff came across rude and uninterested Breakfast price was over the top as well as any extras or the use of the Spa , The hotel had good facilities the staff at the spa was helpful good location
275646,H10 Marina Barcelona, M A, Beautiful hotel with polite and helpful staff The lovely rooms we had theclenliness the decor and location were all excellent and made this hotel a fine choice I will certainly be returning to this hotel 
275647,H10 Marina Barcelona, Area abit urban nothing much around but not far from metro to centre air con didn t work just had to leave window open, Nice clean hotel good beds and big sized room 
275648,H10 Marina Barcelona, Just a small niggle the beds were quite firm so had an achy back of a morning , Great location just a 12 min walk to the marina or 20 mins the other way to the beautiful gothic church quarter and gaudi buildings Great people amazing food 
275649,H10 Marina Barcelona, The roof top bar was closed for refurb and we were not told which was disappointing , Good easy access to city centre many attractions and to the beach We walked everywhere and it was no issue with few bars restaurants etc close by and 20 30 minutes stroll to main areas 
275650,H10 Marina Barcelona, absolutely nothing, absolutely everything our room was excellent and the privilege idea is fantastic and we took full advantage of the privilege bar too 
275651,H10 Marina Barcelona, Beds a little hard for us , Conveniently located Welcoming staff Efficiently run Good breakfast and delicious reasonably priced evening meal in the restaurant 
275652,H10 Marina Barcelona, Mattresses need to be replaced one was quite uncomfortable, Location was very nice close to the beach spa facilities nice if slightly over priced very good breakfast
275653,H10 Marina Barcelona, Very overpriced and average Wouldn t stay here again The building looked like all the rest apart from the others had graffiti everywhere felt a bit weary in this area ,No Positive
275654,H10 Marina Barcelona, Upstairs pool area a disappointment as under construction Pool not heated but lovely view , Breakfast was incredible We upgraded to premium room and this was excellent Free mini bar free lounge with drink and nibbles and sweets 
275655,H10 Marina Barcelona, During the day it is getting really hot in the room We were on the 9 floor facing east and as soon as the sun rises you can start feeling the heat We had to use the aircon all the time and it was November , The bed in the Junior suite was so spacious and comfortable The TV was big and you can swirl it towards the bed and kids channel were included The location is good and you are quite close to the Metro 
275656,H10 Marina Barcelona, No coffee making facilities in room There was coffee available in the dining room but you had to explicitly ask for a cup to take back to your room Dinner was average international cooking Not bad but totally indistinguishable from any other hotel of the same type And seriously 1 90 for an espresso in a city where 1 00 is the standard , Clean rooms friendly staff and a great location in Barcelona 
275657,H10 Marina Barcelona, Swimming pool on roof top not open disappointing considering the weather and no email from hotel in advance Also having to pay for swimming pool inside poor customer service really , Location and how clean hotel was
275658,H10 Marina Barcelona, Just didn t seem as plush as I expected for the money paid Roof terrace fine but looks a lot bigger and impressive in the photos online , Bed very comfy and all hotel very clean and well maintained 
275659,H10 Marina Barcelona, No taxi s available through reception We had to walk out to find one ourselves , The location was excellent close to the beach bars and restaurants 
275660,H10 Marina Barcelona, Food is a bit pricey There are some excellent places to eat one or two side street off every main road , Staff are excellent Hotel is easy to get to from airport as long as you don t mind train metro journey s It takes 10 minutes to walk to sea front and 30 minutes to city centre Bikes are available by the hotel 
275661,H10 Marina Barcelona, It couldn t have been any better , Fantastic customer service On check in and after one employee in particular Paula went above and beyond to make our stay exceptional The room was clean comfortable and had a spectacular view of the city The breakfast was excellent One of the largest and most complete that we have seen in our European travels Great hotel 
275662,H10 Marina Barcelona, I didn t realise the privalige access included a free lounge would have made more use of this to have a drink before heading out on an evening It wasn t really explained at the desk what was included Probably my own fault but as it did say on the booking , The selection at breakfast was the widest I have ever seen Room was excellent glad we went for a suite over the standard double as the cost difference was minimal 
275663,H10 Marina Barcelona, Nothing , We were moved to H10 Port Vell because some rooms were flooded by pool waters at H10 Marina Hotel so the review is of H10 Port Vell Fantastic hotel right near Port Vell Marina area Loved everything Great breakfast too 
275664,H10 Marina Barcelona, Men s changing rooms in the spa very small , Friendly staff always willing to help Great spa Breakfast was very good All drinks and food at very reasonable prices
275665,H10 Marina Barcelona, The room was small The bed uncomfortable The towels grey A plastic undersheet is a no go The iron and ironing board were poor and had to be requested from reception They couldn t provide a proper hairdryer , They loaned us umbrellas 
275666,H10 Marina Barcelona, Privilege lounge could be improved with some music , Breakfast was so worth it Close to the beach and metro was only 2 minutes away Walking distance to Sagrada familia The crew was outstanding
275667,H10 Marina Barcelona, for 4 hotel not value for money paid bar has good position and view however mojitos were disgusting for 8 euros In overall classic hotel nothing special If you preffer to be closest to the beach this can be an option, a bar on the 8th floor if you like the position near the beach then its plus otherwise is out of Barcelona city life clean on the acceptable level
275668,H10 Marina Barcelona, Hard mattresses whole property is shabby around the edges soul less privilege lounge with poor food also not properly staffed haughty receptionists crappy location , Not an awful lot 
275669,H10 Marina Barcelona, Expensive No shade on rooftop , Close to beach Staff at reception very helpful Close to metro Watch the taxi drivers they all charge a different amount Should be no more than Euro 10 from La Rambala 
275670,H10 Marina Barcelona, Was one of the worst hotel experiences I had in a while Asked to pay extra 30 for a 3yo had to drag our bags to the 9th floor no bell man and then the hotel room was very warm in the afternoon because the air conditioning was not effective When checking out asked for a taxi and I was told to walk to the taxi about 1 min walk dragging 4 bags and 2 young children ,No Positive
275671,H10 Marina Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent room great staff and superb breakfast Very good location on this ocassion just 4 stops on the metro to the conference centre Great pool bar on level 8 This is my second stay here and this will be my first choice when I return to Barcelona Excellent local restaurants nearby check trip advisor 
275672,H10 Marina Barcelona, Tiny roof top swimming pool which looked deceptive on booking com It s a baby pool can t swim We didn t use the spa facility as they would charge 16 Euro just to use the pool jacuzzi and steam room and 4 euros more for shower in the Spa It was a small pool The roof top pool didn t even have a shower facility Breakfast expensive 18 euros per person We went to coffee shop nearby which costed us 5euro Not sure if would go back again, Room comfort lounge and bar
275673,H10 Marina Barcelona, A little out the way And roof terrace seemed smaller than on the pictures, The hotel was generally very good The staff helpful and smart Would recommend to friends 
275674,H10 Marina Barcelona, The pool wasn t big enough not enough space around the pool Having to pay for a shower due to late flight home After paying nearly 600 for only three nights found this very unfair , Staff spa and bed
275675,H10 Marina Barcelona, The worst in this hotel must have been the security One of the guests sitting in the breakfast room were robbed from their bag by intruders They got past the reception and past the personnel from the breakfast Second worst are the facilities that are advertised with but actually cost quite some money How about EUR 16 a day for access to the indoor pool or EUR 10 an hour for a late check out even for Booking com Genius members All summed up I would never come back again and would advice people against going , The location is great and close to the beaches of Barcelona 
275676,H10 Marina Barcelona, The view from our room some ugly pavements was depressing The reception staff was bored and just could not try and look interested They did not even looked for a taxi when we had to go to the Olimpic harbour We ended up walking and it was actually cool but they were not supposed to know that When we took our suitcases to eventually go to the airport they failed to deliver again The charming helpful and English speaking porter did that So all in all down with the reception staff They should go somewhere and learn to be professional The grounds around the hotel were pretty ugly , The pool was amazing It was also very conveniently located for the Port Olimpic a mere 10 min walk away The room service food was great the food arrived quickly as well and the waiter was nice The beds were so comfy I had a bad back from staying in a horrible hotel in Costa Brava and a night s sleep in the magic bed in H10 really helped The ground floor looked rather nice We had to store our suitcases to go and spend 6 hours away after checkout then come back It was free and the staff that stored the luggage and helped find a taxi could not have been more helpful The breakfast room was really nice Great choice of fresh fruit tasty eggs yummy Spanish croissants The staff was nice as well 
275677,H10 Marina Barcelona, Location our room was on a road and not well insulated so heard the traffic The people in the room next door room 306 were awake and making a lot of noise at 06 30 so can only assume their is not much soundproofing between the rooms either could hear their shower running , The beds were comfortable
275678,H10 Marina Barcelona, Nothing Was fantastic , Hotel was fantastic great facilities friendly staff and so clean was a lovely place to stay with a roof top swimming pool it s located no far from Barcelona beach and was in a great location for all local transport to be able to visit the beautiful city
275679,H10 Marina Barcelona, The view from the window let us down On booking we asked top floors and had been given a room on 1st floor And someone opened the door during the night when we were sleeping what s going on , Great stuff
275680,H10 Marina Barcelona, Hard to get sunbeds in the roof top pool and the location was a bit rough behind the hotel, Very friendly staff and great facilities Arrived early and let us check in as soon as we got there
275681,H10 Marina Barcelona, Why have a 3 4 length bath instead of a walk in shower Bathrooms looked tired , Area was good beach and Port Olympic within easy reach City centre only a slightly longer walk 
275682,H10 Marina Barcelona, Rude staff advertised roof pool is extremely small advertised view from said pool was wrong no you cannot see the ocean from the roof as suggested in the pictures , Room very comfortable and clean 
275683,H10 Marina Barcelona, not much in the immediate vicinity of the hotel but everything is just a short walk away No kettle in the room although we didnt ask for one so perhaps it would have been given on request but a nespresso machine is provided , Extra large bed offered for a double room was great and very comfy The hotel is a ten minute walk to the beach and a five minute walk from nice cafes to eat in so great location Safe area we walked late at night back to the hotel from the marina and felt safe Plenty of useful shops and 24 hour pharmacies nearby The nearest metro stations are each a five minute walk away in either of two directions with quick access to key areas in the city 
275684,H10 Marina Barcelona, Reception staff didn t allow work related visitors to come to room without making them sign Is this a hostel for teenagers , Large windows in suite Bright Comfortable Pleasant decor Comfortable bed Clean Quiet 
275685,H10 Marina Barcelona, Although massive selection of food at breakfast would have appreciated a smaller cheaper option ie just continental, Immaculately clean and well equipped room
275686,H10 Marina Barcelona, I thought the restaurant was very hot when eating in the evening The pool on the top was very small for such a large hotel Pillows could do with updating, Rooms were spacious Staff were helpful and friendly Victor in the roof top bar was a great entertainer and made everybody laugh Breakfast was good much better than evening meal
275687,H10 Marina Barcelona, Can t think of any , The whole experience in the hotel was just very relaxing We take an increasing number of trips a year and so appreciate a relaxed environment 
275688,H10 Marina Barcelona, We booked a junior privilege suit however this was not as anticipated it was nice but did not look at all like the pictures advertised there was no balcony , Breakfast was excellent staff efficient on check in good location in walking distance of the port Taxi ride to las rambalas
275689,H10 Marina Barcelona, paid extra for upgrade only to find out that rooms below us had a balcony and we did not breakfast hot food was mainly cold at what ever time we sat , clean and comfortable
275690,H10 Marina Barcelona, Never go to this hotel The night shift staff were terrible especially one particular young man and one young lady who pretended to be a manager of that young man for the purpose of assisting that young man in forcing me to prepay all the costs for my intended whole stay I checked in and provided my credit card as guaranty as required by the check in staff on the first night but that young man then for two consecutive nights bugged me for full prepayment claiming that the check in staff had been wrong and he must have my prepayment I asked him to get his manager calling me or leaving me a note for confirmation of such rule but never was there such a confirmation The young man assisted by the young lady finally succeeded in getting my prepayment by withholding my doorkey threatening addtional charges for a ridiculous claim menacing calling in the police and defeating any good impression I could have with the hotel I then realized that it was the same young man who had been scolded by a tour guide for his bad services to his group at the night of my arrival ,No Positive
275691,H10 Marina Barcelona, Room was basic for the money terrible hairdryer no view looked out onto an office block Pool terrace was nice but absolutely no decent view Drinks were ridiculously expensive 20 euros for gin tonic and larger , The staff were very friendly and efficient
275692,H10 Marina Barcelona, Foolish policies like no water with buffet without payment Poor English speaking staff water too cold in pools, value for money good entertainment for kids
275693,H10 Marina Barcelona, twin beds pushed together to make a double bed that kept separating during the night , nice property clean very quiet area not far from town and beech
275694,H10 Marina Barcelona, Paying to use the indoor pool The pool on roof is small and not like the photos The food isn t much choice The chips are much cheaper in the bar inside downstairs than by the pool bar The roof terrace bar is the same as the pool bar The gym is tiny Pool bar stuff are quite rude They have welcome drinks and sweets but only selected people get them dependant on who checks you in , Location is good rooms spacious
275695,H10 Marina Barcelona, Nothing, Service was excellent from arrival to departure Rooftop pool great Bar prices very good Bed incredibly comfortable and huge Free glass of cava and welcome cocktail on arrival 
275696,H10 Marina Barcelona, Not being able to take the privilege drinks to the pool, Comfy clean and in a good location to the beach and las ramblas Easy to get to all major tourist places
275697,H10 Marina Barcelona, 2 single bed pushed together to make one but matrress not zip together so every morning we would wake up with a hole in between us a bit annoying but comfy beds anyways, Staff very friendly service with a smile would for sure come back as location superb
275698,H10 Marina Barcelona, I had noted when booking it was our honeymoon but receptionist had no idea When I mentioned it she said they normally do something nice but because they didn t know there was nothing that could be done Breakfast was expensive 18 per person per day and was not worth it at all , The bar staff in the evening were very nice 
275699,H10 Marina Barcelona, Wasn t offered a welcome drink on arrival wondered if it was because we booked through a third party and not direct with hotel, Lovely hotel location perfect staff pleasant value for money
275700,H10 Marina Barcelona, too cold temp of water in the outside pool to swim in this season , Staff was so friendly and price is definitely reasonable Location is fine not close enough but OK 
275701,H10 Marina Barcelona, Our room was on the first level view was not great it was also a little Noisey we would have preferred to stay higher up but we re only there for 3 nights so no point in moving , Location was not too far from the centre Hotel was nice and clean staff were friendly and very helpful There were lovely cafes for breakfasts instead of the hotel breakfast as we didn t include that in booking and close to the metro station 
275702,H10 Marina Barcelona, The mini bar was in a cupboard and was burning the wood kept having to turn it off to get rid of the smell of burning wood views could have been better Restaurant was awful I know me and my girlfriend turned up a bit later on in the day but they didn t bother with presentation the starter was enormous so we didn t finish it to leave room for the mains and the waiter was really quite nasty to my girlfriend about the left food the mains were really bad I had to wait 10 minutes to be able to eat mine as it came out boiling hot and just plonked on a plate my girlfriends was just horrendous do not know what they were trying to do with that once we had finished we were rushed off the table and was going to mention the issues but the waiter was so cold thought what s the point he just wants to finish , The reception staff were lovely big rooms and the spa was really pleasant place to unwind 
275703,H10 Marina Barcelona, They charged me twice for my room Had to see reception 3 times to resolve this issue and wait in line for 20mins each time There was not even an apology for this mistake I would recommend people to avoid this hotel ,No Positive
275704,H10 Marina Barcelona, Bed was very hard Privilege bar lacked variety Only 1 breakfast tea bag in room per day Had to come home , Pretty much everything Great location for all attractions Good value menu
275705,H10 Marina Barcelona, They really do everything to suck more money out of the tourists in this hotel Wouldn t recommend it one of the worst service 4star hotels I have been staying at , Location was great
275706,H10 Marina Barcelona, Nothing, The Location was great less than a 10 Min walk to the beach It was also walking distance from La familia Sagrada It was less than 15 mins on the Metro to Las Ramblas The Staff was was polite and Helpful The Breakfast was amazing so much variety 
275707,H10 Marina Barcelona, We entered the room and was very disappointed with it We asked for upgrade and were fine to pay extra however non was available We asked to check out 10 min after check in and hotel insisted we pay for one night in any case which we did ,No Positive
275708,H10 Marina Barcelona, I was sad because the rooftop pool was closed but I am sure I will enjoy it next time in full summer , Very quiet location 10 min walk to the beach I liked everything the hotel the room and the friendly staff Especially Inger and Juan Antonio very nice and helpful 
275709,H10 Marina Barcelona, Single room can be very small like 1007 With no place for luggage for example Soundproofing also can be low quality , H10 is nicely location in the centre of Barcelona Two metro stations nearby sea harbour in walk distance One of the most rich breakfast buffet I got 
275710,H10 Marina Barcelona,No Negative, The bed is super comfy the bedroom really spacious Bathroom ok plenty of basic toiletries Dudb t have brekkie so i can t give any opinionon the food 
275711,H10 Marina Barcelona, For someone looking for central location it is a bit far from downtown around 15 minutes by cab but since that wasn t the purpose of my trip it didn t matter But if its the location you need for your work it is perfect The mattress might also seem hard for some people but it was good quality so I didn t mind Only other tiny drawback tough to find with this hotel really it was really a beautiful hotel with an economy price is that the walls seemed a bit thin but nothing that a set of earplugs couldn t overcome Street noise was minimal even from the third floor , Extensive breakfast buffet Nothing fantastic but everything you could want Also gluten free rolls important for those with gluten intolerance I also didn t expect a full assortment of supplies in the bathroom at this price level Location was a five minute walk from the university where my meeting was located I also wasn t expecting a pool in the hotel though I didn t have time to try it out 
275712,H10 Marina Barcelona, The only thing we were truly gutted about was the rooftop bar was not open can only assume it is a seasonal , We couldn t have been more pleased with our stay here the staff were unbelievably friendly and went above and beyond to help us out with everything We paid for breakfast when booking the hotel and it was definitely worth it so many options and everything was truly delicious Also highly recommend using the spa 9 per person for an hour very relaxing way to spend a morning evening The cleanliness off the hotel and rooms were 10 10 and the hotel room itself was spacious bed was huge with a lovely bathroom We were very sad to have to leave and would definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers 
275713,H10 Marina Barcelona, Unfortunately there was a problem with the spa pools so they were cold which was a shame however the sauna steam rooms and heated loungers were great There was also no mini bar list or bottle opener in the room , The room was great very spacious with massive bed big TV and nice clean bathroom with many extras provided Good location L ess than 10min walk from the marina with a long strip of restaurants on one side a delicious little Italian and many traditional ones and bars and clubs on the other the main Barcelona clubs where you will be directed for nightlife on tripadvisor or by local promoters It is a 2min walk from two shops where you can rent bikes to explore the whole of Barcelona easily It is also very close to the parc de la ciutedella with a beautiful fountain sculptures zoo and lake which you can hire a boat on Also very easy to access Sagrada familia from here straight down Av diagonal or walk to the gothic quarter and Ramblas Also fairly easy to get to from the airport via public transport via one train then metro 6 each or 35 via taxi 
275714,H10 Marina Barcelona,No Negative, absolutely everything we are just looking forward to our next visit we normally visit alone but took a friend this time and he absolutely loved everything about it too see ya soon 
275715,H10 Marina Barcelona, Please see comment above Not happy , No water available Only 2 small bottles in the minibar which were not replaced by the cleaning staff the following day so on the second night I had to walk round barcelona for 2 hours trying to find a shop The receptionist would not give me any water and had none to sell there was no vending machine and the hotel did not sell water THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO EASILY ACCESS WATER this is NOT what I expect from a 4 star hotel and ruined my experience 
275716,H10 Marina Barcelona, Nothing Everything was brilliant , Our stay was AMAZING Didn t want to leave Have never been to a hotel quite like it They could big up the hotel a lot more It s not shown how amazing it really is Definitely will reccomend and go back again 
275717,H10 Marina Barcelona, Location not quite as close to beach as name suggests , Enjoyable stay at comfortable hotel with pleasant helpful staff We enjoyed soaking up the winter sun on the roof terrace Hotel will supply kettle where requested 
275718,H10 Marina Barcelona, we had a bad view and the room was next to the fire exit housekeepers storage so it was very noisy early in the morning we asked for an iron and it took them 30 mins to bring it up they also had a technical problem so we didn t have hot water for the whole day, location was ok just 5 mins walk from port olimpic
275719,H10 Marina Barcelona, The indoor welness pool was not usable due to construction works I would not expect this kind of work at this moment of the year but do understand that it has to be done sometime , At arrival we were offered a glass of cava which was nice Also the kids were not forgotten and they were offered a glass of orange juice together with a varied choice of candies Very nice people in the hotel always with a smile and ready to help Very varied breakfast with lots of choice lots of fresh fruit just unfortunate they had no water with gas We had a room on the 9 th floor which gave a very nice view over Barcelona 
275720,H10 Marina Barcelona, Was offered complimentary Cava and fruit on arrival due to spa closure Had to ask on three occasions we eventually got it when we got back to our room at about midnight on the last 2nd night , Nice modern clean hotel 5mins from Metro Had a privilege room with terrace which was lovely 
275721,H10 Marina Barcelona, I specifically phoned in the day before to ensure I received a double bed rather than 2 twins I arrived to two twin beds They then tried to convince me to pay extra to upgrade After refusing so they said due to their fault they would upgrade me free of charge All they did was move me to a different room and pushed 2 twin beds together As a result my partner and I slept in the crack of the bed the entire night Due to renovations neither the rooftop bar or the spa facilities were available both of which are big pulls for my reason for booking The fact that they were out of use was only brought to my attention after arrival , The staff were friendly and it is easy to catch taxis from the hotel
275722,H10 Marina Barcelona, The lack of soundproofing was very notable with quiet talking clearly audible from the adjoining rooms Some of the facilities were closed during our stay , The rooms were fairly spacious with good fittings bed bathroom tv etc 
275723,H10 Marina Barcelona, A big hotel and you feld that The staff was polite But we missed a bit of the personal touch of the staff they didn t look very pleased with there job , breakfast was very nice good products and fresh 
275724,H10 Marina Barcelona, Stag party noise and drunkeness inevitable spoilt it a little but acceptable in the scheme of things sound proofing would be a help you could hear everything going on in the next room wifi very poor in the room , Rooms very good plenty of toiletries in case you had forgotten anything clean and tidy clean crip bedding Food drink very nice wifi in reception worked well 
275725,H10 Marina Barcelona,No Negative, The privilege junior suite rooms and restaurant Spacious rooms with good facilities Excellent choice of food a buffet High quality of food at dinner 
275726,H10 Marina Barcelona, repeated problems with room key to door not working requiring multiple trips back down the elevator to reception and visits from key technician It took about 5 days to sort out but the key and lock eventually worked , nice rooms with plenty of space BreakFast 18euros each but very good 
275727,H10 Marina Barcelona, In spite of the name do not expect to see the Mediteranian it is two blocks away The name is from the street It iss behind the 1992 Olympic village from the sea The coffee with breakfast is disappointing if you take milk and no sugar On the 3rd morning we settled on americano with no milk that was the only way we could get rid of a sweet taste we both dislike , The location is far enough out of the bustle to be quiet and close enough for convenience We are walkers so we walked to many of the attractions and to catch the sightseeing busses which we used to get to the tourist destinations Bus and Metro connections are close for those that do not want to walk so much Breakfast is not cheap but cannot be beaten for quality and variety 
275728,H10 Marina Barcelona, Staff overcharging for items not consumed E g we did not have drinks and we were charged Signed receipt of just a sandwich was proof that we did not order drinks So beware guys check your itemised receipts well , Proximity to the beach nice decor very comfortable beds very impressed Cleaning staff are great 
275729,H10 Marina Barcelona, Had to pay for a kettle tea coffee Although only cost 2 5 so not a big inconvenience , Spa indoor pool enjoyed by all the family Breakfast was fantastic Great choice Room service was very efficient good value for money

275731,H10 Marina Barcelona, Nothing , We were immediately upgraded to a junior suite as it was a family holiday for my dad s special birthday The room was very comfortable the staff were fantastic Very friendly from the minute we arrived the meet and greet were so welcoming we knew immediately we would enjoy our stay here We were given complimentary cava and fruit on our first day and also on our fourth nite We had a fantastic view over the city beach from our top floor room The weather wasn t great during our stay but we did a lot of sightseeing a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes We had breakfast in the hotel each morning this was included and was very good a fantastic choice of food to set u up for the day We ate in the restaurant for dinner and also in the bar and food was also highly recommended The bar staff were so friendly and looked after us each evening On the last day I had a problem with my booking passes on my phone and the reception staff kindly assisted with printing these off for me I would have no hesitations to highly recommend this hotel in Barcelona and would most definitely return in near future 
275732,H10 Marina Barcelona, Having to wait 3 1 2 hrs to get into our room Staff at reception had no idea where the occupants of the room were their belongings were still inside our their room We were told we get a special gift for the inconvenience which turned out to be no more that you would get having booked a clubroom anyway we even had to ask for that to be delivered to our room , The breakfast the staff there 
275733,H10 Marina Barcelona, The breakfast Sunday we had to queue which was ok apart from when we finally got shown to the table there was not so much as a sorry for the delay or even a good morning If your hotel is let down anywhere it is with your waiting staff very unfriendly , The Hotel facilities Reception staff were super helpful so was the porter 
275734,H10 Marina Barcelona, Only slight thing jacuzzi was cold and not as relaxing as it would have been if it was warmer , Privilege rooms are excellent Well worth the upgrade 
275735,H10 Marina Barcelona, Tidiness of the rooms There was dust in the corners of the room and on other obvious places The coffee wasn t good For a 4 star hotel it shouldn t come out of a machine The coffee should be fresh Also the noisy above our room was disturbing They moved chairs and tables of the pool area at 11 pm Impossible to get some sleep , The beds were terrific and very comfortable Also the breakfast buffet was good The staff at the reception were helpful and very friendly 
275736,H10 Marina Barcelona, The staff one guy was rude Also during the check out from 12 till 1pm they have called me 2 times asking me to leave even though i asked for some minutes to come down They tried to charge me 10 euros for checking out 1 hour late I think they are not professional Also it is hard to find a taxi in front of the hotel , Location
275737,H10 Marina Barcelona, I had to go to the airport early in the morning The previous night I asked the staff in the hotel to book a taxi but surprisingly they refused to do it Instead they suggested me to try in a nearby taxi stand or to stop a taxi in the street Eventually it turned out that there was a taxi when I needed it but I felt a bit uncomfortable about the whole thing , Nice pool 
275738,H10 Marina Barcelona, Reception came across helpful however I left a note for a special request which was not handled they said they had a room to change too and did not keep me informed, Friendly Helpful staff apart from my request not handled Evening meal was delightful and excellent value for money A well sighted hotel close to the Metro and supermarkets close by and nice pastry coffee shop on the corner if you don t want the hotel breakfast
275739,H10 Marina Barcelona, Shower head fitting didn t work in shower cubicle It wouldn t stay up so was unusable Service desk staff varied from unhelpful to excellent , Overall the hotel was good with comfortable and luxurious feel worthy of 4 stars Breakfast was excellent

275743,H10 Marina Barcelona, its a short walk to bars and restaurant and i would recommend a taxi 7 to visit the center of Barcelona , excellent hotel facilities and staff great base for visiting close to Olympic port and beach 
275744,H10 Marina Barcelona, Very frustrating felt like we had to abide by rules Swipe key cards were a constant nightmare spent half the time at reception trying to sort them out so they actually worked First hotel I ve stayed in where hotel guests paying a significant rate already are expected to pay an extra 16 euros per person per day there were 4 of us to use the spa indoor pool The pool is pitifully small for such a large hotel with only 10 beds so often guests looking to relax were unable to sit by the pool All in all I wouldn t go back , Reasonable location
275745,H10 Marina Barcelona, I didn t like the fact that I pre booked the shuttle service on arrival and yet it didn t wait 30mins from the aeroplane delay Me and my friend had to then shell out 42Euros for a taxi because the shuttle wouldn t come again which was bad service I thought the breakfast in the morning could of done with having a decent sausage instead of tiny chipolatas , I loved the pool area on the 8th floor simply stunning and the staff kept it pristine Very comfy beds and a high quality bathroom with a bath Excellent location 10mins from the beaches and marina with a metro closeby
