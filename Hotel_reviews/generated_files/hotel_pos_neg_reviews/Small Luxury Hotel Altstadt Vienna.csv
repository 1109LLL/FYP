358892,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Unfortunately I could hear everything going on in the corridors the room doors didn t keep the noise out , The staff were so friendly it was a different stay to what I m used to it felt like I was staying at their home It was a quarkey hotel very arty and a interesting find at each corner I would definitely recommend it to all my friends 
358893,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, nothing , the staff was so friendly and helpful they really made me feel very pampered there were dozens of great restaurants and shops close by but I almost didn t want to leave the hotel it was simply put one of the best hotel experiences I ve ever had 
358894,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, It would be great if the hotel had a restaurant , This is one of the best hotels I ve stayed in We had a very spacious comfortable room The staff were all delightful friendly helpful the Neubau district is very interesting with many artisan shops cafes The attention to detail made this a very special stay we began to regard it as home during our 7 nights there 
358895,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, I really liked this place there is nothing particular that I didn t like The only things I can even think to say here seem like minutiae , The breakfast was amazing I looked forward to it each day Also the location was outstanding close enough to major sites of interest to walk but in a neighborhood with a lot of artsy and interesting shops lively little restaurants a beautiful old church just around the corner with view from our window Our room was very comfortable and also beautiful The hotel is in an historic building and the decor is in keeping with that yet it s completely up to date and somehow felt modern Also loved the Malin Goetz products in the bathrooms We needed to make a change in our plans to add nights to our original booking of 2 nights extended to 4 and were really glad we did 
358896,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna,No Negative, Good hotel breakfast excellent and staff very helpful Covered Parking is available at a location nearby about 5 minutes walk at a cost of 25 euros If this is important to you make sure you book the car parking with your reservation From the old city centre this hotel is about 15 minutes away 
358897,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna,No Negative, Perfect location for visiting Vienna in a nice area with plenty of local restaurants An easy walk to the museums trams and U bahn Very comfortable quiet and stylish room with an excellent breakfast Also enjoyed the cakes and tea in the afternoon The staff were very pleasant helpful and welcoming It couldn t have been a better place to stay for a special birthday treat 
358898,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, The only thing we thoroughly hated were the bathrooms no doors between overall bed and bathing areas and only a clear glass door to shower and separate toilet That is zero privacy If this were different we would definitely recommend this hotel and come back again In the end however and for the price we paid sorry it s a dealbreaker , Almost everything was excellent here the staff were wonderful the breakfast buffet was outstanding right down to gluten free bread and prosecco and the location was great for us

358900,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna,No Negative, Lovely quirky boutique hotel in one of our favourite areas of the city Surrounded by great bars and restaurants but away from the hustle and bustle of the more touristic areas The staff was exceptionally friendly and welcoming from the girls at reception and in the breakfast salon to the cleaning ladies It will be hard to stay anywhere else but the Hotel Altstadt Wien when returning to Vienna 
358901,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Access to a terrace would have been nice , Basic room category equally includes a very well designed room Going up a category is only worth it for the view and more space to move around in the room We tried a night in each Very friendly staff felt more genuine than in some other hotels in that category Great breakfast buffet caters abundantly for lactose free guests The breakfast room which is the bar at night is beautiful like a very nice cafe 
358902,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna,No Negative, Very nice hotel very well located at walking distance from the Museums and the Hofburg Staff was very pleasant and caring Overall very nice experience and would recommend the Altstadt hotel to family and friends
358903,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Toilet Jr Suite No 67 had somehow the smell of cigarette smoke The hotel is entirely non smoking so it was very odd One drawer instead of flat shelf would have been convenient for the same room , Every time I stay here I m quite impressed by friendly and personal touch of services offered It has not changed since my first stay for more than 15 years ago and despite changes of personnel You can feel every staff does enjoy working for the hotel and guests Truly amazing The breakfast rooms were temporarily located on the ground level until the end of March due to renovation Having buffet breakfast at Altstadt Vienna is definitely one of many reasons why I keep coming back to this beautiful city Its comfortable and relaxing atmosphere great variety of tea leaves I prefer tea to coffee for breakfast bread jams and cold cuts always made me late for setting out to the day s first destination This time I particularly enjoyed pear juice In the late afternoon you can enjoy delicious cake and tea at the same place At least I had five different homemade cakes during my stay and they were all really tasty Speaking of the rooms I stayed at one of Jr Suite which is 3 month old after renovation and one classic double room I loved its high ceiling warm colours of curtains and cushions contrasting bright blue sofa of the Jr Suite From the past experiences I was a bit skeptic about waterproof function of glass door of the separate shower booth but it was needless fear One might feel uncomfortable as the outside of closet and bathroom doors are all covered with mirrors You can look away though In a classic double room a large painting was hung on the wall It was a nice change from a colourful interior to a subdued one It is as comfortable as in your own room yet with much more sophistication That s what I really love about this hotel I d really love to get back there like yesterday 
358904,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Nothing all perfect, Everything about the Hotel Altstadt was excellent staff food room information advice about local places to eat in the evening all wonderful Over the last 30 years I have travelled a lot and have stayed in some great hotels but the Hotel Altstadt is the best 
358905,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, First of all the breakfast is very poor We arrived and they told us that they upgraded our suit the room was scary and old fashioned we asked to change the suit they offered an upgrade on 20 night and said it s a competitive price looks like their system didn t accept that and charged us on 30 per night not a big deal on the 10 but that what happened this hotel is over expensive , Well a couple of cool stuff there like free tea and water with mint staff did a wonderful job not bad cleaning too
358906,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Room structure bathroom door in front of window it makes you feeling you are outside Difficult to be two adults in this bedroom Bed in front of windows you still feel outside not enough light near mirror in bathroom Windows Stores far from your arms No light nearby mirror to make up or shaving even next to the closet Bed too hard But we asked for solution and they found one Stairs are not heated you feel cold and outside before arriving to the lift Very cold each morning to pass through the way in to go to the breakfast room , The sightseeing from the bedroom Nespresso in bedroom The hall The location near museum quartier Kindness of staff Everything looks brand new

358922,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Though small he hotel has a bit of an odd and sprawing layout Our rooms were far down a series of labyrinthine halls separated by heavy fire doors While our suite was large bright and pleasant the extra double room we booked was quite dark opening onto a lite shaft with no other window and so small it barely accommodated more than our bed , Pleasant little hotel with friendly and welcoming staff Some interesting and eclectic pieces of art here and there Wonderful breakfast in a lovely salon Terrific location in a lively and interesting part of town Reasonable value Suggest booking one of the suites which are large and comfortable 
358923,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, no gym but that is uber picky , I thought the staff was extremely friendly they made me a breakfast sandwich at 4 30 AM to make sure I had breakfast for my flight The area was super hip and you are not far away from the key sites

358934,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna,No Negative, Breakfast was excellent with wide variety of choices and some food was available for those with early flights Staff was very attentive and helpful Rooms were modern and large Historic hotel 
358935,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Nothing I can t think of anything we could find fault with , The room was great and the breakfast was beyond our expectation Everyone we dealt with at the front desk or restaurant couldn t have been nicer or more helpful One of the best hotel experiences we have ever had 
358936,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Wi fi was okay but the web access restricted the accessibility of loading photos from my camera so I would have preferred direct accessibility, Staff in reception and restaurants were extremely helpful and friendly The recommendations for nearby eating options were sublime
358937,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna,No Negative, Wow what an excellent boutique hotel Beautifully furnished and decorated Staff are very attentive and welcoming Wonderful breakfast buffet THE place to stay when in Vienna 
358938,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, There is limited option for vegetarian people in the breakfast and I suggest that the hotel starts serving some hot potato items like hashbrown for breakfast , We were 2 couples staying at this wonderful property in May 2016 On reception Elena was there to welcome us and was very helpful and polite We got a free upgrade to white Suite and Camila Suite which were both very good The salon room in the property is very cozy and comfortable We really enjoyed the home made cake and tea in the evenings All in all a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend it 
358939,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Nothing , It was all you could ask for in a city hotel Great location with easy access to city centre public transport and restaurants Lovely building and delightful rooms Very friendly staff both at reception and the ladies who worked hard to service the rooms Breakfasts superb 
358940,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, It is not fair to criticise but the lack of privacy between bedroom bathroom and toilet would be an issue if my particular room was used by a couple , The location is close to the centre without being in the centre The five minute stroll to the Museum Quarter is very pleasant and the route can be varied each time External appearances are not impressive but wait until you go up to the reception on the first floor and then wow Without exception all the staff are so friendly polite and helpful My room was listed as a Business single so I was surprised by how spacious it was with a king size bed The unique design of the room was total luxury and comfort I could not fault it Breakfast was everything that I had read in other reviews superb choice and beautiful surroundings with tables in three separate rooms all with original art on the walls If you return from sightseeing in time for free tea and cake it is a very civilised way to wind down after a day in the city There are several restaurants in easy walking distance from the hotel Public transport in Vienna is so easy to use as the trams buses and metro all run frequently and you never have long to wait I bought the weekly ticket which was bizarrely cheaper than the 3 day ticket and could be used on all modes of transport except the sightseeing buses This was one of the best city breaks I have ever had 
358941,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Room was a little bit warm We opened the windows to take care of that nothing major, The exceptional care and attention of the staff uniqueness of the hotel rooms and feel breakfast was spoiled for choice tea facilities in the room the complimentary afternoon snack location and proximity to some attractions and metro the parting gift and the efficient service We left something behind in the room and the hotel was more than kind enough to mail it to us simply exceptional Will definitely be back on my next trip to Vienna 
358942,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, We were not that happy with the deluxe double room we received since it had no view and we were not comfortable with having the toilet and bath set within the room and merely separated by glass walls and therefore not ensuring the proper intimacy we are not that avantgarde maybe other customers are ok instead by luck we happened to see the opposite room that was cosy and what we were looking for and available and we moved into it although it was a classic double room and not a deluxe Therefore we had a very good and comfortable stay Otherwise we would not have been happy , The room was amazing high ceiling very spacious large desk Nespresso machine with refill every day comfortable bed excellent breakfast the restaurant rooms since there are few and with different design concepts 
358943,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, parking situation near hotel not possible even for short time parking at arrival parking garage 5 min walk ok but when the weather is not fine this is not comfortable , Good atmosphere friendly staff excellent breakfast walking distances to all important attractions
358944,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, If i could have received a later check out however the hotel it seems was fully booked, I was able to check in early after a long flight so that was excellent The Hotel was in a good location just walking distance from down town Many restaurants nearby as well 
358945,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, The room was a little small and bedside rugs would have been nice on the hard wooden floor and a mirror in the bed room unfortunately as the hotel is part of a large block the room above was not part of the hotel and had an occupant who walked frequently across the floor noisily Frustrating as the bedroom overlooked internal courtyard and was wonderfully quiet , excellent breakfast and helpful staff the overall ambience and lay out was quirky and attractive and innovative The provision of free tea and cake in the afternoon was a welcome touch The scattering of art in the communal rooms was very enjoyable 
358946,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Quite noisy in the morning but don t think this was the hotel s fault , Free cake in the afternoon really happy and helpful staff superb breakfast

358953,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Would have liked milk for the coffee stand up shower would have better as there was lots of room for one in the bathroom Reception a bit hard to find signposting could have been better, Location was great very central and easy to walk everywhere plus very easy to get to from airport Room was huge nicely decorated and staff very nice Breakfast very nice 
358954,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna,No Negative, It was a wonderful stay and they made us feel very welcome They as provide great info on the local area We tried 2 of their restaurant recommendations and they were excellent 
358955,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Only complaint was the ongoing construction of reception area We never mind upgrades to a hotel but would have liked to have known about it before hand Fumes from construction for a couple of days were pretty nasty throughout the property , Cute hotel with unique rooms very comfortable The wine of the day and breakfast were outstanding Close walking all to all the sites 
358956,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Rooms were warm but corridors didn t seem to be heated , Included breakfast free afternoon tea was very good We stayed in a basic room which was fairly plain Not as nice as the more expensive rooms pictured Room size was good Hotel location requires a 15 min walk to main things like Vienna State Opera etc but our room was very quiet Hotel restaurant recommendations were very good and a short walk away Hotel staff very friendly helpful with good English

358962,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, The water pressure in the bathroom was a bit on the low side and the water temperature in the shower unstable We found a sock of a previous guest behind the armchair on the floor , The excellent staff wonderful breakfast and the salon area which feels like one s own living room The rooms are grouped in former luxurious apartments and all is decorated with real art 
358963,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, A firmer mattress would ve been nice , The sense of space the warmth of the room and the welcoming nature of all the staff Breakfast was excellent and the hotel was very well situated 
358964,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Placing bathroom just next to bed is not very good idea and we got very noisy room next to pub or smth , Location is very good quiet street but close to city center 10 min walk very comfy bed and nice size room 
358965,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, There is not a thing I could fault with the hotel , The owner and staff were friendly and helpful The room was well presented and clean and tidy Breakfast was excellent and good variety

358967,Small Luxury Hotel Altstadt Vienna, Oddly no conditioner provided The location is slightly out of the city centre but I preferred this as it felt less touristy Only putting it as a negative for those for whom mobility or preference limits them to the centre , I loved my stay at the Altstadt Rarely do I feel impressed enough to write a review but the staff at the Hotel Altstaft deserve every bit of praise Always smiling and cheerful knowledgable about anything and everything and ready to help The complimentary afternoon tea salons enhance the fin de si cle feel of the place originally apartment buildings the rooms are tastefully decorated with luxury amenities reliable wifi and welcoming breakfast it s hard to fault the Hotel Altstadt
