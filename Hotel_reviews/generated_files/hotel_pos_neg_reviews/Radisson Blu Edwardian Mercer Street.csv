97702,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room smelt of damp The room was a very small double really a single the bathroom didn t have good exhaust and the windows didn t open in the room therefore there was continually a smell of damp Not what to expect from this star of hotel, The pillows and sheets very comfortable Staff friendlly Location very good

97706,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, air conditioning could have been better, location was excellent as we were attending theatre in shaftsbury avenue friendly and efficient staff at both reception and restaurant

97713,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing, The stay from start to finish was superb Staff very welcoming extremely comfortable and was greeted with a birthday cake and balloon as it was my partners birthday which was very thoughtful and greatly appreciated 
97714,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Having to fix the windows as was a gap at the top of the sash windows Once we managed to close them it was perfect , The super comfy beds Beautiful twin room Friendly staff Perfect location 
97715,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room was tiny the TV too small and the bathroom minute with a specially narrow bath The curtains did not cut out the light from the window there was no fridge All in all sparsely outfitted and way overpriced for what was on offer ,No Positive
97716,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Room was a bit chilly and as with most hotels they never have temperature controls you can see or understand how they work Thought it was strange that the lifts are super silent you hardly know you re moving but the room doors self close and there s nothing you can do to stop them banging really loudly when they close The reception is now what used to be a great bar right on the triangle corner of the building and I miss it I used to drink there occasionally even when not staying at the hotel you could watch the world go by on the Seven Dials from all sides , They upgraded me to a suite which was a really cool big room with a super king bed a big bath and a walk in wardrobe kitchen with a huge Smeg union jack fridge I was very happy 
97717,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room size was very small for the amount paid , The breakfast was really good for the cost The location was great for being able to walk to most places 
97718,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing particularly only comment would be breakfast was a little style over substance At first glance the menu looked limiting but if you asked for something they would provide it although marmalade was not available , Location is excellent in a lovely part of London within easy reach of Covent Garden theatres Chinatown and much more including two underground stations Room well appointed and very quiet for centre of London 
97719,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, View from the window was the back of other buildings which were neat and tidy but to be honest we weren t bothered about the view from the bedroom , We had the basic room but it had a very comfy bed not extra firm like most hotels Very good freshly cooked hot breakfast with self service cold buffet Friendly cheerful staff Easy walking distance from Covent Garden and lots of restaurants within 10 minutes walk 
97720,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, no walk in shower, breakfast was extremely good loved the ambiance the waiting staff were attentive the presentation was excellent and quality perfect 
97721,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, I asked for a cocktail not only the menu but they couldn t make even though they had the ingredients, Friendly helpful staff Ideal location for theatres centre of London
97722,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, No indication that it was the Radisson hotel apart from tiny lettering on entrance , Very comfy bed Room not stuffy Coffee machine in room Nice breakfast Hotel situated in a great spot 
97723,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing wrong with the hotel but the Booking com website did not make clear that we could not specify a twin room rather than a double The staff were very helpful giving us an extra duvet and upgrading to a large bed However I will book direct in future and not use Booking com , Lovely staff 
97724,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Great breakfast Helpful staff with a yes attitude Great at the little touches upgrage to a kingsize bed for my Wife s birthday and a balloon and littles cakes left in our room 
97725,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Deluxe Room not huge but appreciate that s london one table which was not particularly practical for working or make up or anything other than dumping stuff on This is a small negative to a great stay , Location is great staff are extremely friendly and courteous Little things like text link to concierge are also a nice touch 
97726,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The hairdryer in bedroom didn t work neither did the phone It took half an hour to get a replacement hairdryer making us rush to get to dinner reservation on time , The bed was very comfortable staff were very helpful and attentive 
97727,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing , The bed was amazingly comfortable and the rooms were beautifully clean The breakfast was delicious and plenty of it We stayed there after a visit to the theatre as it is so conveniently positioned and we will definitely stay there again 
97728,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We did not opt for the breakfast option as we usually do but at 24 per person was a bit steep when you really do not want a full breakfast at our age and there are so many other options nearby for a coffee and croissant Not a criticism , The room was excellent with all the expected amenities Pay whatever extra for a view over Monmouth Street from which you can sit and watch all of the local activity We stayed two nights in room 102 
97729,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, check in was slow and ponderous and room was too noisy as we were woken by rubbish lorry and sirens double glazing needs to be better for that area, Breakfast was good as was service
97730,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Please lower the volume of the music in the dining area it was just possible to hear what the waiter told about the food Too noisy for me to enjoy the good food In my room I was no able to switch off the air conditioner I stayed off for a while but then started again I felt cold during the night as it did neither keep the temperature as I set is Perhaps I was just clumsy , The bed was nice and the room plan interesting Definitely I ll come back if the business brings me and I m pleased to recommend you further 
97731,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Maintenance side of things water stain on the ceiling by the window small orange stains and fine cracks on bathroom ceiling , The staff were so polite and helpful from front of house to house keeping The beds were so comfy it was a hard choice to leave 
97732,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The bathroom was so small the hairdryer was relegated to a closet The bathroom was so poorly designed that you could not use the toilet without straddling the bathtub and the sink , Bed was very comfortable and overall the hotel feels brand new 
97733,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Bathroom small and strangely shaped Decor in the newly refurbished Monmouth restaurant a little too urban for my tastes , The location Perfect for everything in the west end Located in the heart of theatreland and yet in a relatively quiet side street The staff super friendly and helpful Rooms good sized quiet and well appointed Reasonable value for money by London standards 
97734,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The constant hum of the air conditioning on the roof was quite distracting i wouldn t recommend the top floor rooms , The location was top class and the room was incredibly comfortable and a great view
97735,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing always a pleasure staying here Have stayed many times before and will stay many times again, Room was immaculate staff go above and beyond to help in any way
97736,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Everything was great no complaints , The bed was excellent very comfortable Pillows were really full and dense which is how I like them Location was superb just a few minutes walk to Leicester Square Chinatown Covent Garden Shopping District and Westminister wasn t that far away Everything is walking dostance and food all around 
97737,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, There s no bar other than the restaurant, Reception staff were really helpful especially Phillip location was perfect only 2 minute walk to Covent Garden tube station hotel was spotlessly clean 
97738,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, By American standards my room was the size of a large closet On the other hand it was clean and modern and the bathroom was very nice , The staff were exceptionally helpful Made a wonderful recommendation for dinner And one even went so far as to hail a cab for a clueless American I can t say enough nice things about the staff I d certainly stay here again 
97739,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, leaving it was so nice, very warm welcome room very clean problem fixed within 10min no problem Food excellent service excellent Location excellent Super stay
97740,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Excellent location near Coventry Garden and the Theatres Great crew at the frontdesk with Niki being very helpful and smart and Ed the best concierge of greater London 
97741,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Since a move to cafetieres at breakfast the coffee could have been a little hotter , Welcomed by concierge Yasin who always looks after us very well and took suitcase to room without being asked Reception staff always helpful and pleasant Breakfast staff worked hard to ensure things were always available on the buffet at busy time 
97742,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Noise room on first floor was opposite a night club Noise was unbearable and I complained on checkout at 6 30am no compensation offered other than sorry This is not good customer service for such a lovely hotel , Room design was lovely and very comfortable location is central to Covent Garden but noise is a huge put off 
97743,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The hotel brand needs defining I was looking for a Radisson Blu brand and couldn t find it anywhere the hotel name Mercer Hotel instead is prominent Found the logo on the door as you walk in not ideal if you re not local The bedroom twin was nicely decorated but so tiny very cramped especially for the price Breakfast offerings were very different to the norm although not dis pleasing, The location was excellent the staff were very friendly and the d cor was modern and super clean Bar Staff were very knowledgeable and great serving cocktails the background music and feel of the bar at night was lovely 
97744,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Housekeeping staff tried to enter the room at 8 30 am The room was very small for a superior room The breakfast menu is overly fussy , Exceptionally welcoming reception staff 
97745,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The receptionist struggled to locate my booking on arrival as she misheard my name She was quite abrupt and suggested that we had come to the wrong hotel It didn t give the greatest first impression Other staff during our stay were wonderful though so this would not put me off re booking , The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet top floor Apple TV was a nifty feature and room service was delicious I also liked how the maid visited twice per day and noted the option to have fresh bedding each day 
97746,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Radisson Blu Edwardian location location Everything I needed was at my doorstep shopping theatre eateries the accommodation was excellent quiet comfortable Staff friendly breakfast excellent I would be more than happy to recommend the Radisson Blu to my family friends 
97747,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Supposed to be superior room not very if at all Stayed in many 200 300 a night hotels the room was 100 functional Beds excellent but no mini bar In a superior room Room was small should not be described as superior , Breakfast staff and beds very good 
97748,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Could not work the TV On the first floor lots of steps in and out of the lifts and the rooms, Friendly staff breakfast included which is unusual to find nowadays
97749,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, TV s have a limit on the volume and it was so far away from the bed which meant we couldn t hear it at all once the heat was switched on The most frustrating thing was the lack of hot water and water pressure in the sink and shower taking a shower in a cold bathroom which only ever got luke warm with such little pressure was a very uncomfortable way to start the day It s a given for me that a hotel should have hot water and decent pressure so this was a big negative point , Location staff breakfast
97750,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, A fridge in the room would have been nice but didn t impact at all the quality of the room, The staff were wonderful and attentive especially Ed Parkes the concearge who went out of his way from booking this trip to making sure myself and my daughter had a wonderful stay He was amazing 
97751,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Value for money I would question I would have expected better in house facilities i e bar area breakfast area all seemed very small, Hotel was in a great location 
97752,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Having returned to my room at 3 30 pm I was disappointed to find the bed had not been made the bathroom cleaned or the tea coffee replenished, The situation of the hotel in relation to the theatre was exactly right 
97753,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, The staff made us feel welcome as soon as we stepped through the front door from booking our post theatre restaurant within minutes to drawing walking routes for us to take from the hotel We were staying to celebrate my birthday and got a room upgrade and a lovely happy birthday sweet surprise in the room On our departure we were planning on some sightseeing and again the staff jumped to assist and organised for us to leave our luggage at a partner hotel closer to our departing station Our room was lovely and the breakfast was good with a range of fresh fruit and a great hot breakfast selection We ll definitely book again 
97754,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, pillows There were 4 pillows but the same size Me and my friend found them uncomfortable too high In the morning I got ache in my neck, Location is extremly comfortable bars subway restaurants etc Breakfast and wifi were good
97755,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, This hotel and the staff were fantastic My only negative for feedback to the hotel was that in my room the long mirror in the bedroom was on the back of the bathroom door so there was only a metre to stand back and look in it and the area was dark right beside the door I was preparing for a big event so would have preferred a mirror located somewhere better with more space and light It was perfect in the room my friends were in though Everything else was perfect , The bed and pillows were fantastic The staff were amazing superb customer service from the minute we arrived We would definitely stay here again no hesitation 
97756,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Bathroom a little snug but that s what you get in London , Staff were fab Concierge was brilliant and check in staff really helpful Room service quick and efficient Oh and I liked online concierge service and online checkout 
97757,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Green and purple velvet decor in the bedroom is not very restful , Fabulous choice for breakfast and 100 helpful staff in all areas of the hotel and the restaurant 
97758,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay It would have been even better if the breakfast had been included in the price , The room was very quiet clean and comfortable The bathroom had an easy to use walk in shower plenty of products fluffy towels and again very clean We had single beds which were very comfortable so a good nights sleep The room had all the facilities we enjoy TV kettle bottles of water and it was warm Breakfast gave a choice of individually cooked foods and the cold table offered cold meats cheeses salmon fruits cereals and croissants together with much more It was all fresh and delicious The staff were attentive cheerful and helpful making us feel welcome and relaxed 
97759,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, no way of playing music via your ipod so a dock would have been a further bonus , great location rooms very clean nice design comfy beds and great facilities and everything you could need The bar restaurant had a great atmosphere

97763,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, The location of the hotel is superb Everything you could possibly want from a visit to London is on your doorstep The room was quite small but clean and very comfortable The staff really couldn t do enough for us and even booked our dinner reservations with a choice of restaurants This hotel was a delight to go to and we will be returning again in the summer 
97764,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Outstanding from start to finish What an amazing place and staff You are made to feel welcome by everyone Edward the concierge went above and beyond It was refreshing to be treated like a person and not a number even the smallest detail was listened to nothing was to much trouble after recently staying in a 5 and made to feel like a burden This was pure Heaven And for that I Thank every person who made our experience such a lovely memory Thank You
97765,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We had not water on arrival so could not use showers toilets etc Really this was the only thing that let them down Also I requested adjoining interconnecting rooms when I booked I was only told the day before this was not available but the alternative offered by the hotel was acceptable I don t think that this would be the case if we were staying longer Otherwise excellent but a bit pricey,No Positive
97766,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Would have liked grilled tomatoes for breakfast Not a lot of room around one side of the bed Made getting in and out difficult , Helpful staff Comfy bed 
97767,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, No gab rail for shower users no specific instructions for heating control in room , Great croissant pain au chocolat Lovely duck egg ensembles Staff absolutely excellent
97768,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, The reception staff were extra helpful and the hot breakfast was amazing I didn t get much time to use the extra facilities as I was out all day for meetings but on first impressions I would definitely stay again 
97769,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The Bar was great for meeting friends but a little on the expensive side 7 25 for a single G T I know it s London but two large G Ts for 2 people 50 The bar food was excellent and good value for money , Great service an excellent Hotel ideally located in Covent Garden
97770,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Pillows are too soft for me A table in my room made of glass top is really stylish but bit hard to use my optical mouse Sofas are also too low to use PC , Nice location to Bloomsbury area It s restaurant is also nice esp its atmosphere and friendly staffs 
97771,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room was really small and the bed was probably the worst I have stayed in But I really like the hotel, The bar and restaurant was cool the location was perfect 
97772,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing, Staff excellent The Concierge was fantastic and sorted the valet parking out which is a God send in London never mind Covent Garden Such a great position in the center of Theatre Land and you can walk to everywhere easily whilst enjoying all that is best in vibrant London 
97773,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Easy to get to from Heathrow close to Covent Garden tube station Theatres restaurants Easy walk to Trafalgar Square Quiet and comfortable rooms 
97774,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, We loved the friendliness and expertise of all the staff They went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and pleasant The little birthday cakes and card in the room were a welcome surprise especially as my birthday was only mentioned in passing The staff in the bar were obliging finding a table for 4 when my daughter and partner came to visit The room was quiet and extremely comfortable 
97775,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The selection of food in the restaurant was not to our sons taste he s a very plain eater so we only had breakfast with you , I asked for a nice room for my husbands special birthday and it was a large bright room I also asked that the two rooms we booked would be near each other and they were These requests are not difficult to arrange but the hotel did exactly what we requested so our visit was made extra special 
97776,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Once again the service care from all members of staff A1 I can honestly say keep up the good hard work and you cannot fail On this trip we had a couple of issues with our room that could not be helped we were moved to an alternative room no questions asked basically effortless
97777,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, It is not the same hotel I have been here many times and I think that everything doesn t seem better The hotel wasn t clean especially the blankets The breakfast was pretentious but not delicious I think the products wasn t fresh And so many staff ,No Positive
97778,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, If I had to be super critical The heating was a little difficult to master Cold when we got there boiling during the night User error rather than poor facilities , Staff very attentive Made sure everyones allergies and special requests were taken care of Breakfast was superb and the rooms were amazing The location is perfect and a small oasis in the middle of theatreland 
97779,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Turndown service left the room with terrible body odour really we had to use perfume to cover it up , Location Clean modern design Comfortable bed 
97780,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, We had an excellent stay at this hotel It is located in the theater district quite near many plays and dozens of restaurants on the Seven Dials round about which was all decorated beautifully for Christmas It is also a 15 minute walk from Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery It is a great location for New Year s Eve as well as the hotel is a 20 minute walk from the best place to see the fireworks The streets directly around the hotel are small so there is no traffic or city noise However taxis come through regularly so it only takes a minute or two to get a taxi The rooms are a reasonable size and comfortable We had 3 rooms two had a large shower one had a shower tub The customer service is top rate We had a problem with one room and they immediately moved us to a bigger room for the same price Furthermore room service arrived in under 5 minutes from when we called for ice or more towels And they have complimentary candy and apples in the lobby every day The Internet was free and adequate Our rate included breakfast which was a good deal 
97781,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Unfortunately the tea and coffee facility did not include English breakfast tea only Jasmine Cammomile and Mint Ughh , Ana on reception was so lovely nothing to much trouble for her Delightful manner yet retained her professionalism You immediately that you were going to have a good stay 
97782,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room size was terrible especially for the cost charged of 269 for 1 night It has to be one of the smallest rooms we have stayed in with a very small window adding to an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia , Location on Seven Dials is very good 
97783,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Breakfast was not the best especially for the price I have had better at the premier inn Would not have breakfast there again , Comfortable rooms and great location 
97784,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Just a minor comment about the room The layout of our superior room with bath was a bit strange There is a table with 2 chairs but you can t really sit at it The towel rack can t be reached from the shower , The staff is very nice and helpful great gym and bar We liked the location and proximity to soho and theatres 
97785,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Room was tiny Blind remained down because just a few yards across the road was a call centre full of people who could see right in, Fab location Helpful staff
97786,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Rooms were a little small but very well equipped and well furnished , The welcome from the staff was exemplary the room was well equipped and tastefully decorated Super super location boutique feel for a chain hotel Cocktails in the bar were very good Didn t eat in hotel so can t comment on breakfast or dinner but breakfast seems expensive at 24 a head 
97787,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Rooms could ve been a touch bigger considering paid for an upgraded room also given a different room to that selected at online checkin, Excellent staff that went all out for special requests and also very polite and welcoming every time we walked in comfortable rooms and beds and quick check in
97788,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room was a a bit small and the ensuite bathroom a bit of a squeeze The cooked breakfast was not as good as it should have been for the money Overall the Hotel did not quite do enough to stop me looking around for an alternative when I next visit London , Fantastic location Very comfortable bed Helpful staff 
97789,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, The location was brilliant Also I couldn t praise the staff enough Edward was looking after us and anything I needed he sorted straight away without any hassle A true professional and a pleasure to talk to We definitely return 
97790,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Room with a view would have been nice Although this is our second visit we would still stay here again , Lovely hotel in great location tasty salmon and chicken skewers perfect for small snack at lunch time 
97791,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Size of room for the price I paid Air conditioning was noisy and so was the hall way , Super Location staff were very helpful and friendly bar was excellent as was our bar man 
97792,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The fact I stay a quite a few hotels throughout the year and a lot of Radisson blu East Midlands in particular for 90 you get bed breakfast and parking a massive room with king size bed walk in shower room and no noise even though it under a flight path , Bed was very hard noise was beyond a joke with doors slamming all through the night bathroom was ok but bedroom very small indeed 
97793,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, 1The hotel prices 2 We came very late at night and didn t understand if our room was reserved exactly for us because after we asked the same things which we preffered in our reservation they changed and gave us another room , The breakfast was exellent The kindness of the staff The extra cleanliness of the linen 
97794,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Our stay at the hotel was very nice We were a group of eight people travelling to have a nice time together in London before Christmas The hotel has the best location in the city center in walking distance from Covent Garden Oxford Street and China Town for example The hotels bar and restaurant was very nice and the food and cocktails superb Rooms were very clean and the all the employees very nice and helpful Concierge was very helpful and made our trip more special

97798,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and the pillows were exceptionally comfortable the location couldn t be better for theatres and Covent Garden which are within a couple of minutes walk will make this our London stay hotel in the future Trevor from Barnham in West Sussex
97799,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We were given cozy room which really was a very very small room just space for a double bed so not good value for money No space in bar in the evening , Location was excellent breakfast good value for money 
97800,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Tiniest room ever Very small double they called it Queen bed Had to get an upgrade and pay 40 per night extra Housekeeping knocked on the door at 8 45am to ask if they could clean the room Asked them to call back after we d gone out They didn t Later we asked for room to be cleaned whilst we were out for the evening It wasn t despite a promise that it would be On check out the hotel agreed to waive the upgrade cost which was something I suppose , Location was excellent Restaurant was good too 
97801,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Size of bedroom and bathroom Requested a low floor and given a very high one 12 5 service charge at the bar not optional Very expensive for what it was Lacklustre food , The location and comfortable bed
97802,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Sloping beam alongside our bed gave approx 10 inches of room to pass by which was difficult considering our age , Staff friendly and helpful Nice welcome message for our diamond anniversary 
97803,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The pictures hanged in our room were inapprpiate woman bare chested with scary eyes also the hotel does not provide slippers for the bathroom, the hotel s location is perfect in the middle of all the hype Its interior design was great the restaurant s food was fine the room was spacious enough
97804,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Smallest bathroom we have ever stayed in a hotel bedroom also too small i bumped into bed and chair often l, Bed was really good bedding tip top staff extremely helpful and friendly breakfast was very good and of high quality 
97805,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, THOUGHT ROOM RATE WAS EXCESSIVE AND GLAD BREAKFAST 24 WAS INCLUDED IN ROOM RATE, ALLLLL EXCELLENT STAFF FROM CHECK IN CONCIERGE THROUGH BAR DINNER TOP MENU BREAKFAST SERVICING OF ROOM TO DEPARTURE WHEN LEE WAS PARTICULARLY HELPFUL LOCATION WAS BANG ON FOR OUR VISIT TO THE MOUSTRAP AND THE IVY
97806,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, No dedicated area for residents to have a drink or eat Given where it is I can understand the desire to encourage passing trade but it makes it very difficult for residents to access the bar for a drink or to get a table to eat Also there is really insufficient space in the dining area Certainly at breakfast being seated at a bar table which is far too small to eat breakfast from is disappointing given the cost of the hotel , The location is excellent for Covent Garden and theatreland
97807,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Rooms are very small with little space for your things I fell over my suitcase several times , Location for Covent Garden and theatre land is excellent 
97808,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The double bed was really just a queen so too small for two people , The breakfast was brilliant Location excellent Staff were incredibly helpful and the room was well equipped if a little small 
97809,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing, We knew the location of the hotel but were wary of the room size so upgraded to executive room and were surprised by the size and comfort of the room Staff at all times were excellent and the breakfasts were great 
97810,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Rooms are too small, Pillows are very comfy staff are very helpful location location everyday we get a goodie in our room with a cute card from the staff once it was box of candy then sea salt for the tub then plate with fruits it was very nice of them
97811,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room was very small for a superior room but we werent in it much , The location couldnt be better two minute walk from Covent Garden and five minutes from Leicester Square The staff were amazing and so helpful nothing was too much trouble
97812,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Breakfast choice quite limited table for 2 persons small I noticed someone put the condiments on floor to make more room, Staff very helpful and friendly Evening turndown service a nice touch Quality of towels bed linen and toiletries of high standard
97813,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Unfortunately there was no view from our window, We were upgraded to a suit upon arrival Breakfast was excellent Staff were there for everything you asked for 
97814,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, We had the deluxe suite we got a free upgrade from the studio suite this was the best room I have ever stayed in Stunning and we are already planning our next trip 
97815,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The price but I guess that s London , The room was comfortable of a reasonable size and had everything we might need Good description on the website Good choice of breakfast I d come back 
97816,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Unfortunately we had out of date cartons of milk in our room but this was rectified quickly by Maria Ed concierge This was very minor but my wife always enjoys a cuppa on arrival , Maria on reception was excellent ensuring we had a quiet room as requested and half an hour before normal check in The location for Covent Garden and the West End was excellent 
97817,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Room was very small but immaculate housemaid knocked on door 3 times to see if she had left ipod more importantly didn t like to hear tables being scraped along floor at 5 30 in morning from restaurant , comfy bed and pillows and very clean 
97818,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Bar seating was uncomfortable and service was just standard Ordered a baileys to drink and it came warm with no ice Had to ask for some There are building works going on which wasn t a problem but reception area looked very stark and bland in comparison to the last time we stayed a couple of years ago we were put in a tiny box room next to the lift and there was very little natural light We asked if we could be moved to a different room but had to pay for an upgrade Which we did and the room was acceptable , Bed was extremely comfy and location is great 
97819,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Noisy fan above room not air con Tiny room for a deluxe twin Broken shower gel dispenser and locked into wall so couldn t be fixed Over priced , Location 
97820,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Still undergoing refurbishment so lots of dust and places not finished yet Room was very hot at night although I turned the temp down , Location was great Comfy bed pillows Staff were all lovely polite and friendly Room was very clean Felt safe and secure
97821,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Bed too small for a couple and move to one side and you felt you were falling out of it Could not get snacks later in the evening I could go to the bedroom and order a snack but I could not get one in the Bar area Perhaps a little expensive , Breakfast was very good if you can eat that amount but wasted on us Location excellent Atmosphere was good in the bar area but see dislike 
97822,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The choice st the breakfast buffet wasn t as good as it used to be prior to changing to the Monmouth Kitchen and so no longer feel it is good value for money , Very comfy bed and attentive staff that remembered me from previous visits Good service overall and excellent location 
97823,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, breakfast a disaster sent back cooked food first two days gave up on third had to go seeking a knife one day and other incidents , room clean and comfortable
97824,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, No laptops allowed in bar restaurant after 5pm Not suitable for what otherwise is a great hotel for business trips, Great location in a very busy area of town Lots of restaurants bar shops theatres in walking distance Well equipped gym 
97825,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, If you opt for breakfast be aware that is still 25 even if you only have a bowel of fruit , Very nice room great staff and breakfast bar was excellent 
97826,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Extremely embarrassing situation prior the check in due the some security policy first time guests are asked to pay entire amount of their reservation on check in Clearly this wasn t said to me before And as I m not a UK citizen my bank has a limit on amount of individual transactions so I couldn t make entire payment at once but a receptionist had to charge my card twice Let me repeat that this was BEFORE being allocated to a room after an hour of cab drive and two hours of aero plain , Regarding location this is PERFECT hotel for both sightseeing and shopping Food is perfect service cleanness everything Extra clean room meticulous cleaning lady fresh towels regularly clean bed linen every day absolutely comfortable bed and totally reasonable price Plus some extra details that give you impression that you are a SPECIAL guest 
97827,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Renovations being carried out in some areas of the reception area with little disruption to ourselves , All staff went out there way to make our stay fabulous The service we received was a very exceptional professional service I am sure way above there job descriptions Thankyou to all staff and the Hotel owners 
97828,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Lift too small for my mobility scooter also steps leading outside so I had to constantly ask for help getting in and out of the hotel , Great location Very helpful staff Lovely room with large bathroom 
97829,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, A notice to inform you where the hair dryer was Difficulty finding it as it was hidden behind the dressing gowns, Best breakfast i have had Good healthy choices 
97830,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Would prefer actual bottled products in bathrooms but understand the environmental reasons for not having , Nice hotel Great breakfast Very good gym Very good value for money Great location 
97831,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The building work but the staff did proactively apologise when we checked in It s quite noisy due to the cars and people outside but we were on the 1st floor Couldn t keep the windows open because of this , The location was perfect for the theatre and the staff were amazing especially Andres who provided a truly personal experience for us Other staff also provided amenities when requested and walked right out with us to get us a taxi 
97832,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Location is perfect There were building works to improve the lobby but the staff were apologetic and attentive to make sure disruption was minimum Fresh towels and sheets daily The room was big and the bathroom modern with all soaps etc topped up daily 
97833,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Surprised that there was no mention about the major refurbishments taking place at the hotel Would have expected price reductions during such a process The standard of the rooms were below expectations including wonky armchairs , Great location Friendly staff 
97834,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The English breakfast was cold and some items overcooked sour dough was congealed in places Tables were small and cramped Room would benefit from a small set of drawers Noise from building works disturbed rest Offices across from window so blinds had to stay down , Staff were very welcoming and helpful Room was adequate but not exceptional Location great for access to shops bars theatres and restaurants 
97835,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Bathroom on the small side could do with grab rails to get out of the bath shower and a bath mat as my husband slipped and fell out of the bath shower, from the moment we arrived all the staff were friendly and very helpful The breakfast was 1st class
97836,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The breakfast area was a bit congested given the size Things were missing on the platter of food we received English Breakfast without sausages criminal The design is about modern but tables too small for the amount of dishes items Air conditioning blowing on head during breakfast was uncomfortable View from room was horrible but cannot be helped given location Should be given choice prior to booking Superior room , Location primarily was the reason for the choice 
97837,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, No comments, We got upgraded to a suite which is one up from the room we had booked this was a nice touch Rooms very clean and well equipped The attached restaurant to the hotel is a very swanky bar at night as well as resterant We didn t eat there but the food menu looked good and judging by the quality of breakfast which was superb I m sure it would be great The breakfast was one of the best we ve had The beds are very comfy and there is no noise pollution between rooms Location factor was a must for us and this is literally 4 5 minutes walk from Covent Garden Punch and Judies not the best place to go but we mention as everyone know where this is they have a text service from the concierge so you don t need to ring reception if a cab or anything is required just simply text We really really enjoyed our stay HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
97838,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Lesser facilities then provided by other hotels in this chain of hotels Not value for money Intermittent wifi in rooms Very limited TV channels , Location 
97839,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Tiny bit tired looking rooms for the money you expect a bit more luxury Could do with a refurb Room service menu is poor and food was mediocre although breakfast was excellent , The staff especially the blonde lady Ana was wonderfully helpful The breakfast was superb Perfect location Wonderful extra touches like water in your room waiting and a comfy bed with a selection of extra pillows in the wardrobe 
97840,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Very unhappy on arrival to find we did not have twin beds as requested luckily this was sorted for us but i was told that it was not guaranteed if booked through booking com this is a major issue , Great location breakfasts
97841,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The price but this is central London and it is on a par with other similar quality hotels Would stay again without hesitation though as the location is just so fantastic, Location is 2nd to none close to everything you need for a weekend break in London theatre shopping cocktail bars restaurants museums etc Superb staff service nothing is too much trouble Room immaculate clean Breakfast excellent standard with more than the usual offering and tasty healthy options available
97842,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Given a complimentary voucher to use at the bar but was told the bar was to busy to be admitted it was shame as was looking forward to the experience It seemed like there were a lot of outside influences determining the use of the restaurant and bar, Very helpful staff great location
97843,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Temporary renovation work to restaurant disrupted lifts elevators but staff were very helpful, Very helpful efficient staff Very clean throughout Fragrant aroma in public areas Superb location Excellent breakfast 
97844,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, There were nine of us in the group so it took quite a while to get checked in I know its possible to check in on line but I did not have everyones personal information to do this Also one thing the key card has to be waved in front of the lift numbers which they did not make clear We were all busy trying to make the lift work pressing floor numbers and going no where until another guest showed us how to do it Its obvious to the staff but not to guests unless made very clear at check in this is what is needed , the hotel was exactly what we wanted Great staff and lovely surroundings They hailed cabs for us and brought everything we asked for to our room in minutes 
97845,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Booked in online from email but didn t get much choice of room and arrived at hotel to find we didn t have twin room which I had requested Night club music rather loud below us until after midnight so should be warned when checking in We were on first floor rm 112 Noisy very early in morning below us too maybe the work men but wasn t warned Had to get assistance with TV and no BBC 1 channel available, Location Breakfast excellent staff slightly too over present
97846,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, the bed was small and i think that it was no more then 1 20 m for one person after 15 hours of fiight we expected to sleep better , the staff were very kind excet the front office manager 
97847,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Several faults pointed out on checkout just a thank you for telling us No follow up so far , Good breakfast but at a price high for even London
97848,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, I was disappointed that Booking com show that twin or double beds are available but don t actually give you the option to chose which you d like , The complimentary breakfast was simple but very nice The staff were always friendly and smiling The hotel is perfectly located to get you pretty much anywhere in London easily 
97849,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Ridiculous breakfast service Staff were ok but pathetically tiny coffee table for two people to serve breakfast is unacceptable for this hotel brand Spoiled the English Breakfast with spicy beans tiny portion think 10 beans and Italian smokey pancetta not back bacon Room was tiny and coil hardly access toilet in bathroom , Location was ok Check in was ok 
97850,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, staff at the reception were neither pleasant nor professional bed very very small room and bath tiny and interior design in reception and rooms not appealing at all , breakfast was very good and the staff very helpful interior in the breakfast room was very nice and modern
97851,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, There was work being done that impacted some of the facilities eg gym access Not a huge deal but would have been good to know on booking Room was a little small but fine for short stays , Location is fantastic Very comfortable bed and well appointed room Staff very helpful 
97852,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, that our room was not made up and the building work being done Requested from the reception that head office contact us having had no response we sent an email for a response still no reply Head office what s occurring do you care , location
97853,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We were disappointed in not being able to book dinner before going out to the theatre because the restaurant was reported to be fully booked When we returned later in the evening we were again unable to use the restaurant because a private party was underway We do not expect this treatment in a premium London hotel and this has made us consider whether we will stay there again The refurbished restaurant was gloomy and looked unfinished The polite and attentive waiter at breakfast said this was called the rustic style , We are always made welcome and the staff on this occasion were particularly polite and helpful We were upgraded to a better room which was very comfortable and stylishly decorated 
97854,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, My breakfast seemed to have been forgotten by the kitchen and they needed reminding Check in rather slow and laboured , Breakfast staff very charming and attentive And the breakfast on the first day in the newly refurbished dining room was superb Position of hotel really lovely Our room overlooked Monmouth Street which is most attractive bustling without being noisy 
97855,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Unfortunately restaurant and bar undergoing refurbishment which did run over into our stay but if they had been up and running it would have been perfect , Staff very good and helpful Room although small was very comfortable linen excellent 5 stars
97856,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, No bar or resturant due to an overrunning renovation project , Friendly staff and very obliging service Excellent location in a smart interesting and convenient area 
97857,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, I was a bit disappointed that the hotel did not recognise the fact that it was my daughters 21st birthday even although it was noted on the file I was only looking for a very small gesture in the room to mark the occasion but it was simply forgotten about Perhaps due to the fact that the hotel was having some major refurbishment during our stay In a way I think it should have been even more important at this time This was pretty disruptive However the staff were very courteous and cheerful and the location excellent If they had recognised the birthday as they said they would I would have scored 10 , Super friendly staff in all areas of the hotel 
97858,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Unfortunately when we arrived the restaurant was in the process of being refurbished We were unaware of this at time of booking or prior to arrival full disclosure an email was sent approx 2 weeks before arrival but went to my spam folder As a result there was no food available beyond tea coffee and croissants with location available to eat or facility to take back to the room The lobby was dusty due to the works to the extent that I dirtied my shirt and also one of the two small 4pax lifts was out of order meaning that it often took 5 mins to use the lifts , Great location for Covent Garden Theatre Land bars and restaurants
97859,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Unfortunately building works were in progress and only one slow lift with restricted access We were told via advance e mail of the work being undertaken from 8 am to 6 pm but it was being done well into the evening night , The bed was really comfy The staff were great and went out of their way to be helpful Location good 
97860,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Bar and restaurant were closed for refurbishment which werent aware of when booking on booking com This meant there was drilling dust and loud noise in the lobby area , Great location for theatres convent garden etc Room was very small but modern and had everything you needed very a very short stay 
97861,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Bathroom was a bit too small Insufficient clothes drawers essentially lived out of suitcases , Excellent location for what we wanted to accomplish Staff was courteous though a bit reserved Room was clean 
97862,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing I loved it I m looking forward to my next London visit and I will surelly stay here , I LOVE the location walking distance from everything Very friendly staff Bed linen and accomodations wonderful It even smells marvelous from the moment you walk trough the door a very special aroma greets you 
97863,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Restaurant was being refurbished so we were unable to use , They put out coffee and pastries in the foyer in the morning complimentary which was lovely 
97864,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Provide more seating in reception especially during dining room refurbishment as you are providing refreshments there at breakfast time , Rooms well cleaned and serviced Staff in reception very helpful at all times 
97865,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Cant think of anything negative, Amazingly comforatble beds power shower and the breakfast was wide ranging including a gorgeous full english cooked option Lovely surprise of birthday cake card and balloon left in the room for me 
97866,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The blinds in the room don t really cover the window it was really bright in the morning and woke us up , The location is really great we often stay here when we come to London for this reason It was my birthday while I was there and they put a chocolate cupcake in my room to celebrate The front desk staff and concierge are very helpful Comfortable bed Small room but we booked the smallest room type so this is to be expected I guess 
97867,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The pillows a bit hard on this occasion , The fridge in the room was very useful We were in the hotel on a very hot day air conditioning great The staff a strength especially Yasin the concierge was really helpful Good location 
97868,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We didn t opt for the breakfast option simply because it was 23 per person per breakfast which when you consider it is 22 for the hotels set three course evening meal makes the breakfast seem very pricey in comparison As we were hardly spoilt for choice in London we just went out for breakfast , All in all it is hard to fault the Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street it does what it tells you it will do by offering a solid 4 star experience in a fantastic location for a reasonable enough price 
97869,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Ridiculously overpriced breakfast if it s not included in your room rate better to find a local cafe of which there are plenty Usual underpowered hairdryer come on hotel industry get your act together , Comfortable beds bathroom well equipped and very clean Perfect location in Seven Dials close enough to walk to Covent Garden theatres and shopping 
97870,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, My wife bemoaned the lack of mirror in the main bedroom at desk and near power socket for hairdryer etc So many hotels just don t seem to get this , Great location very well decorated public areas and bedroom nice bar with good selection of drinks and good breakfast Easy check in and check out room available early late check out available and looked after our baggage after check out so we could head out before returning to the airport 
97871,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, the staff was very very accommodating in every way even though booking com messed up on our dates the hotel worked over that to help us the design was great and very comfortable 
97872,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, There was nothing we didn t like , the location of the hotel was ideal for what we wanted Room and communal areas were spotlessly clean and the staff were extremely helpful 
97873,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, When the concierge opened our door I thought what a good size entrance only to look behind the door and find our beds twin room the size of a shoe box Both my sister and I said Harry Potters cupboard under the stairs would have been bigger good job we travelled light and only stayed one night , Very welcoming and friendly staff The pillows on the beds would have gone home with me If I could have fit them in my case Bathroom average size Breakfast very good 
97874,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Be prepared that the bathroom is more than bijou but do you need more for a 1 night stay in London , I found the staff and especially the concierge extremely helpful The location was absolutely brilliant for the purpose of my stay 
97875,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The shower room I think is a dangerous area The floor is smooth and when soap is used the floor becomes very slippery and one could easily slip and fall with serious consequences Moreover there s nothing to grab to break the fall , I like the cosiness of the room being small and compact but wiuldn t mind a little more elbow room
97876,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Room wasn t ready at check in room showed clear signs of wear tear staff were rude and helpful breakfast too almost an hour to arrive was a disaster from start to finish, Location nothing else
97877,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, just a small thing there was only one pillow which was very nice but I would have liked another not so fat , the breakfast was well cooked and didn t have that reheated taste the staff were all extremely helpful and cheerful 
97878,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Price of drinks in bar 8 72 for a pint of shandy is shocking Pity to write a negative on what is otherwise a really good hotel choice, Hard to beat location close to the Covent Garden Good size well appointed room by London standards Friendly staff
97879,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Breakfast there were quality issues with the cooked breakfast which was served twice lukewarm which was unappetizing Although our waitress sincerely apologised and took our room number as a record on departure we were charged full price as this information had not been passed on to reception staff However the rest of the breakfast buffet was of good quality with a reasonable range of choice Service was prompt , Fantastically centrally located hotel with good standard of decor facilities and furnishings Service overall was attentive and professional and would note housekeeping which is very good Reception was helpful and dealt with an issue in the room promptly on arrival Hotel room was in a quiet part of the hotel and of reasonable good size with a modern bathroom Nice extra touches eg newspapers available and iced water in reception No biscuits with tea and coffee though This is a very nice small hotel with a comfortable feel 
97880,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, For breakfast the eggs sausages mushrooms and tomatoes were restricted The first 2 days the plain croissants were very limited and had finished by 9 00 am , The room was fabulous The breakfast was good and the green drink was very refreshing
97881,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Breakfast charged at 23 pp No facilities at all Rooms were sooooo small 2 people can hardly get around in room together , You are only paying for location and a bit of nice decor
97882,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Travelling with a wheel chair for the first time and having stayed in the hotel before I was looking forward to our stay However I was unable to get the chair into the bathroom Apparently no rooms had doors wide enough , Staff and location were excellent 
97883,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Rooms are tiny even by London standards Blinds do not cover the window so sun light beams into the room at 4 30am Internal facing rooms are even worse Never again ,No Positive
97884,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Even for a basic room the room size was smaller than expected and the bed was quite small too especially for a 4 star hotel The rooms windows are not soundproofed either so could hear quite a lot of street noise from our 1st floor room in the evening , Location is fantastic It s clean and modern and staff are friendly 
97885,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, For the price of 239 pounds the room was not good no dressing table a stand in bath shower this is nit what I would call a deluxe room my bedroom at home in Cape Town is much better dreadful couldn t wait to get of hotel and prices of everything was ridiculous would not recommend this hotel we are now in gran canaria in a radisson which is out of this world wonder,No Positive
97886,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The fact they had let our room go to another party Eventually after a lot of stress they managed to find us a room I feel sure there is a ploy here somewhere ,No Positive
97887,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The twin room we were allocated was far inferior to double rooms we have stayed in in this hotel It was poky and had a safe you could not even open unless you moved it and there was no room in the cupboard for an ironing board We were not warned about this The person at reception on our arrival was unfriendly and tried to pre charge us for expenses without asking if we wanted this , We were much happier when we had changed to a double room for our second night and all of the other staff at the hotel were friendly and efficient 
97888,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, First floor has lots of random steps up and down which don t seem necessary perhaps there to cover something up , Bed was really comfy and duvet and pillows super fluffy Reception also has tea coffee water available for guests in the morning and also a sweets table in the afternoon which is a nice touch 
97889,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Facilities in the room were very sparse No soap only gel no biscuits with hot drinks No Hairdryer no dressing table It s the smaller things that make all the difference and this hotel was lacking these Very expensive for such basic facilities whereas we have stayed in London several times before and had better value for money ,No Positive
97890,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Room very small bathroom tiny bed to small no choice of pillows had to sleep on scatter cushion no wardrobe space , Location good staff very friendly food really nice
97891,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, i didnt like i wasn t there long there long enough , Excellent choice for Breakfast food very well presented Very happy with the room the service of all the staff best hotel i have stayed at in London
97892,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Our view from the window was poor although by not being street side the room was much quieter so its pro and cons really The seats in the restaurant could do with a revamp not much support for the back , The bed was comfy the cleanliness was excellent Bulb in light was changed even though we did not report it but the maid did Room service food was delicous hot and quick Reception even took a photo and obtained a taxi for me for an interview I had on our first day Overall the stay at the hotel was seamless would recommend and would stay again The location is perfect for bars and restaurants not forgetting the theaters 
97893,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Our stay in this hotel far exceeded any expectation we had before arriving It s location for foodies shoppaholics or theatre lovers is excellent It s a shirt walk to the tube and everything you d ever need is a stone s throw away The staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble and the food was excellent I have already and will continue to recommend this hotel to friends and family and will definately be going back 
97894,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Twice requested a twin room as travelling with adult daughter I telephoned the hotel albeit I think a call centre as well Also requested early check in as we had an early flight neither of which we received Bit disappointing as it was booked as early as January Was simply told at reception that others had requested twin room as well We did get a twin room on the second night and a lovely little cake as we were celebrating our joint birthdays , Excellent breakfast friendly staff location especially so convenient to tube stations and covent garden 
97895,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We were there as part of our honeymoon which sadly wasn t acknowledged A friend staying in a nearby hotel for her wedding anniversary received a free room upgrade and a complimentary bottle of champagne and box of chocolates in her room Would be a nice touch if this hotel was able to celebrate a special occasion in some way , Excellent location walking distance to Covent Garden and Leicester Square
97896,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We were on the first floor and the corridor had a sewage smell which was really unpleasant I would also have preferred a mirror in the main bedroom too, The bed was amazingly soft and comfy The breakfast was really nice 
97897,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Requested twin beds when placed the booking no twin beds available so we had to pay an extra charge for two put you up beds really not happy , Staff hotel and restaurant were amazing Staff extremely helpful Breakfast was delicious and plentiful 
97898,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The bathroom was flooded it was awful avoid the hotel at the moment it needs the plumbing fixing and at 500 a night you would expect more, The location
97899,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Friendly welcoming helpful staff in all areas of the hotel and restaurant Room was on the small side but plenty for our needs Thoughtful little extras included in the room A lovely stay 100 recommended Great location for getting out and about including shows Good was great too 
97900,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Small Rooms with No Desk However as we spent little time in the room and came to see London not our hotel room this did not matter this time , Excellent location right next to most of the theaters Good selection of pubs and shops nearby clean room and friendly staff Location was key and it didn t disappoint 
97901,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Rooms expensive and so we booked a double room The room adequate size but bed seemed small Not a problem really as we weren t in there long hence another reason why it was expensive , Excellent location for theatre and restaurants 
97902,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The gym was small and could have a wider range of training gear , The bed was very comfy the staff was very helpful and friendly The room and bathroom were nice and clean 
97903,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing , Brilliant staff nothing too much trouble I liked the welcome postcard and sweets brought to my room by the concierge nice personal touch Good room service breakfast Excellent central location for the West End and shops yet quiet Will stay again 
97904,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Our room was quiet at the back which was great but I think the rooms at the front would possibly be noisy, The bed was comfy modern decor v friendly staff great location 
97905,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We were level one and it obviously where the twin rooms are We wanted to relax as we re having weekend away from young children Very noisy drunk people coming back to their rooms st 1am Staff said oh yep sometimes it is noisy on a Saturday but no apologies or slight discount ,No Positive
97906,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The blind in the room did not quite cover the window so it was a bit bright in the morning and the room was a little on the small side I think we usually get an upgrade but didn t this time but it was still fine for one night, Comfortable bed nice reception staff helpful concierge and we love the location we have stayed here before and no doubt will again 
97907,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, No individual shampoos or soaps for that price of hotel it is a minimum requirement basic hygiene If that was a superior room would have hated to see the standard room Was nice but over priced , Comfortable bed friendly staff great location 
97908,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing everything was great Would have like to have stayed longer definitely will next time , Everything The staff were super helpful and friendly The breakfasts were delicious the room was comfortable and stylish We travel a lot and I rarely come across an hotel that deserves a ten out of ten Well done 
97909,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Shower controls hard to decipher set on scalding hot when it actually came on Ouch Breakfast came on super hot plates but the food was cold I would go as far as chilled How do poached eggs get served cold Do they not jump out of a pan of hot water Very disappointed with hot breakfast Situated on the first floor above a busy bar again should of mention when checking in Your rooms above a busy noisy bar u ok with that , The room was very small should really flag this on booking Even if you called it cost We would get what you mean but well kitted out 
97910,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Night receptionist very poor customer skills Had to wait 45mins for room service for two sandwiches then receptionist wanted to have an argument about it , Great location
97911,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We were disappointed with the dining room the seating had started to sag In places and we felt uncomfortable , We thought the staff were great friendly and professional our room was very special the bed was very comfortable we slept very well
97912,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Corridor was very narrow and we had a room with a linking door which does not soundproof too well We could hear their entire conversations , Staff were super friendly Breakfast was superb and our room was beautiful with a lovely view over the streets of Covent Garden
97913,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, You must book a Large room otherwise a double is far to small Not enough room to walk around your bed also the kettle is in a small wardrobe in the room along with everything else the next size room up the wardrobe is in the bathroom so always go large on the rooms if you can afford it , Love the closeness off everything Your right in the middle of all the restaurants bars shopping plus theatres are a 10 min walk away 
97914,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Great staff made us welcome Good location in Covent Garden close to shops restaurants and theatre Rooms were comfortable and bed would definitely stay here again
97915,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Only a very small minor issue the pillows were too big lovely and soft but too high , The Location was perfect right in the heart of everything The staff were attentive and rooms were a good size 
97916,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, If I had to make a negative comment I would say that the shower came over the side of the tray after I had only been in for a few minutes If I d of been washing my hair ale hitch would have meant I was in a lot longer the bathroom floor would have been flooded , Perfect location a for cleanliness and staff were very helpful and polite I will definitely recommend this hotel to others and will stay here again 
97917,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, The welcome from Reception staff was wonderful There was a Happy Birthday cake waiting in our room which was much appreciated Our room was so quiet and yet the hotel is right in the thick of Covent Garden Soho life The bed was very comfortable and the room and en suite were spotlessly clean Breakfast was served by the most professional staff and the English Breakfast set us up for a busy Saturday We will certainly come back Hopefully not just for a birthday celebration 
97918,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Very small room with no twin bed option Dark looked out onto offices so unable to pull up blind No cereal available at breakfast service slow considering amount of staff on duty , Very convenient for theatre Nice modern hotel helpful staff 
97919,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The breakfast was overpriced and although tasty it was served up slowly with no butter or condiments We had to ask for butter with our toast and ketchup with our cooked breakfast , Fantastic location very clean and cool decor 
97920,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The TV did not work Had to request an engineer but due to this being late in the day we were not able to enjoy this whilst we were getting ready to go out Also I wasted time trying to work out why it wasn t working etc which wasn t easy as it was pinned to the wall The duty manager working that day 26 03 16 appeared to be sympathetic but was not prepared to offer us any kind of incentive to come back to the hotel so I am sorry to say this will be the first and last time we will book the radisson anywhere , Good location and the room was clean tidy 
97921,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, My room was a little small The hotel is always very busy so the staff are also very busy which means sometimes you wait a little longer than perhaps you should in the bar areas and at breakfast for service , Think the location is perfect The staff are ever so accommodating and the facilities are excellent 
97922,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, We enjoyed the bar restaurant buzzy atmosphere early evenings nice for a cocktail or two and the breakfasts we re excellent lots of choice and good quality freshly cooked breakfast 
97923,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Excellent all round , The location of the hotel was perfect for our theatre trips The staff were very efficient polite and helpful We fully intend to make a return trip later in the year 
97924,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Fantastic central location within walking distance of all theatres small exclusive shops large choice of resteraunts pubs and close to Covent Garden tube Small but immaculately clean bedroom Very tasty breakfast with a good selection of continental English or on the go bags We found all the staff to be friendly and helpful Will defiantly come back for our next theater trip
97925,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The heating systems in the room are too wild and wonderful to describe Needless to say the room temperature was never right Furniture in room and public rooms were not comfortable , Ideally situated in the heart of theatre land and tourist west end and yet in a quiet spot The hotel is pleasant cosy and well run Expensive but by London standards very reasonable 
97926,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, everyone who orders a double bed is shown a twin saying this is the double and it is small and if you want a queen size you have to pay extra they do that to everyonw the bes we got after the upgrade had a dent in the matress very uncomfortable the rooms very cold and even though we got another blow warmer from the staff the toilets were so cold , the location is great the staf very accomodating
97927,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The price was expensive didn t include breakfast remote control for tv missing from room very noisy on a night, The location of the hotel the staff made you feel special nothing too much trouble for them rooms clean tidy
97928,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We booked a double room got there to find it was a Cosy Double Room and very small so we upgraded at a cost of 40 per night I would not recommend a Double Room for a couple for more than 1 night Bed is small double and hardly any room to move around , The location is excellent 5 minute walk from Covent Garden Tube walking distance from lots of Theatres
97929,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, If you have to work there is no real desk with proper chairs And breakfast in the hotel is to be avoided terrible food and bad service Fortunately there are plenty of nice places near the hotel , The location is superb and the bed is very comfortable 
97930,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Slightly disappointed that we were booked into a superior twin room which turned out to be quite small , Great location The staff were very friendly Lovely breakfast Very quiet considering we were in central London 
97931,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, my room wasn t ready had been given someone else on I got was also very small there was an iron but no ironing board and only one dressing gown I had hoped there would be tooth paste too worse bit was a constant rumble coming through the pillow too which I would describe as the sound of washing machines in the next room kept me up most the night , location staff and the cleanliness 
97932,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Hotel rooms too small and basic Not at all like it was advertised on the web Meals very poor Had to send breakfast back on two days as only barely warm Fire alarm went off both nights No explanation from staff or phone call to advise why Would not recommend this hotel, Nothing
97933,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We wanted a twin room as my daughter was joining me but that was not available so we had a double not a queen or a king so she had to go home, The location and helpfulness of staff
97934,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Pre booked twin room was unavailable We were forced to take double bed with camp bed AND pay extra 40 per night I have rheumatoid arthritis and my daughter was heavily pregnant I was furious , Good breakfast heated towel rails lounge bar has good ambience 
97935,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, i ordered burger and it wasnt good it was like stone, nice hotel nice location nice stuff super friendly loved it so much i ll come there for my next trip to london
97936,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, No privacy at breakfast as they cram the tables together so it s like you re sharing with strangers , Great Location for Soho Theatre s Covent Garden Max 5 mins walk for all of them Room was small but clean and very nicely decorated Breakfast was included in my rate and was satisfactory 
97937,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Breakfast staff not efficient or friendly All other staff in hotel were excellent , Bed very comfortable and I had incredible views of London from room
97938,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Service at breakfast twice was poor Took too long to take our order and bring our food out , Beds were very comfortable Most staff were lovely and very helpful especially the front desk staff Food was amazing Great vibe in the bar area Great location 
97939,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The chairs were comfortable but not good for laptop work relative to table , I was thoroughly impressed the staff who greeted me were great friendly and helpful I was arriving early 6am and leaving early 3am They made me welcome gave me early access to the room and arranged breakfast at 3am because I would not be able to enjoy it at 7am Room was clean and comfortable 
97940,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Had to wait 50 mins past check in time for room despite other guests after us getting theirs Breakfast wait was awful and tables very crammed Noise from heating fan in room very loud , Central location
97941,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Windows in the room didn t shut properly so was noises till about 1 and spent 30 mins trying to sort it myself as it was too late to move rooms then no offer other than an apology for the noise of a sorry , Location and convenience staff were good and apart from the Windows which I have mentioned there was nothing I could fault it on and would stay again
97942,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We booked a standard double for 2 people but only 1 no Bedside table was in the room so know where to put a drink on one side The wardrobe was not big enough to hang a knee length dress in nor 2 winter coats, The breakfast
97943,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Could t use the hotel bar as it was full both times we tried to enter Was told we should book in advance even we are residents would be good to have this information on the website when booking , Clean comfortable room Great location to get to everything you need 
97944,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The size of our room was so small that we had to use the window sill to put our watches jewellery money on The hairdryer was in the wardrobe as well as the coffee making facilities not good as your clothes were in there also Would never stay in that room again wasnt happy with that , Staff were always help to help and the hotel on the whole was lovely 
97945,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Breakfast in the restaurant was terrible we had to wait more than 40mins after ordering this was the same problem the two couples either side of us had too in fact one couple had to return a meal as it was stone cold and the other couple received an incorrect order Our second breakfast was taken in our room and this was far far better , Very warm welcome at check in staff very helpful and the same standard of service during check out 
97946,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Room was a little small but cosy , Hotel was very comfortable staff were very attentive and polite The morning breakfast was amazing Thankyou for a lovely stay 
97947,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, I was given a twin room when I d booked a double as a single traveller I wasn t pleased They offered to upgrade me to a suite with a double bed at a cost of 80 Seemed a bit off not to offer an upgrade without charge since it was their mistake , The location is great as are the rooms and the breakfast 
97948,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room was tiny for the price and the heating was very loud and woke us up Breakfast we had tea with no tea bags no forks to eat with toast was cold and has to ask 2 staff members to receive it at all View from room was office workers staring in , Very clean and tidy
97949,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Poor housekeeping poor bar service weak disorganised service at breakfast, Great welcome at reception poor housekeeping poor service in bar restaurant but breakfast is really good when it eventually comes Room was dirty
97950,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Rooms felt smaller than they were Had to skirt around the bed kept getting in each other s way very easily Tables in the restaurant higher compared to the seats made it a little awkward when eating but wouldn t stop me going again If I being picky there was no bath either so would probably go for the bigger room if the price was ok , Location is excellent Really nice area makes you feel like you re not quite in the city centre Rooms are really clean if a little on the small side standard double Breakfast is really nice Full English
97951,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Very quiet INSIDE the hotel very noisy outside as there are so many streets 7 Dials area in a small area shop burglar alarm went off three times for half an hour each time in early hours of the morning drums playing in another street goods lorries arrive early , Super smart hotel in a great location 
97952,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, I had to pay for an upgrade to get what I already paid for The room booked was supposed to have a bath However only a shower was available When asking about it I was told that I am out of luck because not all rooms have the bath as advertised and I would have to buy an upgrade So basically I had to pay double Their 100 satisfaction guarantee is a joke apparently The room service breakfast was more that 30 Minutes late and they forgot essential items of the order Had to call multiple times and the restaurant chef excused himself saying that a lot of people ordered breakfast I would have expected them to be experienced enough to handle that , Although it is quite a walk to the next tube station the location is good The breakfast is nice and offers a good variety if you go down to the restaurant The room was small but nice 
97953,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The decoration of the room feels a bit dated The window panes in the rooms were dirty The breakfast could be improved The hair dryer is difficult to find and not very easy to use attached to a wardrobe , The staff are very friendly and helpful The location is excellent It s near to many theatres restaurants shops and you can walk everywhere The bed was very comfortable 
97954,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The Mrs moaned that the pillows were to firm , The bed was a good size and very comfy aswell as the actually room being a decent size for central London 
97955,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, For the price the room a deluxe double was a bit tatty floor stains chipped wood hairs scattered around And it was TINY but you re paying solely for location here Staff were pleasant and the room was quiet 509 but this is the second London Radisson Blu I ve stayed at and the chain seems to favour style over substance Weird music in the lifts and weird art and statues but little signage ie reception this way Wouldn t stay again usually stay at the Marrioty Canary Wharf but went to Ronnie Scott s late show and this was close by , Location was great for Soho 
97956,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Lovely Boutique hotel and in great location I know London well and this is a great place to stay lot of local restaurants and bars Pubs Staff very friendly and room and bed very comfy Stayed for wife s birthday and did not disappoint went to comedy store on the Friday night witch is also very near Would stay again 
97957,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Very good location in Covent Garden near theatres Opera Picadilly Ciorcus and Trafalgar Square Nice and clean hotel good breakfast and helpfull staff 
97958,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Not really a problem as its London and very built up didn t like the view from our window but I just closed the blind not a problem that ruined anything, The hotel was a fantastic location for us we could walk to everything we had planed to do the room was very comfortable the bed was very comfortable and made up for us each day we were very happy thank you
97959,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room was extremely small i even asked for an upgrade as i always stay at a Radisson hotel all over the world but staff were not super friendly , The location of the hotel was good 
97960,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Our room is quite small Not much of extra space for 2 huge luggage Also we don t like the steps right before and after our bedroom door and also the lift lobby Too tedious for us to move our luggage up and down Cost is considered quite on the high side as we can find better hotel with the same price The reason we booked this was because of our new year countdown venue which was within walking distance so it would be convenient for us to walk back as the tube service was temporarily closed , Location is superb within walking distance to Covent Garden underground station and all the high street shops Also adjacent to a few theatres we have Maltida show just across from our hotel No complaints on location Staffs are friendly attentive Housekeeping service is swiftly Room is cozy bathroom is fab and clean 
97961,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, No vanity area in the room and hotel could not provide a mirror to apply makeup and the hair dryer was in the wardrobe I has to dry my haire on the back of a wardrobe door, The staff
97962,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The trouble for us is that we are old Over 80 All the facilities in our room were available if we knew how to operate the switches But we did not and nobody ever thought to instruct us We were unable to turn down the heat which was like the tropics We did not know how to work the tv The list goes on It was a pity we missed so much , The bedroom was nicely furnished The bed was comfortable We had a nice i e enjoyable breakfast 
97963,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The view and the size of the bathroom Expensive breakfast, The location is very good but the room was small especially the bathroom The room at the back look directly into other rooms No privacy at all 
97964,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, 1 thing that I can pick at was the size of the room was a little small we had a standard twin but it was comfortable and it s in the middle of London what can u expect , lovely hotel clean and modern Staff very helpful especially at reception Only 5 min walk away from most theatres and china town about 10 minute walk away from regent street and nearest tube stations Great location but very quiet considering its in the middle of London Breakfast was also nice with a big choice 
97965,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, standard rooms are not maintained I had to replace two rooms in one night because of various malfunctions in the rooms, Location was superb hotel was modern and clean breakfast was excellent 
97966,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Excellent location and staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel is in within walking distance of many of the popular London sites and shopping destinations plus theatres Plus close to tube stations 
97967,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Unfortunately we were woken up in the middle of the first night of our stay by a funny noise that sounded like a drill I rang and reported it but they were unsure what it was then later the fire alarm went off We had to all leave and as we were sent back to our rooms it went off again This was unfortunate because the same thing happened to us in a different one of your hotels last year , Everyone was very helpful and friendly The location was fantastic for what we wanted and the room was comfortable 
97968,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room was supposedly a superior double but it was tiny and the bed was a normal double I e very small for a modern and very expensive hotel I didn t know that double beds came smaller than king size in modern hotels We got a bad nights sleep because of this It was also not just pricey but extraordinarily expensive for what you got I paid more than you would for a standard room for this superior one so I hate to think what they are like there was barely room to walk around the bed in ours , Brilliant location and friendly staff
97969,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The size of room The tiny bed Address in google maps take you to a bike shop Check in was difficult as was booked under wife s name wouldn t accept id with marching address and surname Tap was wrong way round nearly scolded myself The breakfast was cold and tasteless and of poor quality , Location Room was clean 
97970,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, Great location very clean hotel rooms a little bit small but they had everything and were sparkling clean bathroom had all the items you would need room had everything also including iron we also had breakfast to the room the next morning and it was lovely very very happy with the hotel 
97971,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, During this stay we found a lot of noise from the staff as they went in and out of the next room each time they went in or out they just left the room door to slam as this could start quite early in the morning and we were on a leisure trip it really did disturb us We mentioned this at reception but they seemed to think it was a guest this was not the case as we made a point of checking who was letting the door slam This is the first time we have had a problem whilst staying at this hotel , We have stayed at this hotel numerous times before as we think it is a good central location rooms are compact but comfy and we had included breakfast this time which was excellent
97972,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Lack of professionalism lack of customer focus poor manners smelly bathroom noisy room old stinking carpets lack of taxis around general manager should not represent this hotel as she brings harm to it I used to stay in Radisson Blu each time that was the last time I did it , Absolutely unprofessional Duty Managers and General Manager not taking care of Radisson Blu intimidating guests not able to admit to mistakes they made with providing incorrect information about the Club Carlson points system 
97973,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We booked an Executive Room on the 6th floor It was very comfortable well decorated and had everything we needed Housekeeping was excellent On the down side the bathroom was very cramped poorly designed and a bit hazardous , The location of this hotel is perfect for anyone wanting to shop visit galleries go to shows and have an amazing choice of good restaurants cafes and bars all within walking distance The hotel is shiny and smart and the staff are friendly and helpful The food s good too 
97974,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Rather pricy but guess that s normal for central London , Fantastic location at the Seven Dials and very close to Covent Garden Lots of wonderful restaurants cosy bars and fantastic shopping close by Very good rooms with a nice decor 
97975,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The breakfast was charged extra and was very expensive We had the continental breakfast but was not impressed with the choice of food , The location of hotel was ideal for us and the staff were very friendly The hotel room was cleaned to a very high standard 
97976,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Booked as Standard Double but was a queen bathroom to small things in stupid places drinks horrendously over priced and very poor service that dos nt warrent service charge will carry on staying at the PremierInn Hub , Lovely decor 
97977,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Nothing , Staff were outstanding Friendly helpful and professional particularly Sonia who was incredibly helpful and patient at check in arranging our rooms for us nothing was too much trouble for her thanks Sonia Location was wonderful as well 
97978,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Being offered an upgrade on the room before I had even seen it The service in the bar resturant was not good for us felt neglected we were there for 4 nights and each night and breakfast got no better , Location hotel staff on reception room was small but lovely food was tasty 
97979,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Booked twin rooms but were given doubles One room we were able to swap with a visitor who asked for a double and got a twin but very disappointed with this Room details did not match what we were given No Bath No Fridge or mini bar, Location was excellent for seeing the west end shows
97980,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Hotels in London have become very expensive but this isn t an issue exclusive to The Mercer, Great location and a great room on the 7th floor Very quiet
97981,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Very small standard room Understand that property in London are expensive but the room we stayed looks more a single sold at price of double for reference we could not even open the lagguage and have to put it on the bed for that , Great location good new facility and staff Highly recommended but check the room size 
97982,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Although the hotel facilities were clean housekeeping is not doing a good job prices of the accommodation and other services were expensive , Location is super staff is nice Bed was comfortable 
97983,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The late check in ie 3pm However the staff took our luggage and we were able to use our room at approx 14 15 , Location was ideal for ROH Breakfast was good Room neat and tidy 
97984,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Housekeeping not to the standard expected They forgot to put slippers in the room On another day they forgot to replace the towels they just removed the used ones Finally I had to ask twice for maintenance to change the bathroom lamp, Friendliness of personnel
97985,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, the hotel is very inefficient with booking taxis so if you travel for business it s a huge problem I was recommended to go out and just find one whereas all taxis were booked for around 15 minutes I would recommend to have a direct deal with Uber or taxi corp to provide better experience for guests , very good location in a beautiful old part of London with plenty of restaurants around
97986,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Had a deluxe room but found it quite small for the money and the window had view of back of buildings, Fantastic location Clean and contemporary Breakfast excellent though the service was slow 
97987,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The service at dinner and breakfast wasn t as good as you would expect in this standard of hotel The tv in our room didn t work for some reason , Lovely Covent Garden location right in the centre of London but on quiet side street nice food in restaurant Room was upgraded but still small tea coffee making facilities in the bathroom 
97988,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, the staff were very friendly and attentive they made all our requests happen My elderly mother was traveling with us unfortunately she had a fall the staff who helped were marvelous breakfast was a joy 
97989,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Such a small standard room for the price and no breakfast including in what we paid air con noisy, Location decor food in restaurant comfortable bed security
97990,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street,No Negative, One of the best locations to be found in London I ve stayed here a couple times before this trip and the staff and service is always exceptional Rooms are small but very nice Also a great bar and restaurant on site 
97991,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The mattress is a little too firm for me , Great service from friendly and thoughtful staff Excellent location Breakfast is plentiful if it s include din the room rate it s definitely worth it Firm pillows are great 
97992,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Rooms disappointing Bathroom nice but bedroom quite basic no dressing table with hairdryer in the wardrobe making getting ready awkward Have stayed in other London hotels for the same price which had much nicer rooms ,No Positive
97993,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The twin room was quite small and cramped but the staff did offer an alternative at an upgraded price , Location was great staff were excellent Breakfast delicious with plenty of choice 
97994,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, not a lot , the staff were great our room was beautiful although it was a suite so as expected for the money perfect location excellent room service breakfast lovely robes and free water fantastic 
97995,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Having cooked breakfast bought and left on our table when we hadn t finished our cereals or fruit Unable to use safe in room situated at bottom of wardrobe right in corner where you couldn t see to set code , Location Breakfast Staff at reception Spotless 
97996,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Tiny room and tiny shower toilet area Pathetically small bed The blind was not adequate and let a lot of light into the room Could not turn the air con on The sink was blocked and water would not go down the plug hole quickly The first room we were offered someone had been smoking in it and it smelt awful We were offered another room which smelt better but we had to wait an hour for it We were also offered an upgrade for 100 extra as there was only a suite free at the time A bad experience in all We had a great stay in London other than the hotel , Good location and it was quiet 
97997,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, The room I booked wasn t available the manager gave me 3 options pay more for an upgrade pay little less for a downgrade or go to another sister hotel After long discussion I decided for a downgrade under the condition that the bed was a queen type Another broken promise the bed was a standard couple type Shame on them , location
97998,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Everything was perfect , The excellence of staff in making your stay perfect We booked very late at night and arrived within 15 min of booking no problems 
97999,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, We had some electrical difficulty and the hair dryer didn t work But overall it was great , The location was perfect The rooms are small but nice
98000,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, however the room we had this time was much smaller then the one we stayed in previously we could hardly move and for 250 a night I thought it wasn t the best value for money, We like the location of the hotel as we have stayed here before
98001,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, Covent Garden tube is exit only on weekdays and closed at weekends so you ll have to go to Leicester Square station Room was rather compact but it s ok if you re only using it to sleep, Check in and check out staff very friendly and helpful unusual for London Location is convenient and accessible to many restaurants 
98002,Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street, My stay was made stressful due to almost every member of staff being not to a standard this type of hotel should have Day before arrival I rang 5 times to confirm my booking even the duty manager wasn t able to until a heated argument started then they felt they had to make an effort heh presto they found it Calls that where promised to be returned after investigation never came went on from 10am in the morning to 5 30pm in the evening After departing I had 2 x follow up calls due to my complaints from managers who couldn t even get my name right I then got follow up emails addressing me by a different name The breakfast was terrible being served simply scrambled eggs on toast the toast only 1 slice was served 20 min before the eggs Asking for more warm toast it never arrived after 1 hr I left went elsewhere for breakfast that was after being charged 23 On a follow up for this complaint the F B manager told me the toaster was faulty he would buy me a drink in the bar if I ever returned to their hotel which I won t The mini bar was totally empty in the bedroom but I had to leave a deposit by card on reception at point of check in so made me worry I was going to be charged will be checking my bank statements After 9 days after departure my invoice from them as requested for final bills has still not been received When ordering room service at the bar to be sent up I had to explain 3 times to the bar tender as he couldn t grasp the fact I wanted it in the room not in the bar I could go on on but I think anyone reading would be fed up by that point Very very disappointed in the standard of staff particularly management I was only there 2 nights , Nothing
