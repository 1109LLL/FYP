438979,Catalonia Rigoletto,No Negative, Awesome place Very comfortable spacious rooms with very elegant and luxurious design style Pool area is great too and it is not busy at all Metro is very close 5 minutes walk Wi Fi is great throughout whole hotel even in the restaurant that is close to the hotel 
438980,Catalonia Rigoletto, It s the second time I stay in this hotel You really need to put carpets on the corridors as it is very noisy and disturbing to hear the other guests walking on the corridors and dragging their suitcases on that wooden like floor I really consider not staying there again because of the noise Otherwise it would be really nice , bed was comfortable
438981,Catalonia Rigoletto, There was some problems with the cold water in the bathroom but this issue didn t affect my good experience at this hotel , Gustavo at the reception gave me a very beautiful room with a nice view and he was so kind and helpful I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and will recommend it to my friends as well This hotel is not located in the heart of the city but there are lots of public transportation systems near the property like metro and bus which you can use to reach every district you want 
438982,Catalonia Rigoletto,No Negative, I did not stay at the Rigeletto because they had some plumbing problems but they organised another room for me at the Catalona Barcelona plaza which was also very good and even booked me a taxi to get there The staff I spoke to was awesome 
438983,Catalonia Rigoletto, The room was small for 2 adults and a kid More important the problem with cold water couldn t be solved and we had to have shower with boiled water , It was close to main shopping area 
438984,Catalonia Rigoletto, The pool is quite small and can be busy at times, Great location for getting around the city situated in a leafy area with a few things roundabout Room was very modern and comfortable 
438985,Catalonia Rigoletto, Would be good to have tea option in room as well as coffee No water in room beside mini bar previously complimentary bottle provided No views from the room but didn t bother me as overnight stay only may do if you were there for longer , Brilliant rooms clean and spacious very welcoming staff good breakfast Have stayed twice would happily stay again Very good value 
438986,Catalonia Rigoletto, Only negative is that breakfas is very expensive at EUR 17 per person per day when there are other cafeterias you can have breakfas for half that price , The property is well taken care of the staff is really helpful friendly and polite The room was very spacious and although the pool was a bit small this is a bonus considering it is a small hotel in the centre

438988,Catalonia Rigoletto, The cleaning staff often set the air conditioning too high after cleaning causing the temperature too cold when entering the room , A really nice hotel outside the city center with very friendly staff The room was nice clean and spacious and was cleaned properly every day 
438989,Catalonia Rigoletto, Bar the Camp Nou nothing else to do around the area but local train station allowed you to get to the central part of the city in 20 mins, Staff was very helpful especially Laia sp Easy check in out Room was very impressive

438999,Catalonia Rigoletto, My room was rather dark and although I wasn t going to spend much time in it I would have appreciated more natural light Also whilst the breakfasts were very good the layout in the restaurant made it very difficult when busy but there s not a lot they can do to rectify this Therefore anyone planning to stay there should aim for either an early or late breakfast and avoid the peak time , The staff location and bathroom were all excellent I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived on everthing from the welcome to the quality of the food in the restaurant A place that I would definitely return to

439028,Catalonia Rigoletto, Provide some coffee and or water in the rooms The location in terms of suburb was ok but I did not expect the hotel to be in btwn what seemed like residential flats , I perhaps had expectations way too high for a 4 star hotel No coffee and or water in rooms

439044,Catalonia Rigoletto, The hotel says they have a gym which is clearly a lie as 4 exercise bikes infront of a TV doesn t consist of a gym was very disappointed with this As it is very hot in Barcelona not having ice buckets to provide ice for guest is ridiculous and then running out of ice on top of that is unheard of The rooftop pool is merely a paddling pool for kids that s all an adult can hardly swim in there Rooms are very dark, The beds are the best thing about this hotel not to sure about the leather pillows though

439050,Catalonia Rigoletto,No Negative, This is a fantastic hotel It doesn t look much from the outside but inside its a very clean and modern hotel The pool is small but rarely too busy so it s nice to hop in there at the end of a long days sightseeing The rooms are very comfortable and the breakfast is good Location wise it s a little out of the centre but Les Corts metro stop is only a 5 10 minute walk and from there you can get pretty much anywhere in the city with ease Highly recommended 
439051,Catalonia Rigoletto, We booked junior suit but there was really boring view and decoration It is so strange that there is no any direct accese to street you must drop off taxi and Cary your logage by your self 50 to 70 m through hotel entrance I think this hotel is 3 star not more , Nothing

439056,Catalonia Rigoletto, Shower wasn t very powerful would have liked more fruit selection at breakfast , The bed was very comfortable the room spotlessly clean Huge bathroom although the shower was not very powerful Highly recommend would definitely stay here again Excellent location for Nou Camp with amazing shops and restaurants all within walking distance

439072,Catalonia Rigoletto,No Negative, Close to Camp Nou for us to watch an evening match there We simply walked back from the stadium Paying just 40 euro for a 6 hour late check out is a plus
439073,Catalonia Rigoletto, I rented two rooms one for me and one for my parents Mine was lit well enough but theirs was a little bit dark Also the shower control was very sensitive and was hard to adjust between hot and cold water , Cozy clean quiet good location Great staff Very nice bathroom soap shampoo gel e t c 
439074,Catalonia Rigoletto, Dark rooms Unpolite staff No capabilities of problem solving Not able to give guidlines recommendations I ask for roomservice and I left the food practicaly untouch as quality was very poor and they charged me more than expected because in my room it was the old menu with old prices , Nothing in special It is just a room The services of a 4 star hotel were missing housekeeping was the only department that show willines to help and serve
