110130,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The value compared to the pictures in Booking com of the rooms was completely not the same Very small rooms compared to the ones in the picture and the prices is very high ,No Positive
110131,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The standard doubles are quite small and you need to travel light as there is a wardrobe but no drawer space , We stay here quite often when I am working in London usually for only one or two nights at a time Superb location for access to most of the key areas to visit and handy for several underground lines Staff are always friendly and helpful and the ability to leave luggage post checkout we usually travel back late evening is a big plus for us The views across london from rooms on the higher floors are also amazing 
110132,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Expensive rate and no Arabic channels in the TV also the restaurant menu could be improved, Good location only five minutes to Oxford street and Edgware Road and the Hyde Park
110133,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The room was a bit small and could do with a renovation considering the high price The dinner at the hotel was not very good and the restaurant staff were very unhelpful and almost unfriendly The toilet was very low to the ground which I found rather peculiar , Mostly the staff were very friendly and service minded The location is great for exploring the West End of London Bed was comfortable and the breakfast was excellent It is a comfortable hotel 
110134,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London,No Negative, We ended up at the Radisson Blu after a nightmare with our original accommodation booking But we are so pleased we did Amazing staff Stefania on reception was wonderful and an absolute credit to Radisson All in all a great stay Comfortable rooms good facilities great location and a nice breakfast Would highly recommend

110136,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, We were kept waiting for a pot of tea late at night You seemed to be understaffed and the staff on duty whilst very polite and courteous needed some training in managing customers , Georgiana Reception Desk was very professional and yet friendly at the same time She is a very good representative of your hotel 
110137,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Nothing Really The air conditioner didn t get as cold as I like it , The staff are all amazing Notably Hailu Mohammed Marta Stefania Gorgiana and all of the Bartenders 
110138,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Bad property old equipment TV didn t work well the entire stay and TV box was replaced 2 times not that it helped toilet old and not working well We ordered a double room through Booking com when we came in they told us we can t stay there cause it is really small and it was we checked and we have to upgrade We paid more and the staff explained that next time if we book directly it won t happen scam Business class means bigger room breakfast bottle of water everyday and coffee machine Bigger room yes it was Breakfast was ok Water we didn t get and everyday we had to call ask for it and wait for it to come Coffee no capsules and everyday we had to call ask for it and wait for it to come Staff said they will try to fix things when we complaint during our stay De facto they managed to fix some of the malfunctions in the TV but no more than that We strongly recommend to avoid this hotel and will consider re ordering through Booking com now that we understand you might get less of a service for doing so Very bad experience we had to expend more money then we planned just because the booking com didn t tell us the room is not really for two persons ,No Positive
110139,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London,No Negative, The pillows are amazing the staff are very attentive and kind the hotel is in a brilliant location just at the back of Oxford street Brilliant for buses taxis and walking

110142,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Not enough staff on at a very busy breakfast The staff did their best but slightly overwhelmed , Polite efficient staff very helpful particularly the doorman who had great sense of humour Made very welcome by all staff and room upgrade was a bonus Very comfortable all round Food was excellent served late 
110143,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, AC did not work on my first visit Sink also too small Gold elite member had to ask for water in room several times and late check out could better , Bed comfortable 
110144,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Only issue is they really should put proper milk into the fridge What was offered in the tea caddy was awful Also nicer tea would be a bonus A small issue but one noticed after a 26 hour flight , The hotel was easily accessible and within walking distance from Oxford St Room was fabulous Staff were helpful and excellent Housekeeping were excellent and I really enjoyed my stay there 
110145,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, My room had a balcony with large glass door which could not be opened which is fine but during my stay it was quite windy outside and there was a bit cold draft coming from the large windows door and a fair amount of wind noise at times but nothing that really spoiled my stay , Good size on room with a decent view i was on 10th floor Friendly staff and good selection on breakfast
110146,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, When I called for taxi the morning of departure they sent private car I refused as it was way more expensive Otherwise concierge and entire staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel made every effort to make stay comfortable , Great bedding
110147,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Picture on Booking com we re not the same The hotel bed linens were dirty and disgusting No slippers in the room No water to drink as well , Nothing special
110148,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Rooms need an update They used to bee good in the 1990 s however things are falling apart in the room the bathroom especially very run down room smells bad and of smoke, Location and staff we re great
110149,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, I was offered a free upgrade to a room when I went to the room there was a bed at a diagonal in the room from which you couldn t even watch the Tv There was no complimentary water and the water in the mini bar cost 4 a small bottle Having paid 250 for the room I thought this was unacceptable,No Positive
110150,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Metal found in food didn t complain then hotel refused to honour discount through the discount card that they asked me to take out on arrival Really disappointed with customer service on this particular point Wouldn t stay again ,No Positive
110151,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Staff were t the friendliest but the main issues were the faults with the upkeep of the hotel Lift would not respond to guests card keys meaning every time someone wanted to get to their room it was either waiting for a staff member to fix or take the stairs The plug in the bath would not release meaning it filled with water during a shower The result was having to stand in my partner s dirty shower water when trying to get clean for the day We asked for a new hair dryer as ours wasn t working and were met with a very unfriendly staff member who came to check ours before going back to get a replacement We also had a very early knock at our door with a staff member asking to fix our door This was the only thing we hadn t reported broken as it worked fine but the staff insisted on checking it while we were in the room , The bed was comfy
110152,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The noise of cars passing by the hotel and the loud music during the weekend at night The terrace s door cannot be closed properly and its not sound proof , Location and staff were very helpful and friendly
110153,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Staff reception guys are good tis you have to deal with them in reception but if you ask anything to be fixed in room like air con etc there attitude is rude as customers are not watching them there ROOM SERVICE i asked in morning for room service and they didn t provided new towels no new soaps or shampoo cleaning was not up to any standard ROOMS SIZE I was not expecting this tiny size double room that in night is you walk to toilet you will literally hit the tele its very small room extremely small for this price of room such type of room is just not right and in central london why i just don t get Pillows on bed are so massive thats its good for HULK not humans restless night due to pillows In shower a tall person cannot take shower as they have a rack there which will hit your head plenty times parking is too expensive i paid 44 per day but they have listed this not something new Air conditioning is very low i asked to get it fixed and they said this is the max it was suffocating i will not be living here again its better i try HYATT or Marriot as if booked early i could get near to there rate of 179 Guys try any other but not radisson blue i seriously recommend this way to type more so no one gets restless , the location of hotel was like only 5 min walk to EDGWARE ROAD that is the only positive point 
110154,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Standard double room was very small and basic Bathroom also tiny otherwise hotel served its purpose for one night accommodation Wouldn t have liked to stay in that kind of room for a longer length of time , Staff were superb friendly and helpful
110155,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The shower flooring needs updating The breakfast buffet should have warm plates for the English breakfast More selection of rolls and bread for breakfast, The surprise treat laid on for my birthday The staff were all friendly and helpful The fresh orange squeezer was a good idea
110156,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London,No Negative, We were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite so the whole experience was awesome The receptionist was fantastic and had done this because our scheduled room wasn t quite ready but rather than make us wait which we had been quite happy to do she looked to see what else was available We were only staying the one night so this was really above and beyond regrettably I didn t note down the young lady s name This Hotel is superbly place for all of London s many attractions and whilst being very upmarket it never makes you feel uncomfortable The staff are polite and friendly and the Hotel is always immaculately kept 
110157,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, breakfast was disappointing big bowl of uninviting yoghurt a plum ad a banana Bread basket with underdone toast and mini croissant and pain au raisin Weak coffee, Comfy bed Really friendly and helpful concierge
110158,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London,No Negative, the rooms were very warm and cosy the Concierge was most extremely helpful Stuart and we opted for a breakfast on the second day which we found I well worth the money A great atay and very close to all the shops 
110159,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, I booked a room with two beds upon checkin i found only one bed so i contacted the reception and they said they are fully booked and cant provide any thing I contacted booking com and and all the sudden they had plenty of upgrades I was given a room with sofa bed which is still not what i have booked, Nothing
110160,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, They are currently renovating rooms if you are lucky you get a renovated room the older rooms are not great You pay the same whichever room you get so be sure to ask for a newly renovated room if you can , Location is great a short walk to Oxford Street 
110161,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Room assistance very poor 2 bottles of water should be provided daily on a complimentary basis , The food at the restaurant was excellent location excellent front desk staff very courteous and helpful
110162,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Location for me was poor as I wanted to be closer to Wembley stadium but this was as close as I could get but staff made up for this with great service, Staff are second to none
110163,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London,No Negative, I have chosen this hotel several times I changed to this Radisson based on recomendation by a local friend because there are other Radisson hotels nearby And I have never disappointed The service was as friendly as earlier times The hotel is centrally located but no traffic disturbances This time breakfast was little better than previous time 
110164,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Small rooms check in was too complicated no complementary water below standard response to guest calls requests, Location proximity to major attractions such as Hydepark Exford Street
110165,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, My friend thought the mattress perfect but it was a smidge too soft for me but that s being really picky , The location was perfect Quiet but near enough to walk to the tube 
110166,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The in house restaurant though modern and very well presented had a very limited menu I stayed in a business class room which was great in terms of size I do think that the rooms would be well served by a facelift as in areas they look dated , I really enjoyed my stay here particularly for the location The staff were professional courteous and welcoming The local partnership with Patisserie Valerie is excellent with macarons waiting for you in your room upon arrival 
110167,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Room size I booked superior room and they gave me standard room Pictures in booking com are misleading Superior room is not 23m sq Rooms are much smaller Hotel is misguiding customers Furniture is old , Nice location Good clean property Comfy beds

110169,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, the rooms are small somehow i would advise to book the deluxe room if 2 people the normal room is so tiny unless you don t mind , the staff were amazing very friendly very helpful and always smiling it was one of my friend s bday during our stay and they sent her to the room a bottle of Prosecco and some fruits and chocolate this was very sweet of them Attu the manager of the hotel is a real gentlemen very helpful and he gave us very good tips and advises also the portman Adel is a sweetheart always ready to help smiling very polite the location of the hotel is 10 10 5mn walking from the underground station from Hyde park from the shopping street and from Selfridges the street where the hotel is located is very strategic you can find many bars restaurants cafe i highly recommend this hotel
110170,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The room is very small , My stay at Radisson Blu Portman Hotel in London was excellent The location is great it is 5 minutes walk from Oxford street and Hyde Park The staff are friendly and cooperative The room is clean 
110171,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The taps need to chnage and the fact there are two shower heads in the bathroom make it confusing also it was very difficult to adjust the hot water , Clean room comfy beddings great location but in a quiet street
110172,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The pictures on the booking were totally different from reality and we had to change our room 2 times and saw 5 rooms We asked for a room in the innovated floors but it seems they weren t The bathroom tub weren t clean hair The complimentary coffee we had to ask for it they don t refill it for us All the rooms must have maintenance Before checking in, The location and some of the staff were friendly not all of them
110173,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London,No Negative, I was not happy about the hotel policy on stay they blocked the whole amount prior to my arrival although my reservation was cancellation free The amount was on hold the charged me later the same upon checking out which causes inconvenient to the customer the front desk staff said just because we booked with booking com we have to follow this policy
110174,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The smell of smoking we had it in our room and no body take an action about it There was some body smoked a cigarette daily and we smell it daily and i told the recipient about that and no body take an action, The receptionist Sofia was so helpful and friendly and polite im so happy that she is the one who helped me thank you for having her In your staff

110178,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, It s first time for me to express this kind of issues with Radisson blu company I booked a room for 7 days from my country using booking website with my sister in law credit card I transferred the required amount to her account and she did the reservation for me I thought the Radisson blu portman will get the amount by accept the online payment like what we used to do in Dubai I know it was my mistake but it is my first time in London However I arrived to the hotel and I found someone in the reception and he told me is that the registered credit card in my reservation should be with me in order to complete the payment but as I mentioned earlier I transferd the reservation amount to another person and she took care about everything in my journey and then he told me that my sister in law should call the reservation to verify her identity and complete the online payment or I need to discuss that problem with reservation department and they can accept the payment if I have a copy of that credit card then I contacted with my sister in law to send copy of her credit card to complete the online payment with reservation department also informed her that the reservation may need to contact with her to verify her identity but he also said is that I should pay at least 1 night for the room until the problem is fix with reservation department and he ask for 200 pounds which is more than one night price in the hotel but he said I will get it back when I fix the online payment problem with the reservation department I go to the room to call reservation department I called them and they refused to complete the online payment from booking com which is really first time for us to face that issue with booking because we thought it is similar to our previous reservations However They told us it s the hotel policy and even the copy of the credit card will not be accepted which make us check another hotels that accept the booking , Hotel facilities such as GYM and the location of the hotel
110179,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Refurbishment proper maintenance required i e bathroom door handle broken Bathtub plug broken Bathtub wall tiles have black mold in corners Shower head leaking Better bathroom lighting required Room wallpaper needs repair or replacement Mattress needs replacement Sound attenuation and insulation leaves to be desired not only could I hear the next room guest talking on the telephone I could even understand the voice of the caller , Location Excellent breakfast
110180,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Staff a little too quick to clear the table at breakfast , Excellent choice of breakfast foods all delicious fresh Superb fish cakes for dinner before going to theatre 
110181,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Room was tiny supposed to have a seating area well it had a chair Very expensive for the size of the room, Breakfast excellent Staff friendly and helpful
110182,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, We were first allocated to an old non renovated room which looked completely different than the picture of the room we booked It had old furniture with a very outdated distasteful interior decor and smelly pillows which we had to cover in order to sleep We immediately asked to be moved to a renovated room and the staff were very understanding and helpful in doing so The renovated room looked exactly like the website pictures was very clean fresh and comfortable I do recommend this hotel but as long as they don t put you in a non renovated room , The location was excellent and the staff were very friendly 
110183,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Our room 206 was right next door to the gym We were woken by sound of people dropping big weights inches from our heads which kept up sporadically all morning , Staff in restaurant were lovely and allowed us to top our glasses to large as small was really too small 
110184,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The staff at the restaurant was completely impolite didn t give us a table even though the restaurant was empty We went to the hotel next door and we had a great dinner even though they were quite full but they were polite and offered a table The bathtub was not working properly and they didn t do anything about it The windows were not opening for the money the room costed it was totally not worth it , Nothing 
110185,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Rooms are just too small The one touch dial or room service from the rooms either just doesnt work or always goes unanswered Although it gives you a pay at the hotel option almost thr entire cost of your stay will be pre authorized on your card a week hefore your stay , Great location Business centre 
110186,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, There is no smoking rooms any more and and they don t change the bed sheet every day when i asked them they said we change it every 3 days and this is not good, I like the location of the hotel
110187,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The pictures of rooms shown in the profile is not the same as the rooms in the property The room and the bed is so rickty Lighting is bad Power socket is far away from the bed, Friendly staff and good location

110192,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, On arrival they did not have a twin room available as per our booking and additional note on booking and did not realise that one had been requested We then had to wait a couple of hours for a room to be prepared even though we arrived at the standard check in time We had to ask three times for the sofa bed to be made up for my son in our room first request around 5pm and it finally was made up at 1015pm, Due to a mix up over twin room we received an upgrade to a suite which was much appreciated Doormen were lovely 
110193,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Room felt like below freezing when I came it was freezing outside and the slide door was open a bit It took 4 6 hours for the room to heat up eventually , Staff was great usher was exceptionally cheerful 
110194,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Breakfast was not good as it was a year ago when I stayed Also the restaurant needs more choices it s always empty and food is not good We have had to eat twice with out a choice, Location great parking great beds really cofmtable
110195,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Room service food was not up to standard On arrival in the hotel after 7pm only one hostess was available No baggage unloading nothing We park the car our self into the nearby garage as it seems like a gost house when we pass in front of the hotel And we had to bring the Baggage from the car to the room again by our self Luckily it got better on the departure , Everything is very close from this hotel And concierge was very helpful in the day time Great location if you want to visit the main site of London 
110196,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Noise on the second floor rooms on friday night view from second floor was bad ac compressors , Location is perfect comfort of the bed was outstanding
110197,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The bar staff didn t seem to speak english didn t understand what drink was asked for Had to tell them by pointing Gin Tonic It wasn t busy either and it just didn t look professional The bedroom door had to be banged closed each time we left our room The key card was temperamental and we always found ourselves at reception quite a lot of the time actually I did inform the housekeeper about the door and it was to be looked at The double room was rather small and rather expensive Both guest lifts were out of order so I was asked to take the emergency stairs That was ok until I ran out of stairs The problem arose again this time it was the housekeeping staff I asked for directions but nobody spoke english Eventually I found the service lift which took me to the floor I needed but then I couldn t get into my room My card hadn t been activated in the lift Very frustrated now I persevered with a chambermaid and she let me in Back down the emergency stairs again Perhaps bad luck and bad timing for me , This hotel is in a good location for shops pubs restaurants and landmarks The foyer is spacious and relaxing We booked this hotel because we have in the past had excellent stays in other Radisson Blu Hotels located in Europe and UK Sadly disappointed 
110198,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, No tongs for serving bread pastries at breakfast Only one plug socket worked on double wall socket Strong smell of tobacco in corridors leading to bedrooms , Selection of food for breakfast was very good Hot food was fresh Staff were very attentive 
110199,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, On arrival through the entrance the revolving doors were broken so first impressions weren t great walked into reception which was lovely and we were given our key and room number we made the payment for our stay and then we were left to our own devices which was no problem we weren t told the lift requires the key to go up or down so we struggled going back and forth asking for help we thought the lift wasn t working went back to reception explained the problem and the staff member took us through the staff lift to our required floor she didn t check the problem we were having or question it we were told the maintenance guy was coming to fix the lift and then we had the same problem once we returned back to the hotel when we tried going back to our room we were then told about using the key in the lift as it was our first time at this hotel we expected a better service Explaining this on arrival would of saved us a lot of hassle and first impressions would of been better the lady on reception didn t explain properly as I believe there was a language barrier We got to our room and it was business class and it was nothing special looked like an average room in the Premier Inn the room was absolutely freezing managed to work out where the heating was from the air conditioning controls and then it stopped working had to ring down and make them aware and they sent a maintenance guy upstairs after a while but by this time it had started working by itself Absolutely not happy with the stay at this hotel definitely won t be staying here again expected more considering the room was reserved and the hotel knew what time we would be arriving we paid 204 for the night but definitely feel it was not worth it , It was an average experience
110200,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, It was my 5th time staying here I expected that we had a better room, Staff was very helpful and friendly especially night reception Hailu that recognised us imigatly
110201,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, There was a problem with the door lock and I ve tried so many times to fix it with hotel maintenance and they come to resolve it temporary And the problem repeated again and again , Location good amount of money wide variety of breakfast
110202,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London,No Negative, The room was small but clean and comfortable The staff were very helpful Unfortunately I had a number of problems with the room The television did not work apparently the cleaners had knocked the cables out the phone was broken and needed replacing and the safe would not open All of these issues were resolved but led to a rather stressful evening when I was getting ready to go out I felt all of these issues should have been checked and resolved before the room was declared ready for use The worse problem was the overpowering smell of drains sewage from the bathroom The housekeeper came and used an air freshener which only helped for a few minutes Overall a rather disappointing experience 
110203,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Very dated property could do with moderisation or rebuilding, Rooms small but acceptable although it did look a little worn location for Oxford st and Hyde park great Deal we got offered good vfm 
110204,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Our booking was messed up the hotel thought we were booking out a day earlier than we had reserved for , The staff was extremely helpful and friendly

110214,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Room was horrible Very old and tiny That s a single room for sure and got turned to double No space at all in the closet for both our clothes We had to live for three days from our bags which we didn t find a place for either Not value for money at all I stayed at others less expensive or same price with much better rooms, Location was perfect breakfast was great huge variety of good quality although one day the pineapple was off and when I told them they replaced them 
110215,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London,No Negative, Fantastic hotel Stunning room with great facilities The staff were superb kind polite and helpful Simply put the best stay we have had in London 
110216,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, rooms dated smelt of smoke plug sockets damaged Couldn t get into 2 of rooms as they were not ready people in our group could not get changed for the evening we had a family party near by at 5pm When we came back at 10pm for the room keys was greeted by a rude male on reception Manager took over and we received complimentary drinks , Location
110217,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, no individual yoghurts Plates of food weren t refilled as regularly they should have been Crockery it s Denby style Awful to drink tea out of Would put me off going again for this reason A nice cup of tea any time of the day is a pleasurable part of your stay ,No Positive
110218,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, 1 I booked pay later through booking com but had half the money of my booking taken from my account a week before the stay and was released to me on the day of my stay 2 On arrival they took the full amount plus 50pound per night that we d get back after the stay 3 Order a double room and got two single beds pushed together with different duvets 4 On checkout they then tried to charge us for room service we hadn t ordered and then tried to charge us the hotel amount again and it wasn t until we spoke to a manager that we was told the money we gave on check out was just being held So not really sure why they needed to hold money a week before we came then hold the money for the hotel plus an extra 50 per night seemed a bit odd to me just lucky we had an extra 100 pounds that we didn t need that weekend and the money for them to hold a week before arrival All in all the room and the way the hotel works is rubbish just lucky they have a good location otherwise I m not sure people would stay here , Location

110373,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Where to start really We made a mistake and requested a smoking room which initially they requested 25 pounds more per day When I refused they said they found a room for us When we got inside I was shocked by the size of it The bed was covering everything and if you would try and watch TV from the bed the wall was standing in your way Bed was broken and it was impossible to sleep I have never seen such a bad quality of bed in my life The bathroom was a disaster as water was not very hot in the shower and the pressure of the shower was let s say not enough to take a shower Mini bar in terms of water was emptied during the first day I gave them a call to fill it up which they did but after that day it was never filled again Overall a very old hotel I think in terms of the room that I saw and what annoyed me was that our friends got a completely different room than ours I know that the manager will come and apologize for it but at the end of the day I won t get a compensation for this bad experience so I have stayed to several Radisson s but this is the worst I think in terms of quality , Location Location Hotel is next to everything like Oxford Street Bond Street etc

110432,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Once through check in which took forever Got to our room and it looked like the furniture had been rescued from the 60 S the carpet was thread bare and dirty Maid still in room cleaning then we were disturbed twice again first it was to bring 2 bottles of water and 1x glass Then an hour or so later someone came in to check the mini bar The seating at breakfast was disgusting it was old worn and torn , We liked the location but the room was dated and dirty 
110433,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The room was not quiet as it was over looking large fans on the ground which were very noisy , The staff are extremely courteous We had an excellent service experience The location is quite central 
110434,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, There did appear to be some sort of problem with a fluctuating air conditioning system in the bedroom , Friendliness and professionalism of all members of staff together with the cleanliness of the hotel while not forgetting the buffet full English breakfast 
110435,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Room was cramped and small Bed was very uncomfortable Shower not great Breakfast was not good as not enough cutlery out and it felt like you had to keep bothering the staff for them to fetch more cutlery eggs coffee etc, Staff were friendly and helpful
110436,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Long line at front desk most of time had to go up and down 2 to 4 times a day and wait at that line for the room key card access problem , The location near Oxford St and between Bond and Marble Arch underground around 15 20 min walking to Madam Tissue 
110437,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Upon arrival the room was not ready and we had to wait an extra three hours before we could go to it The lobby bathroom was not clean with paper and what seemed like urine lying on the stall floor While waiting for our room at the bar we attempted ordering a couple drinks but had trouble communicating with the bar staff who did not know what Campari was nor where to find it did not know how to simply mix it with orange juice and went through pineapple and grapefruit before actually realising neither of them were orange juice could not make a Virgin Mary properly and nearly served a Bloody Mary to someone who specifically asked for no alcohol and spoke extraordinarily broken English for employees at a luxury central London hotel Furthermore the staff at the bar were openly using foul language in front of us and other guests and drinking alcohol on shift behind the bar specifically they were taking shooters prepared by a fellow bartender This was absolutely unacceptable behaviour and we were shocked to find that such a thing could even happen at what should be a professional establishment , The beds were comfortable and staff were helpful but VERY much under trained 
110438,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Dirty windows which meant we could not see view no other rooms available to move to Flies around the bar taps never seen that before in UK and no explanation given other than they are just there , Location
110439,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, I chose this hotel based on very positive experiences with Radisson Blu in other cities but found that the customer service at this location was so poor that it really downgraded our attempt to have a little weekend of leisure We had to wait for 4 hours for our room even though we arrived after check in time As an explanation the receptionist told me that the reservation that I printed and handed to her was not what they had in the system We did not have a room until after 8h30 pm and even then the staff were arguing on the telephone in front of us as to whether we could have the room or not We could not access the gym at all and received explanations as such as well maybe later or it s a 3rd party so we really don t know when it will open While we waited for the room we asked if we could go somewhere close by to rest and have cup of coffee and they suggested we go out to Oxford street and go shopping or walk a couple of miles to Covent Gardens Any time we asked for help with things that were supposed to be included in the hotel we received responses that made us feel like we were on Mars The staff appeared untrained and unfamiliar with basic issues like restaurant recommedations A little customer service would go a long way but we had to go a long way away from this location to find any , The rooms were comfortable and clean The doorman actually tried to be helpful There are some excellent restaurants close by if you avoid Oxford Street 
110440,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Poor leisure facilities Quite expensive, Location was great few minutes walk from Edgware Road and Oxford Street Very friendly staff Easy check in and check out
110441,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Poor service we upgraded to a business class room upon checking in as recommended by the receptionist Unfortunately the room looked like something from a mid 90 s primary school Desperately in need of refurbishment with garish styling bountiful Made to wait an additional hour after the offices check in time of 3 30pm After we eventually checked in we were then rudely interrupted by a member of staff coming back to our room to restock the mini bar , The bed was comfy and breakfast was tasty 
110442,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, It is not practical to have MAC in the business center Most people do not know how to use it including myslef Very aukward It would makes more sense to have a normal PC , In general everything was quite good I found that my room was a little bit too small but anyway 
110443,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Car parking the mini bar dry cleaning and other ancillary services are expensive , The location just behind Oxford Street is really convenient for all of central London and West End The room was extremely comfortable very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful 
110444,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Seems old Compared to other radisson stay at Derby and Durham Bed too hard Long wait at bar for service Key cards failed twice and needed renewal Door locked from outside on one occasion 466, Location

110448,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, I booked a double room and was put in a single at first that wasn t much bigger than a shoe box I complained and was moved but shouldn t have been given a single to start with , Friendliness of staff
110449,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Check in was chaotic as we had apparently arrived when most of the staff were at a meeting We were initially given an 11th floor room but declined this when we found the lift did not go to this floor The 10th floor room we were offered next was very small and had almost no storage space We finally were given a 2nd floor room which was better for space though it overlooked an interior flat roof which was covered with cigarette butts and other debris dropped by residents of the floors above Bathroom toiletries provided appeared to be partially used by previous occupants Not what you would expect of a 4 star hotel , Hotel location was very convenient for central London Food from lounge bar menu was above expectations and bar staff were very helpful 
110450,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, Quite expensive breakfast 21 each no difference for kids better go away for 6 each mini bar with dangerous rules of touching drinks means you are charged iron desk has no place for ironing blocked balcony could be more TV channels, Early check in and late check out free wifi electricity for European devices

110452,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The lady who was Incharge of the breakfast area I didn t like her way of communication she was rude in guiding the people Not considering the children and what customers need Nearly she was shouting at me when I choose another table On Tuesday she was not there and I was observing the work it was very smooth and calm , The breakfast was very good a lot of varieties and options 
110453,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, The creepy suns hanging on the side of the windows my other half thought they were creepy And the price of the breakfast , The breakfast selection but not the price of it The free upgrade to business class The cleanliness The outside terrace 
110454,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London,No Negative, When we arrived there was a mix up with the booking and Maite was very kind to make sure that we were comfortable and upgraded us to business class rooms The location of the hotel is super Very close to all the attractions in central London

110458,Radisson Blu Portman Hotel London, I made two requests for a twin room at time of booking two weeks prior however this was not available on the day as hotel was fully booked They did offer to give us a camp bed in the room as an alternative which we accepted Not ideal of course but was ok Also we were on the top floor which involved walking a flight of stairs This was also ok and suspect it was a quieter room as a result A c was not working when we arrived and room was boiling however maintenance staff quickly resolved this , Great location
