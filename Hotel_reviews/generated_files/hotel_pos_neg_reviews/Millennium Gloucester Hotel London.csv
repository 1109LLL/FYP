171770,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Building is very old and not renovated Bathroom was very small and not so clean Housekeepers are not doing good job Some toilettes are missing B F menu should change sometime we are having 7 days same food , Location is excellent Near from underground train station and easy to go any directions Even one train from Airport B F was good selections for UK 
171771,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Staff particularly in bar were beyond rude I work in service industry and rarely complain as I know how hard it can be However equally my down time is important and the service and rudeness of staff was just appalling Complained bit no one cared Stayed here 4 times never again, Room is functional but plugs didn t work 
171772,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The bathroom required maintenance to be completed the shower didn t change fully from the bath setting to the shower head and the toilet didn t flush properly , The hotel is located centrally and only four minutes walk to the metro station there are some eating places located on the strip where the metro is located The staff at the hotel were also very kind and helpful storing our suitcases 
171773,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Nothing, The Staff Comfortable room Room service Great price and location Variety in the breakfast room Tunde one of the coordinators did an excellent job
171774,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The front desk can be more efficient with the check in process We ve been waited for like 40 minutes while there were only less than 4 people in front of us Also we got a problem in communicating with one of the reception lady I used my credit card to guarantee for two rooms and my friend who s to stay in one of the room will arrive later The reception lady promise that she will mark in the booking system for the gurantee so I don t need to come to the front desk again to show my credit card again when my friend arrived However my friend was required persistently by the reception that I with my credit card has to show up when she actually arrived pretty late on that night What s even worse is that reception lady who s promised to me did not even make an apology about her mis communicaiton That s definitely not a good impression on my arrival Other than that the stay is good , The location is great The underground station and bus stop is just around the corner and surrounded by restaurants and Tesco Though it s not in the heart of London but it s really easy to take the underground to everywhere or actually Hyde Park is just within 15 minute walking distance if you don t mind exploring by walking The neighborhood is quite and great We were upgrated to the club level The room is big and nice 
171775,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, In my first room the air conditioning didn t work only the fan was working So I asked the reception for someone to come and see it and possibly fix it I called three times within an hour or two but no one turned up After a long wait I went to the reception and asked whether anyone was coming I was told someone would come later when I m away But when I arrived late in the evening it turned out that no one had visited my room to see what s wrong with the AC So I went to the reception again and I was given another room with apologies and that was OK no complaints here But in the new room the AC wasn t working at all the switch did not even turn on When I went to the reception again it was so overwhelmed with people checking in that there was no chance to get to speak to anyone So I gave up on further fight and since the weather was getting a bit cooler I decided to live without the AC However that s not the end of it in the new room there was also a bathroom vent extremely noisy and impossible to switch off too loud to sleep at night And finally on the next night we found a half dead cockroach lying in the bathtub Photo enclosed All in all a disgrace , Location near to the Gloucester Road station 
171776,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I was charged twice once on my credit card and again in cash on the day I was told my card would be refunded still waiting Wont use Hotel or booking com again,No Positive
171777,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Air conditioning is weak think it is affected by the spotlights which is warming up the room The light system seem to be either having two modes so either all off or on Ended had to only use the bedside light to allow the aircon to cool the room No slippers provided in the room Can get a bit noisy with the busy traffic outside but to be fair i think this is for all properties in the area, Good location next to the tube station and also a Tesco Express Friendly staff who tried their best on a busy wimbeldon week TV had option of using chromecast which is a pleasant surprise and allowed me to use it as a bigger screen of my laptop Bathroom was big and generous
171778,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The public rooms were lovely but the bedroom was tired the air conditioning was extremely noisy The bar staff were not friendly and also tried to tell us that we could only order large glasses of wine and that other sizes were not available this clearly was not the case, Excellent location Reception staff and concierge were very helpful
171779,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, the male staff members were not friendly to a woman alone not really helpful only Reza the driver was delightful a lovely ride to airport I never asked for anything but I did ask to be awakened for a 12 hour tour that I had booked and I requested the wake up call from a woman Emilia at reception I never got the wake up call Very disappointing , loved the location the access to transport all forms nearby to chemists foods etc 
171780,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Unapologetic Staff Misinformed Staff I think if I wouldn t have booked on this website perhaps we would have been treated a little better , Checked in it was fine requested two beds only got one but we were okay with that Later that evening found out that our room had no A C was broken and lights didn t work Staff came up apologized and said they would move us to a room with two beds Odd they didn t bring up anything to help transport our bags from the 6th to the 4th floor it was 11 30pm Gave us keys to our new room went to the room opened the door and THE ROOM WAS OCCUPIED BY A SLEEPING MAN Management never apologized but moved us to another room Key didn t work they gave him the wrong room At this point we were so hot and annoyed The final night the fire alarm went off at 2am for 15 minutes no explanation was given Wont ever go back kinda a bad way to finish our 12 day vacation through Europe 
171781,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The fridge wasn t cold enough to have a cool drink and my room s air conditioning control was broken so the room was stuffy There was stains on top of the duvet cover and a sweet wrapper was left in the bath , The reception and bar area were good 
171782,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We were offered an upgrade for a small sum and decided to take it We were surprised with the slightly shabby appearance of the room and wondered what the previous room would have been like if this was an upgrade there was cigarette burns in the curtains the desk was dusty and the drawer labelled hairdryer was missing it s key ingredient We called housekeeping to get a hairdryer and after 3 phone calls and a visit from maintenance to fix the none existent hairdryer a trip to the consierge and an hour later we finally got a working hairdryer If we were staying there for longer we would have asked to move rooms ,No Positive
171783,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The view from the room was not nice it was the fire escape stairs and other windows but we only slept here 2 nights And a small thing would have preferred to have had more than 2 tea bags each day would have been nice to be able to have perhaps a cup of tea at night and a cup in the morning Lots of coffee but not tea , The staff were excellent so friendly and helpful The reception area is beautiful The location is brilliant literally 2 mins walk from Gloucester Rd tube station 
171784,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, London had 25 degrees and the aircon in my room only made the room cool down to 23 degrees Expect more for the price I paid Long wait at check in and when I finally got to my room the key did not work Also the room floors smell of mold Mold smell that sticks to the clothes , Very close to the subway convenient Breakfast was OK They had pancakes But for the warm food nothing tempting The bacon was disgusting and not bacon at all Learn the difference 
171785,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The room looked run down Bathroom was smelly The washbasin had a crack and no drain cover Furniture was dusty and curtains had holes Badly maintained room , The location of the property is very close to underground Convenience stores bars fast food joints are close by Breakfast at the hotel is decent 
171786,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We struggled to open our window and called reception maintenance twice to come and fix this and no one ever came We managed to open it with great difficulty ourselves in the end I had two bite marks on Saturday morning and fear that the mattresses have not been properly cleaned in a while , The staff were really friendly and helped us with all our luggage we had lots 
171787,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Checked in late as the room wasn t originally ready the first time air conditioning wasn t working The thermostat was physically broken and obviously had been for months At first the duty manager couldn t be bothered to deal with it at all eventually he came up and refused us a replacement room although it was obviously broken After much fuss he eventually arranged for a portable air conditioner which basically didn t work just kept stopping and starting noisily so we turned it off Next morning I noticed the safety test certificate was two months out of date illegally So I checked the kettle the next morning and it was over a year out of date again illegally The manager that night didn t give a damn Next morning at reception I found myself next to someone else with exactly the same issue except he had been given a replacement room although he was complaining it wasn t much better so the duty manager lied about no available rooms Receptionist next morning basically said it happens all the time The place is a dump even if anything had been working or legally certified it would only rate 1 star not the four they claim Avoid this place or get what you deserve from a management who don t care , Absolutely nothing the place is a pretentious dump 
171788,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, did not like the view the executive lounge not good scrambled eggs every day children allowed in the lounge making a noise staff keeping to the back dirty carpet, nice bed
171789,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, There was no room available when I arrived at 8 30pm I had to wait for 45 minutes not good enough The air conditioning unit was very noisy and it didn t work no difference at all to the temparture during a London heat wave I was better to open the window The heated towel rail clearly connected to power supply with a thermostat although not needed by me because of the heat had a sign next to it saying Please note This is not a heated towel rail in other words they couldn t be bothered repairing whatever fault there was in the heated rail ,No Positive
171790,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The rooms were very small We stayed there as we thought we would be able to use the in house bar all night we were having a university reunion but it closed at 2am so we were disappointed We were told we could have drinks on room service in 1 of the rooms but hey were far too small The bar was also very expensive even for London , handy for metro 
171791,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, No ac in room and it was stuffy and very hot Their solution was a mobile ac which was ineffective and very noisy Terrible value for money Used to be much better, Location was convenient
171792,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The breakfast seating is ridiculously crammed barely elbow room with stranger on next table even though the place was quite empty all squashed together insisted on moving after all breakfast was not cheap , Very helpful staff reception and foyer 
171793,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Service very bad and they give us a room like a store and no water including they put a machine coffee but no water when we ask them about the water they said use the normal water from the toilet and they said all room full booked that why they give a cheaper one And the AC it was very bad When I checked in I mentioned for late check out and they said ok but next day they said I have to leave the room around 12 PM and no mention in system when I speaks to the manager she said ok until 2 PM but I received call I should leave at 12 or they will charge me and I said I talked to manager and she accepted she said no mention in system There s no good connection between the staff And I will never never back to this hotel, Nothing just the location

171796,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Staff didn t let us know to use the room card to use the lift another customer helped us and in turn we helped another new customer who hadn t been informed A minor detail for an otherwise fabulous stay , Clean hotel very near tube Staff were very friendly and professional Rooms were larger than expected which was a bonus 
171797,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London,No Negative, The staff is friendly and accommodating The concierge services are really good and professional The location is perfect and very close to a tube station services three main lines 
171798,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, A standard room is not 4 Start Very tired and dated Stains on carpet ill fitting curtains bat shower taps loose in the wall etc , Very pleasant and efficient staff Close to tube 
171799,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Pity the shower drain was positioned so far away from the shower Result half the bathroom floor was underwater Dangerous Lighting in the bedroom was poor Had to kneel at the end of the bed and place a mirror on the edge to gain good reflection from the window for make up application , We were in a disability room as my husband has a wheelchair Good sized room 
171800,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I just think that it is a little bit overpriced but I believe that this was because the hotel was really busy I also prefer to have free water bottles in each room , Location of the hotel is perfect good facilities friendly staff and impressive structure of rooms 
171801,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I requested a wake up call that didn t come my TV didn t work properly I reported it but no one came to fix it that I know of At check out I spoke to the guest rep and she apologized and said she would look into it and email me Upon my return to the States I had an email stating they would upgrade me to a more expensive room on my next visit Well that s all well and good but I m not planning a return visit and if she had asked me she would have known that This was my most costly booking and to be fair given the location I think it was relatively inexpensive but in retrospect I enjoyed my stays in smaller guest houses where the host and hostess really go out of their way to make you feel at home and provide you with whatever you need and in all cases with less means , the location It was within walking distance of Harrods the V and A Museum Hyde Park Kensington Palace The Royal Albert Hall and tube stops to other tourist attractions 
171802,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room very sub standard after several complaints about the sink being clogged was moved to another room but definitely rooms need to be refurbished No electrical sockets to charge cell Ipad Rooms very very disappointing , Location
171803,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, A tad tired looking and dark French fries like McDonalds Why not proper chunky fries Ridiculous size bottles of coke, Good location Good size bed Good price
171804,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We had to move rooms on our second night as the temperature of the first was far too warm and they couldn t adjust it There was no apology for the inconvenience , Location was great
171805,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, That the shower head was fixed very high up I am a 5ft retired lady so no flexibility with the shower Also for ladies who wear glasses there is no makeup mirror fixed in the bathroom , The upgrade for a loyal customer who used the Millenium group 
171806,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Nothing to complain about , Amazed at the luxurious nature of this hotel for the price we paid Spacious rooms good selection of toiletries selection of big fluffy towels iron and board two hairdryers and coffee tea and biscuits in the room There were loads of lifts also The smart entrance with uniformed footmen made me think I d walked in to the wrong hotel or was mistaken about the price Would definitely return as it was very convenient for the Albert Hall and museums and only a few minutes walk from the tube 
171807,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We booked at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel during London s recent heat wave because they indicate on Booking com that all their rooms have air con In our room our air con was not working it blew loudly but no cold air came out The hotel reception area was well air conditioned There was no hairdryer in the room even though there is a drawer clearly marked Hairdryer and no bathrobes provided Given the room prices I would expect these facilities as a minimum, The bed was comfy and the water pressure in the shower was great although the non adjustable shower head is too low so you have to bend at the knees to fit under it when washing your hair Location is great very close to the Gloucester Tube Station 
171808,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, 1 The rooms whilst big weren t very clean 2 Breakfast was appalling 3 The staff behind the desk were clueless 4 Our instructions were charged for however weren t implemented upon , The rooms were bigger as per central London standards The hotel was very centrally located 
171809,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Suppy more tea coffee sugar and milk Supply coffee mugs not just cups If you are coming in via the tube on the district or circle line there is no lift or escalators I would suggest catching the tube to Earls Court which now have operating lifts and grabbing a taxi its a short cheap ride , Multiple lifts responsive service and good location Nice to have a table and chairs Good shower and comfortable bed and spacious room especially for London Good space to be able to spread out in after may days on the road Across the road 24 hour Tesco Express and lots of takeaway and dine in options Good bus service 
171810,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The room was a bit smaller than we expected and the water pressure in the sink and toilet was low but the shower was fine The only other thing that was a bit uncomfortable are the curtains in our room that did not fully close , We really liked the location and the hotel itself was beautiful Staff nice as well 
171811,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, shabby rooms and unclean Had to change rooms twice as first room was dirty and second room tv was not working Needs updating and more staff to carry out cleaning and other duties Not 4 Star, Beds comfortable
171812,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, A little tricky finding the entrance from the street , Very impressive reception area you feel very assured that you re in for a world class hotel experience 
171813,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Having to ask for faults to be rectified on 3 occasions TV hairdryer did not work and there was a leaky tap in bathroom As we were not in the room for great lengths of time it wasn t a major problem more of an inconvenience having to repeatedly explain the problems to different staff members , The location for arrival from airport tube station directly across from entrance Excellent base from which to visit all main sights particularly nearby museums which are in easy walking distance 
171814,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Could find no fault with this hotel , The location is excellent close to Bars Restaurants Museums Hyde Park and the Albert Hall Less than a minutes walk from Gloucester Road Tube Station the whole city is on your doorstep Staff friendly courteous and helpful

171816,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Air conditioning never worked while we were there and it was very hot It was fixed once but nothing changed the fan blew air out but it never got cold even though we had it turned down as cool as we could , Yay they ve got the internet working finally after all these years Seems to us that the staff have upped their game and now I think the place is just running better 
171817,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Was charged for the room at the time of booking As my credit card had expired and replaced with a new one by the time I got there the hotel charged me again for the three night stay on my new credit card They said it is highlighted on the small prints of booking com if the card has expired even if the payment has already been taken they have to charge for the full amount again for security reasons Will now have to wait for a refund which will take a long time as the card has expired Wlll not recommend using booking com and the Milldnium Hotel ,No Positive
171818,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Quite old worn out hotel old dirty carpets in the room impression of sticky furniture and dirty upholstery It is either aircon or just old room smell making it stuffy Smell of dustbins outside by the passage Very poor view outside dirty windows , Close to shops and underground station Comfortable beds 
171819,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, the local buses where a nightmare to be on we prefered to use the underground , the staff where very helpful and knowledgeful in every place we wanted to go and how to get there breakfast was plentiful and set you up for a full day of sight seeing the bedroom we had 571 was beautiful we would stay there again when next in london 
171820,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Having stayed here nearly every time we come to the UK I can honestly say this time was the worst experience ever and the worst hotel ever On holiday I don t get paid to have to put up with hassle and stress as I do when working First day and paying extra for a clubroom we seem to have paid extra for shoddy services and accommodation Falty Towers has nothing on this 1 Nowhere to plug in kettle or computer in the designated area due to all 3 power points having a plastic panel over them 2 TV channel was not loud enough to hear when window was open 3 only 1 bath towel between two of us 4 the AC was on the max setting and not very cold 5 the sink plug was permanently stuck in the basin so water did not drain 6 the hair dryer heat setting was broken 7 the toilet flush could have been better 8 the bathroom painted wooden panel below the sink was chipped 9 we were told we had a great big lovely bed yes but quality of mattress was really bad if one person turned over the whole mattress vibrated 10 11 the whole room smelt of gone off arm pits The bathroom hot water tap had to be turned with a towel as if it had not been used in ages I also asked for an additional tissue box in the room The next morning we lodged all the complaints no real apologies ended up speaking to 2 people We told them to fix everything whilst we were out or when we came back to the hotel later to change our room When we returned reception said that they had done everything my husband was not convinced that they had done everything so asked for reception to come to the room with us Again more hassle had to wait for the guy The only thing they had done was to fix the basin TV tissue box and towel , bed rubbish staff in breakfast first day good 3rd day no stff looked at you so difficult to get their attention for coffee even though they walked past

171842,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Breakfast staff could have explained where things were and what to do We were just given a table and not spoken to Didn t know if it was table service or buffet for a while as couldn t see from where we were sat The breakfast was good once we were sorted though , The room was excellent The beds were very comfortable and the staff attentive 
171843,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The beds were made every day yet the dust on the headboards hadn t been touched for a month at least Dirty windows made the nice view less enjoyable and a part of the corridor wall lacked wallpaper in one corner thus showing its remnants of glue plaster and more Mold on one fire door due to water damage Just little things really , Lovely lobby great breakfast and professional staff Helpful hands on every step and very polite cleaning staff The location is the best close to practically everything or within a short tube commute I loved the breakfast choice and the breakfast area

171852,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, See above , The look of the hotel was excellent but the room itself provided us with some problems One whole wall with no working electricity and a broken smoke alarm on constant red light mode 
171853,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, but not thoroughly clean there was dust under the glass that covered the room table the AC temperature was set to the highest but the room was warm it made it uncomfortable to sleep , the room was nice and the hotel was central to many locations the staff were nice

171856,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The hotel has been a luxury hotel in its heyday it is starting to fade and look a little tired and dated It would benefit from a refurbishment A slight smell of damp in one area on the fourth floor that was experienced everytime we exited from the lift on that floor , The hotel is in a great location close to tube station shops cafes and museums The room was adequate in size had a comfy bed and good air conditioning for the weather we experienced 
171857,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The rooms were very tired and particularly the bathroom Clean throughout but so requiring a face lift Service in the bar for a barmeal was slow and the meal had a missing item which the waitress failed to pick up on this was rectified ,No Positive
171858,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Although the bedrooms were decorated OK the furnishings were in need of refurbishment , The location was very good and handy for parks museums and a variety of eating establishments The rooms were a good size and all communal rooms very elegant 
171859,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Hotel needs to be renovated , We have stayed at this hotel three times over the past few years and it is progressively getting tired It is now in dire need of complete refurbishment The curtains carpets upholstery all need upgrading The bed though was firm and comfortable The hotel is in a very good location next to the underground station and very good restaurants 
171860,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room was dated chair was damaged desk had ring marks from glasses Carpet was tired With the exception of the concierge and check in staff The staff were surly unhelpful and when I said my milk tasted off with my tea they did not offer any replacement or money back , The location is good and parking offered My room was clean and the bathroom had bath and good size 
171861,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Unfriendly staff especially reception Bad food especially room service Broken phone in room Alarms going off in hotel no explanations from staff Breakfast felt like we were herded in like cattle left dirty milk jug on our table from previous guests Power outage in room no power key slot in our room Rooms not made up until late afternoon, Good location Friendly concierge Impressive lobby
171862,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The bar staff Humphreys Bar were not particularly friendly or helpful , The location of the hotel was excellent The concierge was very friendly and helpful
171863,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The kettle lead didn t fit unfortunately so we had to put it on the floor and additional milk would have been great as we like our cuppas The receptionist didn t give a lot of detail re the Club facilities which we needed as we hadn t stayed Club before Other than that fab , Room was spacious and clean and very comfortable Staff were generally very friendly and helpful 
171864,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, we had to wait over an hour to get into our room as it was not ready we had said we would arrive between 7pm and 8pm I thought rooms had to be vacated by 12 noon We were told they were short staffed We felt that by 8 30pm all rooms should have been cleaned , it was very near the tube station
171865,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The shower head was very close to the wall and very low and as it was fixed no way to alter it I am only 5 6 and kept banging my head on it and had to lean back to get head under it Not comfortable or user friendly Must be a nightmare for taller people Seemed ridiculous as just common sense to allow for varied users should sack whoever designed or planned that , Great location Bed was comfy room was a good size not tiny
171866,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Our Superior Room was not superior after all it had a Nasty wet odour and ot was difficult to sleep Skirting board was rotted and room was 3star at best Toilet would only flush once Tiles in shower were dirty and had mould around them Window area fithy Would Not stay here again Also they debited my credit card account twice for upgrade and said they would telease funds once i left Went all through Italy and this was the only hotel that did this , Location was great near restaurants cafes and train station Lobby of hotel was beautiful Humpreys Bar was great Staff friendly and NIk at Conceige was helpful And wonderful
171867,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room looked tired and not particularly inviting Carpet stained and looked dirty Room looked as though it was due for refurbishment , Good location Comfy beds Clean except for carpet
171868,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We had a light meal in the bar on the afternoon of our departure but 2 of the 4 were mediocre , We stayed for one night only The location was perfect very close to the tube station Our only mistake was taking a taxi from Kings Cross too much traffic Tube would have been much quicker not to mention cheaper 
171869,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room not ready in arrival even at 3 30pm Staff very kindly upgraded us though Pillow hard and decor tired Bathroom also in need of refurbishment Breakfast room overcrowded and poor selection of food , Location
171870,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London,No Negative, Had wallet stolen from Zaks deli 2 mins walk from the hotel Rough area around the tube station Hotel manager could have been more supportive empathetic rather than a detached business as usual manner Staff in club 6th floor restaurant lovely 
171871,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Being knocked up at 7 45 on the morning of my departure then again twice more by the cleaning staff was not good I had my room until 1200 so being pestered for them to clean it was rather off putting and quite rude especially so early , Great location Busy hotel 
171872,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room delay till exactly the prescribed was technically correct but not convinced it was necessary Beds a bit hard maybe hotels should be offering some choice these days Bar prices a bit steep even for London as area not that special Safe at the top of wardrobe and out of my wife s reach Breakfast ok but lacked sparkle , good value upgrade offered and taken room very pleasant up on the 6th floor and facing inwards away from any potential noise
171873,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The room was a little noisy being close to the main entrance and a busy road but didn t bother us too much , Breakfast was excellent and the concierge and door staff were superb and couldn t do enough to help 
171874,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, No mini bar no red bush tea available we had to go to Tescos across the road to buy some Biscuits on the tea and coffee tray not topped up breakfast rather disappointing limited selection of cereals pancakes did not taste as I expected We asked for decaf coffee and soya milk in the bar on our first evening none available We were given a 20 discount on the price of our coffee and liquers at checkout to compensate for this Room was functional clean and tidy , Conveniently located to underground station and places we wanted to visit
171875,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Booked double room instead was given triple room with single beds When I asked for the room I d booked Staff gave the impression that I should be thankful to get a room I did get moved on my second day but the disruption and staff attitudes spoiled my short stay Disappointing for the cost, The location was great close to tube and easy to get around London Good choice for breakfast 
171876,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London,No Negative, Comfortable double room bit tight for space money due to having large tv cabinet desk and easy chair but all good Bathroom clean with good shower Booked breakfast taken in a really comfortable restaurant good value Overall a nice hotel with comfortable bar to relax in 
171877,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Millennium Gloucester have not released money they took for security Everything else was fine Can be bit noisy at times from rooms above , Rooms are comfortable and clean Good location My 4th visit to hotel and will stay again if in London 
171878,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Paid for an upgrade room The room had only one of three lights in the bathroom working Two of the lights by the bed did not work Electric plug in plate was hanging off the wall Window opener hanging by two screws Furniture chipped and leather chair had splits on it Shower faucet missing screw on know Not a 4 star experience ,No Positive
171879,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The room was very tired Bathroom dated and a tile missing on wall The tv didn t work either The air con was noisy and ineffective There were no opening windows , Good location for our specific event but not great for shopping 
171880,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London,No Negative, Excellent location adjacent to underground station giving good access to the West End Within easy walking distance to Chelsea and Kensington and a number of quality restaurants We consider it represents good value for the location and facilities 
171881,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, 10 service charge on drinks bought at the bar , Great location with easy access to central London Nice room which was a good size for a London hotel Staff were friendly and made you feel welcome 
171882,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I don t like to be asked to be upgraded just when I arrive and to be placed to the room as far as it could be from the lobby , Some of the staff were very nice 
171883,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We decided not to get breakfast because it was really expensive Also I did pay 30 pounds extra for wifi they stated they did not have free wifi and offered wifi for 10 pounds a day but when we got there they had free wifi , We really enjoyed our stay the room was big with lots of closet space The bed was comfortable and pillows big and fluffy The hotel is in a great neighborhood with the tube station just across the street couldn t be more convenient Bonus the hotel lobby smelled soo lovely 
171884,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London,No Negative, The underground is right next to the hotel and has 3 lines to take you anywhere in London Or you can walk through the parks starting at Kensington Gardens 
171885,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Housekeeping iffy ability to ventilate control room temperature difficult in spite of apparently non working thermostat trouser press non functional cost of local phone calls exorbitant for price of room , Location ideal lovely neighborhood near good public transport Bed comfortable Shower hot 
171886,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The room was not good at all It wasn t clean The bathroom I ve never seen something like this in my whole life Some things shouldn t happen in 4 stars hotel We asked to change room at the beginning they told us there weren t rooms available eventually they gave us a twin room The day after they told us since it was a better room that we would had have pay to stay in that one We didn t want to have other surprises so we accepted The new room was not bad though but we were disappointed , I like the neighborood is very nice There are some good restaurants and the tube station is less then one minute walking from the hotel 
171887,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Internet access was frustratingly slow For hotel of this class it s a little shame I think , Nice and clean room Quiet but excellent location Good choice in the buffet for breakfast and well cooked and finally kind and friendly staff 
171888,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Bathroom not the most modern shower working form taps adequate rather than good , Bed was comfortable and room large and at a good temperature to sleep Staff helpful well situated for what we wanted to do 
171889,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, walk into reception stank of jeyes fluid and reception itself absolutely reeked of an air freshener that smelt like cheap aftershave massively overpowering parking was ridiculously expensive compared to other london hotels I will not stay here again,No Positive
171890,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, If I were to say what I didn t like it would have to be that the fire alarm went off daily during our stay Not the hotel s fault as I believe someone kept smoking in a room Certain aspects such as the sinks and window are outdated making it more challenging to use But very minor for the price , Comfortable clean extremely friendly staff Everything you would want or need in a hotel Centrally located and right outside of the Gloucester Road Tube Station Makes it quite easy to take the Piccadilly Circle or District lines to get around the city Also the museums and Harrods are within a 5 10 minute walk 
171891,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The room The first room I walked into smelt like someone had been smoking in there The carpet had stains all over it and the bathroom was basic nothing like the pictures make it look like The wooden TV cabinet and the like had mug stains all over them and were very unappealing The deal breaker for me was the seamen stain on the corner of one of the bed bases I walked down and asked for a refund and to go elsewhere As this was booked through booking com they could not do this They upgraded me to a satisfactory room which still looked outdated The only nice thing was the bathroom in this one My room was also only made up on one of the 3 days I stayed despite leaving a make me up sign on the outside of the door Wouldn t stay again Ever The rating on booking com swayed me to book this place Next time I ll do more research , The location close to underground 
171892,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Tv kept turning off and kettle was broken in room, Breakfast was lovely Humphies bar was a nice place for a quick drink before we headed out Over all the room was very comfortable decent fitness centre and friendly staff We also got upgraded
171893,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We were told that the hotel had an issue with the shower gel supplier so they did not provide shower gel to its customers Weird and not acceptable, The location
171894,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The staff were rude and unhelpful The room cleaning was terribly mediocre and the interiors were always dusty even after the room was supposedly cleaned I found hair in the bathtub on my check in although we waited for 5 hours for the room to be ready and cleaned We arrived ta 8 30 AM to the hotel and we got the room at 1 30 PM, The location is excellent since it is 1 min walk from Gloucester station 
171895,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I didn t like that there was a shower curtain instead of a glass door Also London bus tour recommended by concierge was not good , I liked the welcoming lobby also the convenient bar and light food restaurant just off it 
171896,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The club room we stayed in was old and in serious need of an upgrade especially the cramped bathroom that didn t have a walk in shower I was told that only the rooms for physically challenged guests had walk in showers By far the poorest club room I ve stayed in any hotel The room service Indian curry was disappointingly small and I couldn t charge it to my room despite them having my credit card There was no reasonable provision of electric sockets to charge our phones and laptops as in modern hotels It took 3 days to get a very short extension socket The Aircon fan was noisy and the TV was strangely hard to turn on The club lounge was small and dingy mainly providing tea and coffee and was unstaffed when we went I was unclear if the staff were interested in the needs of their guests or just unable to help as the hotel was inadequately resourced To cap off the experience when I picked up my luggage from storage in the afternoon I couldn t open my TSA lock and it had to be broken open When paying over 200 per night your stay shouldn t be tolerated but enjoyed When you can finally find a manager they do seem service orientated but not at any staff level below that I would advise more investment training and a change of culture , The restaurant manager Antonio made a good effort to highlight our limited gluten and dairy free options But the restaurant staff seemed under pressure during very busy breakfast times 
171897,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, a little bit of renovation needs doing on the hotel overall would stay again in future, I liked most of our stay the beds were very comfy and breakfast option was great
171898,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The room was situated next to the hotel function room on the Saturday evening the music was going until 11pm not ideal with a five year old daughter ,No Positive
171899,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Breakfasts were truly awful for a hotel with fancy image and cost it was like Butlins Holiday camp no fruit terrible noisy ambience no muesli or anything remotely healthy to eat , Nothing really 
171900,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Noise from wedding at the hotel banging music untill 11pm could be heard in our room over our tv with window closed Unable to relax staff unhelpful when contacted Would not stay here again ,No Positive
171901,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Nothing really needed any improvement it was all fine , Great hotel very reasonably priced good service very pleasant staff and less than 2 minutes from Gloucester Road underground station 
171902,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, 2 out 4 nights there were noises in the corridor loud discussions when passing by altercations including one assault and loud phone calls which made us have a poor night sleep I am unsure what the hotel can do about this but the clientele was not particularly considerate or at least some of them were not This was not expected in a hotel that feels rather like a luxury hotel most clients certainly looked wealthy , The location great area and easy access room was comfortable and the one on the street was sunny Staff were friendly cleaner concierge porters but at reception one member of staff did not understand a simple request English was not her first language and when needed for my parents a French speaker was not available 
171903,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I booked a standard twin room and the hotel does have an offer to upgrade to the Club room either 50 club lounge breakfast or 30 only breakfast I wanted to have a look at the standard room before I can decide if I need the upgrade to Club room and the front desk was telling me they do not have the availability of the standard room and then later she asked the manager on duty 19 4 17 night and the manager said if I go to view the standard room and the offer will be lapsed Of course this is a surprise to me that Millennium Gloucester Road is having this policy and also running out of already booked room Somehow later they show me a standard room now they have the room in the first floor near the road they said this is the last room usually hotel will not let 100 occupancy for emergency purposes where I did not have a good sleep and wake up every hour in the night They have one row of rooms in that area and if you stay in the hotel good luck Bad management not friendly with not objective to make the guest stay feel like home I would recommend Millennium Copthorn Tara instead as the practice in Millennium Gloucester Road is ridiculous , The Asian Restaurant is authentic in food and decorating in traditional Asian style Staff Eva Eric and Paul are friendly and you will feel like you are in Asia and eating the local delicacy Perfect 
171904,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, room needs upgrading dirty neglected furnishings bathroom needs ripping out and decorating shower noisy Breakfast cold and inedable served by people who didn t want to be there, bed comfy and clean reception ok
171905,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Possibly our room might have been cleaned earlier But not really a complaint , Friendliness of staff Proximity to Gloucester Road Underground Station half a minute to walk We had a large quiet room of the second floor 
171906,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The fire alarm went off 3 times during our stay Had to ask for tea milk etc on a few occasions but they quickly brought it to our room when I called , Close to underground cafe s etc and walking distance to great parks museums Safe area 
171907,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We didn t like 2 things 1 The Hotel is located at the West side of London while we liked more the east side so it was a lot of traveling by subway it s not the hotel fault though 2 At first night we got a room for disabled persons though we didn t asked for that the room was not good to us and we had to stay with our luggage enclosed till we replaced the room to a regular room , The Hotel is really great 
171908,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We didn t have breakfast at the hotel because it was too expensive We booked two double bedrooms but one was smaller We paid the same price At reception the staff explained us that one was located on a corner and that s the reason why some rooms are smaller But you have to pay the same price You are depending of a kind of lottery ,No Positive
171909,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room was plain but had everything that was needed Decoration on one wall didn t match the existing could do with renewing was patched Covers on Bath rail was missing , Lovely lobby bar area and lift area Room was clean Excellent friendly staff Breakfast was excellent many choices 
171910,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, bathroom size is too small according club rooms the breakfast just limited and there are smell in the plates which I gave comment regards that, the lounge are nice and the reception very nice as well
171911,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The hotel room was not great The room cleaning staff were not attentive at all At one point we ran out of toilet paper They didn t replace it when they cleaned the room It then took 3 phone calls and 4 hrs to get some delivered The room maintenance was also very poor We have a number of light globes out in the bathroom but after numerous requests they were never replaced The thermostat didn t work when we arrived To overcome this they just gave us a portable aircon but never fixed it and never offered to move us to another room Will never go back , Location was good close to a tube station and a number of restaurants close by
171912,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, if you are getting an extra bed or anything please keep your receipt with you so they don t ask you to pay for more or extra if you don t have a proof Lights are very few in the room and the rooms are a bit dark , Cleanliness Location Staff were very good and friendly Rooms size were good and i guess bigger than any other london s hotels
171913,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I paid prior to arrival through my father s visa card When I arrived they told me I need to get authorizarion from my father meanwhile they will just do a preauthorization on the card I had with me On the next day my father sent the letter they said they released the hold on the card I had Almost a month after still the amount is not released My bank told me that they charged the full amount on both cards For some reason the staff are not very smart to understand it are now claiming I stayed double the number of nights The lovely thing is that room seevice woke me up at 8 00am that day to check out and now they claim I did not check out Worst hotel experience in my life ,No Positive
171914,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Unfortunately an irresponsible guest let his room flood from falling asleep while running a bath This flooded our room around midnight We had to stay in our flooded carpets around one side of our bed until we could move rooms in the morning I did think however it was unprofessional and not good customer service to not have one of the management team see we were all right with our room move This has left a poor view of the Hotel and may influence a future stay which would be unfortunate as we stay at this hotel a lot when in London, The location and the standard of the hotel was overall good 
171915,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I always request feather pillows but never get them without asking twice A bit petty but don t give the option for requests if you can t fulfil them, Great location
171916,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, seating arrangements a little poor we could only find seating in the main lobby area and Humphreys Bar It would be nice to have another comfy seated area to have a coffee perhaps , great location staff were helpful and friendly parking on site close to tube station and within walking distance of venues we wanted to attend
171917,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The A C are too nooosey it doesn t get cool we complained several times but no body responded The TV s was also not working for the whole week in one of the rooms second room it was auto operating couldn t get it off Some of the rooms had bad smell , Average hotel
171918,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Sorry the club faux leather chair in the room was Poor the arms of which were tatty broken rough painted in in black to try to cover how bad it was A bodge As we we re upgraded well we paid Thought there should be a two seater sofa not Just one relaxing chair Some of the dark furniture was old fashioned, The staff were fantastic Location Most delicious Comfy bed
171919,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Nothing to add, We were upgraded as guests of the day which entitled us to a lovely suite which included breakfast in the millennium club lounge felt very spoilt 
171920,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The rooms are very old and tired We paid for an upgrade and still had curtains filled with cigarette burns and furniture that was falling apart No hairdryer front desk said the last guestbprobably took it The corridors has bags of rubbish left in them , The location is great
171921,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Lighting in room poor some spotlights outside bathroom didn t work no main light in bedroom could be better, Breakfast very good bed comfortable
171922,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room and bathroom in particular could have a make over Bath was clean but worn out wall socket only 1 did not function well , Enough choice on breakfast buffet close to tube starion 
171923,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Mattresses not the best but not bad enough to complain limited number of rooms with walk in showers usually on first floor in not very attractive rooms aimed at disabled customers the alternative is not sufficient safety handrails to climb into baths in standard rooms, Overall it was a great stay friendly helpful staff excellent breakfast best coffee I ve had in a hotel kept hot in thermal jug availability of taxis on location great number of elevators so one is never kept waiting will keep coming back for sure
171924,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, What part of Do Not Disturb is hard to understand We put the sign on the door all nights 4 and every morning just before 9 would receive a phone call asking us if we wanted our room cleaned ,No Positive
171925,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The air conditioning was very noisy and the shower had a fixed head , The bed was very comfy Location very good 5 mins from tube station room very clean 
171926,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The room Had to change The first one was dreadful Far away what was present at internet There it shows nice rooms The second room was better but still far away from pictures Problem with toilet Broken washstand , Location It was clean Good breakfast
171927,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Hotel is a little tired but OK I knew it in the 1990s Would stay there again with a good deal , Good deal on a Club Room Staff were efficient and courteous without overdoing it Location is excellent near the Hereford Arms pub 
171928,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We had 2 stays in this Hotel over the 2 weeks we were in London and in the first stay we were roomed on the 4th floor in the furthest corner of the hotel the room was small and it needed to be updated renovated when we were coming back for 5 nights I spoke to the Duty manager about the room we had had before and he found us a better room for our longer stay this was greatly appreciated Between our stays we requested our suitcases be stored for 2 days even though we were coming back to stay 5 nights the hotel charged us a daily fee per luggage piece to store the luggage I have never had that happen in any hotel in all my years of travel The reason given is that the hotel had very limited space for storage , Staff great Duty Manager outstanding
171929,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London,No Negative, This was a surprise birthday booking for my daughter the hotel placed a selection of pastries and fresh fruit and a birthday card in the room very thoughtful and a nice touch
171930,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, 1 Staff were rude a I was switching rooms so I had to check out check in again in a club room not great btw I asked the receptionist to keep my passport in the safe since I was going out in the morning after check out She refused rudly saying sorry you re no longer a guest Of course I still was so she gave me locker However I don t appreciate the fact that they won t alow you to keep your passport documents in safe if you check out and have a late flight that day b Man who works at the Concierge was rude I was inquiring about the theaters and wanted tickets for around 40 or 50 pounds He told me he can t help because these tickets are so cheap and they don t book at these prices He of course gave me the impression that I was insane for asking him to do that Well I went to the theater and it was the average ticket price for very good seats He could have apologized for it in friendly way 2 Breakfast is below average 3 Room service took long time to send us what we requested , Location
171931,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, General lack of attention to practical details and limited facilities could not find the in room dining menu in my bedroom amenities shower gel etc not renewed during the stay only one computer linked to the printer in the business centre , Nothing particular
171932,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Only problem was that I request an early check in for business purpose and at the end I had to wait 15 20 min to have my room after 2pm the normal time for the hotel check in but at the end all sort it, Everything was very good 
171933,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, One of the worst hotels I ve been to ever In fact it is the worst hotel I ve been to I lost the tag of my luggage and the concierge guy started shouting at me and refused to let me see which bag is mine even though I explained to him the shape of my bag and its color When I tried to explain to him that I lost the luggage tag he started mumbling and making fun of me he was the most disrespectful person I have ever seen The cab was waiting outside and I needed to leave to the airport and he still refused to find a solution and was acting as cold as he could be and keep on telling me that it is my fault not his Well we are not discussing who s fault it is I just need the bag Moreover the room was dirty and the bed sheet as well Definitely NOT recommended Going to London next week again and definitely will stay in a different hotel , The closeness of the underground station but this option exists in most of the hotels in London since there is an underground station everywhere 
171934,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Na, Fabulous location and some wonderful local restaurants with wonderful menus and staff Ideal if your going to the theatre Tube station very close by
171935,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Not enough teabags in the rooms although room service brought more and our room could do with decorating but was great for our needs , The location was excellent my daughter age 9 loved the reception area Room was a good size 
171936,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The breakfast was not very warm The bathrooms could do with updating chipped vanity units and peeling labels Also no waste paper bin in bedroom , The location was very good check in staff were very efficient and friendly Rooms were comfortable and well equipped 
171937,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The hairdryer was broken The kettle leaked There was hair in the bathroom Broken lightbulb in lamp, The room was large The bed was comfy Newly fitted bathroom Nice reception area
171938,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Had asked for a quiet room and was put in a room facing inwards However there was a party going on in the function room which our room overlooked The party ended at 11 am which was fine but the staff clearing up until 1pm kept us awake even though I complained to them twice and reception once They were dragging furniture and bins clattering bottles and talking loudly which was all very annoying and stressful I complained again in the morning and wrote to them when I got home I got an apology but that was all , Very convenient for the tube clean and comfortable 
171939,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Staff could look a bit happier at times , Good choice at breakfast although scrambled eggs were to be desired Good location very easy to get to and all round lovely stay 
171940,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The heater in my room was very loud and didn t seem to work at all so the whole night was very cold The next morning I went down to the reception to ask for a new room or someone to go fix it The reception staff told me that he will send someone to check it very soon I waited in my room for over 30 mins and no one came so I had to go down to the reception area again After talking to another staff she immediately allocated me to a new upgraded room I was disappointed at the first staff I talked to about how he just forgot about me and my issue , Very nice location very close to the tube and supermarkets 
171941,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I would have liked a main light in the bedroom It was a little too dark , All staff that we came across were very polite and helpful The bed was super comfy And the hotel in general was well presented clean and tidy 
171942,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The room was tired and needy a refurb It was dusty and the chair in the corner was all ripped The curtains had holes in The window didnt shut and it was freezing all night There was no hair dryer The mini bar was not stocked Only 4 tea bags per room The air con was on cold all the time and refused to switch off The towel rail was not heated , Located just outside Gloucester Road tube station The staff were pleasant and very helpful Fully stocked and fab breakfast Close to the Royal Albert Hall 
171943,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The breakfast and food at the Club lounge wasn t great at all The quality of food was poor Not sure about the cleaning staff as we have misplaced a Kindle Was our fault for leaving it out so in any hotel we suggest to lock up anything that is of value Due to location and the rest of the staff we will still go back , The staff at the reception were so courteous and so were the waitresses in the Club Lounge the concierge too were very helpful Great location it is located right opposite the Gloucester road Tube Station surrounded by loads of restaurants Bombay Brasserie Olives and a very basic Chinese Restaurant called Bugis Street which was convenient 
171944,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Exceptionally slow bar service and rude bar staff A conference was being held with clearly not enough staff to cope We ended up going elsewhere Had less than half a roll of toilet paper and had to request more a basic need in a bathroom The decor in the rooms was tired and shabby peeling wallpaper broken curtains torn armchair covers , Comfortable bed and great breakfast

172127,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Hotel feels worn out like it really could use a major overhaul The receptionist told me that they would charge me 10 GBP extra if I wanted internet access I feel this is unacceptable in our times This is very bad style to say the least , Pretty good location and nice classy lobby only the rooms don t keep what the lobby promises

172243,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The Wi Fi is very slow weak and expensive Most of good hotels have very speedy wi fi and with out charge The carpets are full of stains and the furniture needs to be looked after , House keepings do their job quite well 
172244,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Given the option to upgrade to a club room and told about all features Didn t get access to club lounge which was sold to us as part of our upgrade Also not a total negative because it shows staff are efficient but we went up to get a cooked breakfast and our table was totally cleared as if we had left meant we had to re order our teas etc, They had a room ready for us at 11am and after travelling all night it was a welcome sight Good shower comfortable bed Quick room service Central for everything we wanted to do An excellent variety at breakfast

172252,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The hotel is tied Despite not requiring a deposit they did block one nights accommodation on my credit card at the time of booking for which there is no requirement as the credit card is on file in the case of a no show The female receptionist was the rudest receptionist that I have encountered to give some context I spend 100 nights per year in hotels being abrupt and condescending , The location is excellent and allows great access to major attractions and the underground rail system 
172253,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The Internet in the room was very bad reported that but never fixed had to go to the hotel lobby to connect and sometimes even in the lobby area was not good Maybe this feacture is the only bad thing about the hotel I hope they fix that and take care of this problem , The staff were very helpful and pleasant The room was very nice and clean The hotel location is ideal near underground with a lot of nearby attractions Our stay and overall experience were very good

172259,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Not a 4star hotel at all Was put in a double room which only had 1robe and slippers 1glass 1mug That was after we asked to move room after being put in a room with no aircon on the hottest day of the year They knew it was broken and should never have out us in it It was supposedly a club room but nothing about it seemed special in fact it was just about average , Breakfast was good

172266,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Restaurant no where for lunch Bar ok but a little dreary , Beds were uncomfortable My mattress leant to one side sloping down Breakfast not great hardly any fresh fruit Hotel was far too busy 
172267,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I booked a twin room as I was here with a family member The receptionist looked concerned when I said I didn t want the double that she was offering We ended up in a twin room 2 single beds pushed together usually reserved for disabled guests which meant no bath That I could live with but the room was basic pokey and shabby with broken drawers no kettle or hairdryer We were transferred to another twin room on the second night and the standard was appreciably higher and appropriate to the s we d paid We accepted the offer of free breakfasts but I do think they d overbooked and as I d made my booking a month in advance I found this irritating , Nice selection of breakfast full english croissants meat cheeses fruit breads Lovely room on the second night 
172268,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The original room rate didnt include wifi which is very unusual these days to charge 10 pounds for wifi for 1 night was exorbitant In the end we just went for the 30 pound upgrade to include the breakfast and wifi but we felt that was a bit of a ploy by the hotel to get a better rate than advertised As well as that the wifi was a bit hard to log on to as the instructions given by reception didn t work exactly Why not make it better and provide wifi for free in the original advertised rate ,No Positive
172269,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Hotel is in desperate need of renovation Damp smell in the public areas and bed linen needs to be renewed Single beds are narrow , Location is very good just 2 minutes walk from the underground Area is nice with many options for restaurants

172282,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room maid knocked on door at 8 50am on a saturday Room rate only was very expensive Corridors seemed noisy and doors don t have silencers so banging doors was an issue , Hotel was close to a concert we were attending 
172283,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Less frills and a focus on faculties that are of use to guests, I would expect a least a basic wifi service to be included in the cost This was made worse by the fact 5 for one hour of wifi did not work either so doing any work was impossible Had to visit Starbucks across the road to get a connection Slightly out moded in a modern hotel 
172284,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Truly awful room on 2nd floor dark old and worn furnishings everything had seen better days and looked like it needed a scrub clean So disappointing as had taken a friend to London for a fun night out and this room was an embarrassment not 4 star standard and far too expensive for the state No free WiFi which is ridiculous for a hotel of this supposed level I stayed in 3 hotels in London this week and this was by far the worst Receptionist said they are in the process of a refurbishment but don t charge those prices if the room is so crap Would not go back , Good location

172292,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Sadly my room wasn t like the photos at all and overall more sad looking than the common areas of the hotel First of all if you are over 5 1 5 meters and assuming all the rooms are the same the shower will not work for you I m 6 and the base of the shower head came at my chin I had to do some Cirque du Soleil acrobatics to clean my hair This isn t an adjustable sprayer like most places but a fixed showerhead I had a giant sticky spot of goo on the carpeting that housekeeping had clearly ignored for ages It was so gross and wore shoes the entire time after discovering this when my foot was stuck to the floor The blinds were broken and didn t close all the way so the bright morning light streamed in The room itself had very dim lighting and would have benefited from a central bright ceiling fixture The other guests and staff were incredibly loud in the hallways In addition my room was located adjacent to their conservatory event space when the event was over around 11 12 the staff was INCREDIBLY loud and clanking and banging what I m assuming were chairs and tables for an hour or so On morning a manager and her staff member decided to have an impromptu meeting at 9 am directly outside my door , I loved the location it s situated next door to Gloucester Rd tube station The lobby is beautiful and smells fantastic

172787,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, For such an expensive hotel I was surprised by the bad service in the bar ordered food and we had to wait ages for the waiter to come back to us and by the time he did we just wanted the condiments we had practically finished We only had enough for one cup of coffee in our room and just two biscuits on the first day an none on the second The mini bar was also empty When paying such a lot I think you could expect much more , I loved the location for the places I was visiting it was perfect

172790,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Old building window doesn t close properly You have to pay for Wi Fi and even to store your luggage at the concierge which is really strange , Only convenience is to stay close to the tube station 
172791,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Lamp and hairdryer not working in our room There seemed to be a constant smell of curry wafting down the corridor outside our room which was a bit too much No help offered with our bags luggage upon trying to exit the hotel and we waved our own cab outside when there was two members of staff there , All main areas of hotel were clean and modern Reception staff friendly 
172792,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The fact that I had booked this hotel as a single female traveller for 3 nights due to it being directly across from Gloucester Rd tube station all confirmed to arrive and find that there was no room available meaning I was moved to the Fulham Road hotel This was 3 tube stops further away from the city and as I was not comfortable walking the 5 minutes from the tube to the hotel at night had to spend more money on taxis , The brief 5 minutes I was at the hotel
172793,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Handle on the wardrobe was faulty On opening the room door wardrobe door flung open and made a wound on my hand Difficult to get telephone operator at night , Club room facilities and the breakfast buffet was good Excellent location for underground and bus service and nearby shopping Waitrose Tesco and Boots 
172794,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Wifi was expensive and practically non existent Reception area reeked of some overwhelming perfumed scent Our bathroom sink also reeked of some odor and we had to plug the top drain with something to kill the awful smell , Location was the best part just across from the Gloucester tube station 
172795,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Upon arriving no one assist to carry my huge luggage Room was not ready and did not get what was requested Breakfast was a huge dissapointment, The location was the best Less than 5 min walk to the underground and very close to cafes and convenience store

172797,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Absolutely no bad experiences with this Hotel at all , Good location well within walking distance of a tube station Central location with plenty to see in the area Very friendly and helpful staff with good knowledge of the area 
172798,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I believe that we must have been given the worst room in the hotel It had little natural light with a small window looking onto some sort of central utility area The available lighting in the room was not good enough to read by The carpet had a large thread pulled in the middle of the floor But worst of all and my main complaint the bathroom was dirty and unhygienic with a lump of chewing gum stuck on the floor and large quantities of someone else s hair on the floor in the bath and filling the bath outlet I took photos Clearly there was a general lack of care We would never stay there again We did complain at check out and asked to speak to the manager A young man who was apparently in charge was pleasant and apologetic and did not charge us for the two drinks that we had at the bar the night before However in the circumstances I would have expected that he offer an immediate refund When I raised this the young man advised that he was not authorised to do that but that he would pass on my complaint to his superior I have yet to hear back This is the second bad experience that we have had when booking on line , Nothing in particular 
172799,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The rooms , This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel and have always been very impressed which is why we brought our friends along too However the room we were put in 1st floor had a concrete wall outside the window So we felt let down a little by this but the hotel food and staff were good as always

172803,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The dining room was like a Railway Station overcrowded and busy with a poor selection of uninspiring food and boiled coffee , Unfortunately our first room was both noisy nearby staff facility and small so were changed the following day to a superior room which was a big improvement 
172804,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Service was terrible had to order drinks from room and then bring down to lobby ourselves Disgusted with attitude of some staff Parking was free outside and was encouraged to purchase 37 00 overnight parking ticket which I then stopped soon as I wa told by kind security staff ,No Positive

172816,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I am disabled and the reception staff wanted us to move to another hotel a considerable distance away because they had overbooked hotel I told the frosty faced supervisor that was not happening We then had to take the disabled room which we were told was near a lift This was a lie it was the furthest possible distance from the lift Bad start to our visit The breakfast was disgusting it was like a cattle market We ended up eating out for breakfast Half the staff did not understand a word of English We have stayed in The Knickerbocker in Chicago which is a Millenium Hotel and the experience was like night and day We will never go back to this hotel, Location was the main reason for our stay here

172819,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London,No Negative, Liked hotel but only a little disappointed as hotel so luxurious when we got to rooms expected a little more However rooms were comfortable and clean and good value for money we paid for our stay and certainly would be happy to stay there again 
172820,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The entrance is through a tunnel that smells of sewage the reception desk seemed to be manned by three people when there was no clients there and only one junior slow person whenever a queue started to build up the common areas are clearly in need of refurbishment and even the rooms seem tired and quite grubby in parts , The location is certainly good and the concierge was extemely helpful and supportive the opposite of the reception 
172821,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room dimly lit No free wi fi Odd sockets so not many places to charge phones etc had to phone reception and find an extension lead hidden in a cupboard Some noise from adjacent rooms, Good location close to Royal Albert Hall for Proms

172823,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, when i went to pay they had already taken out a 179 deposit so in total i had to pay the room cost the deposit which i wasnt happy about as nowhere on the website did they mention that, Everything it was a birthday present for my mum and we were off to see a show that night staff were very help and friendly
172824,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Somehow it seems they have forgotten to maintain the property The aircon did not cool but was leaking water in the entrance big wet stain on the carpet It did not get fixed The sink bathtub and tiles in the bathroom had cracks The arm chair had a big crack where you sit , Thelocation next to the tube is great There Is good choice of breakfast

172828,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The carpets could be given a deep clean the casino below can be noisy and the lifts need to be quicker , The building it s size and proximity to the tube station
172829,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I had previously stayed in this hotel in room 444 and enjoyed the room and my stay This time I was assigned the room known as the Chelsea Suite It was really dark and out of date to the point where I wish I was assigned a regular room They should really update this room since I considered it as a downgrade rather than an upgrade Check in staff were a bit cocky and not the friendliest , Location and proximity to tube station is great 
172830,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I stayed in room 444 and the AC was not cooling the room much Not great for when London is having a heat wave , The room was nice and bright and quite sizeable for a hotel room in London 
172831,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Nothing at all, All the members of staff were welcoming friendly and helpful The Art Deco reception area is a wonderful introduction to a clean quiet spacious hotel minutes from the West End 
172832,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The Hotel room service resturant was very bad in time and tase very very bad Internet never worked well inturrupting all the time and weak signal then lost signal and no one to fix or help , The room size and comfort and location 
172833,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Many old rooms my advice is to ask for 4th floor it was the only one with new condition, i asked to change the room beacuse it was in a very old condition but they changed in directly
172834,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, No view from windows Didn t make any difference to me cause gone 9 am back round 10pm sightseeing Still would have been nice though , Very convenient to most attractions

172837,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Shabby old unrenovated rooms There is a minibar but it was empty because the hotel stopped providing the minibar service some time ago First time we have been to a property that claims to be a 4 hotel and has no minibar The bathroom was shabby as well Lots of staff was roaming around without any particular sense of purpose , The location is fantastic right next to the Goucester Road tube
172838,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Service was very poor For exale 3 requests one per day to change out the battery in the room safe so it could work we re ignored completely Room air conditioner would not cool although fan would run but again requests to fix were ignored Have stayed at this hotel off and on for a number of years but won t be back , Location is excellent but will try another hotel in the same area next time 
172839,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, When we checked in our room was not ready and to make matters worse the extra bed i had booked and paid 40 for for my son to sleep in was not available We were given a room eventually and when we got there the bed was not there A phone call from reception told us that we had to move rooms so we could get the extra bed in we did move again reluctantly went out for the day only to return at 6 30 with still no bed After 3 frustrating phone calls the bed arrived at 8pm and by this time my child was asleep in ours I know this could have been a simple mistake in reservations and i dont usually complain but for a four star hotel the problem should have been rectified immediately especially as a family with a small child Is it not the sole purpose of booking a hotel to have a bed to sleep in , Beautiful hotel and great location
172840,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, I had booked to include breakfast before I arrived but they would not honor the rate on arrival The WiFi in the rooms was also exceptionally poor it would drop every 3 5 minutes and you would have to reconnect to an alternate link and repeat this process for the duration a big draw back for a business hotel , The location of this hotel is excellent whether you stay here for business or pleasure with easy access to a tube station on the door step Plenty of options within 1 minutes walk to pop out for a bite to eat or a drink should you wan something a little more relaxed than the hotel restaurant 
172841,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, There was only one UK plug socket in the room all the others were international Having travelled from the North west we didn t take adapter plugs I spoke with reception four times regarding this matter and the situation was never resolved At one point I was asked to purchase an adapter plug from concierge at a cost of 6 which I refused to do given the fact my appliances had UK plugs and the hotel is in the UK This was a huge inconvenience to our trip and resulted in us being unable to charge phones to take photographs , The location of the hotel is fabulous 
172842,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Distrust of hotel patrons They blocked extra money from my credit card without my concent The bathroom ceiling of one of our two rooms was leaking , Receiption area lifts breakfast hall 
172843,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, We checked in at about 9am and l paid upfront even though the concierge said to me that l could pay later But l insisted because we had to go to into the city and l was trying to avoid long queues on our arrival back to the hotel We arrived at 10 30pm and headed to the reception only to be given keys to a double room even though they had taken an extra 180 pounds from me for a family room I had to call the reception giving them an ultimatum of either refunding back my money 180 or changing our rooms After 10 minuttes one of the staff came upstairs to escort us to a family room It was very tiring especially since we had been out all day Also we paid for internet and had no wifi I had to call the reception 5 times and l was asked if l had paid for internet It is absurd that they have problems distinguishing between paid and unpaid guests Eventually the wifi was connected shortly after midnat , Alfonso welcomed myself and my children with warmt We were delighted with the accomodation and friendly welcome we received from the staff 
172844,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Room we checked in to was awful Strong smell of cigarette smoke from nearby room small dark room with old furnishings window that didn t lock and was filthy on the outside Also room contained cupboard full of pipework and electric which was unlocked Fortunately and thanks to Claudia at reception we were quickly moved to another room which was fine and on which the marking in this review is based , convenient location and availability of rooms

172848,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, Free Breakfast does not cover room service a service charge not mentioned in any correspondence they wanted to charge an 22 each Check in and room service staff unfriendly Room was dated and had broken tiles in bathroom nasty shower they messed up a friends twin room so they had a king and a lumpy fold out couch, Location friendly bar and housekeeping staff

172851,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The good thing that the club rooms has thier own club lounge for breakfast buffet and its not crowded But I didn t like the idea in the club lounge that the breakfast dosent have the full portions like the breakfast for the standard rooms I mean we payed more then the standard rooms so we deserve the best services more So my suggestion is to improve and put the full portion of breakfast in the club lounge like the one in the ground floor for the people who has a standard room , I liked every single bit of the hotel especially the good offers of the coupons The stuff were nice and gentle to me the price of the hotel was good not very expensive I hope the prices does not go higher then this level 
172852,Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, The walls were very thin so there was a lot of noise very early in the morning when business people would leave for work not ideal for people travelling for leisure who want a bit of a lie in , The location was great for people wanting to explore London being so conveniently located to Gloucester Road station which has 3 lines running through it and very frequent trains
