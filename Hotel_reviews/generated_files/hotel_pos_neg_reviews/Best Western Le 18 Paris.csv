206538,Best Western Le 18 Paris, A minor point is that the room was smaller than we expected but otherwise perfect , Very pleasant and helpful staff Excellent access to metro Area was nice 
206539,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Rooms were very small and not worth the money you pay staff were rude and upon arrival we were given the wrong room and walked in on two people in bed which after 7 hours of travelling and arriving at midnight was not ideal Save your money and book elsewhere I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,No Positive
206540,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The shower in the ensuite was very tight not much moving space , The bed was very comfortable Yoy could hear any noise from the street Very very clean It was only 2 minutes away from a metro station so it was very easy to get around Paris 
206541,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Unsafe area especially at nights and no restaurant or cafe in the area, Small rooms but clean Great staff especially Jacques helpful and extremely kind
206542,Best Western Le 18 Paris,No Negative, I hope I am not misspelling his name but Mob at the front desk was exceptionally gracious My daughter and I stayed for only one night after returning from Rome and flying out the next morning The room was very nice and very comfortable Mob was very friendly helpful and gave us good directions to the metro to explore this part of the city Our flight was very early the next morning before breakfast and he sent us with coffee and sweet rolls 
206543,Best Western Le 18 Paris,No Negative, A very warm welcome from the staff The twin room was a little on the small side but beautifully presented very comfortable and fabulously clean The hotel is within walking distance of Montmartre There are good parking facilities around the corner from the hotel 
206544,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The shower room was so small not good if you don t like small spaces The hotel is quite far out from Paris major attractions but easily reached by metro , The bed was amazing super comfy had the best night sleep The room was always clean 
206545,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Shower a bit small but good powerful water flow , I haven t loved the hotel it nice comfortable nothing special but the staff were very lovely It has made all the difference 
206546,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Bedroom size wasn t great for the fee Hotel has a 4 star hotel rating but has more of a B B feel which again gives the room a questionable tariff , Hotel was very clean Bed was Incredibly comfy and well made very good shower Staff helpful
206547,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The shower was tiny Like less than 1mx1m small You couldn t move your arms to wash your hair The rooms were tiny and the breakfast was quite bad It is located in a really bad area unsafe area and is way away from the city and not close to the Moulin Rouge like they advertise It s a 20min cab ride away , The beds were okay
206548,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Rooms are small and it s not the best area in paris , lovely little hotel with friendly staff Very easy to access the metro with a beautiful view of montmatre 
206549,Best Western Le 18 Paris,No Negative, The staff was really kind and they gave me a warm welcome The room is very nice clean and equipped of all comforts I really enjoyed bathroom gadgets offered by the hotel
206550,Best Western Le 18 Paris,No Negative, The staff where excellent at helping us travel around the city giving us brilliant tips and advice As for the hotel the facilities where perfect It was extremely clean and you could tell the hotel was rather new as everything was in perfect working order and rather modern I do not have a single complaint about the hotel It made our trip perfect 
206551,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The location was the worst It s the last metro stop can t walk the lane alone after 12 at night very unsafe area why does the hotel even have a bathroom It s a 1 1 ft bath area Being 6 ft tall could hardly stand under the shower, Clean hotel and friendly staff
206552,Best Western Le 18 Paris, All a bit tight and cramped South of the Hotel is great only go north during daylight hours , A great effort made to make the best of a very small hotel Very clean and organised
206553,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Internet very very slow and most of the time not available at all , Clean room Hotel situated close to public transport and exit roads Quiet stay at night Some rooms with view on Sacre Coeur 
206554,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Very small rooms meaning lateral movements most times around things The view was really nice after leaning out the window to see it The elevator wasn t big enough to fit my wife one piece of luggage and my chihuahua into without having to inhale while the door closed , Great breakfast but expensive Coffee always available and most of the reception staff spoke English to a degree
206555,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The hotel the zone was not clean the service is poor the restaurant is very bad the hotel is ridiculously small to being a 4 stars hotel It does not even deserve 2 stars , The lovely and kindly Italian receptionist
206556,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Location wasn t the best you could feel intimidated with the amount of people mostly men hanging around at night at one particular corner go in the other direction and it was totally different the hotel was basic we had to ask for teabags milk etc we had two rooms booked and one room was supposed to be a twin it was a double which they changed very quickly but the fridge wasn t working in the twin room no mention of a room tax until we were checking out added another 30 euro s to our bill , Rooms were very small ok for a few days fridge in room with a list of items you could buy from it but it was never stocked 
206557,Best Western Le 18 Paris, All things nice in this hotel but I had bad time with night time raciptoon when he keep me outside hotel for more 10 min then when I asked them why he call police for me and he said that he will throw my bags in street His manger don t did any thing to correct his mastic, Nice hotel and cute room Only mini bathroom they have
206558,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The Room was too small I was a solo traveller and even I had difficulty in getting in and out of the room The toilet to say the least was terrible I could not even enter the bath Overall I would avoid this hotel as the location is also not great Its an area you would like to avoid for stay in Paris , The Bed was comfortable 
206559,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Very small room and the shower is very small Far from city center Only one elevator and it is very small Overpriced Toilet paper not replaced daily WC was broken Refrigerator was not working The staff in the reception was very cold definitely not a 4 star hotel and i will never stay at this hotel again , Clean rooms
206560,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Room is indeed small bathroom included The neighborhood can look sketchy but you only take a minute to walk to the hotel from the metro we didn t have any problems whatsoever This hotel has of the smallest elevators we ever used only 2 persons fit barely with suitcases As a result it s very busy in the morning The view for which we payed extra means we have to stick our heads out the window to see the Sacr Coeur so not really worth it Pay attention when booking the price doesn t include the tax of 2 plus euros per person per night , Rooms impeccably clean even though they didn t change sheets All the amenities and modern decoration of a four star hotel only small Comfy bed with a great matress and fluffy warm covers Perfect sound proofing from other rooms room 502 Supermarket across the street with fresh baguettes and minibar in the room to keep all edibles we saved a ton of money having breakfast this way the water boiler was very helpful in that regard Modern LCD tv with lots of channels Perfectly functional air conditioning A safe and comfortable haven after 8 mile walks through the city during the day Also you can take a 20 minute only walk to the Sacr Coeur which was a nice stroll on a sunny morning and a great way to feel Montmartre The concierge was very helpful and friendly Most of all great value for money when compared to other similarly priced places 
206561,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The neighbourhood was not very pleasent On check the room was not cleaned properly and towwels were not changed They did it on the next day Extreamly small bathroom inside the room Very low isolation from other rooms , It was close to Metro station Close to supermarkets Comfortable bed 
206562,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Space is at a premium everywhere in Paris and the rooms were quite small due to this May not be the best pick if you need to be close to city centre , Great value clean and pleasant rooms helpful staff Stunning view 
206563,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Most rubbish hotels we stayed in Dirty surroundings Tiny rooms advertised as a double room Lift was a nightmare too Extremely overpriced , Nothing at all
206564,Best Western Le 18 Paris,No Negative, The staff were great really friendly and very fluent in English It s a little bit out of the centre but a 15 minute walk takes you to the Sacre Coeur Plenty of public transport nearby and there s a really cool market down the road 
206565,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The bed was too large for the size of the room the shower base filled up too quickly with water and had flowed onto the bathroom floor , comfortable bed wifi television channels 
206566,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Our room comfort with a view on 5th floor was infuriatingly small and really not suitable for longer stay we stayed for 4 nights Also the shower smelled like mold The restaurants in the neighborhood close relatively early , The hotel is close to a metro station at the end of line 4 and there was a few small grocery stores nearby 
206567,Best Western Le 18 Paris, the lift is super small the bathroom is extremely small especially douch space was just enough to move the air conditioning was suddenly out of order they couldn t fix it so all the night had to sleep with a window open which made it very noisy , quick check in
206568,Best Western Le 18 Paris,No Negative, Clean modernized rooms a bit small but perfect for those who need a clean comfortable room It s a 3 minute walk to the No 4 Metro which will make commutes to Centre City convenient
206569,Best Western Le 18 Paris, First of all the name is misleading this hotel has nothing to do with a Best Western Second I have no clue if the 4 stars they say they have are real It would be incredible The neighborhood is not nice I was there because I needed to be in that neighborhood The rooms are very small the breakfast is ok and the rest of the facilities are just average , The room was tiny but OK I know that small is the norm in Paris but this was tiny there was barely space between the walls and the bed The good part is that it was clean 
206570,Best Western Le 18 Paris, False advertisement of how big the rooms are Room was tiny and one receptionest was very rude The room with a view does not point out that you have stick your head out of the window to actually see the view ,No Positive
206571,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Shower was cramped Bedroom small but clean Wasn t a nice location but very close to the Metro though when there I was surrounded by unsavoury characters trying to sell me what looked like fake Metro tickets , The lady on reception when I arrived was very pleasant and extremely helpful as I didn t know the area 
206572,Best Western Le 18 Paris, Last M4 stop in the 18th Arrondisement This area is reportedly a little sketchy but the hotel is so close to the subway stop that your exposure is low and we did not feel unsafe nor were we accosted on the short journey , Very clean and modern Excellent staff Has A C important b c we went in June Tiny rooms and a doll house sized elevator but very cozy Didn t try the breakfast not included in so cannot comment on that 
206573,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The bathroom was too small to take a shower The location was close to metro station but the area in which hotel is located was very dirty and seemed unsafe , The rooms were clean and had modern decor Staff was very friendly Best coffee which was not even charged to us

206578,Best Western Le 18 Paris, the neighborhood about 2 blocks seem a little shoddy , First of all we had never been to Paris This hotel is a diamond in the rough Our concierge Lisa and the manager could not have been more helpful From showing on a map the exact way to take the subway or tube to all the historic places and to good places to eat I lost my phone and the manager showed us exactly how to use the computer for guests Breakfasts could be ordered in 3 different factions The subway is 2 blocks away so you can get anywhere easily There is a flea market about 4 blocks and it was fun Who goes to Paris for a flea market Just never know what is around the corner 
206579,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The room was too small You could walk in the room with difficulty not enough space for the luggage or the spare pillows , It was sooo clean and close to metro station
206580,Best Western Le 18 Paris, The television sound did not work properly It would at maximum volume still be barely able to be heard but would crackle instead The bathroom was very small in particular the shower Only enough tea and coffee for one person and it was never replaced however we didn t ask , Very very comfortable beds however pillows were a little too big they hurt our necks a bit Good view of the sacre coure
