39308,Arbor City, The neighbourhood could be a bit dirty and sketchy at night , Nice hotel very clean and modern Close to aldegatr east tube station making it easy to get anywhere 
39309,Arbor City, The staff were very rude Tried to charge me another 100 deposit on top of a 50 deposit that were both never mentioned The 100 deposit was because I was suspected of smoking and was told to pay this or and the speech trailed off but upon asking to see where in the paper work I had signed said this I was quickly told I heard wrong and I was not asked for a further 100 deposit In the morning I asked another manager who said is was part of the hotel policy to ask for another 100 deposit if suspected of smoking I then asked to see the policy which he said he cannot show the hotel policy to hotel residents and if I had a problem to take it up with the general manger on Monday I am yet to ring the hotel manager but will very soon I feel like what I looked like was used to judge and was not left to our own devices at all ,No Positive
39310,Arbor City, The location is ideal for getting to the city but the view from both your room and the main areas is appalling from the restaurant you faced a graffiti wall The Saturday evening whilst having our meal at the restaurant there was this continuous boom boom It transpired that there was a function on below us and they were sound testing this constant boom boom vibrated throughout the restaurant and we could still hear it on the forth floor It continued until at least 2 30am Whilst the food in the restaurant was tasteful again it was not what l would call special It had little choice for vegetarians The family room booked for 4 people upon arrival only had cups glasses and other extras for 2 whilst this may have been an oversight it clearly demonstrated that staff had not read the booking for 4 adults The impression on photos of the room looked like two large double beds with plenty of room This was not the case and it was a tight squeeze for all The general value for money was a huge disappointment and l would not recommend this hotel for families or more than 2 adults per room , The staff in general were very friendly and helpful 
39311,Arbor City, Outside the hotel looked run down The street had a lot of graffiti and old unkempt buildings The neighboring area was good especially Spitalfields Market The Efes Restaurant at the corner was also excellent , Ease of getting around Staff were helpful with tips Bed was very comfy 
39312,Arbor City, There was nothing that I did not like at the hotel , Good location with nearby eating places Hotel is near tube and boat stops for transportation Staff was very friendly 
39313,Arbor City, The water supply to the entire Hotel went out early Saturday morning so I could take a shower It was no fault of the hotel These things happen sometimes , The location was a quick walk from Aldgate East tube station Quite friendly and clean hotel Nice restaurant in the hotel 
39314,Arbor City, Reasonable hotel but the hotel failed to mention prior that they were going to need a further 50 pound pre authorisation on my card for my stay What s even more annoying is that it takes a week to cancel it Wont be returning ,No Positive
39315,Arbor City, We arrived late after a delayed journey and the kitchen had closed a few minutes early so we couldn t even get a sandwich, Great cocktails in the bar very helpful staff
39316,Arbor City, There was a winter weight duvet on the bed which was a bit warm for the summer so I had to take it out of the cover and just use the cover , The room was a good size and clean the bed was comfortable it was quiet with the windows shut the air conditioner worked well The coffee was excellent we had lunch in the restaurant which was very nice 
39317,Arbor City, The view from the window is only the car park and the light is on all night So be sure to shut your curtains and eyes , We have stayed here 2 times before we pick this hotel for the location and the room is what it says on the can Very good Turkish restaurant next door 
39318,Arbor City, The coffee machine kettle didn t work so didn t have drink in morning but they did give us free breakfast The receptionist didn t really care when we told him about the above but luckily the manager over heard, The room was lovely clean
39319,Arbor City, Room was very hot air con on button didn t work later found a separate isolation switch above bathroom door which was on the off position Would recommend this be left in the on position ,No Positive
39320,Arbor City, During the hottest week in London since 1976 the AC was broken in a few rooms I ve checked in around 21h and no one at reception even mentioned the problem The room was an oven super hot and muggy given all the glass windows facing direct sun I ve tried to turn on the AC for a while and feeling really stupid about my inability I called reception Again no mention of a problem Only when a member of staff came to my room she finally said the AC has been down for some time and there was nothing she could do I showed her how extremely hot the room was for which her response was don t worry I ll speak to the manager in the morning to see what we can do Clearly there was no way I could way till morning as it was impossible to sleep and I just left , Couldn t really stay long enough to tell 
39321,Arbor City, The area is a bit dodgy but the hotel makes up for it , Great location for anyone doing business near Lloyds of London or the City Very convenient also to Paddington as Aldgate East is only a 5 minute walk away 
39322,Arbor City, I was disappinted with the cost of parking This was misleading as i was told no reservation was needed then to get there to find it costs 48 for 2 days parking I also booked a room for 3 people to be guven one double bed which i then had to pay 20 extra per night to have a room with a second bed in it ,No Positive
39323,Arbor City, 1 They charged me 50pound deposit which shows their lack of trust and respect for their clients 2 I arrived at 11 00am and they did not provide the room until 2 00pm,No Positive
39324,Arbor City, The bedding had holes in it and as I was there for business the desk too high and chair too low not comfortable to work from It was expensive for what it was , Comfortable bed staff were friendly
39325,Arbor City, Relatively cheap level of finishing lights were flickering there was in the morning cracking noise probably from expanding pipes mattress not top quality dangerously hot water in the very nice an large shower , New modern looking and attractive reception room and bathroom efficient check in and checkout I had a very spacious room but most rooms are smaller 
39326,Arbor City, Personel were extremely rude once they found out Inwas paying with an American Express card since they were having issues with their system and basicaly told me to go and get thw whole total in cash or they wouldnt allow me to stay evethough the reservation was assured through a visa card They made my while first day a chaotic stressfull experience instead of tresting me like the guest I was who had already payed for a first night Other personel were very sorry about it but it was tol late and the damage was already done I had had to make other arrangements just to find out the next day as I was checking out that they had already charged my visa card for the rest of the days which they had said they couldnt do the day before I had already paid for another last minute reservation s first night Very annoying and unbelievable Too bad cause the hotel is very beautiful ,No Positive
39327,Arbor City, I have made a change to my reservation of which the reception staff was not aware of when I checked in I was then enquired more than once about the situation which was annoying to say the least Rooms can get very hot and the air conditioning was the right above the bed so it is advisable to leave the air conditioning on when one s not in the room Breakfast was good with very good quality of all the products I had but I would expect a lot more variety of products little choice of bread no bacon no scrambled eggs no beans Didn t feel like I was in England while having breakfast I didn t get the desired value for the money I paid honestly , Nice room in a very modern and visually pleasing hotel which seemed clean and in which the bed was very comfortable Only the bathroom was really small but apart from that also that was perfectly fine Very animated areas nearby with lots of bars and restaurants but within the hotel I didn t hear any of it Bus and Underground nearby 
39328,Arbor City, we wasn t made aware of the fifty pound refundable key charge before booking it was fine but would have been nice to have warning as we was on a budget , it was very clean and tidy the staff were friendly and welcoming was a very pleasant hotel i would certainly stay again 
39329,Arbor City, The only negative with the room was there was no mirror outside of the bathroom A hairdryer is provided but it is secured in a drawer in the main bedroom so you have no alternative but to try and do your hair without a mirror There were 2 TVs in the room but only 1 was working not an issue for us as 1 TV is sufficient anyway so we didn t even make the hotel aware of this , The room executive family was very spacious modern and clean with plenty of space for the 4 of us Large bathroom with new towels provided daily On site restaurant which we wanted to try but we didn t arrive at the hotel until 10pm and we were advised it was too late to order as the kitchen closed as 10 15 There is a Turkish restaurant just next to the hotel which provided a lovely alternative as it was still very busy at that time of night The hotel is just a minute away from Aldgate East tube station which makes it convenient to get to other places via the tube 
39330,Arbor City, I did not want to pay 28 for a day of parking in their car park so after some fruitless searching of parking spaces in surrounding streets I ended up down in Minories car park and paid 4 for two days , Right in Brick Lane newly renovated luxury room with nice bathroom with lovely toiletries comfortable bed quiet efficient reception that actually took note of my request for the top floor a very good value I managed to get a superior room for 99 on Sunday before bank holiday 
39331,Arbor City, Did not get a good nights rest No water in the room Aircon was broken On top of that we were accused of having the tv too loud when it was not on in the first place We were woken up to a very loud phone call in the morning by reception accusing us of having our television too loud That phone call left my heart racing and unstable as I was just woken up from sleep to hear that rubbish Not very good for me who already has high blood pressure Later on after complaining to the manager it was found out that the complaint was clearly against the wrong room Absolutely the worst hotel experience I have had in my entire life I do not recommend this hotel at all for 179 a night , Breakfast was amazing
39332,Arbor City, Breakfast was continental not full English Quality was good but maybe a tad monotonous for a longer stay , The air conditioner broke down on the first night and the temperature in the room was very high The hotel was unable to move us as the hotel was fully booked but they brought us a fan as well as an electric cooling device which brought some relief The next day we were given another bigger room with good air conditioning Hotel staff were willing to help us move our stuff and we received an apology and complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience Wow The room has everything it needs from a Nespresso machine a fridge empty though to a safe The bed was comfy and the shower was very spacious 
39333,Arbor City, Some noise during the night water pipe and so on Bad smell in the corridor at second floor , Good Accomodation below 200 Euro per night close to the city and 10 minutes walking from Tower of London Room clean Good WIFI Connection Good position close to restaurants and Tube Aldgate East 100 meters 
39334,Arbor City, There was some confusion over payment where the costs were taken twice by accident but it was rectified quickly The staff were very helpful The room price was high for the location you would expect a price like this in mayfair , It was perfect for the location Good hotel 
39335,Arbor City, Green sensor light during the night, Great Location walking distance from liverpool Street Comfy and clean rooms and City great view from my room Great value for money definitely stay there again 
39336,Arbor City, Very bright green sensor light lit up the room at night and made it difficult to sleep , Very comfortable stay Marco s Pierre White restaurant is great staff were really nice throughout and room exceeded expectations Location is a minute from Aldgate East and only a 20 minute walk from Tower of London 
39337,Arbor City, No mini bar or water in the room Room not sound proof and loud noise from main road And noisy lift, Room size and amenities sofa desk Nice food Friendly staff 
39338,Arbor City, The lounge was very comfortable the staff extremely friendly and helpful The air conditioning was not working and no questions asked they moved us to a super room on the 3rd floor brilliant and so very clean,No Positive
39339,Arbor City, The breakfast wasn t the best as we didn t know there was a full English breakfast until we were about to leave the restaurant More leaflets on tables maybe to let people know about the hot food served, The room was very clean and staff was really helpful
39340,Arbor City, The negative would be the street it s on doesn t match the hotel I would consider it rough and run down Staff are ok my experience had miscommunication about late checkout but in general friendly , Very good quality hotel with very comfortable rooms Should have taken photos I will next time Location is great because it s 30secs to Aldgate East tube Great value for money definitely stay there again perfect for exploiting secret clubs 
39341,Arbor City, Nothing really , Absolutely love everything about and around the hotel Great value for the money especially considering hotel prices in London Big room too Comfy bed 
39342,Arbor City, The place the hotel was situated was a little rough great if Asian but it was as if you were in Bangladesh or india Didn t feel like London , The room was surprisingly spacious for London Well equipped with great coffee Clean and modern 
39343,Arbor City,No Negative, The bed was amazing the staff was incredibly helpful and even though we checked out an hour late there were not problems or extra charges very understanding I looked at a lot of hotels in the area chose Arbor and am very happy because I don t think our stay could have gone better elsewhere 
39344,Arbor City, They did not have the room that I had booked However this was rectified to my satisfaction , Location Staff were friendly and helpful Comfortable room Interesting area 
39345,Arbor City, Didnt like that we asked for a 50 deposit on arrival and still have not received it back You need to put this on your hotel information Even though we liked the hotel we will not be returning because of the deposit situation,No Positive
39346,Arbor City, Window quality in bedroom was at best terrible Windows didn t even fit in frame and the noise from outside was constant Really let down a otherwise lovely break, Very friendly staff clean comfortable rooms
39347,Arbor City, There s absolutely nothing I can fault at arbor city They gave 100 , The staff at arbor city were so friendly and polite breakfast was tasty and rooms were so comfy 
39348,Arbor City, Room was too hot and air conditioning didn t seem to work Some messages that I sent from booking com didn t seem to get through I had messaged to add breakfast to the 2 day stay but this seemed not to get through , The hotel was in a good location for the offices I had to visit It was also close to many places to eat 
39349,Arbor City, the hotel was not worth over 120 a night there was no parking because of this we was given a parking ticket as we tried to park as close as possible to the hotel due to my partner being disabled, the decor was nice
39350,Arbor City,No Negative, Second visit we liked it so much the first time Great location and comfy room rooms at the back are very quiet whilst those at the front have a city view Very friendly and helpful staff Very close to Aldgate East tube station

39354,Arbor City, There was no running water in the room in the evening for ca 1 5 hour Was fixed around 11 PM and for another 1 hour there was sound from the pipes The location is not the most beautiful one but still close to the tube and still in the center , Convenient hotel for one night stay in the center Clean 
39355,Arbor City, Very very noisy from the road we stayed in room 510 There is the most irritating green safety light in the bedroom it kept us awake all night It was very bright and lit up most of the room Not good when you want to sleep There was no way of switching it off , Lovely furnishings and good sized room 
39356,Arbor City, Attitude of front desk Couldn t be moved to be friendly smile it say please or thank you Price quality not right , Modern concept hotel functional
39357,Arbor City, The room was not remotely soundproof With windows closed could still hear all conversations laughter etc on the street Also one can hear all of the doors dropping closed each morning Temp control in the room seemed to go off sporadically and return to warm and a bit stuffy We did not feel 100 confident in the area but would stay again if could have a room not facing the street as long as not alone while traveling to and from at night , The staff was fantastic especially the concierge named Robert The room was very roomy and nicely decorated Tube stop is literally around the corner very convenient Nice tea and coffee service available in the room and loved fresh fruit available in the lobby 
39358,Arbor City, Policy where they charge the full amount up front Room could be a bit larger but not bad , Quiet Room in corner was great Nice comfortable bed Fridge and good WiFi Good Maid service and friendly staff Very Clean 
39359,Arbor City, Having paid online for breakfast full breakfast price by any other hotel costs I was amazed when it was pointed out that I was only entitled to a continental breakfast , Comfortable room
39360,Arbor City, Nothing it was fit for purpose and no nasty surprises Pleasantly surprised actually , It did what it said on the tin Clean tidy friendly and helpful staff Good location for markets restaurants and travel to the o2 All in all it was a good choice 
39361,Arbor City, Air con in room faulty room very hot and no water in room fridge even though we were pre charged for any extras , Clean excellent location for what we required and surprisingly quiet for London 
39362,Arbor City, Car park attendant tried to charge us an extra day Keep your receipt as I imagine he tried this with everyone I didn t have my receipt so I complained to the main reception who told him off , Hotel was fine staff very friendly
39363,Arbor City, Breakfast far too expensive especially the continental option two pastries and some coffee for 15 , Excellent hotel at a good price in a perfect location in the centre of London Lovely inside 
39364,Arbor City,No Negative, Great location just round the corner from Aldgate East tube station Spacious quiet bedroom with views over the city and a good bathroom Lots of cafe s and restaurants nearby and Whitechapel Gallery Friendly helpful and efficient staff Will stay again 
39365,Arbor City, there was no hot water in the morning to take a shower one of your staff asked me to wait 30mins for an engineer then I found out an engineer could not be there till mid morning so I wasted 30mins waiting and had to have a cold shower not good ,No Positive
39366,Arbor City, Nice large shower but bathroom was a little small although it was new modern clean and being small certainly wasn t a problem , Staff location very near good connecting tube cleanliness lovely stay 
39367,Arbor City, Nothing , The hotel is just beautiful lovely reception There was a beautiful smell throughout the hotel The check in staff were very friendly The bedroom was very spacious with a fantastic view of the city Bathroom very clean and modern Beautiful spotlessly clean rooms Really enjoyed our stay 
39368,Arbor City, Restaurant is rather plain after one try you will want to look for another place to eat in the vicinity , Quiet comfortable clean Modern bathroom contactless key cards comfortable desk everything you need for a productive business trip Good bus and underground connection close to London City Excel and O2 
39369,Arbor City, The view but then you can t do anything about it The weather was rainy sunny foggy and chilly all at the same time but then again you can t do anything about it also But the lifts have to be serviced as it sure gives a scare opening and closing , The rooms were clean The bathroom was clean The staff were friendly cheerful and helpful The bartender was knowledgeable with regards to the London drinks of which we were not aware of Location near to both Aldgate East and Liverpool Street Station and bus stations in close proximity were extremely helpful for us to get by There were ATM machines in close proximity The Hotel was located on Brick Lane and we were able to visit the Sunday upmarket and take in the local culture Overall it was an excellent but too short of an experience 
39370,Arbor City, Breakfast and food in the hotel were too expensive so didn t try either, The room facilities were excellent great to have a proper iron board in the room Shower was excellent 
39371,Arbor City, We didn t have breakfast as it was a bit pricey so a cheaper option would be good Especially as there are so many amazing places in the locality especially bagel shops , All of the staff are very friendly polite and eager to make your stay a perfect one Room was a good size for 3 adults and was very clean Wonderful shower No noise from outside and we were on the side of the building Cocktails were amazing and water and fruit in the lobby was a nice touch I m good bus and tube routes and lots of good food place and bars nearby 
39372,Arbor City,No Negative, A really modern hotel close to the city which is excellent value for money The staff were very attentive rooms excellent and nice little touches like complimentary fruit espresso machine etc 
39373,Arbor City,No Negative, Excellent location near Spitalfield Market TowerBridge riverside path to the Milleniumbridge Tate Modern and Saint Pauls Cathedral Very friendly and helpful staff 
39374,Arbor City, There were a couple of issues with lighting which were pointed out to reception but not resolved There was no hot water above floor 1 on Sunday morning and therefore no shower unless I was prepared to move rooms I declined the offer but suggested a free breakfast instead which they happily provided A full English was specially prepared which was delicious ,No Positive
39375,Arbor City, I had the room number 115 This is an executive room There are lots of generators in front of the window So it will be difficult to get a good sleep because of the noise Also you will not find a heater The room includes only an air conditioner The machine is very noisy It doesnt matter if you select the smooth or high program The air will be blown right in your face while you are lying on the bed Also very distracting is a green light above the door inside the room which can not be switched off , The staff was friendly Room was large and clean Also the Bathroom 
39376,Arbor City, We were on the top floor and there was a problem with the hot water on Sunday morning we were provided with another room to get showered in , It was clean well layed out and very quiet in our room The breakfast was really really tasty and I have to say I m picky Really good quality ingredients The staff and the duty manager Roberto were very helpful sorting out the hot water 
39377,Arbor City, The first room we were put in was on the first floor on the street side I didn t get a wink of sleep because it was so noisy outside Also the Air Conditioning wasn t working in this room so it was very uncomfortable We asked for a double room but got two single beds I asked for this to be dressed as a double bed for my wife and I and was assured by reception that room service would do so the following day When we returned to the room after a day at a business outing like a zombie from lack of sleep we found the bed was still dressed as two single beds When I called down to mention these issues we were moved to the 6th floor not on street side so hopefully a better sleep No such luck The Air Conditioning was still not working in this room and it was smaller than the first room At least we had a double bed The walls were paper thin so we heard the people in the room next door when they stumbled in at 3am The morning we were due to check out there was no hot water in the bathroom When we rang reception to mention the issue and that we had to shower before leaving the staff member seemed to laugh about it and say we can bring our stuff down to the First floor and shower there Just not a great experience overall and not even worth half the money that I paid for this One of the worst hotel experiences that we have had , The location is convenient very close to Algate East tube station and there are a number of cafe s close by for a nice breakfast 
39378,Arbor City,No Negative, Very nice and helpfull staff most the young men from Morocco in the Lobby Great location right by Aldgate east Underground Many small restaurants in the street where the hotel is 
39379,Arbor City, The coffee machine didn t work properly and there was no hot water to shower This was awful to be honest and the staff SHOULD of mention when we booked that the hot water ran out on the top floor when busy Bad bad start to a day But they did refund half of the room cost to compensate but I would still of prefered a shower Capiche , Location was excellent and in a cool part of the city Loads of food to chose from an excellent room view over Canary Warm and very friendly staff
39380,Arbor City, When you arrive and you pay for your room then they want a deposit of 50 This is unfair because it is not written anywhere when you book your room Air conditioning doesn t work properly stinky air comes out when you turn it on , Location 
39381,Arbor City, I had a large lagguage with me and person serving me at reception didn t offer any help with it Moreover even after I asked wether anyone could help me with it I was only offered to use an elevator to get it upstairs , Comfortable bed clean room close to subway station
39382,Arbor City, The bar closed too early 11 00pm for a hotel , Excellent location and a great price for London If you like Asian food the proximity to Brick lane means that the restaurant choice is enormous and also good value due to the level of competition
39383,Arbor City, Although my evening meal was absolutely delicious and the service was excellence a little more choice on the menu would be welcome , Friendly welcoming staff Comfortable modern rooms fabulous power shower Great continental breakfast Fruit and iced water for guests at reception was a nice touch All in all great value for money 
39384,Arbor City, Honestly we couldnt fault the place , Newly decorated rooms are beautiful and crisp clean bedclothes fluffy pillows and luxury toiletries provided along with tea coffee making machine and a small fridge Saff were Excellent and welcoming Big advantage is how peaceful the rooms are decent nights sleep 
39385,Arbor City, Unfortunately my room was at first floor just over the street and there has been some noise that has disturbed my sleep , Rooms are really large and comfortable There is coffee machine in each room and you can have an espresso whenever you want I m italian Staff is careful and kindly Close to Aldgate East tube station
39386,Arbor City, Surrounding area is industrial showercap was too small also no cottonbuds and I had forgotten mine Noise can be easily heard from nearby and above rooms , Staff was very friendly bed was excellent very modern and comfortable room Very close to tube station 
39387,Arbor City, When I first checked in they attempted to charge me more than the reservation was confirmed for and when I arrived in the room it had a rather bad odor both issues resolved themselves but are worth noting There was a tube strike while I was there and the staff wasn t very knowledgeable about what was happening They tried to convince me to take a taxi to the airport but I found out on my own the tube would be running at that time making the taxi unnecessary and a much longer and more expensive means of transport , The location was great close to Galleries tourist sights great food night life and public transit The hotel itself was clean very modern and really was perfect for my stay 
39388,Arbor City,No Negative, Very comfortable room Great location next to Whitechapel Road with both The City and all of East London close by Very helpful and professional staff 
39389,Arbor City, The options around breakfast could have been better advertices had I known I could have had a cooked breakfast instead of the continental which was what the prebooked breakfast turned out to be I might have ordered cooked instead Having said that there was nothing wrong with the continental breakfast , Staff were friendly and helpful The room was quiet and the bed comfortable 
39390,Arbor City, Inter, Super Nice hotel Located in a cool area The staff was so friendly and helpful Our room was so nice With nespresso machine and tea lovely bath and bed and best of all city view Top I travelled with my 15 year old daughter and she felt so lucky So very recordmentable
39391,Arbor City, The receptionist didn t ask if I had a floor or view preference but that was minor, The decor of the room was excellent Morden and extremely welcoming The shower was excellent 
39392,Arbor City, Pillows are a bit too hard Would prefer option to select softer pillows even if not feather , Staff are amazing Great size rooms with lovely bathrooms and beautifully clean 
39393,Arbor City, Restaurant and bar area appeared a little soul less The immediate area leaves a little to be desired but good restaurants and Smithfield market a short walk away , Great hotel very clean helpful staff good value for money Close to tube 
39394,Arbor City, Breakfast included in the price didnt include hot buffett also although i put in a special request for 2 hours later checkout via booking com which the hotel agreed to whilst I was there this was not accepted had i seen the email from booking com confirming request was accepted i would have insisted this was not good customer service, Single room was small but comfortable single bed
39395,Arbor City,No Negative, Well appointed room with proper drawers for clothes hair dryer next to mirror magnifying bathroom mirror nespresso and tea making facility fridge etc Attractive lounge area and free fruit water etc All very well thought out for guest comfort 
39396,Arbor City,No Negative, Lovely friendly staff excellent location next to the tube stop and down the road from brick lane also delicious restaurant on the corner Efe s worth trying if you are staying here The bed was huge and the showers were excellent
39397,Arbor City, Whitechapel isn t the best part of London even though up and coming Streets were dirty in the morning , Convenient location lots of good restaurants nearby We ll situated for the tube as well Hot was very clean staff from and helpful and continental breakfast reasonable value 
39398,Arbor City, Nothing , Really liked the area quieter but easy access to Central Easy tube access close by Very clean and comfortable hotel and staff very friendly and welcoming Very good sized comfortable rooms Loved it 
39399,Arbor City, The view from my room was not the best , Excellent hotel in a nice location near the Aldgate East metro station a good connection to the attractions Comfortable clean room and kind and attentive staff Good continental breakfast 
39400,Arbor City,No Negative, love this hotel everything about it particularly the Cocktails be good to get a hot breakfast in the price though rather than just continental however it was very good
39401,Arbor City, The lighting in the rooms is so dim you can barely find things I know it s all about saving energy but they went to far it s depressing to be in the room unless it s day time and the curtains are open Also the bathroom has absolutely no counter space difficult to do makeup and hair out of a sink , Great location good access to public transportation Clean and comfortable Friendly and helpful staff Very good breakfast for the price 
39402,Arbor City, At check in there was an issue as we received a room without any view although it was advertised as so However after a complain the room was changed and it was just perfect , Big room great restaurant excellent panoramic view 
39403,Arbor City, The sink in our bathroom had an expected crack on the side which was the only imperfection in the room Apart from that there was nothing we didn t like , This hotel is lovely The comfort and style is quite unexpected The size of the room was perfect for 3 of us Staff could not be more helpful Check in was quick and easy and we will be back 
39404,Arbor City, The area especially at night wasn t nice but the windows offer no reduction from a lot of noise Worst nights sleep I ve had in a while , The hotel it s self was lovely
39405,Arbor City, The underground station which is 2 minutes walk from the hotel it is not very siutable for visit the city as the pink line is not very frequent , The hotel has just been refurbished and the romos are very nice and confortable 
39406,Arbor City,No Negative, Cleanliness Comfortable bed Spacious room Friendly staff Location The hotel is extremely clean and located very near to the Tower Bridge Staff is really co operative and were kind enough to organise a Birthday cake and wine They also delivered it to room at midnight I will definitely like to stay with Arbor City hotels when I am in London 
39407,Arbor City, Shower was blocked which flooded the bathroom The air con unit only blew out cold air so was cold during the night Bright green led lit up whole room so had to take key card out to turn it off , Good location clean decor was good
39408,Arbor City, Travelling as a couple and had a booking confirmed for a double room We did expect this to mean one double bed however when we got to our room there were 2 single beds pushed together This was a let down but we didn t mention to the staff so can t complain too much as they may have sorted this had we asked At dinner in the hotel bar restaurant the service was very slow and I did not receive one of the items I had ordered since the service was slow and no staff were around during the meal I didn t ask about it We did not feel that the quality of the food or service matched up with the price charged Overall the meal was disappointing and over priced however there are a few places to east near by , Room was beautiful very very spacious and spotless and hotel is in a great location right next to the Aldgate tube station so travelling around the city is a breeze Definitely a higher standard of room than most other hotels for the same price in London 
39409,Arbor City, Reception staff not so friendly Room noise isolation could be better, Good location in the east side Big room and very comfortable bathroom All comfort in the room like USB charger etc
39410,Arbor City, They asked for a deposit of 50 upfront on a credit card This was refunded quickly after checkout but it seemed s a strange system , Terrific location perfectly placed in between the flashy city and more down to earth brick lane Shoreditch area Very convenient for the lower of London tower Bridge and St Katherine s docks 
39411,Arbor City, Room temperature was set not to go below 19C which was too warm for me I opened the window during the day but would not leave it open at night because there is a walkway alongside the windows No American news channels on TV, Great staff very comfortable bed superb breakfast especially from the menu great location in Whitechapel 
39412,Arbor City, Room was a good size and well kept and comfortable but it could have had a bit more lighting and the air conditioning system was not that responsive , Hotel really handy for Aldwych East tube so great spot for getting around Area felt as safe as any in a big city lots of colourful markets and shops nearby 
39413,Arbor City, Pictures of room booked were not the same as the room actually provided but room was still good , Staff were very helpful and friendly Facilities limited but what there were were very good Very clean Lift booked a long time in advance so that made the room overall value for money Close to Algate East Underground Station use Oyster card on the underground forget buses as they get caught in the traffic too much 
39414,Arbor City, Shower pressure if I m being picky oh and the room was hot , The hotel clearly pride themselves on exceptional customer service and attention nothing s too much trouble and the staff put you at ease at all times Room was lovely comfy beds USB sockets pod coffee everything you d expect from a decent London hotel nowadays Great views try and get yourself a top floor room if you like that sort of thing Bathroom was good but it s a big hotel and the shower pressure was a bit meh Wether you turn up in your trackies or your suit you ll be greeted the same Good location just round the corner from Aldgate East and just up the road from spittlefields and shoreditch which if you venture up there be sure to check out bull in a China shop for food and cocktails Will stay again 
39415,Arbor City, No gym Some noise from the corridor, Reasonably priced for London tidy rooms in a modern building well connected due to proximity to East Aldgate tube station a stone s throw from Brick Lane with plenty of cheap eats
39416,Arbor City, No shelf for shampoo etc in shower , The room had a view of the city It felt warm cozy and was a good size I liked how you could open windows for fresh air Bedding was very comfortable Good bed side lighting 
39417,Arbor City, Service from breakfast staff and manager was quick efficient and friendly Menu choice was good However the Breakfast was cold well what you would call tepid The hash browns vegetarian sausage were well cooked slightly over cooked but had been left to go too cool or have just been kept warmed up beans were the same The mushroom and tomato were hot and lovely Poached eggs a little cool Manager did offer to get us a new breakfast but we had a meeting to get to and so he offered a free latte which we declined We should not have been charged for at least one of the breakfasts 2 of us eating as we both couldn t eat the cold items In hindsight I feel I should have suggested we didn t pay for at least 1 when I checked out but as we were short for time we didn t pursue it Shame really as the rest of the stay was delightful, Location is perfect for business in and around Aldgate Tower place Brick lane etc Staff service is excellent Room was a great space Great to have a walk in shower as opposed to some properties that still offer a shower over the bath Clean
39418,Arbor City, Aircondition didn t work properly but in October we didn t really need to use it , Nice and clean room Good size of the room too Bath was very Nice 
39419,Arbor City,No Negative, I stay at this hotel on a fairly regular basis The staff are friendly and efficient and you are always greeted with a smile The rooms I have stayed in vary in size but the beds are super comfy This is one time when size doesn t matter There is everything you need in the room iron with ironing board kettle coffee machine hairdryer as well as toiletries in the bathroom Plenty of electrical sockets for your gadgets too I don t always have breakfast when I stay there but there is a fabulous choice of both continental as well as cooked For me there s no other place I d rather stay when in London Definitely highly recommended 
39420,Arbor City, Receptionists are a bit bland maybe smile and improve you customer service a tad bit The kitchen was under renovation so we couldn t order off the 24hr menu a bit annoying my boyfriend had to bring us food after hours I also didn t have a robe in my room small but when it states you get one then it really should be in the room , Location was good near Aldgate good transport links if you re not driving Also lots of shops near the vicinity so worth having a look around Facilities were new and comfortable bar area and lounge was nice 
39421,Arbor City, The area around the hotel wasn t amazing it felt quite unnerving at night , The room was comfortable and clean although it was extremely hot and the air conditioning didn t seem to do much to cool it down 
39422,Arbor City,No Negative, This hotel is great for walking to Tower of London and just round corner from Aldgate East Tube The hotel is very modern and contemporary Rooms very comfortable with beautiful bathroom Breakfast is amazing We loved the little pots of natural yoghurt with fruit puree Staff very helpful and friendly Will definitely visit again 
39423,Arbor City, Rude staff Had to argue to get inclusive breakfast even though I showed the email proof Didn t want to give me upgraded room even tho I was entitled to one and spoke to my partner in a very rude way discusting customer service will not be going back, Central location
39424,Arbor City, If you re going to stay there request a room not facing the street as it gets quite loud Also the staff failed to notify us there was a party happening which went on all night long as being on the 1st floor not ideal Lastly upon check out we were told if we had sorted out our taxi issue to which we were told we had caused damage to a taxi then apparently told the taxi driver our room number and the staff had spoken to my mother in regards to this This is still ongoing , The amenities were very good The staff were rather pleasant The location as I ve stayed before was perfect 
39425,Arbor City, Possibly the only downfall is the street noise Feel they could double or triple glaze the windows as street noise is an issue , Location is fabulous On a really good tube line to get pretty much everywhere and literally 2 mins from the tube Very friendly staff and huge comfy room 
39426,Arbor City, Staff could have been more friendly Although only using the room for a quick change to attend a ceremony and just to sleep we still had to supply a credit card which was debited by 50 On checkout we were presented with a bill for room service It took some time to be sorted and we were made to feel as we were lying My name was on the bill and someone else had signed it No idea how this was allowed to happen Not happy we won t be staying here again , Location was perfect for the purpose of visit
39427,Arbor City, At The check in I asked for twin bed she made me pay 40 extra and when I went to the room it was still a double bed , Clean bed comfy room new very well maintained
39428,Arbor City, Breakfast was expensive at 14 95 for only continental , Has a car park around the back of the hotel which was the main reason for picking the hotel Staff all very friendly 
39429,Arbor City, Staff quite rude and dismissive on arrival Could hear next doors blow drying hair at 6am Asked for decaf tea and got decaf coffee Not a very nice view straight in to an abandoned building, Staff nice on leaving Breakfast good No hot food within cost
39430,Arbor City, Slight odor from the switched off air condition after entering the room Disappeared shortly after switching air condition ON No big deal , Just about everything 
39431,Arbor City, Nothing, brilliant contemporary interiors very spacious room luxurious bathroom phantastic rest in the thick of it great service very friendly staff loved it
39432,Arbor City,No Negative, Great size rooms with nice additions such as nespresso machine Very good value room service menu Free fruit and water in reception Comfy bed and very quiet at night so able to enjoy a restful nights sleep 
39433,Arbor City, The car parking situation is awful They say there is parking and to get a permit ticket from reception who then tell you you can t get one and must pay at the booth where there is a man who s card reader won t work so you have to walk to the cash point to pay for parking It s honestly cheaper to park it on the pay and display outside and leave by 8am the next morning, The hotel interior is well presented and clean
39434,Arbor City,No Negative, Staying near friends so it was great location spitfield markets aldgate east tube around the corner Liverpool station 5 minute walk Hotel staff very friendly and helpful hotel room very clean free wifi
39435,Arbor City, the hotel has a chain hotel vibe workers arent very interested in you they dont even look at you while speaking and the location is really close to the tube station but only tower hill is close enough to walk from the hotel and even that takes quite long to walk so you need to take the tube to basically everywhere , rooms are clean and comfortable and there s plenty of extra place hotel is really close to the tube station Aldgate East so transportation was easy 
39436,Arbor City, This hotel had the worst staff I think I ve ever experienced in my life I had issues when checking in and I had issues when checking out to be honest the next time I stay in London I will pay a bit more for a much better hotel you get what you pay for and this is somewhere I will never stay EVER again Word of advice for anyone planning on staying there JUST DONT GO THE STAFF ARE TERRIBLE ,No Positive
39437,Arbor City, Although not in a particularly good area it was very local to everything we had planned for the weekend, Really good value for money rooms very spacious and staff very friendly
39438,Arbor City, Nothing, Clean towel new good quality box for shampo and lotion and shoer gel big room air condition near station one miner near super market tesco And they serve frout in resepion Hotel give my givt in my barthday see photo 
39439,Arbor City,No Negative, Great hotel Very nice stuff spacious and clean rooms fresh fruit and water on reception Underground station and many nice restaurants nearby Tower Bridge 15 min walk We had a wonderfull time and we recommend this hotel to everyone 
39440,Arbor City, We were on the first floor and the noise form the street was quite loud Next time we will ask for a room higher up, The room was very comfortable Shower room was very stylish Check in was easy and I like the contactless room keys Nice and close to the tube and a great base for visiting London
39441,Arbor City, a little bit far from the center, Close to underground up to 2 min walking Very clean functional and large room excellent staff i ll come back optional for rich brekfast
39442,Arbor City, Lady checking us in wasn t great She couldn t find my booking Manager sorted it all out and was very friendly , Location cleanliness value for money
39443,Arbor City,No Negative, The bed was very comfy the rooms nicely decorated and modern and the rest of the hotel was great The nearby area is a bit shabby but perfect when taking the early train from Liverpool street station 
39444,Arbor City, As I said the bed could have been a bit larger the Hotel was very friendly clean and well run, Did not stay for breakfast the bed could have been a bit larger all in all the room was OK
39445,Arbor City,No Negative, Huge rooms with a view over the city Very clean and modern with pleasant staff Close to the city centre underground as well as many restaurants and tourist attractions 
39446,Arbor City, One of the receptionists didn t speak very good English very polite and friendly tho, Practical rooms and immediate facilities and excellent location
39447,Arbor City, Noisy other guests slamming doors late at night One night it was 3am and we were woken up and couldn t get back to sleep so very tired next day , Upgraded to a high standard since our last stay nearly 2 years ago Cleaned well each day 
39448,Arbor City,No Negative, A lovely modern comfortable hotel with extra little touches coffee machine in room cool water and fresh lemon water in reception The room was a lovely modern room with a fantastic bathroom and wonderful shower Only thing I would say is there was no mirror near a plug so had to do my hair with no mirror 
39449,Arbor City, Location was just short of perfect About 200 yards to be exact It was just too far down a slightly threatening side street Fortuneately i was never travelling alone and it wasnt too far down but i wouldnt let my daughter venture out on her own , Beautiful hotel a v reasonable little luxury all mod cons and staff exceptionally friendly and helpful Great lounge bar area too perfect when you come in from a long day 
39450,Arbor City, I thought it said in the details dressing gowns were provided but we didn t find any and to be honest for a lightening stay it did not matter, Staff were welcoming everywhere is nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable And only minutes from the underground station
39451,Arbor City, While the hotel is very nice the area it is located in leaves a lot to be desired , The hotel was very nice The staff was helpful and assisted with calling ahead so we had a taxi when we were ready to leave The bathroom and room was modern and up to date 
39452,Arbor City, I did not agree with the deduction of 50 00 from my account even though was explained that this was refunded later on after check out Also this is yet to appear on my bank statement , I liked the staff they where very helpful at check in room was also great and bathroom was excellent 
39453,Arbor City, The area at night seemed very rough and unsafe We witnessed some unsavoury behaviour on our way to the Tesco Express There was also a previously unmentioned fee of 50 as a security deposit which took us unawares and left us with 50 less in our pockets for the trip It was refunded a week after we had arrived home , Close proximity to the tube station it was very handy to get from Liverpool St to Stansted airport with heavy bags A lovely hotel and extremely comfortable after a long day sightseeing 
39454,Arbor City, View across the hotel restaurant may not be to everyone s liking , We found this hotel to be excellent The exterior of the hotel may not be eye catching but once you are inside it is a totally different story Hotel lobby is quite modern inviting and fresh as it is obvious that the hotel was recently renovated Hotel location is very good with the Aldgate East tube station District Line less than 2 minutes walking and Liverpool St station about 10 15 minutes walk away Start of Brick Lane is also less than 2 minutes walking Tower of London and Thames River is about 15 20 minutes walking from the hotel Hotel room is very spacious with ample space for 4 people and their luggage we booked an executive family room The couch and the two armchairs were also a nice touch The size and the overall ambiance of the room was very good and it definitely made for a very comfortable stay The bathroom was also very spacious and the lighting in it was fine Provision of tea herbal teas nesspresso coffee pods yes there s a Nesspresso machine in the room and biscuits was also nice touch A jug of water was also provided which we thought was very nice especially after a long day venturing into the big city of London The main bed was very comfortable while the second bed which seemed to be a sofa bed got mixed reviews from the kids The room has its own air condition system and this came handy because although the temperatures were not very high during our stay it still felt sufficiently humid to warrant its use We used the hotel restaurant a couple of times and if you receive discount vouchers from the hotel staff I would recommend to give it a try The food was very good and with the vouchers is on par cost wise with restaurants around the area serving cosmopolitan dishes western European food View from the hotel restaurant was not anything to write home about but don t let that deter you from giving it a try 
39455,Arbor City, The location of the hotel was very convenient 30 seconds from Aldgate East tube stop but the area wasn t very picturesque , Beautiful hotel friendly staff AC in the rooms super fast Wi Fi I can t complain about anything 
39456,Arbor City, Off street parking availability is mentioned in the Booking com listing but not the cost Parking at rear of the hotel was GBP20 A bit of a rip off for an overnight park in at 10pm out by 8am , We stayed here in July 2016 Hotel outside was not all that impressive but don t let the exterior look deter you Once through the front door the hotel is superb The room was incredible Super modern interior spotlessly clean and very well presented A Service and staff were excellent Nothing was too much trouble Location was terrific value for money close to local restaurants and supermarkets 15 minutes walk to London Tower 2 minutes walk to Aldgate Tube station A fantastic stay 
39457,Arbor City,No Negative, Excellent location for visiting London attractions very close to Aldgate East station Staff was very friendly and helpful Rooms were clean modern and quiet Excellent value for money Would stay here again 
39458,Arbor City, Price was a bit high but possibly in the range for London in July, Very near underground easy walk to Tower of London Plenty of room for 4 people Good wifi
39459,Arbor City, Breakfast was too pricey even for London and the independent cafe next door was more reasonable , Helpful friendly staff well specced spacious rooms Modern and well equipped with Nespresso machine in room comfortable bed Nice little extras such as fresh popcorn in bar area chilled water and fruits Lounge with cinema screen Spectacular views across the city from the front bedrooms above 2nd floor 
39460,Arbor City, Continental breakfast cost 14 95 which we thought very expensive so we had breakfast elsewhere, Very comfortable bed Spacious room Lovely bathroom Good air conditioning though slightly noisy didn t stop me sleeping though
39461,Arbor City, Poor English language skills of some reception staff Breakfast price a rip off, Location to tube 1 minute walk God send if you are lugging suitcases Smart clean interior Staff welcoming 
39462,Arbor City, Better book as earlier as possible to get best reasonable price, This hotel located in City of London which is still at zone 1 in London very near to MRT station Aldgate east you can just walk for 5 min near to some restaurant Very clean comfortable bathroom and bed they provide tea and coffee machine room was Ok not too small Near to Tower of London and London bridge
39463,Arbor City, The lady who checked us in didn t speak very good English and it took a lot of slow talking and her looking around confused before we got sorted , Hotel was amazing Rooms were lovely Reminded me of the Mondrian in LA Just an unusual quirky little location for such a luxury hotel but it was the location that made us book so can t complain 
39464,Arbor City, The area around is ok But in one block there is an underground station and the nicer area starts , Well decorated spacious rooms nice city view with skyscrapers 
39465,Arbor City, Sometime some noise from accross the street can be here but this is minimum , Location cleanliness facility are excellence Modern look and new Staff also quiet good 
39466,Arbor City, the cost of breakfast was expensive at 20 each per night for buffet breakfast There are plenty of options nearby serving great food and very good value for money , Modern clean located very near tube station and staff were very friendly 
39467,Arbor City, For twin rooms larger beds would have been more comfortable , The decor is modern and comfortable Location next to a tube station very convenient Very friendly helpful staff 
39468,Arbor City, They don t have a Gym which is fine but there are plenty of Gyms in the locality so they should come to an agreement with one of them to allow guests to use Gym facilities , Staff extra helpful and make you feel welcome
39469,Arbor City, Price can be cheaper than this Sheets must be changed everyday without asking We only eat at the restaurant one time it was too pricy The bed is the real problem it is very soft for my taste , Hotel location is very good 1 minute to tube station Very clean very fresh slient If we come to London again we will exactly stay in this hotel They cleaned our room everyday 
39470,Arbor City, if you have to pay the full price like 200 euro for a night then the price qualityscale tips over a bit to the negative side, room with great view on the City financial district And very comfortable too And just a five minutes walk from the Town bridge And with a 40 percent bonus on the price that made it perfect
39471,Arbor City,No Negative, A very nice hotel well located It was nice and quiet The restaurant food was good but we chose not to have the breakfast and found many places nearby that had great breakfast comparatively cheaply The pillows were brilliant so a good night sleep was had by all 
39472,Arbor City, It s pretty far out of my usual stomping ground but I really enjoyed being able to tumble home after a long day at the Tower of London , Loved the basket of chilled clementines in the lobby the service and the clean open design I also loved exploring a new neighbourhood I loved the Brick Lane vibe 
39473,Arbor City, The hotel was really good except I felt that they were trying to make as much money out of everything they could The breakfast was no particularly cheap but was fairly basic except they then hand you a menu to get more money out of you for anything hot, It was a lovely equipped recently revamped hotel Very clean and friendly 
39474,Arbor City, Small niggle we asked for a quiet room the lovely team upgraded us to an exec room which was great but next to a service lift which woke me up and kept me up every morning though i am a light sleeper , Lovely hotel good deco good staff comfortable rooms also great quality and spec of bedrooms and the bar toilets gorgeous toilets downstairs Nice touches such as lemon flavoured water in reception and oranges available Great location with a couple of very good cafes if you choose to opt out of breakfast which we did Exceptionally accessible to Central london without the downsides 
39475,Arbor City, Nothing, Very friendly staff hotel room was very spacious and clean Bathroom was immaculate And a 46 HD TV to wrap it all off Excellent Hotel is 1 minute walk from Aldgate East tube station 
39476,Arbor City, Nothing only used the hotel to sleep so couldn t comment on the food or other facilities, Room was very big for a family room plenty of space for the kids to play with the toys from Hamleys 
39477,Arbor City, Location, The look of the hotel was very contemporary and trendy Also the breakfast staff were extremely attentive and couldn t have been any more helpful and friendly 
39478,Arbor City, The chambermaid keep providing us only 1 face towel and shower towel when there are 2 of us This happened on our 4th and 5th night stay , There is a supermarket nearby the hotel and many eating places to choose 
39479,Arbor City, Confusion as the parking payment was separate to the hotel check in out and wasn t explained in the booking Pay the attendant when you arrive , Great location rooms are visually appealing immaculate hotel on site parking 
39480,Arbor City, The breakfast lacks in my opinion Its not bad but definitely the weakest part of this accommodation to reach 9 , View in the upper floor 6th is great to City of London the very next buildings are rubbish warehouses propably they dissolve in the next years The location for walks to the city of London is very very good and the connections to Tube or Overground are quite good as well 
39481,Arbor City, There was a problem with a leak in the carpet in a triple room we had booked and some staff had snubbed it off as my dad s wet feet from the shower and did not look into the problem until we had spoken to another staff member who then apologised and upgraded them to a bigger triple room All was good in the end , One of the best hotels I ve had the pleasure to stay in Was a little on the pricey side but hey that s London Staff were very friendly and even upgraded us upon our arrival They were also very helpful in giving recommendations and directions Rooms were impeccably clean and our bathroom in the family room was HUGE and amazing Complete with 3 basins perfect for my mum sister and I The hotel made our stay in London so much more enjoyable Very close to Aldgate East tube station with great stores all around yet in a relatively quiet area Tower bridge walking distance There is also an AMAZING sandwich place cafe just next to the hotel run by a Moroccan family would recommend there for breakfast as I heard the breakfast at the hotel is rather pricey Would definitely come back again 
39482,Arbor City, Doesn t have a gym or pool which is a disappointment, great location 5 minutes from metro Alsgate east on Bricklane which is famous for its curry houses Not many other good options though if you are not interested in greasy curries
39483,Arbor City, I would say nothing that I dislike , All the things especially the elegant decorations and comfortable furnitures as well as the convenient location The small fridge also adds the credits 
39484,Arbor City, Nothing , The room was great and the staff was lovely super friendly and helpful Beds were comfortable room spacious and the hotel s decor was great 
39485,Arbor City, The area might not suit everyone very much a up and coming neighbourhood with plenty of hipster bars coffeehouses in the area Looks a little rundown in areas but we never had any problems walking around late at night , Excellent facilities and the staff were fantastic Very close to tube station which always makes travelling around London a little easier Large selection of Indian restaurants on the street who all offer great value 
39486,Arbor City, Nothing can be done about the rather brutal exterior aspect but the interior more than makes up for it , comfortable room very well equipped friendly and helpful staff excellent Continental breakfast Very close to the City 
39487,Arbor City,No Negative, Good location 15 minute walk to financial district Close to Brick Lane Spitelfielld markets and other locations like that Clean tidy good size and comfortable room and bathroom Very Quiet rooms Close to Aldgate East tube station 
39488,Arbor City,No Negative, The location and close proximity to the Underground at Aldgate East and the outstanding high quality of the whole interior foyer rooms fixtures and fittings At the price we paid this represented extremely good value for London 
39489,Arbor City,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel was excellent value for money including a room upgrade it was very modern spacious and clean Would recommend 
39490,Arbor City, The area is up and coming lots of building but quite a lot of litter on the streets not the hotels fault Good views of the London skyline but also a large skip Quite close to the tower of London and interesting markets Overall good, The hotel is very modern and comfortable
39491,Arbor City, you need to ask for water they don t refill it I asked to be woken up and they didn t don t use hotels taxis way too expensive and no option to pay by card I took ber at the end and it cost me half the price I would pay for their taxi , free water delivered to the room fast internet staff polite close to the tube
39492,Arbor City, Overpriced breakfast go to Exmouth Coffee round the corner instead for best coffee in London , Very comfortable bed which is my number one priority as business traveller Bar closed at 11pm but very accommodating staff allowed us room service downstairs 
39493,Arbor City, Breakfast was very good but a little pricey at almost 15 a pop against a lot of local competition , The Room was clean and comfortable The Air Con ran quietly Loved the walk in shower and the large Bathroom mirror has a heating element to stop it misting up when showering 
39494,Arbor City, Nothing to complain about , Very pleasant hotel staff We liked the location caught train from city airport the hotel is close to train station and city we could walk to the tower bridge easily Enjoyed a tasty Indian meal in Brick Lane 
39495,Arbor City, Nothing about the hotel itself I just didn t find London to be that impressive and it s waaay too little value for money , Location is near Liverpool station and near several metro stations it s very easy to get around the city from here Also there is a very nice area between the hotel and Liverpool station with markets bars shops etc Unfortunately we didn t have enough time to explore this part of the city but it seems cozier than some of the touristic areas 
39496,Arbor City, Nothing, Location is excellent lots of restaurant and cafes during weekends you will find a big festival at the end of the street where you can feel the real Londoners life Rooms are large compared to London s Hotels Everything is nearby
39497,Arbor City, Early morning traffic noise as we had a street facing room on the 1st floor, A real surprise to find a superb modern hotel with friendly staff so conveniently located for exploring the City of London and Southwark 2 minute walk to Algate East for all other destinations
39498,Arbor City,No Negative, We were upgraded on arrival which was lovely The staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for us Loved the fruit and iced water in the reception Excellent location for the tube White fields gallery and Spitalfields market
39499,Arbor City, The only drawback was when I ordered food that took way to long to make was made up for half a price tag and very nice person who delivered it But all in all a very nice stay , The hotel was great the surroundings could be better but give the hotel it s charm as well Everything was clean and nice smelling The staff where cheerful and nice The room was great big and confy 
39500,Arbor City, Nothing , Very welcoming staff who explained everything on arrival and we were given a discount to use at the restaurant as well The room was clean and well presented with a coffee machine making fantastic coffee 
39501,Arbor City, I couldn t fault it to be honest, This hotel didn t look much from the out side but it was fabulous the reception bar and the room was amazing quality to a very high standard I would recommend this hotel and the staff were very helpful I enjoyed my stay there 
39502,Arbor City, Didn t have breakfast at the hotel as it was really expensive though there is a nice caf next door , Staff were really friendly and welcoming and the facilities in the room were excellent Really good value room rates 
39503,Arbor City, Wasn t easy to find the carpark, Had a fab time in London Staying at the Arbor just made it even more delightful Hotel is very well decorated to a high standard The staff couldn t of been anymore helpful
39504,Arbor City, Our shower did not empty but we reported this and it was sorted , The staff were very friendly The hotel is in a great location and the bed was very comfy 
39505,Arbor City,No Negative, Very modern hotel couldn t fault anything about the location facilities or the room Our stay was excellent If i had to pick something to improve on it would be the space in the bathroom Great 3 days away couldn t have chose a better hotel 
39506,Arbor City, The heater didn t work as it is June and the hotel automatically turns it off but it was unseasonably cold and I was uncomfortable slept poorly The front desk staff the next morning told me I should have informed them and they would have brought me a heater The bed pillows were too fat for my taste I like flat pillows and pipes in the walls hot water perhaps were clunking and very noisy in the morning from about 6 a m I was on the first floor , The large bathroom has a power shower and separate body showerhead there were four big fluffy towels tea kettle and espresso maker big room for London very clean throughout nice restaurant downstairs and chill out space with books etc selection of newspapers and fruit good wifi tasteful decor 
39507,Arbor City, Placing the air conditiong system s external units just outside room s 113 window is not a good idea , Perfect location very spacious and very clean room great bed A bit on the expensive side but the tube station being only 50 metres away and the restaurants of Brick Lane being 100 metres away make up for everything 
39508,Arbor City, The bedroom could have been a little larger Similarly the bathroom , Breakfast was cooked to order none of the more usual shrivelled dried out offerings which have sat under lights for too long 
39509,Arbor City, You have to take the tube for everything and the street it s on is a bit grimy All the way at the edge of the tube s zone 1 , Room was very spacious and comfortable 
39510,Arbor City, Could do with a full length mirror in the room other than that fab, Really close to the tube and from st Pancras daughter enjoyed the close proximity of the vintage shops Saw a different side of London
39511,Arbor City, Bathroom was so small you had to step outside it to dry yourself Chair for desk was so low I had to sit on 2 pillows to use the desk , Very helpful and courteous reception staff 
39512,Arbor City, The car park facilities were a little pricey and not as nice or professional as one might have hoped , The room was large the provisions were perfect the shower was amazing the staff were polite the bed was comfy and the location was brilliant 
39513,Arbor City,No Negative, Clean comfortable and just a minutes walk to Aldgate East Tube station and the Brick Lane Shoreditch area Staff were very friendly upon arrival Great stay 
39514,Arbor City, The ubiquitous fitted carpets loved by British hotels Always a dust trap , This hotel is well located on a quiet street adjoining brick lane The city is easily accessible as is central London
39515,Arbor City, The room was very comfortble and of a good size , The receptionist was a little rude i queued up to check in and was told to go and sit down amd wait to be called There was only one person in front of me in the queue This was my welcome to the hotel 
39516,Arbor City, Would have liked breakfast included in our price but Spitalfields Market is close by so on a nice day only a short walk for a nice choice of breakfasts , Nice comfortable quiet room had everything we wanted Liked the location take the 25 bus right into the West End 
39517,Arbor City, Staff at the reception was not friendly at all First words upon arrival Do you want to check in Ok you still need to pay XXX pounds What about Hello welcome at Arbor City How was your trip Is everything ok , Very good value for money Cleanliness Nice rooms Tube and buses nearby
39518,Arbor City,No Negative, The Hotel is in a perfect location Less than 30 seconds to Aldgate East tubes station 15 minute walk to Liverpool Street Station or Shoreditch box park It is situated right at the bottom of brick lane next to Whitechapel art gallery There s everything you need within walking distance We never got breakfast at the hotel There are numerous places to have breakfast close by Within 5 10 minute walk is The Cereal Killer Cafe The Breakfast Club Spitalfields Market and also highly famous Beigel Bakery on brick lane Can t beat a bagel and cream cheese for 1 
39519,Arbor City,No Negative, The staff was more than friendly and couldn t do enough for us It was my wife s birthday and everyone was wishing her happy birthday and she got a card and chocolates
39520,Arbor City, pretty small bathroom you had to step out into the room for drying yourself with a towel but perfectly clean and new , The best towels in town They switch then daily which is not necessary to me 
39521,Arbor City, The shower OMG it was one of those big square showers have to say best one yet even better than the one in the Lanesborough Hotel and that s saying somethjng, Everything the staff could not have been more helpful the food was unreal could not fault it at all
39522,Arbor City, I didn t like the bed and the sheet that looked like not natural and not breathable Cannot open window so air was not that good , Very new nice shower full equiped
39523,Arbor City,No Negative, Literally 2 mins walk around the corner from Exit 3 of Aldgate east station Staff upgraded our room to the one with the best view Much more spacious than we expected especially by London s standard Tea and coffee facility was an added bonus Definitely gave us the best end to our honeymoon trip 
39524,Arbor City, It was quite warm in our room even though it wasn t that warm outside The air conditioning wouldn t stay on very long so it got very warm during the night Also the pillows were too high for us We got lower pillows when we asked but they were still a bit too big , New and very clean hotel in a great location near Old Spitalfields market Brick Lane and Liverpool Street Station Very helpful and friendly staff 
39525,Arbor City, The only tiny thing that irked us was food in the restaurant We were given vouchers which gave us a really good deal We both chose steak off the set menu but were told that this wasn t available We ordered chicken instead which was ok a bit dry Later another table came in and ordered steak which miraculously appeared The hotel should have honoured the set menu and provided the steak instead of saying this wasn t available Breakfast was also very expensive which made us eat out , The hotel was really lovely Quiet clean modern and well looked after Our room was spacious and lovely the shower in particular was amazing We d stay here again but probably eat elsewhere 
39526,Arbor City, I didn t notice the air conditioning was leaking until I had opened it for a while and there was some water on the floor However I called the reception and they sent someone to look at it immediately and covered some towels on it and since it was late at night so he promised that it would be fixed next day morning It was fixed the next day so it is not really a big issue The complimentary bottle of water was only placed on the day of check in and was not replaced after the room services , The room is very clean and has great facilities There is a heater in the bathroom which is very useful to dry the used towels and hand washed clothes The location is very convenient Just a few minutes walk from the Exit 3 of Aldgate East underground station A walk distance to Liverpool Street and Brick Lane Market The staff are very nice and helpful Speedy check in and check out We requested to change a room with a view and the staff made the change on the same floor for us She just asked us to stay outside the room to wait for her to come upstairs to give the new room key cards to us and didn t have to go downstairs to the reception with our luggages to change the room 
39527,Arbor City, No hair dryer, The receptionist was friendly and checked me in promptly The room was spacious clean with a sofa that meant I could relax after my meeting Bathroom was extremely clean the location was excellent as it was a stone throw to the train station and had easy bus access Would definitely stay there again Highly recommended 
39528,Arbor City, Noisy outside till 2am at night TV is no good no good movie ch , Small but updates and cozy room Very small but modern bathroom Clean and updated hotel with well implemented design Very close to the tube 
39529,Arbor City, I was travelling with my parents a few steps to negotiate , The beds were lovely and the room was very spacious Loved the bathroom too esp the shower 
39530,Arbor City, The hotel was VERY warm I had to keep the A C on 24 7 on full power The pillows aren t great a bit lumpy They were charging 15 for breakfast which is astronomical Still I got the hotel for a good price and it s in a great location at the end of Brick Lane would stay again, Great location price and clean hotel Good wifi and massive tv in the room My room had a lovely view over London Will definitely stay again 
39531,Arbor City, I booked a room for 4 people I paid the exact amount for Executive family room They gave me a room with a double bed and a single sofa bed the sofa bed is only 1 m wide They told me it s because we only have 3 people when check in WHAT I paid more money for two double beds one for my parents and one for me You paid the room fees before you see your room Although they changed the room from the second night It was a room beside the elevator and stairs it was very noisy They ruined our journey cause we can t sleep well at all I stayed there for 5 nights paid more than 1000 pounds It was terrible It has a bad location for tourists You always need to travel long in tube and change lines , Facilities
39532,Arbor City, My room was too hot with the air con off and too noisy with it on , The hotel is in a good location and is well presented with very modern d cor Staff were friendly and helpful 
39533,Arbor City, The only thing I can think of was I think the refrigerator overheated I should ve brought this up to the staff , The staff was very friendly the amount of restaurants and shops around the area was great and the proximity of the hotel from the Underground was perfect 
39534,Arbor City, The hotel is too expensive The manager was not helpful in solving my problem I got disabled room and the poorest breakfast ever Did not enjoy my stay with them I had cheaper deal in 5 star hotel , regardless bad side room was ok
39535,Arbor City, Bathroom a little small but it s London I don t like carpets but British hotels do, Very quiet room Pleasant staff and excellent location on the edge of central London and near good food and excellent curry houses
39536,Arbor City,No Negative, Loved Absolutely everything The hotel is superb The staff are friendly and very professional the rooms were lovely decorated and clean and very modern It was gorgeous 
39537,Arbor City, Not very sound proof can easily heard the open closed from adjacent or opposite room Another disappointment point is no replenish of drink water in the room after you finished the initial bottle then that s it The air condition is works properly but a bit noisy as well as the lift that serves level 6 it make a loud noise every time closing the door, Very short walking distance from Aldgate East subway station surrounded by few fast food restaurant as we as some decent Turkey Indian restaurant and local cafe Guest room has USB wall plug installed 
39538,Arbor City, Nothing to not like especially for the price paid and it s relative central location in Zone 1 , Great value for money Right next to Aldgate East station so easy to get around In Zone 1 so kind of central Very clean and the reception always smells so good Got a lot of restaurants around the the hotel plus a really good Turkish restaurant right outside 
39539,Arbor City, Only negative is the 11 am checkout Especially at the weekend the hotel should really consider a noon check out which is common at most hotels , Great location newly refurbished rooms windows that open and good value for money The staff are very friendly Perfect for a weekend in London 
39540,Arbor City,No Negative, The cleanliness loved it a lot The room was extraordinary much better looking that in the picture The staff really went an extra mile for me because I arrived earlier than the check in time and they managed to accomodate my needs even though it was early The room was incredibly clean and very very cosy I would recommend this hotel to everyone 
39541,Arbor City, Would be nice to have leisure facilities but it is very central so understand space at premium, Location Staff Responsive when I had an issue Nicely decorated
39542,Arbor City, Nothing , The hotel is welcoming and the bedroom is spacious and well appointed with very modern fittings The bathroom was excellent with a large shower 
39543,Arbor City, Our window was a bit drafty and there was lots of noise coming from the street especially on the night There was loud music on the saturday night coming from somewhere , The food we ordered from room service was lovely and came quickly The staff were extremely friendly and helpful A beautiful and clean hotel 
39544,Arbor City, The pillows would just not up a 4 star property it was like staying at 1 star property The staff on departure were not very helpful When contracting later in the day the hotel management did not take my point of view seriously Smoke alarm when off in another room at 05 13 for at least 20 seconds, The overall ambiance location and the reception staff when arriving 
39545,Arbor City, windows can t be opened so the air inside the room wasn t really fresh , the bed and linens were really comfortable the hotel is just one minute walk from the aldgate east tube station so it has good connections to the city centre 
39546,Arbor City, Couple of minor issues I had was an annoying green light in the bedroom that never switched off and being close to the elevator which would make noise during the night both of which were bothersome but I didn t complain about it as I don t think anything could have been done short of me moving rooms Otherwise all good , Pretty much everything was great great location for work with quick access to the tube restaurants cafes and places of interest to see Close to Brick Lane which has a nice Sunday market
39547,Arbor City, Shame that my room was opposite the lift which pinged loudly everytime it arrived Staff say they will look into this , Very nice decor all new and shiny still 
39548,Arbor City, Check in staff at reception rather surly No bath robes Breakfast menu price list confusing could be better worded , Staff at breakfast were excellent Very friendly and helpful Good rooms comfortable bed Parking available public at rear of hotel Close to tube station 
39549,Arbor City, The only possible improvement would be providing a few more coffee and milk sachets as I needed 2 sachets just to make one decent tasting cup of coffee but that is all , Shower was amazing The building is immaculate and the reception smells so fresh The beds are so comfortable and rooms are spacious There is a fridge in the room and also a Nespresso machine in addition to a kettle Complimentary sparkling water was a nice touch Can t fault our stay 
39550,Arbor City, Parking costs, Location Effe s Turkish restaurant outside the hotel s entrance is superb and situated at the start of Brick Lane the aromas during the evening are mouth watering 
39551,Arbor City, Nothing, Excellent value for money the staff were helpful and friendly The room was big and spotlessly clean The tube station is a couple of minutes away and round the corner from Brick Lane which is lined with Indian restaurants Would definitely recommend this hotel 
39552,Arbor City, They didn t have pizza when we ordered room service at 4 00am , The room was nice and big and comfy The staff were nice and it was all a pleasant stay 
39553,Arbor City, Everything was faultless , Rooms were very clean and very comfortable Loved the nespresso machine next to the bed Staff were amazing and no question went unanswered They were always smiling and helpful 
39554,Arbor City, USB cabel charger didn t work But instantly we were given EU chargers So can t really complain about it , The staff vas very friendly and helpful Room was very clean Bathroom was like brand new Seems that they had renovated it recently Room was wery spacios We were 3 persons in the room and there enough space for us Beds were very nice and comfortable In the room there was tea coffe and water without extra charge Defenatelly would stay there also next time
39555,Arbor City, The only issue I have is the lighting in some of the rooms could be better some of the rooms are quite dark even with all lights on Prices vary a lot depending on availability early booking is recommended , I have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the last year and the refurbishment has been excellent Rooms are very comfortable The hotel is well placed for access to the City and the underground network Staff are always extremely helpful and polite 
39556,Arbor City, Room slightly too warm despite climate control on minimum Only stayed 2 nights but no real complaints, Really well placed for the subway plenty of quality choice for eating and drinking Never stayed in this part of London but would definately book again
39557,Arbor City, Nothing everything was great, Room was extremely well presented and so clean with plenty of space Staff were very friendly and always with a smile Top effort
39558,Arbor City, Nothing , Great room size for central London Lots of space for families if you book the executive family suite This hotel is newly renovated It is wonderful We appreciated the tea coffee and cookies after traveling all day Staff were super helpful with recommendations on where to eat and shop Make sure you visit the Spitafields Market Food heaven Also ask for a room on a higher floor looking out to the city The view of the city lights is lovely 
39559,Arbor City, On arrival staff did not mention that the hotel would be hosting private functions on both the Friday and Saturday night from 19 30 02 00 The music was extremely loud and caused everything in the room to vibrate For this reason I would only stay at this hotel from a Sunday to a Thursday night unless you are going to be in after 02 00 or don t mind not being able to sleep or hear the television over the music , The location of the hotel is brilliant 
39560,Arbor City, The room was very loud Outside the window there was air conditioning which obscured the view , Location amenities comfort of the bed And english breakfest like a polish dinner Wow 
39561,Arbor City, Twin Beds were pushed together to make a full sized bed but if you slept in the middle of the bed you would end up on the floor when the beds would slide apart during the night , The day manage was exceptionally helpful willing to try and help with any situation we needed help with even if it had nothing to do with our room or the hotel 
39562,Arbor City, Restaurant and bar very expensive in a location with lots of super cheap restaurants If there menu was a bit cheaper we would have eaten in after our flight besides that this is a great place to stay , Lovely room with a fantastic view of the London skyline Coffee machine and empty fridge in bedroom 
39563,Arbor City, We had a first floor room overlooking the street and the street noise was loud in the morning but we were aware this is not within the hotel s control The creation of congestion zones in the city has created this everywhere it seems as we had been on the second floor of a flat we d rented and heard similar street noise We enjoyed our stay despite this small detail , Our greeting by the reception staff was warm and friendly Very welcoming The decor is fabulous and fresh with bright colours and great lines and textures throughout Our breakfast service was also wonderful Our server seated us a few minutes before the close of the buffet was extremely attentive to us and our young son and was very willing and helpful when we requested something to take upstairs for our teen daughter He even walked us to the elevator Also the manager stopped by our table and chatted with us about our trip and shared his stories about a recent visit to our home It was a fantastic experience and I will return 
39564,Arbor City, Corridors and stairs needed more frequency of cleaning, Lovely bar free tangerines complementary bar snacks lovely loos with piped birdsong and beautifully clean
39565,Arbor City, There was a party on downstairs which kept me awake However the staff relocated me to another room as soon as I complained It was inconvenient but they were very nice about it and gave me a free breakfast , It was super comfortable and clean 
39566,Arbor City, Restaurant didn t have a lot of food choice Selected to pay on arrival as we were a group of friends but when we arrived was told that the entire booking had been taken from my credit card the night before , Beautifully decorated very clean Lovely reception staff Restaurant food was lovely 2 mins from tube 5 min tube ride to st Pancras 
39567,Arbor City, Ordered a taxi through the hotel and the company they used was very expensive, Staff were lovely and the room which got upgraded was one of the nicest I ve ever stayed in 
39568,Arbor City, Cleaning service knocking at 9 am on Sunday morning when the door is locked from inside Room is really too hot at night and you have people saying this since one year Do something , Comfortable room at 2 minutes from tube station at good price 
39569,Arbor City, I did not like the green safety light It kept me up and I had to find ways of blocking it To do that I stacked pillows on the top of the bathroom door ,No Positive
39570,Arbor City, The room was pretty small but the most annoying was the smashing doors in the corridor and the cleaning service bumping on the walls in the room next to mine It s pretty quiet at night but from 7 8am it gets quite noisy in the corridor , The value for the money is definitely the key point for the place Nice room clean and renovated 
39571,Arbor City, Nespresso type coffee machine environmental disaster that makes rubbish coffee was disappointing Very minor niggle was no shelf in excellent shower to put bottles but really no complaints , Quiet comfortable clean room well equipped 
39572,Arbor City,No Negative, Very well presented and everything is in excellent condition Very clean however staff can be more interesting when they deal with clients I wanted to compliment the hotel but staff in reception weren t interested Apart from that hotel is fantastic 
39573,Arbor City,No Negative, The staff were exceptionally pleasant The room was well appointed Tea and coffee in the room along with a safe Bathroom and shower were of a high quality 
39574,Arbor City, temperature was quite hot the light stayed on in the wardrobe which shone out into the room told the staff who wrote it all down so imagine they will look into it , Liked the beds size of room shower was fab liked the view of the Gerkin cleanliness and products in the bathroom decor was very pleasing
39575,Arbor City, The staff were ok Until I tried to explain that it was bad practise to print my entire card number on the credit card receipt the woman at the desk couldn t comprehend the problem I gave up , Location was great right next to the city and it was well fitted out and comfy in the room 
39576,Arbor City, there was a private function in the lovely relaxing lounge area so we couldn t go in there which was a shame as it was a lovely room to sit and have a drink in , nice modern hotel room was lovely
39577,Arbor City,No Negative, Very polite helpful happy staff Smart fresh decor throughout the building especially reception and bar lounge Great cocktails and delicious food 
39578,Arbor City, May not be the ideal location for those wanting a quiet and laid back neighbourhood , Lovely stylish hotel in an exciting part of London As soon as you walk in you can tell it s going to be nice Comfortable bed nice shower good view and even a nespresso machine Would definitely return 
39579,Arbor City, The area is unfortunately in a neighborhood full of work in progress and after sunset there are drunk and vomiting on the roadside Breakfast too expensive a little extra in my opinion does not correspond to 60 of the room Third bed frankly not up to two singles as shown in the picture During the night the quality of sleep was disturbed by excessive heat and noise from outside we were on the first floor , Given that London hotels are very expensive my judgment is positive Friendly helpful staff especially Nick always professional Clean modern hotel and very spacious rooms especially the shower is huge and you would never get out Complimentary toiletries products were of first quality and water tea and coffee daily offered 
39580,Arbor City, I stayed on the 1st floor close to the street It was quite noisy at night The breakfast is quite expensive The double bed is two single beds pushed together The additional bed is a sofa bed not very comfortable , the location is great the hotel is only 1 minute walk from the nearest underground station Aldgate East Exit 3 The staff are very friendly and helpful The hotel is very well decorated and modern 
39581,Arbor City, I really can t say anything bad about hotel Very comfortable stay, Loved the location of hotel so near tube station Very trendy stylish hotel Loved the little extras such as the nespresso machine in room Shower was amazing

39583,Arbor City,No Negative, Excellently situated very efficient and polite staff they listened and answered perfectly to my request of a quiet room which was calm big not often the case in London and had everything I needed and more I was truly impressed and will definitely go back 
39584,Arbor City, Breakfast was a little pricey 15 each for a continental breakfast which didn t really wow me Although I wouldn t let it put me off staying here again I d just get breakfast elsewhere , The location of this hotel is fantastic right beside the Aldgate East station albeit it was closed 2 days of our visit but Liverpool Street station is just 15 minute walk away and there are so many buses close by The room was fabulous really modern and clean The shower was AMAZING Staff were really accommodating too no problem leaving our bags with them when we arrived early for check in and again after we checked out

39589,Arbor City, Nothing really, The location was excellent The hotel was large rooms were large and everything was exceptional Parking out the front is free on a Saturday too 
39590,Arbor City, OMG noisy You could hear residents on the sides the elevator bell ringing echoing down the hall doors closing The worst though is the outside noise It s like a party happens every night right outside your window All hours of night people are walking up down the road yelling screaming singing So loud An interior room may elliviate it but still a noisy hotel for sure The price would be acceptable had it been located in a better area I get it was newly remodeled but you can t remodel the whole street I wouldn t go back fir these reasons , Newly remodeled clean Rooms equipped nicely spacious clean Located with a block of metro Arbor East exit 
39591,Arbor City,No Negative, Friendly accommodating staff nothing was too much trouble Comfortable spacious and modern rooms with the added bonus of a Nespresso machine Gorgeous bathroom and fabulous power shower One of the best hotels I ve stayed in

39613,Arbor City, No breakfast included The bell on the lift was loud enough to be heard clearly in our room there were 5 rooms between ours and the lift so each time the lift arrived on our floor we were disturbed all through the night Housekeeping was done very late in the afternoon we came back to change for our evening meal and there was a cleaner in our room at around 5 00pm Pillows not great , Brilliant location for exploring both the east end and central Newly done up very clean and well decorated Staff were fantastic we left some items in the safe and didn t realise until we had checked out phoned hotel and staff immediately sorted it out for us very friendly and welcoming as well

39618,Arbor City,No Negative, Hotel offered everything you could need from air conditioning to a good coffee Nespresso complementary in the room The nearest tube station only a few minutes walk from the hotel 
39619,Arbor City, Only one thing we had bad luck with bed size 140 cm wide is to small for two adults So our night sleep was not so comfy , Beautiful design modern and very clean hotel Good location just 2 minutes from metro station We had a very small room but nice and cosy Excellent breakfast we have been told by staff that kitchen is under restoration and variety is not so wide as usual but it was ok wide choice of everything and waiting guys just wonderful 
39620,Arbor City, nothing major just some hickups in service here and there If the hotel would be rated as 3 star i would not be mentioning it but when joining the 4 star group the bar is raised a bit , Completely renovated clean and nicely decorated and well located on 1 minute from subway station All in all a high quality accommodation at a reasonable price 
39621,Arbor City, 1 lift was broken for the 3 days I was there Street noise can be excessive sometimes, Friendly helpful staff location comfort rain shower is awesome
39622,Arbor City,No Negative, As two young female tourists we were looking for a nice place to stay and treat ourselves We stumble across this and were very happy with everything ie Staff amenities room etc The convenience of the tube less than 100 yards walk topped it off 
39623,Arbor City,No Negative, Brilliant gem of a hotel From check in through to departure the whole experience was brilliant Just around the corner from Aldgate East station Osborn street is effectively an extension of the renowned Brick Lane Great room with all the facilities you could wish for A few lovely touches in the Coffe pod machine which delivered a great start to the day and the bedside USB charging ports which are rare in most hotels Clean and modern Rainforest shower with exquisite shower toiletries in its own little presentation box All in all Brilliant 
39624,Arbor City, was charged for a breakfast and then advised that the kitchen was being refurbished and no cooked breakfasts were available was disappointed the road in front of the hotel needs a tidy up was noisy most of the night outside and roadworks construction from very early, clean and spacious rooms newly refurbished 
39625,Arbor City, The only negative thing I have to say about it is that we booked a double room but the bed was basically two single beds pushed together which was slightly uncomfortable , The staff were the most friendly and helpful I ve ever come across in any other hotel The room was so clean You d never know anyone else ever stayed there The design was modern and pleasing to the eye My partner and I both thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
39626,Arbor City, Breakfast was pretty poor in that I wasn t offered a cooked option and waited about 10 minutes to pay when in a hurry The continental option was poor the money paid , Coffee machine in room
39627,Arbor City, Little green light that stays on in room next to main door I like the room to be completely dark , Central but off busy main road Quiet and well within walking distance of many restaurants Close to tube Quick check in and room was lovely
39628,Arbor City, Nothing , Very comfortable clean room with great facilities The location was perfect for us and the reception staff were friendly and helpful Overall very good value for money would definitely stay again 
39629,Arbor City, No where to hang coats in the room, Hotel had just been refurbished and smart and clean Nice big room for 3 plus view plus great bathroom and TV Staff very helpful and excellent cocktails
39630,Arbor City, Not all rooms have a landmark view but my view of the London skyline was still very pretty Soundproofing is good re outside but not internally I could easily hear people in the corridor coming in late , Great location Stylish and comfortable Great London skyline view if not landmark 
39631,Arbor City, The lady who checked us in seemed a bit judgemental on our appearance possibly age we re 29 , Perfect location Very clean and smart hotel appearance Room was very modern and gorgeous 
39632,Arbor City, Nothing, Friendly professional staff and the quality of the hotel Good travel links for getting there and on to Olympic Park Great Sunday market within 5 mins walk and fab Turkish restaurant within 1 min
39633,Arbor City,No Negative, Rooms re furbished to a high standard very modern and comfortable Room service quick and was very nice Nothing too much trouble for the staff would recommend to anyone 
39634,Arbor City, The rooms are quite small the beds not great , For a hotel in London the price quality ratio is OK Location is good and the hotel has recently been refurbished Internet is fast and free 
39635,Arbor City, A unique quirk about our room it was in the stairwell separate from the rest of the rooms on the floor As a result the wifi connection was terrible however we realized on the last day that we could ve potentially used the TV as a wifi hotspot , We were walking distance from a couple different Tube stops and there were a variety of restaurants in the area The bed was comfortable and there were electrical outlets we could use without a converter traveling from Germany 
39636,Arbor City, Nothing bad about this hotel at all, Everything the hotel is excellent in every respect and the staff couldn t do enough for us Definitely more than 3 star
39637,Arbor City, The hotel was being refurbished and we were first placed in a very noisy part of the hotel We got a new room two floors up when we complained so it was solved easily The breakfast was way overpriced , Friendly staff very helpful great location very good wifi lovely design and look of the hotel 
39638,Arbor City,No Negative, Really nice hotel freshly renovated good and friendly staff near to the underground room was clean and really nice bed comfortable Even due to renovations taking place the room was very quiet The last day we went to O2 to watch tennis and they had a free luggage hold from check out to 22 30 PM no problem really comfortable and customer friendly 
39639,Arbor City, The area is significantly downmarket and the area is suffering from the impact of major building works and a changes to the character of the district , It was new quiet and comfortable and the staff were very professional 
39640,Arbor City, The breakfast could do with some more options , The room was absolutely top game perfect The renovations are clearly finished finishing cause at least as far as the 6th floor was concerned the place was immaculate Very spacious room everything about it comfortable cozy and great Seconds away from the tube Absolutely recommended 
39641,Arbor City,No Negative, Newly refurbished stunning rooms and excellent room facilities would definitely recommend and stay there again Just at the end of brick lane so close to restaurants and shops 
39642,Arbor City, The thought that when the refurbishment is complete that the price will rise, Very good hotel great location great staff and recently refurbished so all positives
39643,Arbor City,No Negative, Location was good a one minute walk from Aldgate East tube station there was a little supermarket nearby the room was very clean the bed was comfy and the rain shower was incredible They allowed us late check out which was much appreciated View over the city was gorgeous 
39644,Arbor City, Unfortunately we were woken up at 9am on Sunday morning by tapping The room next door was still being renovated This turned to drilling just before 11am which admittedly was just before checkout time We had been out the night before until quite late so usually we would have been awake earlier Design fault with the taps they weren t long enough to go over the bath but they still worked , The staff were very friendly and helpful It s nice to be served by people with personalities and smiley faces A special mention for Ester This will be a fantastic hotel when completed Great location near the bars and hustle and bustle of brick lane Very clean new nicely equipped rooms bathrooms They kindly agreed to an hour extra for us until checkout which was really appreciated by all of us 
39645,Arbor City, Minor grumble the building work outside the front door of the hotel I expect that may have gone by now though , Comfortable and in a good location for my work 
39646,Arbor City, Brick lane is quite busy all night But that s not the hotels fault, Excellent hotel for a two night stay whilst in town on business Will definitely use again 
39647,Arbor City, The view from our room didn t include the gherkin , Loved the decor nespresso machine tap card to open doors and the bed was firm Right near Aldgate East tube and stagger distance from the Alchemist Ben Nevis 
39648,Arbor City, Nothing to report, The hidden treasure due to renovations you think you have arrived at a construction site then you walk into the reception and it s a gem All new and modern 
39649,Arbor City, At around 17 30 I was in my room and one of the receptionists tried to get into my room without knocking first She was there with another member of staff and said one of the cleaning staff had left some keys in a room but couldn t remember which one These things happen but I d have preferred that they checked there was no one in the room before trying to get in , Good location just round the corner from Aldgate East metro stop Plenty of bars and cafes in the area The room was lovely very spacious and comfortable The bathroom was excellent a wonderful shower and a good size Reception staff on arrival very friendly 
39650,Arbor City, Building works taking place outside the hotel gave an extremely poor first impression you almost have to walk under the scaffolding to get into reception No breakfast included with room rate , Friendly check in staff great location close to Aldgate East tube so walking distance to Moorgate the City Large clean room with ensuite shower room Looked recently refurbished and more than comfortable for a mid week business trip Free wifi which worked well Well sound proofed and good nights sleep 
39651,Arbor City,No Negative, fully new clean comfortable with all amenities The location was perfect for me as I had a meeting in the neighborhood the day after The rooms are also quiet
39652,Arbor City,No Negative, Ideally located for city and surrounding attractions a few yards from Brick Lane so a wide variety of culinary delights to choose from on the doorstep
39653,Arbor City,No Negative, This hotel is still undergoing a major overhaul but the reception and bar restaurant areas are already completed in a fresh modern style and our room was also freshly re decorated with fabulous city views Don t be put off by the outside which still looks like a building site we have already booked to stay here again Just a bit hard to spot the sign at the moment 
39654,Arbor City, I did request blue rose petals as an extra but got red ones Bit of a challenge not the end of the world , Overall appearance of room was classy and clean Thank you 
39655,Arbor City,No Negative, The room was newly renovated and very nice The staff was very good Note although it s hard to find the door the hotel is under renovation inside everything is very new and shiny The breakfast is very good and good value for the price The hotel is also closer to the Underground than it looks It s only about 200 meters away from the Whitechapel Gallery outlet of the Aldgate East Subway 
39656,Arbor City, just the works outside which is nearly finished , Its obviously going through some renovations at the moment but with the exception of the entrance the hotel was way beyond what we expected The room was really very good much better than other london hotels that were more expensive Staff were really courteous and helpful would 100 stay again and recommend 
39657,Arbor City, The street was seedy I wasn t comfortable waking around alone Even if you are working in the City of London it was not the best location Isolated from office buildings The room had a LED light in the entry way that was so bright I could not sleep , The room was clean and modern 
39658,Arbor City, The automatic light over the coffee and tea making facilities kept coming on if you moved in bed shutting the wardrobe door stopped this , The hotel was being renovated and from the outside looked like a building site and the initial thought was oh no but walked through the front door and everywhere was beautifully decorated clean and welcoming The bedroom was spacious comfy and quiet The location was 2nd to non for Jack the Ripper tour and Brick Lane 
39659,Arbor City, Refurbishment is ongoing and the street is closed as part of city transport works The car park was full but the very friendly attendant made room for us the only downside was after being parked on a building site for 2 days my car was covered in dust and grit Despite the continuing refurbishment the hotel was quiet and I would recommend to anyone , Refurbished rooms are very modern and comfortable staff very helpful nothing too much trouble even the on site builders were friendly and polite The location was great just a short walk into the city or jump on the tube 
39660,Arbor City, Was a little concerned when we saw the hotel from the outside as it is currently undergoing works but as soon as you stepped through the door it was another world , Staff at breakfast were charm itself made my daughter feel like a princess 
39661,Arbor City, The hotel is being renovated I was put in a room next to a room in which they were building Wouldn t have been an issue however machines kept making noise during the night Mentioned this to the staff but no action was undertaken , Great new room 
39662,Arbor City, The hotel is being renovated so of course there was building noise and the place looked terrible from outside Inside my room was modern clean and nice Though there are some teething problems with the tap on lights no mirror on desk where the hair dryer was attached to had to ask for amenities why didn t cleaners just leave amenities when they could see they had been used Dirty cleaning clothes left behind from cleaner Wifi was a bit dodgey and then when cable was given couldn t get it to work from any of the sockets , The night manager was brilliant and went the extra mile to make me smile when little things when woops Enjoyed the nesspresso coffee machine in the morning Staff always greeted me and were friendly smiley 
39663,Arbor City, The ongoing works on the hotel should have warranted a lower price I think at 106 80 sterling per night without a breakfast is very over priced , The location was good and the hotel was within easy walk from both Aldgate East station and Liverpool Street station It was comfortable and quiet The quality of the fittings in the room was very high 
39664,Arbor City, They aren t give us the room i booked and they are booking anther hotel bad service and not like the room i shoes it and the city hotel orady token mony from me before 4 day s thats not good for customers,No Positive
