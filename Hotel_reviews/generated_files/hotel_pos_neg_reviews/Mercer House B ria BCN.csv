289010,Mercer House B ria BCN, Air Conditioner was in one bedroom for the suite The person in that room would freeze or everyone would be warm without the use of AC, The staff was outstanding Leah gave me precise directions on the closest Metro stop and even offered to walk down to the stop if we got misdirected It s Barcelona it s not unusual to find an eight corner intersection
289011,Mercer House B ria BCN,No Negative, Fabulous hotel with an amazing and friendly staff Perfect location close to everything The hotel and the city made our vacation one of the best We will certainly return 
289012,Mercer House B ria BCN, Finding the location , Sat navy wouldn t take us to the property I took one hour lost in a ten street maze An absolute nightmare Likewise when I parked 300 yards away 
289013,Mercer House B ria BCN, Maybe a better coffee set up in the room Even though they offer nice coffee downstairs during breakfast my wife and I still need just one cup of coffee or espresso before leaving the room , Great location Close to metro Really nice and simple breakfast every morning downstairs just next to the lobby 
289014,Mercer House B ria BCN, We were located on the first floor so in the evening when guests would be returning at all hours of the night the front door to the hotel was so heavy that it would slam shut The sound was loud enough to wake us up a few times each night This is a problem that is easily fixable by the hotel Everything else was great , Great location and the rooms had everything you required The hotel had two small roof top terraces that were great if you wanted to purchase your own food and wine and have a quiet dinner The staff Ariel and Carla where great as well 
289015,Mercer House B ria BCN,No Negative, we found an amazing deal last minute when our plans changed huge loft style apt with lots of space a bit dark but the location was perfect staff were wonderful last minute decided to have breakfast and we were able to take up to the room wish we had more time to stay here 
289016,Mercer House B ria BCN, Both air conditioning units in the room need servicing as they were very noisy making it difficult to sleep with them turned on during the night Taxi to our hotel dropped us off at the incorrect location there is more than one Mercer Hotel in this area We had to then walk with all our luggage to the correct location Thankfully we were assisted by the hotel staff to find the correct hotel The taxi driver s disappointed us in Barcelona by firstly dropping us off at the wrong location but also getting annoyed with us when we tried to pay with card rather than cash To my mind a taxi driver should be annoyed if you CAN T pay the fare He was very rude, Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was very spacious and clean Decor in the room and artwork really nice Breakfast was really nice Location is excellent for restaurants and shopping Love Barcelona and the people Felt safe walking around and lots to see 
289017,Mercer House B ria BCN, N A, Excellent boutique hotel This hotel is located near everything you want to see in Barcelona The staff led by Carla Hotel Manager and the rest of the staff were extremely friendly warm and very welcoming Carla also assisted and arranged having a private car pick us from the hotel for the cruise port Breakfast was excellent as well My wife and I can t say enough about how it a was truly a great experience Our room was at the floor with a two great rooms Everyone associated with the Mercer House Boria made our stay a wonderful and relaxing experience Will definitely not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone 5 stars A 
289018,Mercer House B ria BCN, Bathroom could use a roof to ceiling for added privacy otherwise the facilities were great Taxi to airport was almost twice the price on a Saturday , Fantastic stay with my son Staff all courteous and helpful Excellent location Recommend the hop on off bus to get around especially if this is a short trip
289019,Mercer House B ria BCN, Would have liked bottled water provided every day as part of service instead of mini bar fee No ironing board in room Dishwasher but no washing machine which was not a problem for us but was unclear in the booking com room description , Our loft suite was well designed and spacious with one bedroom and another king bed in the main space where there was also a kitchenette and seating area Excellent quiet air conditioning Housekeeping was perfect The breakfast buffet was excellent with eggs cooked to order if requested and excellent coffee Friendly helpful staff The neighborhood has dense alleyways with colorful graffiti and a gritty city feel A few blocks away you reach the many amazing landmarks of the Barrio Gotico Steps to Picasso Museum shops bars restaurants as well as taxis and transit 
289020,Mercer House B ria BCN, Hotel staff poor english unhelpful HOTEL LOCATION we had a car impossible to get to the hotel as it is situated on the small pedestrian street ROOM Major rooms face another building which is on long term reconstruction we stayed in May 17 hotel didn t warn us about this The dusty facade of the construction was actually 1 5 meters from the both of our balconies photo attached Don t book this hotel if you plan to enjoy morning sun and long sleep Construction works started at 9am The conditioner didn t work hotel manager refused to give us money back as we didnt want to check in in these circumstances , Goof breakfast if you need eggs ask individually hotel located in the city centre 
289021,Mercer House B ria BCN, No ceiling light the room is too dark in the evening But it s apparently the design of the hotel which looks nice during the day time when you get light from the window Very thin wall we could hear the people next door talking very clearly Couldn t sleep in the main double bed and had to move to the small bedroom and sleep on twin beds not so ideal for couple Found a few ants in the kitchen area on the last day Bathroom was clean but feels a bit old , Really good location in the middle of old town with all good restaurants within close walking distance found on tripadvisor Right next to Jaumel station and the cathedral Picasso museum Also walking distance to the seaside Very big room we had a loft which has a double bed in the main room a bedroom with 2 twin beds Loft has a kitchen area with microwave kettle big fridge but stoves are not to be used so we cannot cook Very nice helpful staff at reception both day and evening shifts 
289022,Mercer House B ria BCN, The charge for breakfast was 15pp And it was NOT worth this and my husband and I were actually annoyed by this There was a lovely lady there who would cook you eggs but only fries or scrambled There was no other hot foods The actual buffet was small with limited choice So ditch the brekkie The room was spacious nice and it was comfy But it was not 100 clean and there was some work needed done to it like plastering and the bathroom need work There was also not a lot of hot water so the shower was luke warm This would not have normal bothered me as the room was nice but for the cost of the hotel I didn t expected that , The location was fantastic The hotel was great staff were really nice I would defo stay here again The room was massive the bed was very comfy There was a little kitchen so it was a nice place to come home to after a busy day The roof top terrace was a lovely place to sit and get some sun I would recommend 
289023,Mercer House B ria BCN, Poor and missing lights did not increase comfort in a dark panelled room Construction site dust and pigeons hindered opening windows , We were upgraded so the suite was huge for two people and we had no use for the kitchen except the fridge Breakfast was fresh and versatile Bed was good towels were chanced every day as well as cleanup done Air condition was needed once to warm up because of the weather 
289024,Mercer House B ria BCN, Hot water ran out after one long shower not sure if it was a localized issue or not Rooms were a little dark could use better lighting , Very nicely renovated rooms in an old building Double windows make for total quiet insulation from the street outside Comfy bed nice bathroom and a nice living room in our suite 
289025,Mercer House B ria BCN, Was a bit noisy at night but we were on the first floor and it was right in the hub of bars and restaurants so was to be expected it was fine for us but others might be put off, Great building excellent location friendly staff
289026,Mercer House B ria BCN, Terrible smell of drainage uncomfortable bed lack of interest of staff to sort out problems very thin walls between rooms hear everything Never will recommend this hotel, Location
289027,Mercer House B ria BCN, No real issues very minor and didn t really bother me at all I loved the room overall The rooms are quite dark despite lots of lamps because its more of a boutique hotel conversion high ceilings dark wood This wasn t a major issue for me but a little more overhead lighting might have been better or you could consider it romantic if there with a partner There was also a bit of a smell from the drains in the bathroom at times but I think this was more a problem in BCN as some street drains were equally whiffy in the area The kitchenette has basic cutlery but no cooking utensils so more heat eat buy prepared rather than actual cooking option but I didn t need this for my stay , This hotel was a surprise gem I was genuinely delighted when I opened the door to my room Great location in the Gothic area walking distance to the Cathedral and shopping areas lots of lovely little boutique shops in the surrounding alleys super hotel I almost walked past it on the street its behind a very large but discreet wooden door on a small side street and the receptionist buzzes you in I was given a free upgrade to a junior suite which had a lounge kitchenette super spacious rooms felt like real luxury after a VERY basic hotel that work booked for me earlier in the week Bed was comfy good heating was an unusually cold week in BCN with decent large fluffy towels Good free wifi quiet street very reasonably priced I would definitely book this hotel again 
289028,Mercer House B ria BCN, The room was a little bit underlight More light would be better, The breakfast was excellent Not a large buffet like in 5 stars but good Fruits eggs prepared by a dedicated and very careful person The room 403 is an appartment Very large and fitted for a family The location in the Born area is excellent
289029,Mercer House B ria BCN, Heating was not working in the room We had to sleep with our jackets on the first night I complained the next day They promised to fix it or offer me another room When we came back at night it seemed they fixed it but still the room is warm I didn t want to change it because I don t know if this problem is all the hotel or just my room Before check out I clearly complained to the receiptionist that we were not happy at all for the first night but they didn t offer any thing Sad Breakfast is very limited Not much choices for vegetarians Light very very dimmed Didn t like it at all Entrance not wheelchair friendly We had to go a couple of stair s steps up to reach the elevator We had a baby buggy and it was ok Don t think it s ok for a wheelchair user Insulation not good There was work on one of the Neighbour houses Very noisy and could not sleep Bathroom did like it as it was glass door , Location Staff Free upgrade
289030,Mercer House B ria BCN, TRULY not a huge deal but the non functioning heating which required a move to another loft the broken refrigerator which were problematic were dealt with in a most exemplary manner , The breakfast was excellent both chefs were proficient skilled very personable pleasant Exactly what we always hope to encounter on our travels An exceptionally delightful way to start the day 
289031,Mercer House B ria BCN, Some things not all so important Very hard beds Not enough ac contacts Non by the beds Nice upgrade but for a two bedroom apartment it was not very well planned One wardrobe in just one of the rooms in total No doors between rooms Why make the small but good breakfast room feel like a cellar when it is de facto not More lights through the big window please , Nice and quiet location El Born is a wonderful maze of small alleys bars and shops Got upgraded Nice Smal and familiar hotel Real Boutique Liked it a lot even if I have some comments Will return I think
289032,Mercer House B ria BCN,No Negative, The entire experience of staying in this hotel was wonderful I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in a vibrant section of Barcelona where you are basically in the center of everything of the old city It is beautiful and aesthetically exceptional with proper modern furnishings furniture lighting all of respectable design and manufacturer as an Interior Designer I always pay attention to the details and this establishment does as well 
289033,Mercer House B ria BCN, Air conditioner was broken and made a lot of noise It took 2 days to fix and management deducted 25 off the bill for the first 2 days , Location and great breakfasts served by a very nice woman each day 
289034,Mercer House B ria BCN, Front desk staff could really care less Needed a taxi and the desk staff told us to walk to the next busy street with our luggage Walls are paper thin and the windows allow a lot of street noise , Breakfast was good and the the lady who makes it was wonderful and friendly Location was good 
289035,Mercer House B ria BCN, At times there was smell and some noise from the streets but then it s the price to pay to be in the old town It wasn t constant and it didn t ruin it I still like the place , Modern spacious cozy feel in the middle of medieval Barcelona Nice terrace at top of building 
289036,Mercer House B ria BCN, Smallest lobby I ve ever seen in a hotel Poor breakfast Definitely not a four star hotel And very expensive for this kind of service, Perfect location Clean and comfy room
289037,Mercer House B ria BCN, It s not about we didn t like just hotel can improve their breakfast menu and serve more kind of product for taste But anyway we liked how chef made us omelet , We booked loft room for family stay in some reason reception girl placed us in their suit room Room was just amazing Every time when entering to the room I feel the smell of cleanliness It s an old building in a narrow street and at the same time very stylish and comfortable We loved 
289038,Mercer House B ria BCN, Renovation in front of the building can t use the balconies balconies are with spikes against pigeons can t use them , Location design clean big room
289039,Mercer House B ria BCN, Air Conditioning was not proper we had mentioned this to the office attendant as well Rooms were large but AC was not effective We had asked for a fan but there was none Instead they gave us a small heater fan LOL , Breakfast buffet was amazing beds were comfy
289040,Mercer House B ria BCN, choice of breakfast you could hear neighbours inside the hotel, Excellent location staff was friendly and with can do attitude brilliant and airy design of room
289041,Mercer House B ria BCN, Wish breakfast started earlier than 8 Many of the local excursions require you to be elsewhere by 8 so not able to have breakfast 7 AM would be a better start time Elevator is on the small size so we used the stairs more , Junior Suite was very spacious and a great value for the price Great free wifi connection Less then 5 minute walk to Metro Countless restaurants within walking distance Near Picasso Museum Breakfast selection was perfect meats fruit yogurt pastries fresh juice Secured building Air Conditioning Nice Modern decor Comfortable Bed and Pillows Would stay again 
289042,Mercer House B ria BCN, The staff a little laid back but this is what we expected in cool Barcelona If you asked a question they were eager to help but they don t pounce on you , The room was surprisingly large and the location was excellent Breakfast was boutique style with local jamon and cheese and you can order eggs No bain marie full of bacon eggs Nice pastries and local fruits 
289043,Mercer House B ria BCN, The air conditioners making noise all the time very annoying , We books a suite for a family of 4 and it was very spacious like an apartment We were pleasantly surprised Location was fantastic we couldn t have picked a better located hotel 
289044,Mercer House B ria BCN, Nothing this was a great stay, We stayed in a larger space on the 4th floor It was perfect for traveling with an older child The size and amenities worked very well Also the desk is staffed 24 7 and the property is very safety conscious which was very nice 
289045,Mercer House B ria BCN, Amazing hotel room but a loud clicking sound kept waking us up all night along with loud voices in the hallway , GREAT location Easy walk to the market cathedral and Picasso museum Very friendly staff good breakfast

289047,Mercer House B ria BCN, The hot water in the shower is only sufficient for 5 min which means that it s enough only to a quick shower for 1 person If the hotel will fix that it s the perfect choice and deserved to be rated above 9 , The location is great the breakfast is very tasty and the Loft is a big room with a lot of space 
289048,Mercer House B ria BCN, They need a name outside the hotel other than on the glass It is a hidden gem , Location and the room itself fabulous Very close to a metro and wonderful dining options

289052,Mercer House B ria BCN, Very limited breakfast got tired of eating the same things every day It is OK if you stay for a day or two but we stayed for 5 days and the breakfast became boring as it was virtually identical every day , The location the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff very comfortable room
