297640,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The batteries in the locker had run very low which made it very difficult to operate That wasn t fixed until days later The breakfast lounge kitchen was undermanned things would run out and it would take too long to wait for them to be replaced There were quite a number of cheap iron chairs there that needed fixing The rubber pad at the bottom had come off so there was this incredible screech every time you moved the chair or stood up The beds were uncomfortable too stiff I found it strange having to pay for all the hotel weeks in advance and that the payment would be nonrefundable , The staff were generally friendly and helpful both at the reception the breakfast lounge and the room maids 
297641,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The beds are a tad too hard and although soundproofed you can hear furniture scraping off floors prehaps from above rooms early in morning , I loved that there was two showers in the room The location is very good and close to metro Staff are friendly 
297642,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The amenities provided daily by the house keeping and the air conditioning wasn t functioning properly specially for July nights, The helpful decent staff the location of the hotel the spacious room and the amazing open buffet breakfast 
297643,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bed was too hard Away from the tourist area which some might attractive , The front personnel were friendly and helpful It is a walking distance from Sangrada Familia 
297644,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Friendly and helpful staff The room was clean and comfy bed The bathroom was good and breakfast good Good value for money Not from shops and attractions 
297645,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The interior rooms around the main lobby The curtains can t completely cover the light at night and AC flow straight over the bed is uncomfortable , Just the usual 4 star hotel friendly staff at the bar
297646,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Restricted outdoor window and drinkink water 3 water for 1 or more days Broken bath door , We stayed three days in 2 5 july walked most of the important tourism centers Sagrada Familia Place de Catalunya Ciutadella in 10 20 minutes As a result this otel is both good and slience location Resepcition personals was so friendly and helpful 
297647,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Bathroom was great However I asked the hotel receptionist for the best room in the house based on the type of room we paid for tongue in cheek of course She smiled and said of course When we arrived at the room myself and my girlfriend saw two single beds While it was not the end of the world it was a little disappointing We decided not to ask to switch rooms but others may only want a double bed in a double room so just a heads up , Lady at the restaurant was lovely Reception staff were really friendly upon arrival Bedroom was very neat and tidy and had complimentary water in the mini fridge which was very welcomed given the travelling and the heat The hotel is near the metro and all the major attractions were approximately 20 minute walking in any given direction Would recommend 
297648,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Curtains need to be able to block out the night lights our window looked inwards and anybody walking along the corridor during the night activated the corridor lights although not too bright , Plenty of storage space an ironing board the bed was very comfy Security box was big some are often too small to hold all our valuables 
297649,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We would have like to eat in the restaurant for an evening meal but the hotel did not provide that facility however there were loads of restaurants close by , Very central we could walk to all the facilities 
297650,Ayre Hotel Caspe, It was disappointing that they have the sign in the bathroom that they care about the environment and don t change towels everyday but they did anyway , Decent hotel with spacious room very comfy bed and with okay breakfast the variety is not great 
297651,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The receptionist was terrible I got sick in the middle of the night because I ate something wrong When I called the receptionist to ask them if they had an emergency kit they not only answered no they were really rude and impolite They basically said f you I was really sick so I tried to ask if there was another solution A pharmacy The answer was no no no They didn t make any effort to help me but then someone else on the reception took over and he was helpful The day after I took my breakfast which was included in the price I already payed in my room because I was still sick when checking out they charged me the breakfast I wanted to tell them it was not correct but before I could even say a word the receptionist went no no no I really had to insist before he would listen I said you can charge me the fee for taking my breakfast in my room but I am not going to pay a breakfast that ia already had payed for So yeah the receptionist are maybe stressed out but anyway I don t think that should be an excuse to treat your customers badly that was for me a bad experience , Breakfast was great and the employees in the restaurant are really nice 
297652,Ayre Hotel Caspe, I like coffee first thing in the morning No kettle in the room It will be nice to have nepresso coffee like any other hotel this days I had to get dress just to go down and get a coffee , Friendly and helpful staff
297653,Ayre Hotel Caspe, nothing really , comfortable beds clean 10 15 mins walk to Sagrada Familia we were offered an upgrade to a superior room for few more Euros which was a very good value for us mainly because of the extended 3pm checkout time these 3 hours meant a lot for us before our long flight back home 
297654,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Little bit higher price for accomodation, Location near to estacion de nord and city centre Personal on reception especially Christian who was able to help us in case of need in english 
297655,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bed ac very noisy There was a taxi strike and no upfront info or solution from hotel offered Missed the plane Hotel could have avoided that Very very poor, Pedestrian friendly city good breakfast
297656,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Hotel was modern with large rooms and friendly staff a couple of issues were sorted immediately and staff followed up to check we were happy The location was very good easy walk to great areas and less busy excellent recommendation for Dining nearby
297657,Ayre Hotel Caspe, No kettle tea making facilities in our room, Very clean and comfortable staff very helpful at all times great breakfast nice caf quiet rooms good aircon safe area 
297658,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Not very easy to get to using public transport for the first time But once you get the lay of the land it is fairly convenient If you are taking the Metro from the airport Take line 9 to Torrasa and switch to line 1 in the direction of Fondo Get off at Arc de Triomf Exit the station on the right and make a left turn You should see the bus station on your right Continue straight until you reach Carrer Caspe Hotel is on the right Should take you less than an hour , Located nearby is a supermarket howvevr it is not open on Sundays There is also a cafe nearby which is open early everyday where you have a value for money alternative to the hotel s breakfast buffet 
297659,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The nearest metro station is still a 10 minute walk Not a problem in the morning but when you ve walked all day this is a little frustrating although of course this is not the hotel s fault , Very nice modern clean 4 star hotel only 1 2 km from Sadagra Familia Rooms are very quiet good airconditioning which you can use in he Barcelona heat The bed was fine not too soft Very nice bathroom Also fine breakfast and excellent staff ordering taxis and pointing to ATMs and supermarkets was all fine 
297660,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The only niggle was that we got back to our hotel at 23 15 one eve and just wanted a drink in the bar and when we went in we were told it was closed we explained we were hotel guests but that didn t matter shame really as we had had a very long day and just wanted a drink and relax before going up to bed , This hotel is fabulous just a 10 minute walk to the metro or about 20mins to the city center The staff are all really lovely smiling and always ready to help Ramen on reception was exceptionally helpful with advise of restaurants what was on and how to get there including advice for the metro The breakfasts are really good catering for everyone s needs fresh fruit cereal speciality breads cold buffet hot buffet cava pastries and you could have eggs done anyway you wanted We would definitely recommend this hotel Thank you for a great stay in your beautiful city 
297661,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Staying in the Eixample is great away from the crowded beaten track of the Ramblas but convenient to walk to key destinations and with a myriad of small bars cafes restaurants in walking distance Taxis are cheap and public transport easy so that going further is not an issue 
297662,Ayre Hotel Caspe, on arrival our room was changed from double to twin we had to change again the next day hassle two days later we had to change again as the building next door was being renovated and some genius decided to take out is kango hammer at 8 00 am right outside our room hassle bar closed at 11 00 pm crazy people like a nightcap , the location was very good near the metro station the hotel was very clean and the staff were very nice and helpful 
297663,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The walls were pretty dirty and needed a good wash down There were black streaks and handprints dark rubbed spots all over , The bathroom was big and bright with both a shower stall and a separate tub 
297664,Ayre Hotel Caspe, No possibility to open windows One elevator broken long waiting times Rooms could use some renovation bit worn out , Staff very helpfull and friendly Breakfast very good Easy parking Luckily we had a promotion not worth the normal price
297665,Ayre Hotel Caspe, One night stay I can not judge it But I can say that they have charged me for an extra night which I and Booking com have canceled it , One night stay I can not judge it 
297666,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The location and hotel amenities in respect of sound proofing were limited and did not meet my personal requirements , Esteban Garcia the hotel s Community Manager was excellent and prompt in responding to certain problems that I experienced during my stay The hotel staff and management team are helpful professional and approachable I very much appreciated the personal responses to my questions 
297667,Ayre Hotel Caspe, clean the terras every day It is the first thing you see of the hotel, the staff gave a good advise about a tapas restaurant Also the information about bike rental was valuable
297668,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The initial bed was as hard as a rock After we were transferred to a room that had a memory foam pillowtop bed on the bed this bed was good , The Hotel is centrally located We did not like the area restaurants And had to walk a distance to find the tranditional well cooked food from Spain The Hotel breakfast buffet was delicious and had a good variety therefore inluding the breakfast with your reservation is worth it The Hotel was clean and attractive The rooms are spacious perfect size and super well orgaized for travellers to open up suitcases and unpack The staff were excellent overall polite responsive and appeared to do all they could do to satify our requests The Bathroom is awesome has a Shower has a separate Bathtub 2 sinks The shower s water pressure is great very strong the hot water does not runnout yippie so important to a traveller The Hotel itself is great except for the standard room beds The beds in standard rooms whether they are queen sized or twin sized beds are as hard as a rock Beds are one of the most important feature of a room to be ableto rest in my opinion The standard rooms have mattresses that are 8 inch thin spring coil matresses that sit on a platform base The pain that this type of rock hard mattress caused us was horrible The pain from the mattress woke us up with terrible back pain However the staff were empathic and efficienty resovled this problem by upgrading us to a room that had a king size bed with a memory foam pillowtop and the pillow top of that bed was super comfortable and made all the difference If you reserve at this Hotel just be sure to ask for a memory foam pillowtop to be on your bed and you will be happy We thank the staff especially Christan for saving us by accomodatibg us with a decent bed Thank you 
297669,Ayre Hotel Caspe, I really don t like the internet it s very slow , The stuff is always friendly and helpful Thank you for your work and your dedications Jonathan is the best 
297670,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, The hotel was quite with very good service The breakfast buffet was excellent and plentiful with an option to add eggs etc cooked to order all included in the price 
297671,Ayre Hotel Caspe, In the room they gave us first wi fi signal was very low When we pointed out that the staff immediatly proposed us to change room in order to have a better internet service So we really appreciated their availability However they could work to improve the wi fi system all around the building , The staff was very kind and polite and they quickly took care of all our needs The rooms are very comfortable and the cleanings are perfect 
297672,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Breakfast choice and quality not brilliant Noisy neighbours till early hours of morning for two nights Hotel staff were quick to sort it though and we changed rooms ,No Positive
297673,Ayre Hotel Caspe, There was no kettle in the room we had to ask for one from Reception and it comes at a 5 Euro charge With most hotels nowadays it seems pretty standard to have a kettle in the room Breakfast was okay however if it was not included in the room rate we probably would not have paid for it each day as it was pretty much always the same One night after getting in quite late we decided to grab a snack from the bar downstairs I would advise to avoid this unless absolutely necessary We ordered Patatas Braves and chicken strips it took them about 45 minutes to prepare them and when they arrived the chicken was raw Rather than wait another 45 minutes we asked for the chicken to be removed from the bill which they did after apologising The potatoes were lacklustre and not even close to the traditional tapas we d experienced at other places However if you re not after a traditional experience it ll do , The hotel is situated in a great location not too far away from the main square We found that everything was within walking distance Pla a de Catalunya is a 15 20 minute walk It is very easy to get to public transport with bus stops in the adjacent streets Estacio del Nord is a 5 minute walk straight down the road There is a Lidl just around the corner which we found very useful for lunches on the go The staff were nice and very welcoming we were glad to receive a city map upon check in They were quick to recommend places to try for traditional food and experiences There was a table soccer table that was free to use which was good fun in the evenings The room was basic but comfortable it was also a little bigger than we were expecting There was not much noise during the night even though we had a room that was facing the street All in all the hotel was what we were after not too far away from everything but quiet enough to rest after a full day of sightseeing 
297674,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The only 2 points I didn t really enjoy were the position in the city and the fact where not a full silence during night early morning , I ve really appreciated the great hospitality of the staff The clean of room and hotel is excellent 
297675,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The worst thing in the hotel is The electronic card key of the room very time before entering the room we have to active the key card that was annoying it s so sensitive when its near electronic devices very cheap quality Wii fi wasn t that fast and most of the time it was very hard to download even pictures , The location was great being close 2 metro stations 3 minute walk but in a quiet part of Barcelona so you were able to retreat back to the hotel after experiencing the hustle and bustle of Barcelona away from the big noisy crowds of tourists the hotel is located close to the Sagrada Familia around 10 15 walking and at the same walking to center of Barcelona La Rambla Old Town etc in around 15 minutes if you wish to go by taxi costs 5 7 euro max The breakfast was good Our room was very clean and comfortable bed fully functioning AC The staff were so helpful and friendly they provided us with any information that we asked about Special thanks for Mr Christian who did the reservations for the places that we want to visit specially it was Easter time and almost most popular destination were booked ahead and no tickets were available at Easter time Without his recommendations we could miss a lot of places that we want be able to visit due the sold out of tickets Another thanks for Mr Pavlo and Victor whom advises us on daily bases where to go and what to see and to do The best thing in this hotel was the hospitality of the mentioned staff and all also other staff There is a mini market opposite to the hotel with a very reasonable prices 
297676,Ayre Hotel Caspe, wifi was awful did not work almost break fast was very ordinary safety box did not work hotel is a little bit far from public transportation , room is big and clean bath roomis very good 
297677,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The area around the vent had some mold and the WiFi connection was very slow , The staff were super nice and friendly both at the cafe and reception Rooms were good size Breakfast was excellent Location was very convenient too attractions shopping and public transfer 
297678,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Nothing , The staff was superb the room was brilliantly laid out large bed ample space around the bed long desk with multiple power options bathroom with sufficient space for laying out toilet kits plus a shower and full bath The staff to say it again were brilliant we had a lost luggage issue and I had a 3 week cough and they put us in touch with local resources And a great location in the eastern Eixample near the Sagrada Familia and within walking distance of the Born Gothic and Old Town districts 
297679,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The restaurant area wasn t open in the evening , This is our second stay at this hotel so we do really like it It is difficult to give a true account using face images We asked for a quiet room so not a surprise the view was not great The wifi a little slow but not unusual when staying in any hotel The bar staff a little inattentive at times but didn t spoil the trip Location from Plaza Catalunya was great 
297680,Ayre Hotel Caspe, the safe in the room was very sensitive to open and close and we had to get reception staff to come up to the room twice to help unlock it However they were more than willing to help us , Plenty of choice at breakfast and all very fresh The restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful The reception staff were excellent and as we were trying to speak Spanish they spent time going through sentences and explaining how to say certain phrases 
297681,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Breakfast not included and very expensive Not worth it , Great location close with almost everything that a tourist needs to see Staff very helpful in recommending 
297682,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Our roo first night The hotel is a walk away from the tenet station But once we found our feet we walked most places from hotel, First night our room overlooked wooden fence Not nice felt very claustrophobic and we also asked for double bed when booked they did change our room the next night 
297683,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Free wifi was not strong enough so i used it time to time in lobby instead of the room , Breakfast was better than i expected Room is comfortable and cleaned properly the best thing is what we paid for was quite satisfactory a real value for money hotel Due to genius discounts we paid 100 Eur night 2 person including breakfast 
297684,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Great location comfortable hotel very clean and free wifi Location is spot on with plenty around you Hotel was very quiet we heard no outside noise Definitely upgrade to a superior room its worth it We had lots of complimentary toiletries bathrobes slippers coffee machine tea making facilities fridge large TV and huuuge bed We stayed for 4 nights and experienced no problems at all our room was immaculately cleaned every day with fresh ironed sheets and any used toiletries were replaced The staff at reception were very happy and helpful especially the lady who speaks good English cant remember her name Overall we wouldn t hesitate in recomending this hotel and returning here ourselves 
297685,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Breakfast was alittle expensive for what there was to offer , The staff were very attentive and friendly Prior to check in they answered all my queries and assisted well with an early check in Great location just the right amount of distance from the center of Barcelona yet still be within reachable distance of the main attractions The rooms were sizable and beds were comfortable I enjoy the extra pillow that was provided as i find hotel pillows alittle too puffy and difficult to sleep on Room was also very clean 
297686,Ayre Hotel Caspe, On the last hours dissapear wifi It wasn t hair conditioner Just one teeth brush for two persons , Location very good It was included slippers bath gown minibar was included and other Breakfast was wonderfull Personal was very pleasure and friendly
297687,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The room has not windows and the air was kind of smelly when we got there Room furniture is really old and bathroom door was closing really hard Rock hard pillows were annoying, Location Cleanliness Free water in the mini bar
297688,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The location of the hotel was good for the sagrada familia but the area itself wasn t the nicest and was quite a way away from the action at la rambla el born passeig de gracia Though the breakfasts were decent enough the restaurant of this hotel for an evening meal was definitely not 4 standard You are likely to want to eat out and about anyway but if there are any nights you want the convenience of eating at the hotel it s going to be basic food like frozen pizza though admittedly it is cheap , The room was lovely and the hotel was smart the staff were friendly and helpful The hotel was about 5 blocks away from la sagrada familia and about 3 blocks in the other direction to the arc de triomf 
297689,Ayre Hotel Caspe, lack of coffee machine in the room, Clean wide room bathroom with shower cabinet very nice staff good location to many touristic places Nearby shops for clothes and food

297693,Ayre Hotel Caspe, no sleepers and no coffee in room service , Very quiet rooms clean private Personal was very helpful with everything we needed The location is great for a vacation close to the center but not in the middle of chaos and noise its about 37euro from airport to hotel by taxi 
297694,Ayre Hotel Caspe, I had to pay touristic tax when i left the hotel that i wasn t informed in any moment during my time there by the staff You should review your receipt properly before you live Tv at room wasn t working , The ubication is very good Good cleanliness
297695,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bed linens in our room were very clean but there are some small holes resulting from laundering use Maybe there should be some regular efforts to replace worn linens , I like the location in a quiet residential area but within easy walking to many sights and metro stations Staff was very helpful and knowledgeable 
297696,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Staff was really helpful and they gave us best they could considering our request Also they gave us superior room without extra charge which was really nice 
297697,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The location was a little far out from the centre, The hotel was modern and great The staff couldn t have been friendlier and more accommodating I would return if I come back to Barcelona
297698,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Something should be done to improve the whole impression of the hotel particularly in the lobby More details like big plants mirrors etc What is even more important is to have someone at the front door of the hotel to help guests with bags when they come and leave the hotel , Room was nice lot of space clean Bathroom was clean 
297699,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We faced a problem withe A C but it was solved soon after we address it , The staff are amazing The location is great The hotel is practical and modern
297700,Ayre Hotel Caspe, WIFI performance in the evening can be poor or even very poor Insufficient noise insulation among the rooms If people next door decide to be noisy you will hear it , Nice furniture convenient location
297701,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Nothing stands out that would need to be improved , Attitude of staff was excellent Position is good Clean bright well maintained Hotel Breakfast was very good lots of choice 
297702,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Wifi was useless Thin walls could hear people talking etc in the early hours of the morning waking us up Stiff beds weren t the best Asked for a double bed was given 2 singles but they did offer to change rooms the next day , Very nice modern feel hotel close to Arc De Triomf and metro stations 10 15 minutes on the metro to the beach Las Ramblas and Sagrada Familia is a 10 15 minute walk Friendly staff didn t have the breakfast so cannot comment on that Although a nice bakery is round the corner Would stay again 
297703,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Very quiet rooms clean private Personnel was very helpful with everything we needed We only had breakfast once during our 7 days stay but it was very good they even served mimosas with cava The location is great for a vacation close to the center but not in the middle of chaos and noise Plenty of restaurants and patisserias nearby
297704,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The final cost was about 10 more than the price given on the website which wasn t expected , Everything was fine and as I d expect from a hotel of this classification 
297705,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Food was cold Breakfast has few options but then it is subjective Bed was moving in the room if you sat and lean of the head board quite uncomfortable, Good location easy to get to most places with Metro lines Helpful staff Neat rooms Good value for money
297706,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The welcome at reception was cold and aloof The room though nicely designed and spacious had no bath and the bed was small , The hotel was in a convenient and reasonably quiet location The bar was excellent value staff friendly and attentive Breakfast also great value 
297707,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bath seems to be quite cheap and not perfectly clean I d expect more of a 4 stars hotel , Good location very friendly staff fast and reliable WIFI 
297708,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Could be bit closer to city centre but we did not need to use public transport at all , Friendly reception and clean rooms Also they give bath rope and everything Very big and comfy bed as well 
297709,Ayre Hotel Caspe, It was a little bit noisy inside may be because the wall was thin The view from our room window was not so pretty and slightly dark , The staff member at the reception was very friendly The location was good as it was close to the bus station 
297710,Ayre Hotel Caspe, I didnt like the fact that this Hotel offered no kettle or coffee and Tea service we phoned down to ask about this and was told only the 7th floor has this So we had to pay 5 euros to have a kettle in the room Also we were staying on the 6th floor and for 3 nights out of the 4 we could smell smoking in the corridoors we phoned down one morning and told this to reception staff which they said they were very sorry and would get one of the cleaning staff to check it out so for these reasons I would not return to this hotel , It was very clean and tidy and reception staff were very friendly 
297711,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Nothing I recommend , Good breakfast has more than what we expected from continental description E g hot eggs and sausages bacon or omelette made to order which was not expected Rooms lovely and comfy bed Great shower and the staff all charming 
297712,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Unfortunately some other noisy guests returned at 0130 and made sure everyone heard them , Comfortable room very friendly and helpful staff Within reasonable walking distance of the city centre and the Sagrada Familia 
297713,Ayre Hotel Caspe, No tea coffee facilities, The hotel was exactly how it looked in the pictures The bedroom was very spacious clean and a nice bathroom with two showers There is free water in the mini bar but no tea coffee facilities but I think this is the case in most hotels in Barcelona The room we had didnt have any view just looked out onto the street but we were out early in the morning and in late at night so it was ideal for our needs Some hotels in the centre and especially la Rambla have small balconies overlooking the street and it would be nice to sit in the evening with a drink and people watch The location of this hotel is about a 15 min walk from the centre and sometimes in the evening on our way back to the hotel after a long day siteseeing we wished it was closer But we enjoy walking so it didnt bother us too much Overall a good choice hotel for us 
297714,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Having to leave , Wonderful welcome Friedly reception staff Lovely room Super comfortable bed Easy walking distance to city centre A clean bright elegant hotel 
297715,Ayre Hotel Caspe, absolutely nothing , I liked the silence of the room No traffic noise This is for Barcelona extraordinair for a hotel of this class And the situation of the hotel was for me just fantastic 
297716,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The room needed a good cleaning superficial daily cleaning is fine but when there is visible dirt in the corners as an example then it needs a good clean This is not a staff issue but a staff training issue Also two people in the room need more than one device internet connection To limit it to one especially when there are two people in the room or even if only one is simply insufficient and the first time in all my travels I have encountered this Yes it can be resolved by paying a premium fee for more devices but that is hardly responsive into today s wired global world , The hotel was fine room quiet staff responsive and location good Subject to my comment about what needs to be improved I would recommend it 
297717,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Even a highly critical person couldn t fault this hotel All was great, Rooms perfect Staff very friendly and beds very comfortable Buffet breakfast was amazing The hotel was very clean and we would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Barcelona Very central 
297718,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Everything was fine Barcelona accommodation seems relatively expensive in general Ayre Hotel Aspe was relatively good value considering location , Very helpful and friendly staff who seemed to be able to speak several languages Having a car it was good to have access to a secure car park although it does cost extra unless you have a superior room A good breakfast 13 euro per person A quiet room for sleeping 
297719,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Breakfast is not worth the money but there is a nice bakery nearby , Good location not far from 2 metro stations Area is more residential than touristy 
297720,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, I enjoyed my stay at Arye Hotel Caspe The lobby check in area was modern and well kept the room bathroom was very spacious and clean My check in was a little slow but overall staff was helpful answering questions It s about a 10min walk to passig de gracia and a little further to the catalunya station It was a safe neighborhood to walk around at night Many busses picked up a block away I would stay there again 
297721,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The location of the Metro stations near the hotel could have been highlighted in the hotel s publicity , The staff were extremely helpful in providing directions to sites we wished to visit Maps were provided 
297722,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Did not eat any food but went to the bar on two occasions and the bar staff were fantastic especially the gentleman who had a great rapport wit myself and my girlfriend Reception staff were also super friendly and polite and the room was perfect for us Kindest regards Peter

297725,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Wifi was v weak except in lobby breakfast was 13 euro pricy compared w nearby competition , Staff were v helpful recommended restaurants called us taxis helped carry baggage great breakfast good english modern comfy quiet street in big busy Barcelona 
297726,Ayre Hotel Caspe, All was brilliant apart from the Wi fi it was sporadic, Wonderful breakfast fabulous staff comfortable hotel in a great location Will definitely stay again

297728,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Staff were incredibly helpful and good at their jobs Bed was terrific Breakfast was a highlight so many choices and I have a restricted diet due to health the choices meant that I had a great breakfast and the staff were very helpful We loved our stay and will definitely go back

297731,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We had an interior room which had no outside facing window it had an interior facing window which i found a little depressing having no daylight This was room 501 Also it was a bit of a trek to the main places of interest , the staff where very helpful and the rooms comfortable
297732,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Nothing to be honest I would go back there without hesitation , Good location only 10 mins walk to La Rambla and the Sagrada Familia Hotel very clean and rooms very comfortable Room serviced daily and friendly and helpful staff Excellent value for money bearing in mind the location 
297733,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Really enjoyed my stay here Great location friendly helpful staff and good value for money Pay no attention to precious people complaining about unimportant things like having problems with wifi speed It s all nonsense Would highly recommend this hotel 
297734,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Can not think of any, The staff were very friendly and helpful always ready to serve with a smile I didn t eat the breakfast but it did look very good in the restaurant The hotel was always very clean 
297735,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Nothing, The staff members were very helpful and friendly The food in the restaurant and bar was good and well priced Our room was a nice size modern and very comfortable Housekeeping did a great job of keeping our room clean and tidy The location was a short distance from the heart of Barcelona but we really liked being in a quieter part of the city 
297736,Ayre Hotel Caspe, You can not open the window in the rooms and the bathrooom s door is like a curtain you can t close it I hate that , Its close to everything on foot Breakfast is fine They have a glutenfree and sugarfree special food if you need There is fridge in the room Air conditioner s location is good in the room Gym is good 
297737,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Only stayed one night was put in a small room with windows that faced the atrium and hallways where others walked No outside view Strange light , Good location not the center Fair price Excellent staff super easy check in check out Held bags after check out without a problem 
297738,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Our room s window was facing the inside of the building There s one such room on every floor check whether you can have a better one we couldn t as the place was fully booked , Close to all main sights without being in a noisy extra crowded area Good value for money 
297739,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Our price did not include breakfast which we were told would cost 13 euros per head each day ouch We thought we wouldn t fork out for that as it was too hot for a buffet anyway Instead we recommend trying some of the Baracafe s you will pass if walking towards the Arc de Triomf they sell incredibly tasty pastries for 1 2 euros each which will keep you going well through the day There is also a Lidl 5 minutes down the road and enough room in your mini fridge to keep some goodies But if you ve got the money treat yourself the standard of everything else is that good I m sure the breakfast would be great , We booked this about a month in advance of our mid July trip at a surprisingly good price considering we are both uni students and can t afford anything swish Having stayed in a few more expensive hotels before we weren t expecting a grand room when we arrived something clean and small When we walked in we couldn t believe our luck The room was very spacious with plenty of storage space a not so mini mini fridge and a large flatscreen TV with a large bathroom containing not one but two showers one of which was a walk in Things just got better from there you re 20 minutes walk from La Rambla 5 minutes walk to the Arc de Triomf and its metro station 20 minutes to the Gothic Quarter and 30 40 minutes from the beach depending on temperature Amazing The room was always cleaned exceptionally well with little movement of your belongings so you didn t feel your personal space had been invaded By the third day it felt like home A great place to stay with friendly staff and lovely spacious rooms Recommend 100 
297740,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Sound insulation between rooms I can hear people when they walk in the room next to us or when they talk in the hall but it didn t disturb our sleep , Confortable bed nice location rooms are equipped with both bathtub and showers 
297741,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Blocked shower drain said we would have a terrace over looking the city Just a glass window no terrace overlooking people s apartments
297742,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Definitely NOT a 4 star Hotel despite managements protestations to the contrary Over priced for what you get NOT a great location a solid 20 minute walk to the centre of town the majority of attractions NO TEA COFFEE facilities provided in room When we requested these it took several days for them to arrive WIRELESS was so SLOW we gave up trying to use it Initial room we were allocated was EXTREMELY NOISY we could clearly hear when people in the next room used the toilet had sex etc street traffic noise was bad Staff were helpful in moving us to another room but this was still VERY NOISY Hotel management claims rooms are sound proofed but this was certainly not our experience Lots of young exchange students staying at the hotel contributed to a rather noisy environment ,No Positive
297743,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bed lacked any kind of pillow top cushion that we found in our other hotels around Spain , Marc at the front desk was very helpful directing us to points of interest He was also very helpful with parking 
297744,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bathtube wasn t working The breakfast could be less expensive or with a special rate for online booking , Confortable room Breakfast 13 euros 
297745,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The rental bike broke when I was ridding it and it took me hours to get back to the hotel walking with the bike it was bad luck I guess, They have gluten free breads and parking garage is very convenient and easy to park They also have rental bikes which is also super however mine resulted broken but for that reason they reimburse me the rental for the bike which was nice 
297746,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bed was really hard Might as well have slept on the floor I didn t have a decent nights sleep in the 5 nights that I stayed there The headboard and pillow was a mismatch too and made sitting up watching TV really uncomfortable Although what we had tasted nice there isn t a lot of choice for dinner in the hotel restaurant , The location was good 5 10 minute walk to Tetuan Metro station and probably a 10 15 minute walk to Arc de Triomf The breakfast had lots of choice however you would have to get down there early One day we went down around 8 45 and noticed things weren t being restocked for example the Greek yoghurt eggs and bacon Hotel was clean Staff were friendly and helpful 
297747,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, THE HOTEL WAS ONLY 15 MINS WALK TO CENTRE OF CITY AND THE Sagra Familia Astaff member Marcus deserves the highest acclaimation for his high level of customer service at reception 
297748,Ayre Hotel Caspe, It would have been an added bonus to have had a sun terrace and a dipping pool as the weather was so hot Tea making facilities would have been nice too but then we are British , Great friendly and helpful staff extremely clean good central location 
297749,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bed was kind of hard for my back Did not meet my request upon booking for extra sets of towels until I requested them upon arrival Also iron and iron board not available in the room unless you request them No coffee maker and coffee or tea in the room When we checked in noticed the two ladies chatting while checking us in which was annoying because we traveled for 14 hours and needed some rest so just thinking that they should have asked us how was our flight and expedited our check in process sooner , The buffet breakfast except same kind of food is served each morning The front desk staff are so helpful every time we need a taxi to go to the city center Also helped me with their lobby computer which had a connection problem night before our departure but was resolved right away 
297750,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We both found the beds extremely uncomfortable The shuttle service is not complimentary as it might sugges on the website You have to pay cash to the driver before you leave the airport You cannot choose the time you want to be picked up when you go back to the airport We had a 5pm flight and they wanted to pick us up at 11 30 It took the Receptionist a couple of phone calls to get them to change pick up to 2pm And still we had to go to each hotel to pick up people for an hour before arriving at the airport Take a taxi more direct less wasted time for only a couple of more , Friendly staff
297751,Ayre Hotel Caspe, 4 Star on assessment day but not in reality Here s the list 1 Mould in shower bathroom resembled student flat and splash marks plus water swelling damage on bathroom door 2 Missing top to plug sink lever 3 Room service hit and miss dirty glasses not removed no soap left on one occasion sticky glass marks not wiped really hot sticky weather and no clean sheets for a 4 night stay 4 Advertised a mini bar which consisted of 4 bottles of water 5 Crooked draw 6 Advertised a Airport Shuttle service for anadditional cost this did not exist 7 Breakfast no fresh orange juice option just concentrated option eggs tastelss 8 Advertised as sound proof rooms not the case as difficulties sleeping with singing from other guests a constant swoosh sound every 10 minutes and then a ridicously loud radio communication to the room service that made any lie in impossible despite Do Not Disturb sign 9 Room service knocking at 9am to clean 11 After 10 minutes of viewing TV kept pixalating and it would only sort itself out if switched off and on again however this would be repeated every 10 minutes and was realy annoying 12 Uncomfortable beds, Helpful and well intentioned staff
297752,Ayre Hotel Caspe, 1 We checked in at night and they said the room was not available they had overbooked which was very disappointing as we have booked months in advance We had to sleep in a small bed rather than the two singles which we have requested earlier 2 The receptionist told us they will change us to the single rooms the next morning but we went and it was STILL not ready so we kept our luggage and decided to go out 3 Rather than upgrading us to a better room this is what we got What a shame 4 The breakfast was horrible Not many options and when we ordered outside the menu it took forever and wasn t even cooked well eggs so we only tried it once and went out to cafe s the other days during out stay 5 The cleaning lady walked in our room while we were asleep in the morning despite the do not disturb sign outside the door 6 The cleaning ladies were loud and we could hear them chatting at the hall way all morning 7 The blankets were not comfortable at all it felt like a bed sheet rather than an actuall blanket 8 The hotel didn t provide good toiletries not even a conditioner 9 We asked for a taxi at the reception and they told us they won t be able to order one to the hotel so go look for one on the road Overall we had bad experience at this hotel and its a shame its called a four star hotel because clearly it doesn t live it up Definitely not coming back nor recommending it to anyone If the service was better I would have enjoyed my stay better despite the lack discomfort of their facilities , The only positive thing I can say about the hotel is its location 
297753,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The location is not as central as I had hoped The hotel was not a 15 min walk from the main locations such as plaza Catalunya La Rambla the beach etc The neighbourhood wasn t clean bad smell all over the area , Clean and spacious rooms Good service at the hotel Staff helpful 
297754,Ayre Hotel Caspe, I was unable to connect to the wi fi , We stayed just 2 nights in the hotel but it was quite clean close to metro station by walking just 900mt to Sagra da Famillia hotel was located in a silent area especially at nights it was peaceful also they put 4 small bottle of water in the minibar free thanks a lot
297755,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We didn t have a key to our room for 3 days and we had to ask someone to open the door for us The Wi Fi did not work one evening for a few hours , The room was very comfortable and clean The staff has good English and was very nice 
297756,Ayre Hotel Caspe, This is a 3 star hotel not a 4 star one Ac was not working well in the room Complained couple of times but it was not fixed Internet was not working during the two days while there Overall it was not s great choice , Staff were kind Location is good 
297757,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Not much They had an issue with the room card system which lasted for 1 day they should have fixed that earlier However they were helping you enter the room every time Slow internet, Convenient parking pretty decent and comfortable room very clean Helpful personnel They let us checkout late and leave the car parked for extra hours 
297758,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The wifi signal is awful you re better off using 3G The breakfast buffet was poor No a lot of options at all Overall value for money not great ,No Positive
297759,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Noise cancellation between rooms can be better I heard people talking in the next room and laughing around midnights but I am an easy sleeper so I didn t mind that much I guess other s could complain about it , Good wifi connection the double bed was very comfortable location is great very close to public transports Very helpful and smiling staff at the reception all in good order 
297760,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bed a little bit hard , We spent 4 nights in this hotel and overall we have been pleased with our choice Of course the location is its first advantage walking distance to Tetuan metro station and also walking distance to Parc de la Ciutadella Cleanliness is over average they pass every day to check the room The breakfast is quite good it offers everything you d like to eat in the morning My son loved the pastry The staff is nice and helpful WiFi is working well We were not that lucky with the room position Some of the rooms have the windows oriented toward an inner courtyard and the view is not that interesting In compensation that type of room is quiet and your kids will sleep well 
297761,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bathroom had a sliding door rather than a proper closing door The room did not have any external windows , Very helpful and friendly staff Good central location for sightseeing as well as metro stations being a 5 minute walk away 
297762,Ayre Hotel Caspe, At the breakfast there is a cord that is blocking people from entering the area It is very unwelcoming seems like at a club Toilet paper missing for 1 day Sunblock curtains are not very preventing sun from emtering the room at 6 00 am, Good location and welcomimg good staff
297763,Ayre Hotel Caspe, There were some room card issues they were deactivated after only a couple of days and we had to go to the reception and redo them Also one night around 4 AM someone entered our room without knowing that we re inside It was quickly resolved by the reception office The city tax is not included and has to be paid at the checkout , Staff was great very friendly and helpful Rooms very clean and roomy Quiet area and quite good location close to Sagrada Familia and to the Tetuan Arc de Triomf metro station 
297764,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We could hear the phone ringing at the room next door which was the wake up alarm at 6 30am even with earplugs you could hear it , The room is quite comfortable and spacious The bathroom has a shower and a bathtub The reception at thr lobby was efficient and nice
297765,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Everything especially the cleaning and bar staff as they enhanced our stay by making us feel more welcome by always smiling and having conversations with us 
297766,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Nothing could be better Thanks to the staff for all important help , Best were the staff after that the breakfast Thanks for a very good stay we recommend the hotel
297767,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The lights sometimes went out in the room but did come back on again quickly The bar shutting at 11pm is a bit early I thought but then it was quiet Had a lovely cocktail from the bar The bed was a little hard and there was a little noise from the road and the room next door , Size of the room was very good Had two showers in the double room The staff were very accommodating 
297768,Ayre Hotel Caspe, its not a 4 star hotel in any way the were no facilities no tea or coffee machine no english tv channels and so on, quiet area nice staff pretty good noise isolation
297769,Ayre Hotel Caspe, This is very minor guests need to bring their own soaps The hotel soap you get one per day is tiny and made of glycerine you wash your hands four or five times and it s gone The shower gel doesn t lather well , We got everything we care about a clean and quiet room a comfortable bed and a great location We walked everywhere to the Old Town to Barceloneta to the Guad sites 
297770,Ayre Hotel Caspe, I would have liked tea making facilities in my room and more English channels on the tv , Thank you for the gluten free options at breakfast the room was perfect and the bathroom was very clean with a great shower 
297771,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Nothing really except the wifi was a bit weak in my room I had to go into the bathroom to get a signal , Very friendly and welcoming hotel staff Excellent breakfast too and good location 
297772,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Very clean nice breakfast A great place to stay when you want to find a great hotel for reasonable price Located near arc de triomf and metro station 
297773,Ayre Hotel Caspe, My room faced an inner courtyard and I would have liked to face out but I was on a budget , The staff were excellent and very friendly I really appreciated that they printed out my voucher for an attraction the next day 
297774,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, The staff was really kind and helpful The room was super clean The breakfast was great everything was fresh and available even close to the end of breakfast time Metro is close
297775,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Sound insulation between rooms and the corridor door isn t great Light sleepers might want to bring ear plugs and if sharing a room you will need to be on familiar terms with your room mate as the sound insulation between the bedroom and bathroom is very poor , Good location with a nice range of cafes bars and restaurants nearby Rooms were clean and the complimentary bottled water was a nice touch 
297776,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Air con not the best Breakfast expensive and little choice Bit further from the Ramblas than I expected No view, Staff really friendly Large clean room Bright and modern
297777,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Shower waste slow to empty Bar lacking ambience in the evening, Express breakfast at 4 very good Staff really helpful friendly 3pm late checkout was really useful Comfortable bed nice bathrobes showergel shampoos etc all good 
297778,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The room maintenance staff barged into the room at 5 00 pm on the same day after my check in at 12 30 pm Fail to understand the need for them to come in at that time that too without knocking on the door , helpful nature of the reception staff
297779,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Air conditioning in the room wasn t good We had a room with no windows so was very hot, Staff were very friendly we travelled without our converter plugs the hotel were very quick to help 
297780,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Even though the pickpocket attempt failed it was not fun , The staff was particularly helpful re any question we asked The were sure to alert us to the possibility of pick pockets in Barcelona and the various ways they go about it That was great since on the morning of the second day a pick pocket attempt was made on me Since I had been well informed the attempt failed The staff s advice was priceless 
297781,Ayre Hotel Caspe, I would have liked tea and coffee in the room , Staff were very friendly and helpful bathroom and room were lovely and clean and the room was a good size Breakfast was nice and had a varied choice of items available We got 4 bottles of water for free in the room also The gym room was also good with a row machine treadmill weights and bikes 
297782,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, To be honest I don t remember much This was the first lodging in a 2 week trip Nothing was horrible or I d remember nor do I recall anything noteworthy that was great I slept well 
297783,Ayre Hotel Caspe, No kettle in rooms and no slipper in bathrooms , Everything is Perfect Great Location good facilities excellent breakfast kind and helpful staffs big rooms and nice design Fast Wifi and reasonable price 
297784,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The room was a little small for the cost but had everything needed a very comfortable bed and a nice bathroom The shower was good but the drain was partially blocked so would overflow after more than a minute or 2 , Location was about 10 15 min walk from Placa de Catalunya so was easy to get around Staff were very friendly and helpful Wifi speed was good Bed was comfortable and there were 2 complimentary bottles of water per day left in the mini fridge Free use of reception PC for printing documents too 
297785,Ayre Hotel Caspe, There was a dirty mark on the sheet from the day I checked in and no change for 3 nights There is no sign of changing sheet request in the room It s very inconvenient Talked to the reception when I checked out I was told that I should have talked to the reception directly if I wanted to change the sheet because the hotel normally change the sheet every 3 days This was something very different with other 4 stars hotels , Not very special
297786,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The Wifi did not work at all it is free but it doesn t work The bathroom was a bit primitive there was no tub and no shower tub You would just shower on the floor and make a mess but the personnel would clean it every day The walls were a bit thin you could hear noise coming from outside the room Overall I wouldn t rate this hotel as a 4 star hotel but more like a 3 star hotel , 15 20 minutes walk to Plaza Catalunya 15 minutes walk to Sagrada Familia 
297787,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Perhaps a kettle in the room so you can make a drink , Location was good It was a 15 minute walk to the Plaza de Cataluyna which is a good central location in Barcelona The very popular street Las Ramblas connects to Plaza de Cataluyna so if you walk from the hotel you could get to the gothic quarter in about 25 30mins If you don t fancy walking you could get the metro The nearest metro station to the hotel is Tetuan which is a 6 minute walk You can buy a T 10 card which gives you ten metro journeys for 10 Euros Great price To get to the gothic quarter via the metro it takes about 15 mins Another good neighbourhood is La Ribera which is a 15 minute walk from the hotel EL Born is a place lots of bars and lots of restaurants So therefore I feel the location of the hotel is very good I also liked how quick the check in was no fussing at all The hotel room was a good size and the shower is excellent I feel that this hotel is a good choice All staff were also very pleasant and friendly 
297788,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Lack of swimming pool Had to re enter wifi code after short period of inactivity , Location excellent close to Sagrada Familia and metro station but quiet Bed was very big and comfortable 2 showers Staff very helpful Free wifi 
297789,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Only the wifi have problems sometimes, All is perfect the staff the rooms is very clean and the location is very good I was 4 years ago This year And i think that i well come back to this hotel
297790,Ayre Hotel Caspe, No remote control for TV and only BBC World News in English , Hotel quiet and very clean Everything to hand including quick breakfast at the bar hot food cooked to order and delicious mohitos Bedroom and bathroom beautiful All staff very helpful and friendly Gym room looked great but after a full day of touristic experiences we were too tired to use it Reception staff recommended a really nice restaurant on the way into town called Mussol 19 Great atmosphere and lovely food 
297791,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Noise travels easily between rooms It needs more noise insulation They need tea making facilities to be available for all rooms Not just when you pay 23 euros more per room , The bed was comfortable The room very clean 
297792,Ayre Hotel Caspe, One minus WiFi practically does not work It is a shame because no other cons can be presented, Perfect location New extremely clean hotel Highly recommended
297793,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Unfortunately our room was rather dark as the window was not on the street but on the inside of the hotel A very minor issue as we only spent the night in the hotel but it would have been nice to have some sun in the morning , Perfect location in a lovely and quiet area very close to the metro station Friendly staff Comfortable and cozy room Superb bathroom Free wi fi 
297794,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Hotel is a little far from the centre The cleaning lady starts at 9 00 because we were on holiday it was not really nice to hear the noise coming from the hall , The rooms are big enough the staff are friendly 
297795,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Breakfast was a good continental standard although any cooked extras you wanted had to be ordered , Very clean and rooms serviced promptly daily Good location near tetuan metro station and most places were in east walking distance Would definitely return 
297796,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We arrived very late and reccomendation to go to local tapas bar Dune for some late Tapas was disappointing Expensive and poor quality , Large airy room Quiet
297797,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Room looked onto public courtyard curtains had to be closed constantly Kettle for tea and coffee would have been appreciated, Comfortable clean room friendly staff
297798,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Room service was very slow although they did apologise without being confronted and forgo the drinks bill as a result The cafe facilities were poor the menu was limited to light snacks and had no restaurant that can be accessed at night only a light menu was offered Please note I sent a review just before this that was meant for the Hotel Luz in Castellano which was excellent I now send this one to replace it sorry for the mistake , Reception staff helpful hotel in a central position in the city Comfortable room 
297799,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Cleanliness bathroom was dirty when I arrived a lot of hair on the floor Despite at the highest floor room was noisy and overheated air conditioning was not working properly and despite the window was large it was possible to open only a teeny tiny part, Staff very friendly location okish no central though Room well sized
297800,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The pillows were small and extremely hard and uncomfortable Breakfast was a limited choice because many items had run out by 09 00 although the breakfast time was until 11 00 am When we asked for certain items we were told they were finished bread being one of them , Staff were very helpful and friendly Bar restaurant had some good dishes and excellent value menu of the day 
297801,Ayre Hotel Caspe, There aren t many restaurants and bars nearby although it s only a relatively short walk to La Ramblas and the centre of Barcelona The tables at the buffet breakfast were a little slow in being cleared up by the staff so clean cutlery was in short supply on the morning of our breakfast Overall though I found this hotel excellent, The hotel is located on a quiet street so it s ideal for light sleepers It s only a fifteen minute walk to La Ramblas The facilities are excellent and the room had extra pillows in the wardrobe The staff were all very friendly and offered free maps at reception The buffet breakfast has a great selection although a bit pricey at 13 so it would not be good value if you only took a light breakfast 
297802,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Early March the room was overheated all heaters were off and there was neither an outside window nor airco Almost too hot too sleep kind of heatwave feeling Curtains were white and thin too much light in room from hotel at night Breakfast was poor and became worse every day of our stay never muesli low quality tea wrotten fruits lack of fresh fruit unhelpful staff , beds were excellent no noise friendly staff at desk Centre of Madrid withing walking distance Room was ok good lighting two chairs 
297803,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, It is a really nice hotel Close to the metro and sights so you can walk as well room was comfy and clean and breakfast really good It was my bday and staff left me a present of cake and prosecco in the room which made it even more special We had great time 
297804,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Pillows could be comfier Toiletries should be improved , Location is perfect 2 metro stations available close to the hotel Receptionist are very helpful and friendly Breakfast is good Rooms are cozy and clean 
297805,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Would have liked a kettle to make coffee in room , Excellent reception desk and Maid service Very helpful informative and professional and pleasant 
297806,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Too far from city centre Good 30 min walk to other attractions, In a quiet area very near basilica about 10 min walk from hotel Rooms and breakfast great
297807,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bed was a bit uncomfortable, It was so central and easy to get to places The room was fabulous and the shower was amazing it was massive Loved the hotel
297808,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Limited cafe evening menu Limited UK satellite service , Helpful staff good service spacious good parking facilities Pleasant caf open long hours
297809,Ayre Hotel Caspe, DINNER A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING , STAFF WERE GREAT LOVELY CLEAN BIG ROOMS VERY GOOD LOCATION EVERYTHING WAS IN WALKING DISTANCE GREAT BREAKFAST 
297810,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We didn t order brekfast because as for me it was overpriced more than 10 EUR per person per night , The location is very good close to the Sagrada Familia and the Parc de la Ciutadella but the street where the hotel is located is rather quiet A king size bed in the superior room was comfortable and there were both shower and bath in the bathroom I also appreciated free water in the mini bar and an iron in the cupboard such a small things can make your life more comfortable 
297811,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Poor quality bathroom amenities and a bad smell of mould or damp from the shower upon entering room which can be mitigated by keeping bathroom door shut and AC on, Well designed room comfy bed good housekeeping services away from tourist hoardes but near Tetuan metro and bus stop Plentiful cabs available too so good location
297812,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Quite costly for what you get Breakfast not worth 13 euros Plenty of cafes nearby though , Easy to get to and from if you like a walk Staff very friendly and helpful 
297813,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Bed was too firm for my taste location is further of a walk than what I hoped for to from the metro but taxis are rather cheap, The staff was really friendly and helpful rooms are spacious and the wifi fast and free
297814,Ayre Hotel Caspe, district and neighborhood is not central Barcelona , Staff very kind breakfast not included during our booking very good and full of all kind of food Rooms are clean and lovely Very quiet at night Prices are quite high but we were lucky to find a very good offer 
297815,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The breakfast is expensive And they did not provide any water heater in the room , The room is very nice with spacious bath room They even provide the baby cot for my baby which was nice But bear in mind the distance was not very close to metro station 300m from Tetuan station and around 500m from Arc de Triomph station 
297816,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The key card to access the room was ridiculously inefficient even after changing it Definitely a problem with the system on the door Took us several minutes just to enter the room very annoying , Good location near metro station nice room staff very friendly
297817,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The tiles in the shower had been painted over and it was peeling extensively which looked horrible There was also a shower over the bath which was up to the standard of the rest of the room , The room was really nice the staff very helpful and the location was great 
297818,Ayre Hotel Caspe, 1 There was a menu del dia which looked as though it was very good value for money but it was only served during the day and not in the evenings 2 It would have been nice to have had a kettle in the room to make tea , The reception staff were very friendly and helpful as were the waiting staff in the breakfast room each morning my wife asked for gluten free bread and it was obtained very quickly Our room was very spacious and well laid out and was spotlessly clean 
297819,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Noisy sound from the neighboring rooms are heard including their alarm clock Distance from the city center subway station is a 5 minutes walk The tv only has 2 English channels and both are about stocks Other channels are all in Spanish or Catalonian , Close to the central bus terminal of Barcelona estadio del nord Many food places in the neighourhood which are cheaper than in the city center Sagrada familia is about 10 15 minutes walk away from the hotel 
297820,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Breakfast Not worth the asking price selection of cereals poor and items seemed to run out half way through the advertised times of breakfast Hot dishes not readily available and had to be asked for We chose scrambled eggs which were overcooked and dry You can obtain simple breakfasts at many local cafes within a few metres for a quarter of the hotel s asking price , Location within walking distance of the centre of Barcelona Underground parking facility Very helpful and polite reception staff Bright airy bedrooms 
297821,Ayre Hotel Caspe, There was no external window in the room we had a window which faced into an internal courtyard but this was overlooked by corridors leading up to the rooms so we had to keep the curtains closed , The hotel was clean and excellent value for money We had a walk in shower and a bath in the room which was most unexpected Beds were comfortable and there was plenty of storage space 
297822,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We booked a room with double bed two months in advance On the arrival we were offered a choice of two beds put together a room for clients with disabilities or to pay for upgrade till room with king size bed What was the point to book it in advance , Was clean and quiet
297823,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The hot water in the restaurant was not quite hot enough but the staff got some that was from the kitchen Minor details, The reception staff were fantastic and could nothave been more helpful 
297824,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, This hotel was very accommodating Upon arrival they offered us two different rooms one with a window facing the street and another one with a window facing the inside of the hotel which was very nice Since we went for New Years the desk helped us plan for the night with the traditional grapes and cava The room was very clean but my favorite was the bathroom We had a standup shower and a bath shower combo all in one bathroom The desk also helped us book a flamenco show hop on hop off bus and cab back to the airport Overall I would definitely return for the generosity of the staff 
297825,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Bed not comfortable Internet you have to get login info from the desk every day if you have more than two devices , Its location staff and cleaning service 
297826,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Cleaners started quite early in the morning so there was a bit of noise but that cant be avoided, Location is within walking distance to many attractions and theres a metro stop very close to hotel Staff were very friendly and gave us advice on arrival Hotel is very modern and clean
297827,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Liked Everything about the hotel it was our first time in Barcelona the hotel staff were really helpful room was modern and very clean would highly recommend 
297828,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, The Reception staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly The rooms and facilities were very clean comfortable and spacious Good location for a quiet night and access to the Familia Sagrada basilica parks and monuments 
297829,Ayre Hotel Caspe, No kettle first hotel that I have stayed in for many years that did not have a kettle for making tea or coffee Not sure if this is standard in Barcelona , Hotel was great the room was available to us from around 11 00 am which was great Location quite good easy to walk to most things 
297830,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Changing the room was no problem as in the room next to us was a family with a baby and we didn t wanted to be woken up in the morning We didn t have breakfast so can t say anything about that The rooms not on the end of the floor are a little bit bigger Nice solution for the bath to have a bath tub and a shower the same time 2 Metro stations close to the hotel 
297831,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The shower was one of those temperamental ones you can never tweak to quite the right temperature wifi wasn t good enough to have a Google Hangout with, Really friendly and helpful staff smart rooms and lobby
297832,Ayre Hotel Caspe, no fresh air and no fresh air circulation at room , very clean great breakfast close to city center Hotel personnel was very helpful for each detail 
297833,Ayre Hotel Caspe, It s an 8 to 10 minute walk to the closest subway station so that can be a minor complaint Still nothing that bothered me , The place was perfect Nice room great reception the bathroom was ideal Pretty satisfied with our stay 
297834,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Bed was very uncomforted We couldn t sleep not at all Bed size for us was really small WiFi was horrible, Location Staff cleanliness
297835,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The room service did not clean the room the day before our last night , Very good price of the room for a hotel with good location in the centre of Barcelona eixample at reasonable distance of many attractions The reception staff very attentive and offered us a choice of room 
297836,Ayre Hotel Caspe, There was a block sock in the closet when I move in Wifi speed is inconsistent and only two devices are allowed per room Not many good restaurants nearby , Cheap and tasty room service Highly recommend Clean room Positions of power outlets are humane Descriptions are correct We booked for 2 nights and 4 bottles of complimentary water are provided 6 mins walk to metro Will come back again when possible 
297837,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Only one thing perhaps we had focaccia and spaghetti in the hotel bar The focaccia was tasty but the spaghetti is not recommendable , Tasteful clean spacious rooms with bath and shower delicious coffee in the morning correct breakfast very friendly and helpful staff great services smooth check in check out In all a really great experience 
297838,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Location is not too good not to bad There is public transportation but the area is not like the city center, Everything is excellent and staff are so nice
297839,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Bed was a little hard not a big deal for me , Stayed here for 3 nights asked for a quiet room and a double bed and received both They put me on the end of the fifth floor 509 I m assuming because it was quieter than being lower and hearing street noise You can still hear some street noise at night but it s not overwelming The hotel was in City Center but still a little ways away from highly populated areas which is a great trade off for a quieter room Very good location metro is like 3 streets away everything is well within walking distance Staff spoke good English and was very helpfull with changing the length of my stay was also very friendly for check in check out The room was modern and clean perfect for walking around the city all day and just using the room for sleep showering I would definitely stay here again 
297840,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Room rather on the small sides and neighbours were noisy Also the hall light shone into the room so can disturb you if you want an early night Coffee facilities would be appreciated , Very clean with modern facilities and excellent bathroom 
297841,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Sound in our room we could hear the people next door taking a shower as of it was in our own Don t eat in the hotel restaurant there are better choice in nearby like Can Vador Carrer de la Diputaci 367 , The location is great and to can walking to La Segrada Familia and even to the Picasso Museum For the park G ell take a cab they are not that expensive and all cab driver were very friendly and honest 
297842,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Our room wouldn t have been worth the full price for the room Fortunately it was heavily discounted low season and therefor it was very good value for money , Location is good Few minutes from metro and close enough to city center to walk the distance 25 mins A nice local cafe across the street to eat breakfast or lunch Overall a nice experience Friendly staff incl cleaning and nothing to complain about 
297843,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Breakfast doesn t worth the money Sometimes there were a bad smell in the room, very nice hotel helpful staff good location near everything good wifi
297844,Ayre Hotel Caspe, My room didn t have real windows Instead the windows were looking to the inside hall of the hotel which was a bit annoying without sunlight But there were many normal rooms with windows looking to the street or back side of the hotel , Location was fine Price was good Internet was fast enough 
297845,Ayre Hotel Caspe, there is none, room was big enough and it was quiet good location and quiet place you can get to La sagrada Famillia by walking it take 15 min and you can take bus to go to la Ramblas easily it takes 8 minutes 
297846,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The bathroom maintenance is necessary Mattress are not confortable and need to be changed , Near to Rabla and Placa Catalunya Very good breakfast Very helpful staff Two metro station near by 
297847,Ayre Hotel Caspe, My general opinion is that this hotel is like a 3 stars Hotel in Germany The mold in the corners of the bathtub and in the corners of the shower was the only thing that bothered us The room was cleaned every day but the mold will not go away just with a vacuum cleaner , The Hotel is situated near Bus Station estacio de Nord and near Arc de Triumph metro station 12 min away walking distance from La Sagrada Familia The personal is friendly and the breakfast was quite tasty It was quite cheap 60 Euro night and for Barcelona is a very low price 
297848,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, It was my second visit to this hotel and I m afraid my first visit a couple of years ago was better than this one My main concern was the bathroom that may need some renovation and cleanliness was not very good with a greasy feeling on door handles the fan surfaces etc Nothing that can t be fixed by thorough cleaning though Breakfast was very good and location perfect so thumbs up on those Wi Fi is ok in the lobby but not so good in room 216 breaking the connection every 2 3 minutes Anyway this is a good match if you are looking for value for money and enjoy Barcelona 
297849,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Booked this hotel mainly because it said sound proofed rooms this was not the case Noises from other rooms , Staff brilliant Rooms cleaned very well every day 
297850,Ayre Hotel Caspe, It is a little far out I think crossing San Joan was a bit too far But it not spoil my stay , Nothing was too much trouble the staff really wanted to go the extra to make you feel welcome and wanted as a customer The rooms I had were perfectly appointed and the bed was comfortable No complaints 
297851,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Only disappointment was the lack of English speaking TV channels 2 news channels and that was it would be nice after long days of sightseeing to relax with something apart from constant news And Unfortunately our room view wasn t very nice very old dirty looking apt blocks but when ur out all day sight seeing it s no biggie Anyone that likes their tea coffee in room need to bring own travel kettle, Cleanliness of hotel and room was great Wifi worked perfectly in room Very friendly and informative staff at reception Taxi from Las Ramblas to hotel 2 passengers was approx 6 Small 24hr supermarket directly across from hotel great for stocking up fridge in room In my opinion this hotel is the upper end of a 3 star hotel not a 4 star as advertised Would definitely stay here again 
297852,Ayre Hotel Caspe, No tea or coffee making facilities in the room TV all in Spanish but then we were in Spain so perhaps to be expected , Easy walking distance to Metro and many small caf s and bars Staff friendly and helpful 
297853,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Slow WiFi it needs some urgent remediation upgrade, The hotel is quite clean and the staff are very friendly You can walk to the city centre within 15 minutes or less 
297854,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Not usual 4 stars More like solid 3 stars Maybe it is usual for Barcelona , Great staff nice and clean room Good place for stay not far from center of Barcelona 
297855,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, The room was lovely clean and comfortable The hotel was very close to centre town and the nearest Metro station was only 5 minute walk mployee were really friendly and polite 
297856,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We had a problem with the room which seemed to have some electrical malfunction They gave us a superior room instead but the initial one was disappointing for the price we had paid and definitely not soundproof ,No Positive
297857,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Sorry to mention but the beds weren t erally comfortable , Location is absolutely perfect near Arc de Triumph and 10 min walk from Familia Segrada The staff were very helpful 
297858,Ayre Hotel Caspe, internet coverage was poor and was most of the time disconnected, the location of the hotel is excellent relative to its price it is almost 10 15 minutes walking distance to Plaza Catalunya and La Rambla street 
297859,Ayre Hotel Caspe, First room interior was really noisy you can hear absolutely everything from the other rooms and corridor Second room was a bit better , Staff was really helpful when asked to change the room their attitude was excellent Location is good 
297860,Ayre Hotel Caspe, No Tea and Coffee making facilities within the room Very Surprising, Location so close to the beach so close to Sagrada Familia all other local attractions are easily within walking distance 
297861,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We had to travel a while to get anywhere the immediate surrounding area was nothing special the hotel was a bit pricy for what you got and I didn t like the austere modern look and the bed was a little soft My dislikes are mostly my own personal preferences and to be fair not the failings of the hotel None of those issues would stop me recommending this hotel which is very good , The hotel is very good very modern helpful friendly staff the breakfast provided is wonderful had to remind myself to hold back so I would be hungry for lunch the kitchen provides very nice food in general and the bartenders make good cocktails The rooms are of a good size modern clean and with TV fridge AC and nice bathroom with shower and separate bath You could not hear sound from other rooms 
297862,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Sadly unlike its sister hotel the Ayre Rossilon where I stayed previously no roof terrace with city views , Great location in a quiet side street but within 10 15 mins walk of the city centre and many tourist attraction Clean modern accommodation and comfortable beds Hotel staff extremely helpful 
297863,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Just one complaint pillows are a little hard Just a wedge of sponge Everything else wonderful , The hotel decor is modern and excellent The beds are really comfortable Reception staff are wonderful so helpful The area is about 20 mins walk from the gothic area It is a little outside but no prob is you like walking like we do It is not a busy tourist area it is fairly quiet We got it at a good price as we arrived on a Thursday Had it been Friday would of been 100 more for the 3 nights we stayed Breakfst was 12 euros we just went along the rd to a cafe very cheap 
297864,Ayre Hotel Caspe, did not like the additional charge on taxi s called by the hotel vs getting a cab on my own The breakfast was totally over priced for mediocre buffet Wifi worked poorly if at all,No Positive
297865,Ayre Hotel Caspe, cafe bar restaurant staff need to keep to regular hours no food available after 4 in afternoon Fortunately there are cafes close by , the room was exceptionally clean the staff courteous at all times we stayed for a week the cleaning staff worked around our schedule not the other way around the whole experience was relaxing and non invasive we will stay again thank you 
297866,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Football nights at the restaurant The breakfast has an option to request hot meals but when there are a lot of people you can t do that because they put some for everybody but the quality is not that good , The people working at the hotel are very nice and friendly and they help you The hotel has a nice hotel but it would be better to have some nice music than a TV with football on it The breakfast is really good when they don t have lots of guests 
297867,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Nothing to complain about , This is a well located hotel 3 blocks from the Tetuan Metro station in a residential area Much nicer area than anything within the Ramblas area where we staid before Facilities are modern Staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfasts were very comprehensive Would definitely book again if ever return to Barcelona Carlos
297868,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Very helpful reception staff Nice room with 4 water bottles for free Conveniently located for a visit on foot to Sagrada Familia church and close to Metro stations shops and restaurants 
297869,Ayre Hotel Caspe, It is rather at a level of a 3 stars and not 4 For example no minibar in rooms , The location is very convient for a touristic visit The staff was very friendly 
297870,Ayre Hotel Caspe, No exterior window overlooked light well Noise from corridor Charged for breakfast we did not have had to argue for refund , Modern clean secure Safe in room to store valuables 
297871,Ayre Hotel Caspe, can t think of negative comments , everything is excellent Courteous and helpful staff Abundant and very good breakfast quiet location and not far from the attractions will refer this hotel to friends 
297872,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, This is a beautiful hotel in a quiet location and was just what I needed It is a walking distance from the bus station and metro and is located in a quit neighborhood Extremely polite staff always willing to help you Free wifi and works very well The room especially the bathroom was cleaned meticulously every day Really happy with this accommodation 
297873,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The staff at the bar and restaurant were not friendly or accommodating almost rude to a point The Wifi kept dropping and we needed to add the credentials continuously , The front office staff at the hotel were great helpful informative and very accommodating The staff were friendly cleaning staff were very polite and always greeted with a smile The hotel is in a great location easy access to 3 metros stations
297874,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, All the young staff were friendly helpful and always gave the impression that they enjoyed their jobs The whole hotel was spotless Our room was cleaned meticulously each day 
297875,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Didn t realise location was in the Chinese area for most nearby bars , Spacious superior room with very nice decor Lovely bathroom Helpful and cheerful staff Secure parking 
297876,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Waiters at buffet breakfast are not very helpful it takes them ages to refill missing cutlery cups , Lovely hotel with comfortable rooms and at an excellent location
297877,Ayre Hotel Caspe, I didn t like the service overall 1 The room we asked for wasn t available when we arrive and it wasn t as the one we expected Therefore we upgraded the room which was okish with an 20 euros supplement every day of our stay We asked them to have a gesture cause we didn t have the room available as we arrived but we never got an answer until I called them and the answer was no 2 The breakfast fast service was poor to me The responsible kept coming to us to ask if we have registered for this service every time we will be having breakfast However we did get free breakfast the 1st day , I like the room especially the king size bed It was really comfy 
297878,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Bed was a little hard but that s a matter of preference , Great stay for the price just a bit out of the way of las ramblas But it was quiet clean and the staff was nice 
297879,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Very good hotel Located near two metro stations Excellent staff clean rooms good wifi good breakfast A good choice to visit Barcelona the city that you find everything 
297880,Ayre Hotel Caspe, There s pretty much no air in the rooms as in most of them the windows are overlooking an inner yard that is all covered in glass Internet was very bad and can be used by just one person per room at the same time We were given half cleaned room with dirty towels and garbage in the bins It was however changed upon complaint , The place is quite close to the center and there are 2 metro lines close by The people at the reception were really nice Reception works 24h and we left our baggage for a few hours without problem 
297881,Ayre Hotel Caspe, In some rooms the wifi signal is really week , Breakfast does worth paying for it Really helpful and friendly stuff The location is almost perfect there are two tube stations just in the vicinity you can walk to Catalunya Square the North Bus Terminal is also within a walking distance 
297882,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, The staff at the Front Desk was very friendly and helpful We could check in at 10 am although the official check in time is 2 pm The receptionist was very nice and recommended some very nice spots to go 
297883,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The slooooow Wifi I tried to connect my device to the internet but it doesn t work I cannot even check my flight on line , The room is tidy and clear Staff is kind and friendly It just takes several minutes to the metro station 
297884,Ayre Hotel Caspe, wifi needs to be developed expect good hotel, Close by the all touristic places by walking distance metro station is also close but we used rarely because walked to eveywhere nice location free from noise and disturbance of city quite big enough rooms 
297885,Ayre Hotel Caspe, The Internet on the upper floor was not working properly A better system should be in place rather than paper tickets for each guest for one device at a time, The location a walk from the attractions at a more reasonable price with larger and modern rooms Nice space in the closet the lighting was great 
297886,Ayre Hotel Caspe, mouldy shower floor the switch to use the bathtub s shower head was broken, excellent staff nice and convenient breakfast good wifi convenient location and good value for the city
297887,Ayre Hotel Caspe,No Negative, Our room looked just like the one on the picture it was nice clean and functional However beware there are few rooms facing inwards into a small atrium these might feel a bit strange 
297888,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Nothing to complain about , We arrived in Barcelona at 2am and had the reservation only from the following day We planned to spend the rest of the night in town even though we knew this would pretty much ruin our first day as we would be very tired we are both over 60 But when we arrived at the the hotel in the middle of the night to leave our luggage we were offered the room right then and there this really early check in or effectively an extra night offered to us free of charge meant that we were able to sleep rest and get refreshed and have a full day of enjoyment in Barcelona Otherwise the hotel is very nice clean and well located 
297889,Ayre Hotel Caspe, Thin walls do not protect us against noise so we have heard not only talks in the hall but also in room conversations and sound of water splashed in a neighbors apartments restrooms, Location and staff on the reception and in the bar And provided baby s crib as we requested
297890,Ayre Hotel Caspe, We had a nicer room assigned but the bed had just been changed from singles to matrimonial Staff very accommodating even helped us move but room was on a lower floor a little banged up Hotel location was a bit out of the way , A high quality experience in every way The staff were very helpful the facilities in beautiful condition the breakfast excellent worth the high price The residential neighborhood location was quiet I enjoyed stopping in at nearby cafes and walking to La Familia Sagrada It was fun to wake up and see Barcelona and Catalunya flags hanging from apartment balconies across from us
