428903,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, They advertise 24 7 service however there is nobody attending the bar during breakfast hours We waited for a coffee 20 30 minutes , It had free parking which was awesome 
428904,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Better put a signboard at the parking lot We don t know which place is for hotel , Parking Clean room Bathroom was very good Compair to price Highly recommended 
428905,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Breakfast without warm fried egg meat like fish sausage bacon is a bit disappointing Hope they can provide them in the future, I had a ginues discount from bookings and only 55 euro for a very stylish modern facilities double bed room with large bathroom and all 5 star hotel standards It was more than triple the price I should be paying I stayed in many 5 star hotels and this one is definitely worth staying with its quality and price cost 
428906,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The hotel was very close to the motorway and there was a lot of traffic noise at night We had to leave the window open as the air conditioning was not working , The hotel room and the free parking
428907,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, i wish there was an iron for clothes and maybe basic cosmetics like sticks for the ears prepared we had that in way chesper apartment before so i think a 4 star hotel should deliver that it makes the location way more personal and i also think that 1 bottle of water for free as a hello present is not too much too ask as the room had a decently high price already just small wishes nothing big , big clean friendly staff good location with access to trains and buses not far from the center of vienne and good bars arround 
428908,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The location is a bit far from the center but was not a big issue for us since we traveled by car , The room was very clean and nice with all needed facilities Parking place is perfect Overally a great experience 
428909,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien,No Negative, Perfect for one night if you need to get to and from Vienna International Airport easily want to spend an evening in the city Well worth paying extra for the delicious breakfast Extremely friendly staff lovely rooms easy to use app Free WiFi free parking

428912,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, We stayed at Doppio in Sept 2015 and it was a whole other experince Now the room was much smaller the mattresses really worn out the whole bathroom flooded when I took a shower the receptionist was really nice though she herself came and mopped the bathroom floor the room door didn t close properly the cleaning tidying up of the room missing thus no napkins toilet paper refill , Close to tram station that takes you into city center Free parking Great to get to from motorway 
428913,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, A bit expensive but in Vienna this is no surprise , Clean comfortable rooms Tram that takes you to the center in 15 minutes stops near the hotel The hotel has its own parking lot Highway is near easy to find 
428914,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Wi fi didn t work I made a call to reception to understand what s going on they promised that they will fix the problem till the end of the day but for real wi fi didn t work at all even the next day this problem concerned only 6 and 7 floors The location is not really great There was no slippers and bathrobes , Personnel is very friendly The hotel room was really clean and good looking the bed was very comfortable There was no noise from the outside 
428915,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, We stayed for 2 nights at the hotel we checked in late and as we got to the room hair on the pillow hair on the bathroom floor behind the door and in the bath tub I told the night clerk who said oh thank you I ll let the cleaning staff know for tomorrow 2nd day same spots were still present The carpet in the hallway needs cleaning big time It is 8 stops away from city center by tram and don t expect to find anything near coffee shop night shop For a 4 stars hotel no amneties in the room bathroom I was charged the water bottles from the empty minibar I wonder why they called it minibar since it has 2 small bottles of water only Wouldn t a coffee machine be nice in the room instead of the useless electric window shutters , The bed is okay comfortable 
428916,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The breakfast is SO limiting and definitely not worth the price There was no hot breakfast except the random scrambled eggs made in a test tube or whatever that was The location is not ideal Quite far from most places , The hotel is modern and has beautiful spaces Very clean Low rating is mostly for location and limiting breakfast 
428917,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Restaurant was not open for dining in the evening We were disappointed after a long day sightseeing , The towel warmer heater was great in the bathroom Room was nice Staff was friendly 
428918,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The place is spartan Extra towels must be paid for the breakfast is basic and the place crowded with teenagers I had to leave my driving license with reception throughout my stay or they would not accommodate me The nearest U Bahn is a 15 minute walk away and there are no restaurants nearby , The rooms were quiet 
428919,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Breakfast advertised as included was not We were informed in the morning that we would have to pay almost 11euro each for breakfast Not as close to the central station as we had hoped but not knowing Vienna well didn t help us , Bed was fabulous room was very comfortable Everything very clean new and modern If you re looking for old world character this is not the place It s a modern hotel with nice amenities We didn t stay long enough to use any

428922,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Hotel and parking spot could be better marked on the road with signs We had some troubles with reaching it by car , The room is quite big and quiet there is also very comfortable bathroom 
428923,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, As this was just an overnight on a longer trip I wish there had been an evening dining option , Breakfast was very good in fact I was a little disappointed it did not have an evening dining option aside from grilled cheese at the bar 
428924,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Breakfast was too expensive for what it offered Bathroom had no shower door so water would flood the floor WiFi dropped off continuously , Staff was extremely polite and helpful Room was clean 
428925,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The receptionnist at our departure had a hard time saying thank you and good bye She apparently prefers people paying by card than cash , For the Marx Halle concert is was a perfect location Room was well equipped and clean Breakfast quality 
428926,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, , We went to an event in Marx Halle that is right behind the hotel so the location was perfect 3 min walk from one to another There is also a tram stop right across the street from the hotel that is 2 stops away from U Bahn metro or you can walk 8 min to it It is around 20 min away from the city center Stephansplatz 
428927,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Breakfast not included in price, Clean and spaced rooms professional stuff free parking Even though location of the hotel is a bit away from the city center there is a tram 71 driving to the ring passing nearby literally 3 mins from hotel

428929,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, 1 The air conditioner worked a little bit loudly you need to turn it off at nights 2 1 out of 2 rooms has provided no slippers, Good choice for tourists travelling by car 1 Located at the exit to the ring road no traffic jams which are common in Wien 2 The tram station is 3 minute walk ticket 2 30 euro but you should have coins to buy the ticket inside the tram Do not drive to the city center by car there is no place to park 3 Perfectly clean well maintained room comfortable beds although they are separated On the pictures it looks like a king size bed but there are two of them joined together it is typical for Austria 4 They provide bathrobes and slippers as well as comprehensive personal hygiene kits head and body shampoo body lotion nail file shaving kit 5 The car parking place is safe but it is about 100 meters from the hotel
428930,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Reception staff not very helpful and pleasant Beds are not comfortable enough Minibar was empty except from two still waters , Good breakfast clean rooms spacious toilet
428931,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, I heard music from a lower floor even though the rooms are supposed to be soundproofed So the walls are soundproofed but not the floors , My room felt fresh clean and comfortable

428935,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The women who was at the reception was very unfrendly to us We arrived well a head of check in time we knew that we have to wait for a room but she mad it look like we wanted a room in a sec and had a rude tone We had luck because there was another women who helped us out The bed was full of hair and I was disgusted by that photo attached for a 4 hotel this is not acceptable Also the bathroom wasn t too clean , Breakfast was great but very noisy and loud The bed is just great and very comfortable also you have no noise in the rooms although the hotel is in an industrial place The metro is next to the hotel which is great The room is well decorated
428936,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, No coffee tea facilities in the room and also at the lobby bar we couldn t get it around 23 00 the coffee machine was already off For a 4 star hotel I would expect to have this option , The city center is reasonably well accessible direct tram to the Opera ring U Bahn is two tram stops away The breakfast is very good big choice 
428937,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, A bit far from the center but OK if you have a care and tram station a few minutes away , Clean comfortable rooms big walk in shower fantastic breakfast with many local bio products Would go again and recommended to all 
428938,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Breakfast without eggs please you can do better once you have invest so much in reputation Although it is 20 min walk from Erdberg international buss station still have to pass through a bit shady area bellow highway bridge, It is well maintained hotel with fitness facilities
428939,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, We booked a twin room and got a room for persons with handicap which got a bathroom a little unconfortable and the toilet seat had stains on it also the heating didn t work properly we only had about 19 20 degrees in the room during the night though we fixed the temperature on 23 so it was kind of cold , The personel very nice the location close to the center nice and rich breakfast free parking 
428940,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The reception staff were not very helpful the first girl directed us to the second closest tram stop She also didn t ask to validate parking at checkout Both minor things but I was traveling alone with a small child so every extra step we had to take outside in the cold was that much more difficult I feel like at this price point breakfast should be included especially since there are no breakfast restaurants within walking distance TheRe wwas only bar food available at night which was very inconvenient since only one restaurant is waking distance The parking lot while free was also small and full I was afraid to leave the lot and risk not being able to find another spot , The room was modern clean and well appointed We stayed in December and found the room to be warm and he climate controls way to use The beds were comfy and shower was amazing It was a quick and easy tram ride to and from city center I appreciated the free on site parking

428943,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, I would have enjoyed taking a walk to the city centre but it s a bit too far However I was aware of this prior to booking , New modern hotel with comfy bed nice bathroom spacious room Kettle with coffee and tee selection was a big plus Tram stop is less than 5mins and metro station 10 15 min Free outdoor parking 
428944,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Impersonal business hotel that could be anywhere else No Vienna charm Two bottles of mineral water placed in the fridge which does not contain any else No sign that the bottle of mineral water is 2 60 each It is not the 2 60 that matter but the way there is no sign that they are not complimentary as it is customary in good hotels Eggs are charged 4 per order at American Breakfast Buffet No decent restaurant nearby only Kebab joints , Modern affordable hotel Free parking free internet Good breakfast Tramway 71 passes in front of the hotel The ride to the city center takes 20 minutes to the city 
428945,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Nothing much to dislike here Though I would love the sauna , Very good hotel Good for business travelers traveling by car as the hotel is right by the highway Not quite near the city center if you are looking for a hotel to explore the city 
428946,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Hair dryer not working in the room However a replacement was quickly offered Also room temperature regulation was a bit slow so the room remained quite cold for a while Otherwise no complaints at all , Rooms extremely comfortable clean and spacious Easy access both downtown and to the central railway station by tram Breakfast very tasty and with great value for money 10 90 per person per night during our stay Very polite staff We will surely use Austria Trend Hotel Doppio again in our future visits to Vienna 
428947,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Location was terrible Not near city centre booked to be closer to the train station but wasn t near that or many metro stops either Reception staff weren t very helpful either , Good value for money especially for the size of the room and the breakfast offered 
428948,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, I coming to this hotel 10 15 times per year last 4 years Beafore I never had problem with parking in hotel parking but now it seems that you need to close gate too many cars from some companies need to be only for guests If you come to late you will have problem to find free space , Everything is perfect 10

428956,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien,No Negative, Hotel was just as described on Booking com Actually there is a little mistake in description as it said that there is only wired free internet in rooms and they have free wifi there too So this was a pleasent suprise Tram station is in front of hotel 15 min drive to city center and underground U2 is near by 10 min walk Free parking is also a big plus 
428957,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, no restaurant for evening meal hard to find if you ve never been to vienna before , everything was superb excellent breakfast good location excellent rooms and facilities
428958,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, There was nothing exept shampoo even no body lotion Always wet in the bathroom no heating during the summer Towels always wet because of that we had to change them every time that s not ecologically friendly Location is not convinient for tourist travelling for sightseeing quite far away of the city center 50 min by foot 15 by tram Seems to be it is good for business travellers seminars or for the organised groups Not easy to find from the St Marx metro station , Hotel is rather new Stylish Room is quite spacy Good shower

428964,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, 15 min by tram to the city centre thus not the best location however well located with approximately a tram every 10 min, Free parking Very very clean Helpful staff 
428965,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The double bed had two mattresses it was sometimes not so comfortable with space between the mattresses , Rooms looked neat and tidy Breakfast was really good 
428966,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, There is a person watching the entrance of the breakfast room Never seen this before You need to have your room key envelope with the room number on it to show it to this person you need to sign that you enter While I can imagine why this is so I still find it awkward , Super room
428967,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Maids knocked at the room door twice in the morning once entered briefly to see if anyone is in 9am approximate other than that a better view would be appreciated but overall good service , Very comfotable bed Overally enjoyed stay would recommend 
428968,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Staff was almost rude upon our arrival no restaurant that serves dinner gym cannot really be called a gym bed uncomfortable too soft a window in the bathroom facing the sleeping area so if you use the bathroom in the middle of the night you will light up the whole room Location outside the city center with not that attractive surroundings If you ask me this is more like a 3 hotel , Breakfast was pretty good but not included in our room price Best mojito we have ever tasted in the lobby bar Free parking nearby Pet friendly 
428969,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien,No Negative, The hotel gave us a free upgrade so the room had a fabulous walk in shower and tea coffee in the room Very convenient location with free parking on site Visiting the sights in Vienna is easy S Bahn St Marx station and tram stops Routes 18 and 71 within 5 10 minutes walk of the hotel 
428970,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The room has no balcony The distance to the city center but I wouldn t say this is a reason not to chose the hotel as one can use public transportation to get in the city center , Very nice hotel quite new with a fresh design It was very clean and the staff was helpful Even though it is a bit far from city center like 40 minutes walking there is a metro station and a tram that gets you directly in the city center The parking is in included and is very close to the hotel location It is a very good value for the money

428972,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, We chose this hotel because of silence we were suppose to experience thanks to sound proofwindows Unfortunatelly we were given a room with roof windows and they were everything but soundproof It was very loud noise was comming from the street all night We could hardly sleep and we had to arrange a new place to sleep in other part of the apartment good that it was big enough I don t know how it is in other rooms I guess we just had bad luck beware of 427 , Modern clean very good breakfast 
428973,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The only thing that need improvement is the breakfast It s very limited when compared to everything else , I am a regular it s the only place I stay in Vienna unless it s fully booked It s in a very good location very clean free hotel parking It s a 4 star hotel with 5 star standart 
428974,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The location While the u bahn is about a twenty minute walk away it isn t the most pleasant area of town being a new area and still being built This doesn t effect the high standard of the room we had but it s not somewhere you can just walk out of and walk to the main sight seeing areas in Vienna The restaurant they recommend and have on the website is closed on weekends we did find one about twenty minutes walk away which was good as an alternative at the Arsenal ,No Positive
428975,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The lady that greets and gets info for breakfast could have been more welcoming , the breakfast buffet had eggs and was very attractive The Receptionist were very helpful and customer service from them was great 
428976,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Breakfast was not very reach in assortiments The sofa on our room was not vacuum cleaned And there was dust on the headboard of the bed , The 4 star Hotel Doppio is situated in the 3rd arrondisment of Vienna in Neu Marx It is close to Schloss Belvedere 10 15 minutes walk The center of the city can be reached by tram no 71 direction Karlsplatz Oper Rathaus The stop is 2 minutes walking distance from the hotel The subway Ubahn stop U3 is 8 minutes walking distance away from the hotel 
428977,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Some of the bathroom fittings needed adjustment The tap in the wash hand basin was loose and the lever to let the water drain out was very stiff Being British I miss not having a kettle with tea and coffee which I can make in the room , The bed was very comfortable The room and the bathroom were spacious and clean 
428978,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, might be slightly expensive breakfast could have more options, Clean rooms Good breakfast good coffee Good location tram station close to hotel 2 station to nearest subway or 15 min with the tram to Karls Platz Wiena s center Private parking WiFi
428979,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Wifi is non existent and can be rated outright poor Stay away from this hotel if you intend to use wifi to get any information Only one restaurant Irish restaurant which was in fact good within 1 km distance It s a budget 4 star hotel which shows in many other ways Hotel s private parking is a little away from hotel Breakfast had less choices compared to other 4 stars we have ever stayed in Room walls are thin Hence they have limited the volume of the TV to a fixed maximum which is not a lot , It s clean spacious modern hotel Free parking Close to Belvedere Palace 5 mins by car 
428980,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Nothing special There isn t room service which isn t a big deal but would add more convenience , Free parking good location and very nice room 
428981,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien,No Negative, The room was spacious clean and comfortable The hotel is near a tram station that takes you to the center No 71 which is a convenient way to go around the city 
428982,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Well first of all the room we booked is nothing like the photo we see on internet And the facilities are not exactly fits on description lack of things The most annoying part is the staff in reception who is not helpful at all we waste lots of time to do the things which the reception should tell us before to be more efficient , Parking
428983,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Far from downtown but OK with tram Smooth pillow harder than the normal one but normal one OK , 2 contiguous rooms very large and nice Quiet because new and well isolated Good breakfast not always refilled forced to take 5 glasses orange juice because no more than 5 cl Free car park 
428984,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, breakfast at e10 80 was too expensive so I had mine at macdonalds for e3 40 , a good modern hotel on the outskirts of Vienna with good public transport to the centre the room was excellent as were the staff 
428985,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, A restaurant on site would have been nice as there wasn t anything within easy walking distances, Good room with nice amenities Location a bit out of the city center but a train station close by and a short ride to the centrum Free parking
428986,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The location In that neighborhood there is nothing metro is pretty far around are about two restaurants , Its a nice new modern hotel with contemporary vibe I guess its a great business hotel 
428987,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Room was quite sparsely decorated and equipped The place has absolutely no character and no human touch It s new but it s utilitarian There s no restaurant no room service and the food available at the bar is terrible Street food would have been a better option were it not so late when I arrived The surroundings are offices and highways But nicer areas are not far , Very clean and close to where I needed to be The breakfast was good 
428988,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, There was wifi available everywhere inside the building but connection to the network was unsuccessful It would be better to improve the connection capability , Everything was perfect except WIFI 
428989,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, A little far from the city center There weren t many restaurants near the hotel Trashcans full of cigarettes in room even though a nonsmoking room , Good value for money Full breakfast Nice pillows 
428990,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien,No Negative, Excellent hotel without any flaws for a decent price and a rich breakfast menu for an acceptable price The location served us well as we were headed to the airport the next day and the S Bahn S7 stop is only a few walking minutes away 
428991,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, 1 One of the waiteress did not speak english I mean how can you possibly have stuff anywhere in the 4 hotel that goes into contact with your guests that has no clue about english I have enjoyed my stay at your hotel very much but this was shocking for me Lady looked at me like I am crazy that I am talking to her in english 2 person who was doing map for parking Come on I have recieved wrong instructions on the reception and spent literally 20 minutes looking for parking Reason was that map is very unrealistic and stupid And yes I know it was right next to hotel But I was asking 3 people around hotel nobody was able to tell me even though we were right next to it , Everything was very clean except dust in our room 716 Very nice breakfast and excellent coffee Location was pretty nice according to fact that is located near highway Mozart and his grave I do not suggest traveling by car in Vienna therefore we used tram that is only 5 minutes walk from the hotel Parking is for free big advantage and money saver To be honest I really suggest this hotel We were satisfied except some small details and price is very fair If you want to have a business visit or just leisure stay this is the hotel you have been looking for 
428992,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, I missed SPA nothing fancy just sauna maybe a small pool which is expected from 4 star hotel but nothing like that available Just a fitness centre but haven t been there , Kind and polite stuff clean modern room at fair price Good location tram station line 71 is just around the corner Ride to city centre Opera House Opernring takes around 10 minutes 8 stations New tram arrives every 10 minutes or so Ticket price is 2 40 Euro one way We also used Taxi for a few times which costs around 10 15 Euro to city centre there are always a few of them parked right in front of hotel Free car parking is a great value compared to most other Vienna hotels which charge 30 40 Euro per day We didn t have breakfast included in arrangement so I m not sure what the food quality is 
428993,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, One of the rooms was not prepared for our arrival no amenities whatsoever no bathrobes empty mini bar The reception lady had a bad attitude and was not interested in solving the problem, delicious breakfast

428996,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, 1 We lost baby bib in this hotel Because i sensed the fact that i lost it before leaving this hotel i requested to send a mail if they ll find it but i didn t get any answer yet , Breakfast was good not various but atmosphere of refinement 
428997,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, I didnt like the selection of dishes The breakfast was bit poor for such hotel They need more selection of dishes for the breakfast , I liked the variety of drinks wide selection of tea and coffees 
428998,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien,No Negative, After 5 6 days we were again i this hotel We were very surprised when we were offered free upgrade to suite Everything still perfect We will come back every the next time when we re in Vienna 
428999,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien,No Negative, The last time we were at this hotel did not deserve the best rating because of some things But now I realized that it was just a failure of employees who obviously was just that time now everything is perfect Good breakfast clean rooms free parking wi fi perfect 
429000,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, No restaurant in the close neighborhood pretty poor wifi almost impossible to use during peak hours time , Free parking pretty easy to reach the downtown good breakfast 
429001,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, nearly impossible to find the hotel without a navigation , good breakfast with great viarity Bar is very inviting Room sice was more than enough for two people parking for free
429002,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Zero, There was really nothing to dislike with the hotel We arrived on 27th Dec and our first impressions of the hotel were from the exterior it looked a bit characterless but then I realised that it is a business hotel more than a tourist hotel Once inside however everything changed it was warm smart even a little elegant The reception staff were very helpful and courteous The room was wonderful large comfortable quiet with plenty of comfortable chairs to sit on The bathroom was amazing with a fantastic walk in shower It was very clean and had everthing that you would expect from a 1st class hotel The situation of the hotel was also great a short walk from the tram stop with a 10 minute journey to Vienna center All in all I would reccomend this hotel without hestitation 
429003,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, It was a bit far from my points of interests and in an area looking a bit industrial but the way to the centre was pleasant and not too long About 30 min walking , Lovely very clean hotel nice staff good value for money 
429004,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The location is good thinking in the airport by Metro but not in the downtown for walking a little bit, Very nice and good hotel Good quality service and new Free Parking
429005,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Some far from metro by walk at the cold air , Friendly helpful staff new clean room really enough hot for us after a cold day Comfortable bed pillows Travel to Zipperstrasse by U3 than take the tram 71 3 stops until Lindestrasse right direction after metro exit 10 minutes to the city center 
429006,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, 1 The staff is very unfriendly especially the bar tender 2 there is no water heater in the room you need go to the bar to get the water in this case you must have the cup otherwise the bar tender will charge you 50 cent for the paper cup which is very unbelievably , The room is clean and comfort 
429007,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, No tea coffee making facilities Also on our booking page it was stated that as Genius travelers we have options for early check in late check out and a welcome drink however no welcome drink was arranged Seems like an issue with booking com itself not the hotel but it was actually disappointing , The hotel may seem located too far from the city center but actually it s 10 15 min tram ride from there Free car parking is great The modern style rooms are very clean and spacious enough The staff helped us really a lot this time It was the 4th time staying in Doppio and I will surely stay there on my next trip to Vienna 
429008,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, It is told breakfast is bio But no fresh eggs just industrial liquid egg Server AS scrambled eggs Fresh eggs only for surcharge , Friendly and helpful staff except breakfast 
429009,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, breakfast had nothing warm scrambled eggs at least would be nice however great home made muesli toaster at breakfast didn t work location could be better nothing in the neighborhood area not so nice either , nice fresh room clean bathroom great shower new elevators free fenced parking 
429010,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, No slippers it should be included in a 4 star hotel room necessities , Cleanliness free parking under the highway with the supervised ramp comfortable rooms nice bed good connection with public transportation tram 2 min metro 5 min 
429011,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Girls at the reception aren very friendy We said hallo or good morning evening many times but they didn t greets back Last day in the morning hotel stuff and cleaning stuff entered in our room when we re sleeping and after that no one could t say why they did that A little bit strange, Very pleasent stayin modern hotel very close to the city center and other sights Comfortable room clean and modern 
429012,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The hotel doesn t have a restaurant for serving meals in the evening They have just a small selection of snacks in my view every 4 hotel should have a proper restaurant where they server dinner and lunch as well , The hotel is located very near to a tram line that takes you to the center around 15 minutes The rooms were clean bed was relatively comfortable 
429013,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Location should you decide to use the metro line it s about 15 min walk away and you will go through a pretty bad neighborhood Housekeeping changed the sheets only the 3rd day of our stay and only after we made a complaint twice Heating did not work in the room and it got pretty cold during the night Staff uninterested , The room is nicely designed Free parking 
429014,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Even though location is not central it is quite easy to get to the city centre and other transportation hubs Wien Mitte and Wien Hbf However during the afternoon rush hour it was quite busy and it took both bus and tram more than 30 minutes to get to first Ubahn station usually it takes around 10 minutes If you have any arrangements somewhere in the city at 5pm or 6pm I suggest that you leave earlier , Kind and polite staff Quiet and clean room Solid breakfast
429015,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The only open point is there are not so much choises for restaurants in the area , Good location tram station next to the hotel 10 min from the city center breakfast ok rooms were cousy Everything clean and stuff very helpful 
429016,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The optional breakfast was pretty expensive but maybe for Wien it s a standard prize , The rooms were perfectly clean air conditioned silent double window and luxuriously furnished Great advantage was also free private parking 
429017,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Everything was perfect , Very professional kind staff quality service cozy furniture perfect sound isolated rooms very clean nice coffee in the lounge fast and stable wi fi fast check in check out free parking close to the hotel real business hotel with high standards 10 mins by car to the center We fully recommend Doppio hotel 
429018,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, N A, Great staff very friendly and helpful Room was spacious and clean with lovely en suite bathroom The breakfast was delicious lots of choice and one of the best yogurts I ve eaten in a long time Although the hotel is situated near busy roads we stayed on the fifth floor and couldn t hear any noise of the traffic at all 
429019,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, WIFI available but very hard to connect when u are in the room No restaurants open except for breakfast , Nice modern hotel with spacious rooms Good location Very close to ring round The staff was good and friendly
429020,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Breakfast has no many choices and it is very poor Wifi available but very hard to comnect when u are in the room Its a bit far from the city center, Modern hotel clean room and bathroom is brand new staff friendly
429021,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, T hat a facility of this caliber does not have Wi Fi in the room and makes you go to the lobby , Location easy access into town on tram the breakfast bar very clean and most of all accept my small French Bulldog 
429022,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The service No restaurants open except for breakfast The room too small The TV is small The room is not as clean as it should be, The breakfast is accepted but it could be better
429023,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The tranny in charge of breakfast seemed more of a prison warden We being vegetarians wanted to check what they had for breakfast and if we should pay for it She did say yes we can have a look but she literally followed us and asked us to leave before we could even figure out what the cups had in them Hunger took over and we just went for it , Wasn t too far from places to visit Wasn t right at the heart so it was calm Staff was friendly and helpful except one Breakfast was good 
429024,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The location is a bit far from downtown but it s near the Belvedere , The hotel was really clean and cozy helpful stuff Though it was located near the hiway we didn t hear the traffic noise Free parking spot 
429025,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, The staff are slick and unhelpful and do not go out of their way to assist As an Austrian I cringed at the rudeness with which guests from overseas were treated at breakfast and as someone coming to Vienna often I was a bit surprised by the ugliness of the surroundings and the walk to the nearest underground 8 10 unpleasant minutes I had booked in a hurry looking for a hotel with car park and forgetting that parking is free in Vienna from Friday night till Monday morning and not realizing either that the excellent long term car parks in Vienna are just as close to town as this hotel So certainly no need to do without the charm of genuinely Viennese hotels in the city centre because of one s car , The rooms were impeccably clean the beds rather comfortable 
429026,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, A hotel for business trips more than leisure i would say , The hotel was fine a bit far from city centre We had to take the tram or metro for around 15 mins to reach the centre of vienna

429029,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, Poor selection for breakfast said in booking we would get executive room in one of top floors got 4 with no view Said also free welcome drink but didn t get it , Free parking easy travel to city centre
429030,Austria Trend Hotel Doppio Wien, There was no balcony or a great view to the city but actually this wasn t something that bothered me , very good breakfast the staff was polite free parking high speed wireless 3 4 minutes drive from city center if you don t have a car there is a bus tram stop in front of the hotel and you can get in the city center in about 5 6 stops I think
