481702,Armani Hotel Milano, I honestly can not find a reason why anyone should choose this hotel I was planning to buy some Armani furniture so I decided to stay here but for anyone with a real genuine taste for quality and luxury I am sure there are better options in Milan , This hotel is very mediocre Nothing genuinely exciting about it 
481703,Armani Hotel Milano, It s tough to pinpoint something to get to your room from the street you have to first take an elevator to the lobby floor and then another back down to your room which is a bit complicated , Immerse into a full Armani experience starting for the good looking bellboys to a remarkable SPA experience and of course Armani style rooms with all features you expect from a luxury Hotel On top you re ideally located just a few minutes from the fashion district and the Duomo di Milan as well as a waste choice of restaurants 
481704,Armani Hotel Milano, All controls work from an iPad including the lights My only snag is that when I want to turn the lights off to go to sleep I have to control it from the iPad Similarly if I want to turn the light on in the middle of the night , We checked in after Milan s Design Week so it was relatively quiet We were upgraded to a room with two sided balcony with a 45 degree view of Milan Wonderful huge bathroom with separate rain shower booth and toilet and his her wash basins and a long bath Toiletries are signature fragranced Armani and towels are fluffy Drinks in the fridge are inclusively free and replaced everyday Pure luxury 
481705,Armani Hotel Milano, The restaurant was a disappointment I thought it would be better The event of meet the chef with the visiting chef was a let down , The service was prompt and it was a comfort that they revolve around your needs and accommodate to your timing not the other way around 
481706,Armani Hotel Milano, The free mini bar is great but only non alcoholic drink items are stocked You can order alcohol from room service but be ready to pay a pretty penny , Was assigned a lovely corner room on the top floor with a large balcony and glass fa ade wrapping round the room Great staff and nice amenities 
481707,Armani Hotel Milano, The lighting in the rooms especially in the bathroom could have been less cool and sometimes new cool bathroom fittings are just not practical It took me a while to understand how to get the water running at the right temperature in the shower , A very cool hotel with all the newest technology The staff were all very friendly and did everything to make our stay momorable 
481708,Armani Hotel Milano, U have to change the lifts to exit the property lifts buttons didnt work immediatly we had to push it many times , Location facilities and service Attention to details staff is freindly and welcoming Everything was perfect
481709,Armani Hotel Milano, Light controls are luminescent too bright for sleeping Hotel noted my efforts to cover them and placed fitted covers without prompting next day Shower control also fiddly Bathroom floor dries quickly but can be very slippery when wet , We liked the proportions of the room large bathroom and separate closet Underfloor heating always a treat in winter Housekeeping second to none Good sized and well equipped gym Great cafe Excellent restaurant Very good and timely room service Perfect internet connection for business Kettle and coffee machine We felt an immediate bond a sense of quiet wellbeing privacy intimacy and class We look forward to returning Excellent staff throughout 
481710,Armani Hotel Milano, Rooms while spectacularly outfitted were a bit dark I suspect those facing the street are better , Service was great Very helpful and professional Spa area was very nice 
481711,Armani Hotel Milano, Absolutely nothing , The service was wonderful the facilities provided with the room and all the extras were fantastic I loved everything about my stay 
481712,Armani Hotel Milano, Was perfect , very design hotel and I love the upside down aspect where the check in and restaurant and bar is on the top floor of the hotel very cool 
481713,Armani Hotel Milano, I would have expected a much better hair dryer for a hotel like this , The deco is very chic The room is spacious Staff are friendly Food is also not bad 
481714,Armani Hotel Milano,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff Perfect location right next to the shopping district 10 min walk from Duomo and other attractions Delicious food room service late in the evening
481715,Armani Hotel Milano, no, staff very professional and friendly When it was raining day staff proactively prepared umbrella Bed sheet were extremely comfortable Hope can have some product in Hotel available to purchase
481716,Armani Hotel Milano, The lighting of the long corridors were dim kind of depressing, The size of the rooms were good very comfortable beds the interior of the bathrooms is amazing The staff were so friendly the breakfast was so good excellent location close to everything 
481717,Armani Hotel Milano,No Negative, When we arrived we were upgraded with the room one level up and got junior suite for free Room was nice and very moder with smart remote control of main process light blind tv etc if like such style you will be satisfied Our daughter was excited about that But in any case unfortunately room was little bit too small and I hit my foot finger by furniture twice on the way from bathroom Bathroom itself was amazing and show example of functionality and Disign Bar on L flore very nice and we spend nice evening time there Location is great and I could say most convenient if you would like to visit all the shops Our stay was good as usual in Milano 
481718,Armani Hotel Milano,No Negative, Great room service I loved that you could control everything in the room with the tablet The spa and the bar areas are also really great Every staff member that I met was extremely helpful advising me locations that were interesting to visit day and night 
481719,Armani Hotel Milano,No Negative, Hotel Armani is the BEST Incredibly professional and friendly staff with outstanding service I had a fantastic stay One of the best hotel experiences ever 
481720,Armani Hotel Milano, It has to wait several seconds for the water of shower turning to warm and the door of bath room is too heavy it can move autonomously The door squeezed my foot finger its a bad experience I hurry to the flight back home and after 12hour I have to do X ray exam in hospital Fortunately the bone is well But I have to limp for a week , the suits is awesome the iPad control is cool the bed is good the location is good 
481721,Armani Hotel Milano, The carpet on the entrance was dirty , Ideally located and very friendly staff and great service as you d expect from Armani Best of all was the free upgrade to the suit
481722,Armani Hotel Milano, Perhaps a tad expensive , The Armani Hotel is what you d expect of Armani chic efficient modern We adored the view from the lobby and the bar The architecture was cool We were also pleasantly surprised to discover that the staff was warm and the clientele was discreet The restaurants Italian and Nobu were great The rooms were really comfortable and the amenities were generous Free bar 
481723,Armani Hotel Milano, Dining in room the food was not that good and tasty Missing the swimming pool , Its a safe nice hotel located in the center of milan Modern style room nice and elegant The size of the room good enough The atmosphere of the hotel is very relaxing and perfect
481724,Armani Hotel Milano, For me nothing If you don t like modern style then you may not like the style of the hotel but that s just a personal preference , Everything Location is perfect plenty of cafes and shops right at the doorstep of the hotel and only 10mins walk from duomo Close enough for it to be accessible and far enough to escape the crowds great breakfast choices spacious room very high tech you control everything from an iPad used the spa for a manicure and loved it staff are helpful friendly and knowledgeable
481725,Armani Hotel Milano, Value for money could be better Rates are out of this world , Possibly the most luxurious modern hotel in Europe Extremely clean and of high aesthetics

481728,Armani Hotel Milano, I booked a king size bed room and got a bed with 2 mattresses stuck together to make a king size bed Sleeping was very uncomfortable , Service lounge bar 
481729,Armani Hotel Milano, Overpriced hotel I really hated the fact that neighbour s phone woke me up at 7 AM Terible soundproof We could hear everyrhing they were doing in the room next door Bed to small Bath too small Spa too small I really think that anyone should have possibility to lay down in spa So small even if alone inside Only 6 beds in resting area For the most expensive hotel in Milano I expected much more Outdated hotel even it doesn t seem that way on photos , Amazing staff nice location
481730,Armani Hotel Milano,No Negative, Very friendly staff always here to help and assist you All our requests were fulfilled fast and with smile additional bottles of water ironing desk even helping with our flight registration The Gym facilities are 24 hours 7 days a week open even on the night from the 31 12 to 01 01 In SPA and Gym areas everything is super clean and tidy lots of space and not so many people even in peak times Breakfast excellent buffet selection pastries cheeses fruit berries and vegetables cereals etc When arriving ask for a menu on hot dishes And don t be shy to tell the waiter you allergies or simple food preferences all the staff is very friendly and understandable The room is perfectly cleaned twice a day The soundproofing in the room is excellent The mini bar is included in the room price and the selection is good The hotel is ideally situated close to everything places of interest shopping streets and the train station 
481731,Armani Hotel Milano, That we had to leave , Hospitality is at top quality Location atmosphere decoration food and beverage services facilities Simply excellent Even Milan is not our top destination we do come back for the hotel experience 
481732,Armani Hotel Milano, Service was very slow and there was plenty of staff but obviously very young and untrained It took 20 mins to get a drink at the bar Reservations were required for the main bar even for residents which we were not informed about Elevator system very complicated for no reason Hotel is very futuristic with little ambience Everytime I had a refill for a glass of champagne the measure was getting smaller , The location of the hotel was fantastic and very convenient The concierge was really helpful in advising for ongoing travel plans The room was spacious and very clean at all times Breakfast was very enjoyable Great smoking area
481733,Armani Hotel Milano, Pillows are v uncomfortable TV system feels like it s buffering and v poor selection of channels, Staff is amazing General feel of the whole hotel Design

481736,Armani Hotel Milano,No Negative, Everything was perfect I really enjoyed milano during my stay in Armani The toilet is one of a kind I strongly recommend anyone want a piece of mind to stay at Armani 
481737,Armani Hotel Milano, The breakfast was hardly bread butter and some fruits everything else you had to pay for from the menu The theme of the hotel is one big dark toilet with two pieces of furniture They ll only exchange major currencies like dollars And pounds but wont exchange Middle eastern currencies where their only other hotel is So maybe Arab tourists are not their major target either , Location
481738,Armani Hotel Milano, The lift situation is awkward The rooms are very dark Corridors depressing No art Shower is tricky iPad control tedious Difficult to get into the bar, Location excellent Room size good Food good
481739,Armani Hotel Milano, Tiny Reception tiny suite My suite view was the roof of an empty building very slow internet my 3g network was three times better Breakfast has only fruits bread and cereals the rest you have to order and pay from the menu The lightning is too dim everywhere in the hotel and the rooms My friend wasn t allowed in cause she didn t have her id when she came back the next day with her id nobody bothered to ask for it No atm machine in or next to the hotel They wont exchange middle east money and they ll only exchange usd or pounds but the stupid thing about it their only other hotel is in Dubai They have a Huge jeccuzi but not a swimming pool I had a massage in their spa the therapist was friendly but clearly wasn t trained for a five star facility service I could of paid less for something better , The only thing good about this place is location
