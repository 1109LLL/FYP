179623,H tel de Lille, I love the underground breakfast bar but I wish that the coffee was made by hand rather than coming out of a machine , The staff were incredibly helpful and went the extra mile to ensure our connection with a river cruise The bed was a dream I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past few years and their high standard has never varied 
179624,H tel de Lille,No Negative, Very nice boutique hotel Ultra cool Very helpful staff even though we couldn t speak French The rooms are extremely nice Include Clarins soaps and toiletries Then the location is fantastic 4 min walk to the louve 10 min walk to Notre dame Within 5 min to amazing restaurants and options at st Germain and ST Michel restraunts 
179625,H tel de Lille, Very small lift that got confused a few times , Wonderful location facilities and staff My wife is convinced we stayed here 16 years ago I m 50 50 on that 
179626,H tel de Lille,No Negative, We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel de Lille It was in a lovely quiet location just down the road from the Musee d rsay and across the road from The Louvre Easily accessible to public transport and walking distance to Rue St Germain There were lots of little restaurants nearby to walk to for dinner I would highly recommend this property and would definitly stay there again Also very quiet at night 
179627,H tel de Lille,No Negative, Although the room was small it felt spacious due the very high ceiling Bed was very comfy Breakfast was served at lovely hall at the cellar it featured pillars supported ceiling All the staff were very helpful and friendly Excellent location 
179628,H tel de Lille, Room was smaller than expected as was the bathroom Very limited privacy regarding the toilet arrangements You certainly leave with no secrets , Very pleasent staff perfect location Very comfortable bed 
179629,H tel de Lille, We stayed three nights in this hotel in mid May 2017 Our room was on the top 5th floor The Booking description included free wifi However in the 3 days and nights we stayed there we experienced a total of about 30 minutes wifi access Apparently the signal does not reach to the top floor and I was told that it was almost as bad on the 4th floor The office manager did not seem too concerned with the situation although I reminded her on a daily basis We had planned to use smartphone maps in the evenings in order to plan the next days activities Not having wifi in the room was for us devastating When we checked out I mentioned the wifi issue again and asked for a reduction in price due to the fact that the hotel s description on Booking com clearly did not match reality The office manager refused any kind of compensation for us and seemed not to care My advice avoid this place or at least the 4th and 5th floors if you are expecting 21st century accommodations , Excellent location 10 minute walk to the Louvre many other famous attractions within 30 minute walk
179630,H tel de Lille,No Negative, The owner of the hotel was very nice and accommodating Our room was stylish and comfortable The bed linens were luxurious The Clarins products in the bathroom were a a nice surprise 
179631,H tel de Lille,No Negative, The room and bathroom were absolutely beautiful and my room was upgraded at no additional charge The staff were extremely helpful and friendly I was staying alone and felt extremely safe The staff also spoke English very well It was very hot in Paris the day I visited and was excited that my room had air conditioning as many other Paris hotels do not Overall this was an amazing stay this is one of my favorite hotels 
179632,H tel de Lille, The Junior Suite I booked for three was very small and it was hard to move around as the sleeper bed was not made up and put away every day but rather left out The Room cleaning service was also very slow and sometimes my room was not made up by 16 00 which is unacceptable I would recommend more service ladies to assist in getting the rooms cleaned by at least 13 00 14 00 There was also supposed to be a night turn down service that we never experienced in our 7 day stay The Showers were temprental and we had to wait almost 5 10 minutes for hot water which I find umacepatble , I thought the Hotel was in a nice location and Close to all shops and key attractions It is also only a 5 min walk to the main C line that links to all underground tubes in and around Paris It is in a quite road so noise is minimal Staff were very helpful and pleasant The Linen was fresh and clean and the rooms though small were exquisitely decorated 
179633,H tel de Lille,No Negative, The hotel is in a great safe location Centrally located to many attractions museums as well as public transportation The staff especially Angelina Amelia Hassan were extremely helpful friendly and professional 
179634,H tel de Lille, Fantastic unbeatable location But The rooms are weeeeeeeeensy Even their suite is weensy We adjusted to the cramped quarters after the first 24 hours but it s tough to find space for luggage and clothes if you are staying for longer than 2 nights , The hotel with the ulitmate location five minutes from the Louvre 20 minutes from the Luxembourg Gardens five minutes from the Musee D Orsay 20 minutes from Notre Dame The location can t be beat 
179635,H tel de Lille, The entire hotel was tiny Tiny rooms tiny elevator etc slightly claustrophobic No room for luggage Safe was not bolted in so was useless to us , Walking distance to many tourist attractions and close to subways Very friendly knowledgeable staff who have excellent English language skills It was a big part of our historic French experience 
179636,H tel de Lille,No Negative, Hotel location is great room cleanness and decoration was wonderful the staff of this hotel were remarkable I can t thank them enough all were great and special thanks to Angelina in particular for her great kindness and support I m strongly recommending this hotel and for sure I will stay there gain 
179637,H tel de Lille, The bathroom in the room was not comfortable at all toiletries were changed only when requested lift was out of order until repaired construction at the entrance, Staff Location books about paris in the room
179638,H tel de Lille, small room though it was well set out and made the most of the space , Great location lovely hotel and helpful staff Nicely fitted bedroom and bathroom
179639,H tel de Lille, Nothing, We received a room upgrade which was gratefully appreciated after weeks of travelling Europe The staff were so professional friendly and we re helpful with tips and directions The hotel has its own personalised bed linen and the bed beautifully comfortable with one quilt not two small quilts like others Clarins complimentary bath products So close to great restaurants the Seine museums all an easy walk We didn t avail ourselves of breakfast there as we ate later and bistros are close by A quiet neighbourhood 
179640,H tel de Lille,No Negative, The staff were so helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble Exceptionally so in my opinion Very very clean and tidy no external or internal noise 
179641,H tel de Lille, The room was really small and it was hard to regulate the heating, Location is perfect so many wonderful Paris sights on the doorstep and surrounded by great places to eat and drink Could not have been better The staff are really friendly and accommodating and everyone speaks great English 
179642,H tel de Lille, Nothing , We had a wonderful time this time around in Paris and genuinely this was mostly down to this amazing hotel Location cannot be rivalled the staff are the most friendly and knowledgeable people you could meet and our room was beautiful I really can t stress enough how much we loved it Thank you Hotel de Lille your fantastic team
179643,H tel de Lille, Have no negative comments, Location excellent Staff extremely helpful pleasant Rooms so comfortable Best shower and surprised the hotel supplied Clarins products in Bathroom I have only praise for this hotel Will go back again 
179644,H tel de Lille, The cleaning of the rooms could probably have been a bit more organised , This is an exceptional hotel located in a great part of the city It s central to the main attractions yet away from the hussle and bussle of the city 
179645,H tel de Lille, Room space is quite small I think it is normal in Paris , I love decoration and modern style The hotel is located very near to Musee D Orsay and train station The location is not crowded and easy to get to metro Concierge service is impressive and very helpful Thank you Mr Mahmoud we were very happy 
179646,H tel de Lille, If like us you need constant access to good wifi for business purposes it s a bit flakey but that is being a bit picky It s certainly not a reason to stop you coming here , Really comfortable bed and high quality bed linen Exceptionally clean hotel The staff are all very friendly and helpful and Mairie has a very good command of English You can t fault the location of this hotel with the Mus e d Orsay Louvre and Mus e d Orangerie all within walking distance The hotel is surrounded by restaurants art galleries and antique shops and you could easily spend a few hours wandering around these without even going to the museums It is also in a very quiet location which is a huge bonus in a big city Taxis everywhere so it s easy to travel if you don t want to take public transport or walk Cost us approximately 20 to the Gare du Nord 
179647,H tel de Lille,No Negative, staff exceptionally friendly and extremely helpful with all required information very clean and new and comfortable and still had charm buffet and cont breakfast both good would recommend highly
179648,H tel de Lille,No Negative, Location was fabulous for tourists Taking the Batobus is a must Whole staff was a joy to converse with very knowledgeable and helpful Marie was so much fun and even taught us to speak French Merci beaucoup Marie and all

179650,H tel de Lille, Nothing , A wonderful place to stay location is superb quite at night The hotel was just renovated but still has that old charm A beautiful lady at reception who is delightful We stayed in the suite attic baby and me and my husband Good size for Paris If you are travelling as a couple or solo this place is perfect 
179651,H tel de Lille, The only downside was the rooms were smaller than I d expected not much space to move about but that s for most bit cities really Also I really missed a kettle in the room to make a cup of tea after a long day sightseeing, Hotel staff extremely friendly and helpful Hotel handy to Musee D orsay metro station and one street back from the Seine so handy to all attractions 
179652,H tel de Lille,No Negative, Staff very helpful little touches like early access to the room extended check out advice about very nice not too expensive restaurants nearby Hotel recently refurbished small rooms but good standard and well equipped Location is by far the highlight a few minutes away from The Louvre We will return to Paris and this hotel will be my first choice 
179653,H tel de Lille,No Negative, The staff was very friendly The room was quiet nice interior very modern Several cafes and two Metro stations minutes away The Michelin guide on the generously equipped bookshelf came in handy while picking places for lunch and dinner 
179654,H tel de Lille,No Negative, The rooms were compact but very well designed and comfortable making exceptional use of the space Our e 3 children stayed in a suite across the hall which was very convenient and worked out well 
179655,H tel de Lille, The walls in weren t totally sound proof we could hear loud talking in the neighbouring room Fortunately they went to bed early , Very nice hotel there s negative reviews but they were before the refit It s now a very smart hotel 
179656,H tel de Lille, Room was extremely small we couldn t even have our luggage open and still open the restroom door , Very welcoming staff modern rooms well equipped and comfortable bed 
179657,H tel de Lille, Room very small shower cubicle very small Would not recommend to anyone over 10 stone , Superb tv set up Loads of music playlists including 128 rock classics 
179658,H tel de Lille, WiFi signal was weak at times , Great location Quiet comfortable room and bed Modern large bathroom Fresh air in room and had air conditioning Everything about this hotel we loved 
179659,H tel de Lille, Closet space was limited , Clean modern room Nice staff Convenient location easy walks to the Louvre Musee d Orsay St Germain etc Within close walking distance of the Seine Lots of interesting shops galleries and restaurants close by 
179660,H tel de Lille, Room was very small lack of toiletries safe wasn t working in the room and it was placed very high up I m 5ft 10 no where to hang dresses breakfast was lacking in fresh fruit, The bed was very comfortable the room was spotless staff were great Especially the Mamoot on the front desk
179661,H tel de Lille,No Negative, We found the Hotel de Lille a great place to stay The staff hosting the breakfast were accommodating and gracious the breakfast great The room was appointed beautifully the bed was perfect and Mahmoud who was running the front desk was a great representative for your hotel Mahmoud was friendly engaging efficient and helpful We hope to come back to Paris and the Hotel de Lille Sincerely Phil Eastley
179662,H tel de Lille, Tiny room Hardly any room next to the bed to stand Second day new towels and the bed was made no new ammenities no cleaning up of the room bathroom for the rest mirror floor shower shelf bit pricey , Very tasteful well equipped nice rooms very comfy bed small but nice bathroom Good location 10 20 min walk to downtown St Germain 5 minutes to the Louvre Toulleries Good in room breakfast Good Air Cond 
179663,H tel de Lille, The rooms were small but that s how it is in Paris , Location was great rooms were clean and quiet staff was very welcoming Would defenately return 
179664,H tel de Lille, Room was not cleaned and the cleaner did not come back even when she said she would Room could have been a bit bigger, Very clean Well designed room had everything we wanted Great location for 6th and 7th and the river Air conditioning was excellent Lots of nice touches e g nespresso machine
179665,H tel de Lille, staff very ignorant even though we gave them a copy of printed booking they tried and insisted that the price booked through booking com was for 1 room Not very smart by the reception, comfortable and clean
179666,H tel de Lille, Rooms are small but everything else outweighed anything that is minor , Mahmoud plus other staff were attentive to all our needs Made it special for us Located within walking distance to Louvre and we walked to Eiffel Tower 2 6km but flat and easy 
179667,H tel de Lille, The room is very small, The location is good but 500m from a metro The room is nicely decorated Nespresso coffee machine in the room good service very clean 
179668,H tel de Lille, There is no view from the window And one more detail if you will ask to call for a taxi from the hotel be ready to pay extra We came from airport to hotel for fix price 55 and way back we paid 65 driver just said I m putting 7 more cause u didn t catch me on the street which is totally strange but still in the end it s 65 anyway the taxi driver was totally unhelpful So my propose to hotel manager to find better taxi company for future , Hotel is clean nice very friendly staff Location perfect around of 500 m you will have a great bakery with fresh croissant D orsay museum and Louvre and St German neighborhood with a lot of shops cafes etc I would decently want to come back here Thank you Call taxi in advance 24 hours before will cost you 18 person I wish we would new this before 
179669,H tel de Lille,No Negative, There is not a lot one can say against this hotel pretty much everything was great The rooms as very small but this is Paris and the toilets are quite impersonal all noises are very clear but if that s not an issue then its a great place to stay 
179670,H tel de Lille, Slightly over priced considering the small size of the room tiny desk tiny wardrobe , Lovely location in a quiet street just round the corner from Quai d Orsay Room was stylishly decorated and had an impressive library of books large flat screen TV and very nice bathroom including double size shower Breakfast was all good 
179671,H tel de Lille, The only issue that I had was that the tile in the bathroom was cracked and loose But that is France for you because of the high cost of labor in France little things often go unrepaired , The hotel was very well kept the staff were very polite 
179672,H tel de Lille, Bathroom was located down three steps off the bedroom which was tricky to negotiate in the night , Excellent location Very quiet but close to everything we wanted to see Plenty of restaurants and caf s nearby Warm and comfortable Staff friendly and helpful 
179673,H tel de Lille,No Negative, Fabulous location and the staff were friendly and helpful Mahmoud was great in helping us with restaurant bookings and taxis The room was modern and spotlessly clean and while not huge it was very spacious given the location Good wifi too and we had the added bonus of a small private terrace 
179674,H tel de Lille, Nothing, Great location which is very evident from the city map 5 to 20 min walk to the most famous sightseeings But my best reference is not to the location but to the hotel personnel All of them are very friendly and of high assistance All personnel speaks very good English which makes comfortable stay for tourists who don t speak French Rooms are renovated and cozy Additional words about the location being in the very heart of the city the street is extremely quiet huge bonus The best hotel I ve ever stayed in Paris
179675,H tel de Lille, Hotel advertised that they had room service but this was not the case , Beautiful boutique hotel in a good location Close walk to Musee D Orsay and the Louvre Staff were friendly and check in was smooth Rooms are beautiful modern and of high quality 
179676,H tel de Lille, We have booked a room with two single beds but when we arrived we saw that 1 double bed which is formed by 2 singles They wanted to seperate it but they should have done it before we arrived Also the room was different then we have expected because we have stayed in a room that we havent seen while booking it The room facing to the backyard , The location was great great The hotel was realy clean and neat Staff was really helpful 
179677,H tel de Lille, Room is too small, My flight arrived early in the morning and the staff offered me an early check in saved my life The room is clean stylish Nice French breakfast 
179678,H tel de Lille,No Negative, The rooms are small but very efficient Last year renovated with modern touch The beds are great and it is very quite at night Highly recommended if you need a good rest 
179679,H tel de Lille,No Negative, I have to be honest this was my first time going to Paris so I was very nervous about choosing a hotel online I was looking for a hotel close to some of the museums but not in the heart of the city with ALL this hustle bustle Just as important I wanted a hotel that had employees that spoke English and was very clean especially the bathroom I m very picky This hotel surpassed all my expectations Not only was is right down the street from the Louvre and the Musse D Orsay but it was close to great restaurants and the staff was amazing Very polite and helpful It was a breath of fresh air and I recommend it highly I would without a doubt stay there again Thumbs up 
179680,H tel de Lille,No Negative, Very convenient location near the Orsay Museum but it is still in a quiet posh residential area with a lot of high end restaurants Reception staff are very friendly 
179681,H tel de Lille,No Negative, We didn t realize until we arrived that the hotel was in the VERY last stage of renovation I don t know what it looked like before but we loved our experience It s a small intimate kind of setting The room was affordable and spacious enough for two people and also our luggage Modern decor Room had a street view but was not loud An occasional siren in the morning but nothing overnight The bathroom was completely redone and high end equipped with fancy amenities including a hand towel warmer There is always a staff member at the desk 24 7 You are asked to leave your room key behind when you leave which makes sense No risk of losing and someone is always there to answer the front door Location in the city is key Right by the Museum d orsay and corresponding metro stop We re from NYC and like to walk so we walked to the Eiffel Tower another time to the Marais but did make use of the convenient subway stop Free wifi I had a personal and work iphone going at the same time and service was fast Do not stay here if you require room service 24 7 but if you re looking for a quaint very well located hotel with completely new and modern decor it was September so they hadn t yet unwrapped the gas fireplace in the lobby and want a nice quiet kind of fancy way to retire to your room book As we were leaving the nice woman in the lobby after calling us a taxi said We hope to see you again They will
