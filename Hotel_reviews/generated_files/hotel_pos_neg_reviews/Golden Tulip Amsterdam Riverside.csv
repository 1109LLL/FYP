422999,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Missing toiletries and hairdryer not working in room Near motorway, Hotel and room modern and update facilities Helpful and very friendly staff Nice walk through local park to hotel Metro close by Clean
423000,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, You can see in the room that it was really used already The small renovation is needed Or just can start to wash walls we have in room dirty spoon for all 4 days what we stayed Nothing big but not nice for 4 hotel No mini bar If you arrive after 11 PM on a work day you can t buy water not in the restaurant and as well not in reception , The restaurant had tasty food The room was spacious 
423001,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Not enough coffee tea milk considering the cost of room Not enough toiletries for 2 people again considering the price of the room Hotel not easy to find from metro better signposting would be better There is a large park at the entrance and easy to get lost would not feel safe if we arrived at night , Beds were comfortable Lovely room view nice fluffy towels 
423002,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The shower wasn t very powerful though it did work ok , Very comfy bed and we loved the view out of our bedroom window We couldn t get going in the morning for watching boats go past 
423003,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Very rude reception staff Ignored us answering the phone in front of us when already waiting and let people queue jump on check out Hairs in bed , Very quiet and pleasant location 
423004,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Cleaning of the room was very bad One time coming back to our room we discovered blanket forgotten on the armchair Another time the was no toiletries coffee tea and sugar and one of the trashbins was still full Moreover nobody washed empty cups I had to do it myself in order to drink coffee Come on it is 4 star hotel all after all It there are such rules give your guests dish washing soap and sponge Water in shower was flowing too slowly for comfortable washing Kettle was also almost broken , Location near park and water We had really beautiful view Also breakfast must be good as I heard but I haven t experienced it 
423005,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Thr food made us sick and get diarrhea also the service is horrible The food was absolutely atrocious, If I have to say what I like it was nice having a balcony
423006,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is far from city center it costs us 36 euros of taxi fee to go from the hotel to the main square of Amsterdam , The decor is modern facility is new 
423007,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Read the book that is provided in every room telling you about the facilities and rules of the hotel some things were not specified when the book states other wise for example a card is supposed to be in the mini fridge with packag deals yet nothing could be found Carpet wasn t the cleanest on arrival either , Loved the remote area outside of the centre of Amsterdam Only 21 minutes direct metro to Amsterdam central only difficultly is it costs a pretty penny to travel back later on on the evening as the mwtro stops running at 9pm on week days
423008,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Hotel is a little way out of Amsterdam and nearest metro station is about a 7 minute walk not good if weather is bad as a taxi won t take you to the station from hotel as journey is too short, Hotel staff were very friendly and room is lovely and modern had a love view overlooking the river 
423009,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Dreadful evening meal had fish and chips very poor quality fish So bad decided not to have breakfast there and went in to Amsterdam for food, price was very good about 8 miles away from Amsterdam though easy to get to via Metro line about 7 mins walk from station to hotel in countryside Quiet location room backed to river very nice
423010,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location is remoted what is not good for active people but if you want to enjoy the riverside it s ideal We liked it , Good hotel for quite rest after crazy Amsterdam 
423011,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I didn t like the smell either , Not much I liked the location was horrible 20 minute walk to the nearest subway which takes another 30 minutes to get to the center of Amsterdam The hotel won t even offer a shuttle service to said train stop 
423012,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Not in the center of the city To get to the central station you need 15 min walk and 20 in the metro , Very clean nice view on the river side Close to metro station 15 min walk not less lobby and restaurants are nice i like it Really nice place outside amsterdam to stay with good price I recommend for couple or family tourists 
423013,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It was dirty as soon as we entered the room I mentioned that white blankets are in brown and pink spoils No one pays attention to please clean the room sign I knew it was far but not that far One trip via uber to centre 35 50 eur Metro 1 km away and takes ages to get to central station Menu in the restaurant consists just from several types of meal , The only plus of hotel is a relaxing view and more or less friendly staff especially waiters at the restaurant 
423014,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is far from anywhere and even to get the public transportation you have to walk 10 minutes It is for groups travelling in organized trips and not for lone travelers as you will spend lots of money on Taxi or will have to rent a car The balconies are connected and door locks to the balcony broken harming your self security feeling After 10 oclock you will either have tpo travel to the city paying back and forth 60 euros for a taxi or you will stay hungry as there is no more food is served You can always order online a meal like I did but I do not recommend as I had to wait for an hour and the food quality was bad, It has a nice nature next to it and is located on the riverfront The staff is what makes it a bit better than what it is 
423015,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location is terrible Its in the middle of no ware They charge for parking on their premises despite the fact that its far to any civilisation No shops nearby to buy things The location is my main concern then the building is outdated The curtain is turn and patched The bath is blocked Cant wait to get out of the place , The breakfast is not bad 
423016,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, We traveled to the center everyday for food as the hotel breakfast did not have great options and the price was 16euro which is way too much The bar did not have a great atmosphere and was full of bored staff rather than a welcoming face or fun for that matter we felt uncomfortable ordering drinks , The hotel is great value for money for Amsterdam as most properties in the center are very expensive It is approx ten mins from public transport to Gaserplas station which will take you directly to the centre of Amsterdam It is quiet and modern facilities the bed was extremely comfortable and the room had air conditioning and a good shower The room had beautiful view of the river with boats coming through each day in addition to a mini fridge in the room to store beverages which was cheaper for us regarding alcohol 
423017,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, When I booked the room I saw the hotel have parking place for the car But when we arrived and asked about parking the receptionist told us that parking cost 12 50Eur per day So we stayed for 3 days and we had to pay 37 50Eur extra for the car parking I think hotel must to inform about parking fees or do not publish on booking com about free parking for the cars , Big room Hotel really far away from the center but You can reach everything You need with public transport 
423018,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, No washcloths in the room The shower door only covered half the openingfor the shower so water went all over the floor Bathroom could have been updated a bit The restaurant staff was very rude and ignored us sitting there for more than 10 minutes No one even greeted us when we entered the restaurant I recommend eating elsewhere , The bed was very soft and comfy One of the most comfy I ve had in Europe We really loved the view of the river 
423019,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The staff were not friendly one member of the reception team was having a stand up fight with another visitor on our arrival not a great first impression Housekeeping was hit and miss mainly miss Room supplies were not refreshed with any sort of regularity we had to ask for supplies every single day The room was a little tired looking Bathroom fittings were plastic y no quality feel for what was supposed to be a deluxe room Terribly overpriced for the standard provided , The beds and pillows were very comfortable The room was quiet 
423020,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Mattress and sheets were quite worn out , Very fast check in good internet connection big room and bathroom walkable distance to a tube station nice view on the river during breakfast 
423021,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, The hotel itself was located about 25 30min from the centre which is easily accessible You have to walk a little from the station to the hotel but it s not a problem and pretty straight forward The room twin room was perfectly fine and clean shower facilitates Slept well thanks to the black out curtains Would stay again 
423022,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Coffee in rooms awful Re period staff not friendly and somewhat unhelpful, Coffee in restaurant was great and the restaurant staff very helpful and friendly 
423023,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, First I asked for a small surprise for my that was her birthday and they forgot second the TPA in the Hotel does accept debit cards I needed to get a taxi pay 30 to go to an ATM to get money to pay in the hotel because the receptionist when I asked if I could at the check she made a suspicious expression if this wasn t enough I spend 3 nights there and not one single day they clean our room I complain but they didn t care less about us I will come back to holland but never to any hotel of this chain look the pictures I found the room likes this when I arrive from Amesterdam on tu second night complain to the night auditor I work in the hotel business and this is I can t allow terrible experience, Front to the canal
423024,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location is difficult to get to if you don t have a car They say walking distance from Metro but they fail to say it s about a 13min walk and then at least another 25min until you re at Amsterdam Central Station The phone in the room didn t work signage is confusing room numbers sign doesn t accurately take you to the room it s showing This is good if you re driving through but if you re looking for a hotel close to the action this is DEFINITELY NOT IT , Staff was accommodating to the best of their abilities There were a couple issues like room cleanliness and bed type They moved us both times without any issues 
423025,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Checkout arranged for 2pm Call received at 12pm asking us to leave Maid slamming doors after doors from 9am No power in the shower Facilities in the room not replaced bathroom mugs coffee Weak unreliable internet Road access via Lange Stammerdijk Driemond closed and not advertised anywhere we ran an 80 EUR taxi fare for having to turn back , Spacious rooms 
423026,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Having to walk long distance from Gaasperlas station to the hotel THE HOTEL CAN IMPROVE MORE ON THE SITTING AROUND THE RIVERSIDE VIEW , The room cleanliness design Most especially the bed design Breakfast is very good 
423027,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I think it s quite bad that you have to pay for parking at a 4 hotel Also we arrived very late at night and couldn t get any drinks anywhere No vending machine nothing the mini bar in the room was completely empty , Nice and modern hotel Very clean spacious rooms
423028,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It was a long walk from metro station Bed was two singles pushed together so had a gap in the centre, Nice hotel great restaurant recommend the pizzas 
423029,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The lady at the reception was very rude I gave her my passport for check in and after she done she through it on the pench which is not polite at all I felt that she served me with force wishing not too During checkout I requested 30 min extra they said it would cost 20 euros and their reply not in respectful way Plus the location is bad as it is 10 min walk from the nearest public transportation such as the metro Noting is around the hotel in term of facilities Not recommended option, The room space
423030,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location was out the way but the quite and veiw made up for it the two single beds made it difficult to cuddle my spouse, Bar was good after a days walking view reseption always had someone coffee in room was great nice room and shower room
423031,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location is not easy to drive to with major roadbuilding right outside Its at the end of metro line to central Amsterdam Staff messed up the payment through booking com and tried to tell me my card was refused in advance of the stay which is a plain lie I have never had this type of problem in many many booking com bookings before Very disappointing especially as I took the time to respond to an advance request to update card details on the booking which were the same as all bookings I have made in the last couple of years with no problem Obviously the card worked when offered at check in No hint of any apology but at least they allowed me to stay , Facilities quite good as you would expect from a 4 
423032,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Dirty plates in room no toiletries supplied extra 15 euros per day just to park in hotel parking very disappointed and very misleading advertising Will never visit again , Absolutely nothing 
423033,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Not the cleanest place I have stayed When I was in the shower I noticed that the walls of the shower had tiny hairs on and when you first turn the shower water on it smells a bit funny I had to let it run for a while , Very comfortable bed 
423034,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The air conditioning emitted a screeching noise that prevented me sleeping so had to turn the air off this was during a very hot spell which also meant I didn t sleep I had to work the next day so I was really unhappy about that The kitchen closes totally at 10 p m so no room service nothing not even a sandwich The hotel is remote I needed cash but there were no ATMs close by Luckily taxis take credit cards ,No Positive
423035,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Nice hotel nice rooms good helpful staff Quiet area Away from city centre with beautiful views out back of hotel very close to the metro which is cheap n very easy to use 
423036,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Our room looked to the stairwell so those using stairs could see into our room when curtains not pulled , Room was beautiful and very spacious Staff were very friendly and excellent service Hotel was immaculate and beautiful Outside terrace was amazing bonus Will visit again 
423037,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, No vending machine for drinks or snacks which was annoying as we were so far out from anything Advertised as no pets but we came face to face with a few dogs 20 mins metro ride to Amsterdam central forget to mention the 20 mins walk to the station as well , The rooms in the property were really nice massive bathrooms and comfy beds The lake at the back was lovely as we were there during a heat wave and were aloud to jump in Staff were all really helpful and friendly and spoke amazing English Short uber ride to the beach lake thing which was amazing when you want to escape the hustle and bustle and enjoy the weather 
423038,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, 40 minutes to the Amsterdam center, Modern and new 4 star hotel near a very beautiful park good restaurant and services If you stay here be sure to have a walk in the park1
423039,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Bed was to soft Cleanness not 100 given especially on the balcony Price to high if you consider cleanness of bathroom balcony and the position of hotel outside of Amsterdam Downtown Didn t try breakfast because of high price better eat in Amsterdam Downtown , Good connection to Highways Easy access to Public Transportation Secure Parking Lots Coffee Maker fridge in room Friendly and helpful staff 
423040,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, If traveling by car best place to stay If travelling by public transport do account for the extra 10 mins walk to the Station , Very nice location calm and restful A little away from the mail city but you can get there in 20 mins roughly Facilities are also very nice Food was good and service very nice The Metro and bus stops are 7 10 mins walk away also has Nigh Bus so you can get back any time without a problem Day time frequency of public transport is nice 
423041,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, dusted room when we asked for extra soaps for shower the receptionist woman was suppriced and not friendly at all we have arranged with the hotel a taxi to come at the airport to picked us up but didnt show up, The surrounding of the hotel The bed
423042,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I didn t realise the hotel was over 30 mins away from the centre so it wasn t ideal for the purpose of our trip which was sightseeing The cleanliness wasn t great eg there was a vomit stain outside the entrance for the duration of our stay there were glasses in the corridor for 4 nights outside our room not ours Train station is 10 min walk which is fine but not ideal if you get back quite late as it s in a bit of a remote area , Helpful staff nice hotel 
423043,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The staff were uniformly indifferent except for one guy we meet on the last day Walking to the property from the Metro late at night was a little scary , There was nothing special about the property that we liked 
423044,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, We didn t experienced something bad , Location was very good for us It is close to metro station in walking distance It is by a nice river It was very nice to drink beer in the garden by the river and watch wild birds and rabbits They have a free parking area which is very rare in Amsterdam 
423045,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Expensive for the accommodation provided The room was not so clean and there was no storage for clothes The room consists of 2 beds pushed together which separate during the night a small desk with no drawers open hanging space and a block of wood from a tree to sit on I would advise other travelers to find other accommodation closer to the city This hotel is 13 kms from central station The closest metro station is 1 kilometer , Not much at all 
423046,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Reception staff were very friendly and very helpful room was lovely and clean and a good size The only down side was that it is on the outskirts of Amsterdam so costs quite a bit for a taxi from the train station to the hotel However it is easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam a ten minute walk and a 20 minute metro ride and you are there the plus side is that it is nice and quiet Lovely park nearby to walk through as well 
423047,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I didn t really like anything about the property My first room was dirty with stains on the floor The lock on my balcony door was broken and I was told that it could be looked at the next day I was charged 12 for a plug when it stated the reception would borrow me one in the welcome pack It was only a use plug so I couldn t use my strainers I feel robbed and unhappy about with the price I paid for this hotel , I don t like the property 
423048,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Hotel room was not clean The cups for coffee were not clean too , Hotel was very far from center but was near to metro station So easy access to public transportation Staff was very nice 
423049,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It was too expensive for what it was this hotel is in the countryside After the train you have to walk along the road for about 10 or 15 minutes , the restaurant personal was very nice the young woman 
423050,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location was extremely poor 10km outside the city sits alone surrounded by motorway 20 minute walk to the nearest metro no shops close by and no supplies in hotel You would think the tea coffee was coming out of the receptionist s salary given how tight she was with it I feel the hotel description was very misleading re distance views We had room 203 The river view was was a stagnant pond The bed was uncomfortable with a huge dent in middle We couldn t open windows and air con screeched There were smears on the wall The bathroom was nice but no bath which we needed after long days of walking Restaurant was poor and very overpriced We spent a fortune travelling to and fro hotel Amsterdam itself is extremely expensive and we will not return , Nothing 
423051,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Change the staff to people who are friendly and helpful Clean the rooms to a better standard Change the dirty and heavily stained carpets Provide decent food at breakfast , Breakfast was inedible disgusting we both left without eating the scrambled eggs which was cold as was the bacon which was also extremely hard and over cooked Would never go near this hotel again Staff not helpful in any way at all 
423052,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, One of the girls on duty on the 6th of may needs proper customer care training i arrived at 7 pm and she was very rude cause i was were to check in nasty attitude, Room was ok
423053,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The fact that we had arranged an early check in which was confirmed by the hotel staff in writing but they did not actually arrange anything As such we had to check in after our day in Amsterdam No apologies nothing only hiding behind the phrase it is an additional service when it is possible I don not mind if the latter is actually the case can even understand it but then you should explicitly state that fact when you are confirming an early check in in writing or make amendments This is just terrible service to be honest ,No Positive
423054,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Kinda noisy at some times The doors slamming expecially Far from the city Closest public transportation is in walking distance though 10 minutes walking and to get to Amsterdam Centraal would take around 30 minutes by metro direct line , Very clean and well equiped rooms Has a gym and a nice restaurant Very friendly and helpfull staff
423055,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The room was a little bit cold for me , All of the staff were helpful and kind I really liked the funny barista girls at the bar They really made everything I asked for with a smile on their face It made my day 
423056,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I had better pillow in hostels Shower water would overflow on the floor and enter whole of the bathroom Staff at the desk rude I asked if possible to check in earlier and was told that need to wait till 2pm or later whilst there were checking out quite a lot of guests I was waiting at reception area no updates When asked another girl if possible to check in at 13 00 she said yes Inconsistency at the desk , Good 3 star superior hotel nowhere near 4 star hotel 
423057,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Being 40 mins away from central Amsterdam 10 min walk to the Metro and a 30 min ride to Centraal Station , The rooms were big and very comfortable A quiet location with surprisingly fast free WiFi 
423058,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Completely disappointing no bath shower and no heating There is just a disabled toilet with a water pipe Staff told me there is a suite upgrade for me but later I found a normal room without bath and I did NOT even get to take shower after long day ,No Positive
423059,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel charged 16 50 euros for breakfast but it was not at all appealing Location was disappointing not the 20 minutes into the centre that they say more like 40 Way out nothing nearby and nowhere to eat locally , Bed was comfortable and at the back it was quiet Nice view from our room
423060,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location was un the middle if nowhere Possible to bet theee nu metro from centre but thats the only connection basically To bet to the airport had to b t metro ticket to centr again train ticket to airport All and all 1 5h from hotel to airport , Room was excellent with super comfy bed and extremely large bathroom 
423061,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The late night concierge is terrible called him to qsk for directions at midnight and as soon I said hello he left me on hold and never picked up again When i arrived for check in he gave us a room with a terrible attitude like if we were bothering him to give us the twin room that we requested when the booking was made he told us yes it is twin is just that the beds are out together but you can pull the apart I want to clarify this was no easy task starting from the weight of the beds how the room is designed and the fact that it was a double mattress meaning only one bed good keep it At the end the real problem was how he was disturbed by this and the terrible attitude he showed towards us and our issue ,No Positive
423062,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location of the hotel was fairly inconvenient since it s quite far from Amsterdam s city centre However for that budget I don t think I can find a four star hotel in the centre of Amsterdam , My friend and I had a room of two single beds looking over to the east which we could see the sunrise It was very spacious comfortable and well furnished There was free gym for those who want some exercises during the trip more or less it s a four star hotel We really enjoyed resting in the room 
423063,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The reception staff were extremely welcoming and helpful however the bar kitchen staff let the score down They had messed up our food order and rather than apologising and making it right they spent a great deal of time blaming each other for the error The female chef in particular was extremely rude they all gave the impression that they couldn t be bothered with us Which is a big let down compared to how lovely the Reception staff were , Amazing beds 
423064,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The rooms weren t perfectly clean I had two rooms for my family and both rooms had broken kettles one kettle was burnt and the other one was full of fungus because someone had left water inside without washing it for a long time Also the drain of the sink in my room was clogged with a hairball and we had to remove it ourselves And finally the safety box in our room was blocked and despite we reported it nobody came over to unblock it The gym is poorly equipped and it was full of insects I went there one night and I came back with 20 mosquito bytes Guys you really need to put a net on the windows of that room or something The hotel is somehow far from the city centre it has a Metro station 15 minute walking distance but taxis are expensive from to the city centre , The hotel is good The rooms are big and confortable the breakfast is delicious and the staff at the restaurant and some persons at the frontdesk are very friendly 
423065,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Air condition was way to laud there was no way that you could be able to sleep with it Bathroom was dirty it looked like it hadn t been cleaned for a while ,No Positive
423066,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Reception staff was rude and unfriendly It looks expencive at first sight but cheap materials and facilities The room was very cold because there was constant stream of cold air under the door and windows also the airconditioner was not able to keep higher temperature although very noisy Pritty far from the city center nearest station is 10 minute walk Expensive breakfast, Big comfortable room
423067,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, While helpful the front desk staff didn t show much warmth The hotel is a little bit budget for a supposed four star and didn t set our world on fire but it was a place to stay and there was nothing wrong with it for the price Parking isn t included Quite far from the city and the local area is a little unpromising mainly busy roads , Cheaper than the hotels in the center of the city so a good cost saving option if you re happy to be a bit further out Metro station is about ten minutes walk away and it s a pleasant enough walk Gated parking is useful River view from the room 
423068,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel was situated in the middle of nowhere It took me and my boyfriend hours to find and there was nobody around to ask for help We had to cut through a park after getting the train and we didn t feel safe at all it was far from the tourist part of Amsterdam we hoped to recive Even walking to the hotel there was no path or pavement A dog walker gave us a lift to our hotel but it s not ideal to stay here if you want city center Amsterdam with the journey taking more than an hour to commute ,No Positive
423069,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location was really difficult to get to or Evan find a local shop We had to get tram or taxi in central station and on the website is says it s a 15 minute walk which isn t true It s 20 minutes on the tram after a 15 minute walk from the hotel to the tram station, I like the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel
423070,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Quite a long and expensive drive to see the sites Would have been great to have some more information about what was available to see closer to the hotel , Extremely friendly and helpful staff much nicer than at the sister location in the city centre Very good breakfast Excellent coffee 
423071,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, They called a cab for us who didn t turn up and swore at us when we tried to call In the binder in our room they said you could order room service breakfast by leaving a sign on our door We did this but didn t receive breakfast , The bed was so comfortable and huge which was great The restaurant was lovely and great staff at the restaurant very attentive and the food was delicious 
423072,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Upon arrival with my partner we were made pay a deposit of 70 This was not specified when booking Disgraceful, Beds were very comfortable and rooms were clean
423073,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location had to walk 15 minutes from the last subway stop 40 45 minutes total to get to the city center , Comfortable bed nice restaurant overall a nice quiet hotel 
423074,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Quite isolated location without restaurants etc close by Paying for parking at outskirts of A dam is ridiculous Similar hotel options with free parking close by , Clean modern room and bathroom Next to freeway exit Free WiFi
423075,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Faded glory Old fashioned bathroom Limited television channels Very high price for such level of services , It was the only hotel available at short notice and at a convenient location Tasteful local dishes on the menu 
423076,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, needed to place borg at front desk to be able to put dinner on my hotel room bill thus had to pay separately and go back to my room for payment means Wifi is way too slow please upgrade world is streaming nowadays,No Positive
423077,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The reception staff that I encountered both male were really unfriendly and spoiled my impression of this recently renovated hotel with their overly pompous manner If there is a next time I know now not to try and engage with them but to treat them with utter contempt , Comfortable room and the view over the lake at the back of the hotel 
423078,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, This motel is outside amsterdam basically in a field but charges 12 50 per day parking complete with annoying ticket system Moved rooms due to toilet constantly spewing water second room wasn t much better The heating couldn t cope with the freezing weather so the room was cold and the aircon loud There are much better hotels around schiphol ,No Positive
423079,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Rude staff No bars on terrace , Great pizza Some helpful reception staff Kim one young looking girl in glasses and a few gentlemen I couldn t catch their names One of the mature staff from the females was very rude and unhelpful though 
423080,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Grubby walls and cigarettes on the balcony , It was a nice hotel about ten mins walk to the metro which took 20 mins to central station room Could have done with being a little cleaner crubby marks on the walls and cigarette ends on the balcony floor But other than that overall God room Bed was very comfortable 
423081,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location very bad on edge of a motorway and far from metro station and busses and cash point and shops Far from city centre Bed linen was dirty on arrival Gym poorly equiped , Staff helpful Restaurant good value 
423082,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The room has some maintenance work to repaint the window ledges This is general wear and tear that you would have in any hotel , Excellent and peaceful location with great transport links to Amsterdam central Staff were very friendly and happy to help and answer any questions I had 
423083,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Only got 1 extra pillow we both sleep with 2 and they wouldn t give us a second one Also there was a little walk to the station it was okay but after a long day in Amsterdam centre you just want to get back , Was a whole good experience Great staff and very helpful The room and hotel was lovely Very clean and nice Food was amazing 
423084,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I didn t like the fact that the bathroom facilities wasn t fully functioning the ahoer overflowed I don t know if the drain was blocked or the floor tiles wasn t slanted enough for the excess water in the shower cubical but other than that slight issue can t say a bad word , The bed was so comfy and the lunch meal we had was beautiful 
423085,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, I loved it here It s only a 15 minute taxi ride from airport costing 55 euros it s out of the way from the center so it s nice and peaceful The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable The metro station to town is only 10 min walk from hotel and takes around 20 mins to central Amsterdam The staff were very helpfull I would recommended this place to anyone 
423086,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Its nothing to dislike about this property , Amazing location not close to city but quite and lovely environment Will strongly recommends to those who love nature and need piece of mind 
423087,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location not great Good public transport connections but quite out of the way and don t run all night , Very clean and comfortable room with polite friendly staff Affordable for Amsterdam on a weekend

423089,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The local metro wasn t working due to work being done but a shuttle was every 5 10 mins was a 10 min walk to the hotel from there , Lovely room great shower staff where fantastic nothing was to much of a problem 
423090,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location is outside Amsterdam You can go via metro around 20 minutes and then 10 minutes walking Also the breakfast is so expensive , The room was so comfortable 
423091,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Already mentioned Desk staff could have chatted and been frienlier It wasent that bussy Not shown Pet rooms as i have a dog and super to know there are pets rooms, I needed rest as my daughter was getting married and got married on the friday This was perfect The view over the canal the meadows and forest in the background sunrise and natural beauty was exactly what i needed to start my day as nature is my healer I did not make use of vacilities except for dinner once the Salmon was delicious Even though i was there from monday to sturday i found the staff could have been a little friendlier and made a little chat Different to someone just there for a day However they where not unfriendly On asking to see the rooms if one comes with a pet as i have a dog i was unfortunenately not shown the room which is a pity after being there for 5 days As This hotel is perfect 5mins from my daughter and so close to the meadows and forest for walks so it would have been nice to just have a look where the rooms are situated and what they look like Room158 was wonderful Spacious Bath And view Super thankyou
423092,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location was a bit out in the sticks and took about an hour on public transport from the centre of the City Hotel was a bit pricy but I was in a room on my own which didn t help obviously , Bed was ultra comfy room finish was excellent staff helpfulness and food were both great too 
423093,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, We chose the wrong hotel location and should have booked the one near to the central station The nearest metro was closed and we had to walk quite a long way from the metro stop that was before The replacement bus also did not run at weekends , A large room with a good size bathroom and shower 
423094,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Terrible value for money and a terrible location Arrived 5 minutes after the restaurant closed to check in The website did not state a closing time for the restaurant and I had based my decision on that but the kitchen closes at 10pm I was told at reception that I could still order pizza at the bar but by the time I got to the bar after the barman ran to the kitchen as I arrived I was told that next month we offer this until 1am but not now sorry The best I got was an offer of a take away that would take 40 50 minutes to arrive The hotel is too remote to go anywhere else for food As staff would not offer any help I m sure there was food in the kitchen I ended up buying chocolate from reception at an extortionate price The hotel is not at all easily accessible by public transport it is actually outside the city limit The last metro stop is closed so you have to get a shuttle bus to it There is then no footpath so you will have to walk over grass to get to the nearest path and walk down a lonely road for ten minutes to get to the hotel The hotel will not order a taxi for you I asked and was refused apparently taxis won t take such a short journey I asked for the manager the morning after all of this and she was completely unhelpful I basically got a shrug but no apology I was expected to know that I should walk through the car park of the Planetarium to get to the footpath when there was no signage Despite paying a lot of money breakfast was not included in the rate and the room was pretty average The front of the hotel advertises it as a 4 star not sure if this is correct I would never stay here again and would not recommend it , The food I got was ok average The waiting staff were pleasant but not that knowledgable about the hotel and what it offers 
423095,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Hendricks and tonic is 12 95 but worth every cent A bit out of the way from the centre but once you get the hang of the transport it s not too bad 
423096,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The cleanliness has to be maintained beter in public places location is really far from Amsterdam center and there is nothing nearby no supermarkets restaurants etc so don t be suprised to appear outside the city , Very nice personnel in the bar restaurant
423097,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Itvtakes 10 minutes walking to the next metro station This station was under repair so we had to take shuttle bus to another station , We got a room with a balcony and a view over the riverside with Dutch farmsteads very beautiful The room and bathroom were well sized and comfortable Coffe and tea in the room were convenient 
423098,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Can t think of anything , Staff were friendly and helpful On checking in we were given a useful map and a tourist attractions guide book Rooms were clean and comfortable Quiet location but easy to travel to the city centre via public transport which is both frequent and very good throughout Amsterdam 
423099,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Personally the food for room service wasn t to my standards nor the price for it Unfortunately not all rooms have balconys which if you smoke is a bit of a nightmare as we had to travel 2 floors every time we wanted a cigarette The other real downer was the distance from the hotel to city centre you have to walk about 15 minutes to the nearest metro station which unfortunately was in the middle of being refurbished which we never got told by hotel before booking or at least after booking so we then either had to walk 30 45 minutes for the next metro station which isn t an easy walk considering you most likely don t know your way around Our option then led to taxi s everywhere which are not cheap most taxis will charge between 50 80 and that s not each way of course So I would definitely check the metro situation out before booking , Beds are very comfortable rooms in general are very nice even standard rooms 
423100,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location facilities are weak Bathroom looked clean but someone had decided to leave a calling card in the loo which I discovered 10m after getting to the room Nothing that you would not encounter occasionally in a public bathroom but in a 4 at 160 night Seriously , New build 
423101,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, we went into the room and it was full of items from other people like a coca cola bottle Pringles and a bag of M Ms already open It was not that clean too The location is awful we had to walk 25 minutes just to get to the metro station Dodgy area full of works around , Not
423102,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is lovely please be aware that this is a whole metro line away from Amsterdam central plus a good walk from the metro stop plus the metro stop you need the very last one is under construction so you have to get off the stop before catch a bus then take a good walk Once you have left it is not feasible to return until you have done for the day it is too far out So unfortunately we only slept at the hotel and did not enjoy any facilities but lovely comfy clean room , Comfy clean room 
423103,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Remote area Fortunately the weather was beautiful and we needed the exercise of walking to the train , Helpful staff stored luggage due to early arrival Delightful setting in the back Able to take train into town Arranged transportation to ship 
423104,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Poorly located and especially bad due to the tube line not working so having to take the bus to a rather dodgy part of town before going into Amsterdam , Very comfortable room 
423105,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Breakfast was way too expensive at 16 50 pp Unfortunately there were roadworks ongoing around the hotel which I understand is not their fault and these kept us awake more than we d like The location has some things to be desired as it s a 10 minute walk to the metro and 30 40 mins into town but if you can budget this time in it s a great cosy spot I found the holding fee that the restaurant puts on your card a little excessive we had a hold of 150 put on my account which I was not happy about , The restaurant food was great quality and we loved the outdoor terrace by it The staff were very helpful and friendly with one staff member going out of his way to help me at night with a medical emergency 
423106,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location was a trek into Amsterdam There was a mix up we got single beds had to pay extra for a double bed Even though I had cancelled on night stay with no refund I think they could have wavered the bed charge Staff didn t care , The hotel was nice and clean bed comfy room large bathroom nice and spacious 
423107,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location is poor The hotel is beside a building site and all you can hear is drilling It is 10 mins walk from the metro station but the walk is quiet secluded so I would not walk this at night A taxi from the hotel to Amsterdam is 35 and about 50 back to the hotel , The hotel was clean and had been renovated 
423108,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Although the location was within walking distance of a metro station there was nothing else in the immediate area in terms of services , Clean and comfortable 
423109,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I paid for a double bed and what I got was two single beds put together I had to put couches at the side of the beds so the mattresses don t split while sleeping It was very uncomfortable There was only coffee given on the first day coffee pouches were not refilled cups and glasses weren t cleaned , The hotel was very clean staff were nice too rooms were big and bathrooms were nice with a good shower 
423110,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The first day we went to our room for a little nap apr 2 hours and when we got up we realised that pur body is full with small bug bites So we went to the reception to change the sheers The time we got back the room was cleaned again and there was no problem after all , For the price it was a great accomodation Easy to reach modern and there was everything what we needed for two days 
423111,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, A little hard to reach by public transportation, My friend had sprained her ankle before arriving and the kind staff got her ice and extra pillows to elevate the leg They were very courteous We appreciated the clean bathroom and comfortable beds
423112,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Room should be bigger and double bed for couple location wasnt very pleasant this hotel located in the border of Amsterdam even there was a sign board saying end of Amsterdam few meters before this hotel From station to to hotel was a good 10 mints walk if you walk slow it could be 15 mints , Hotel was nice itself staff was friendly 
423113,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Spacious room with great view over the river Decent food in restaurant in the evening Very pleasant and helpful staff Nicest hotel I ve stayed in 
423114,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is far away from any form of transportation You need to walk next to the highway to get to the closest metro station around 15 mins walk The ride in the metro from the centre of the city is 30 minutes It is super far away if you want to stay out till late because next to the highway it is a lonely walk , It was raining during our stay so the staff lent us umbrellas Wifi was super a lot of pokemon around 
423115,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Hallways and lobby were grimy Shower was small narrow and doors don t close all the way so water gets everywhere , Staff was friendly and helpful although ready for an upsell at any opportunity Room was clean Easy to get to Weesp via bus worth a visit if looking for a cute village pleasant moderate length walk through the park to the metro 
423116,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Expected to pay 100 euros as a deposit on arrival this was not stated in terms and conditions therefore I refused to pay it Also the amount of milk tea bags etc left in the room was ridiculous and when asked for more the worker was shocked at our request , Fresh and clean comfy bed
423117,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, the location is a bit far away from the central station so you have to go by train every morning for about half an hour, beds are perfect room service is very good and tidys up every day best price you could get in Amsterdam for four stars I would say Thanks 
423118,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Nothing not to like would have prefered the bathroom door to have covered the entire bathtub as its a hassle trying to make the water not go on the floor , Beds were really nice friendly staff and very helpful Would definitely book a second time for my stay in amsterdam If you re concerned about how far the hotel is then maybe you shouldnt book in the first place its a bit hypocritical booking knowing where the hotel location is then saying its far away They put the address on the booking page and everything is very clear Metro is 10 minutes away and a bus stop is 4 minutes away but the metro has fewer stops and no need to make a change along the way 
423119,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, originally booked to stay in the west of Amsterdam but stayed at riverside instead it was a little further away but really easy to get into Amsterdam central by tram hotel is only a short distance away from the tram station and perfect for a weekend away , The room I stayed in was lovely with an amazing view comfy bed and great shower perfect 
423120,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location is not anywhere near to Amsterdam centrality is a 35 minute drive away considering we flew a hour to amsterdamit was not practical to travel 35 minutes by car to a hotel it is not clearly stated on its description I the advertisement,No Positive
423121,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The 50 Deposit I had to put down for the restaurant or minibar even though there was no minibar to speak of and I had no interest in using the restaurant , The bedding was very soft and the bed was comfy The room was light and airy and nicely decorated
423122,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel was dirty stains on all the rugs and old smells throughout the hotel and the sheet didn t smell fresh The waitress didn t clean the tables before setting the new ones there were crumbs on the booths and tables I had to find a waitress to place my order after being seated for more than ten minutes with nobody tending to my table The toilets didn t flush properly witness by left over toilet paper in the toilet upon my arrival in my room THE FIRST DAY The cleaning ladies didn t clean the bathtubs properly given left over hair from my morning shower was sticking to the side of the bathtub when I came home at night Requesting an iron was demanding the moon it took 24h and numerous request to finally have one and to top it all off it was leaking and I had to iron my clothes on my bed since no ironing board was given to me The bedroom windows haven t been cleaned in ages given the hundred of bugs and webs which were there They say four stars I wouldn t give it any I have one more thing to say about this hotel is RUN AWAY AND DON T LOOK BACK YOU WILL REGRET OTHERWISE, Nothing
423123,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, There s a charge of 25 per night that you have to pay on arrival and don t get back until you leave This wasn t mentioned on the website or any emails before arrival , Just a really nice calm hotel Beautiful lake out the back 
423124,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location isn t the best as it is a bit out of town however there is a tram about a 10 min walk away to take you to the centre , The bed was very big and comfy modern room with good air con and wifi Staff were friendly and helpful 
423125,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Our stay was four nights I didn t know which days if any the room was going to be serviced On the third morning I had to go and ask for more tea bags and toilet paper It was possible they were going to service and replenish anyway that day but I just wasn t aware , The bed was huge never seen one that wide and very comfy with lovely soft duvet cover
423126,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location of the hotel is terrible terrible terrible I do not advise anyone to book at this hotel as it is in the middle of nowhere and the metro station is a 20 minutes walk ,No Positive
423127,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Some of staff did mistake Me and my friend already rested in the room but around 11 o clock someone opened my door I think it was master key and I saw his shoes and I screamed He apologized after several minute but I was really surprised , I can sleep well Very clean and quiet 
423128,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, There we re tons of squashed musquitos and spiders on the walls and ceiling This is because the room is next to the water but still pretty nasty Gym could be bigger , very nice bed spacious room bathroom suitable for tall people nice and quiet 
423129,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Balcony door did not seem to have a lock on it It would have been more of an issue had we been located on the ground floor , Friendly and helpful staff 
423130,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, If you book a room for two you think they are going to have everything prepare but not They have not two bed organized and they don t provide enough element for the bath The daily cleaning of the room was deficient ,No Positive
423131,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, the hotel requires a small deposit for any damage to the room , Great hotel clean still new the staff is good and nice placed near bus and metro stations large room good restaurant beautiful view on the river 
423132,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I needed more towels for my long hair , The catering staff made extra effort to provide soft boiled eggs each breakfast The staff were engaging competent friendly 
423133,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Forget like the location is miles frm the city dint enjoy amsterEdam as much cause of the location its inthe middle of no where it on the outskirts of amsterdam
423134,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, In my room floor in the bath was dirty in the corners everywhere was spider webs and room was very dusty The sink was blocked and water stay for long time This hotel is good for 3 stars but definitely not 4 Long checkin time , Very comfortable bed and I have good sleep 
423135,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The room was not that clean You could see hairs from previous guests all over the place After the morning cleaning they were still there The tea pot was dirty The location is far from the center and from the metro station From the hotel to the metro station you have to walk 10 15 minutes It is a nice walk though From the hotel will the central station it takes around 45 minutes , The hotel was nice I especially liked the bed and the pillows We slept very well It was quiet and we had everything you need form a hotel The prices at the restaurant are reasonable 
423136,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Staff was not friendly nor did they go out of their way to be helpful Location was pretty far out of town there was a train which was also a bit of a walk , Price was good clean and comfortable 
423137,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Every additional thing very expensive Far from the center but in good place maybe a bus that goes to the metro will be a good idea , The people happy the tub the bed the pillow
423138,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It would have been nice to have the towels changed more regularly or being given 2 big towels each as well as a smaller one , The infused waters by the entrance were great 
423139,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The mattress was extremely uncomfortable with little support We resorted to sleeping on the base of the bed at the mattress was so uncomfortable The room was not very clean there was a used plaster on the back of our welcome guide There were marks all over the walls , The staff were friendly and approachable The room was spacious and there was air conditioning 
423140,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Beautiful hotel rooms very good price for the room really happy overall with our stay The food in the hotel restaurant was reasonably priced and the food was lovely
423141,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, The view was amazing Something that really was exceptional was the service We had left behind something in our room and even though we realised only a day after we checked out the staff was able to recover it They even had an option to courier it back Further whether it was last minute printouts guiding on routes wake up calls or booking a taxi all these small things added up to a great experience
423142,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, the location wasnt very good it was 20 minutes by metro to amsterdam centre a further 20 mins for me to the hotel walking i have bad feet so they hurt but i dont have a problem walking but that was some walk from the metro to the hotel and also no lighting for night time walk and its a lot of bushes trees ect , The hotel was lovely would have to say it should be given 5 stars they have a patio at the back which over looks the river no lights so would be better food was expensive but didnt eat in it the rooms were fab tho comfy beds and they cleaned on a daily basis staff friendly nice decoration and also can use facilities if wished to 
423143,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Service was a bit slow for the restaurant but not too much Also some more variety at the restaurant would be nice and a brunch option since not many people will wake up before 11 , Beds were very comfortable staff was friendly all the way and we could store our luggage after checkout Food was good at the restaurant 
423144,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Absolutely poor location with nothing nearby Staff weren t very nice and wanted me to go by the reception just to get extra towels and toiletries that they did not replace during the day As a 4 star hotel I d expect them to bring them up to me ,No Positive
423145,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, LOCATION not only far it was like it was on the countryside horses outside and NOTHING closeby Staff weren t helpful service was at 3 star inn level which was the left half of the building , Clean 
423146,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, We were very surprised at how far out of the city center this hotel was it took us 21min by train from Central Station to get there and then another 10 min on foot Our safe was not working and they offered to move us to another room but the safe also did not work there also the TV was not working but it was okay because we spent the majority of the day and night in the city , The room was clean and very comfortable I have to admit the breakfast was delicious not that many choices but the setting for breakfast is lovely with an option to also eat outside The staff was also very friendly and helpful 
423147,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is literally on a motorway and only public transport is the metro and night bus which is 15 mins away , The windows were double glazed Staff were friendly Rooms were cleaned every day Room was cozy and modern Away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre Beautiful park nearby 
423148,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is quite far from the city center although it is near the last station of one metro line that takes around 30 minutes to get to the center However metro works only until midnight and although there are night buses these leave you too far from the hotel 30 40 minutes walking Just to keep as a reference a taxi from DAM square city center to the hotel can cost nearly 50 euros this was at night so I do not know if they charge more at night but there was definitely no traffic The room was very cozy and seemed super clean however when I left the soap next to the hand wash the next time I picked it up it was full of hair it looked like someone shaved and left the bathroom full of hair because I also spotted some of it in the shower , We were able to do an early check in without paying extra money because the room was already cleaned Besides we had an upgrade of bedroom as well 
423149,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The double bed was 2 singles joined together, It was a quiet spot which was perfect to come to after a noisy night in the city A 15 minute train into the city very easy and value for money 
423150,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, The staff was super friendly and helpful Beautiful facilities with a terrace on a river bank and flower garden with prints of Van Gogh pictures all over the place The bed was comfortable the bathroom spacious and comfortable My room was overlooking the river Full breakfast was excellent wide choices lots of proteins hot sausages and bacon cold deli cuts several breads croissants chocolate rolls rolls boiled eggs butter jams and spreads choice of cereals yogurt teas and juices good coffee several good cheeses including Old Amsterdam I have just booked them again and I highly recommend it 
423151,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, We arrived to a lovely and clean room though when the room was cleaned sheets with stains were put on the bed These things happen though which is why we didn t report it , Very comfortable beds We got upgraded to a quieter area of the hotel as our original room was taken great view and very quiet Room and bathroom were very spacious and we could not hear any noise throughout the hotel 
423152,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Just next door to ArenA it s an excellent place for young couples and not only I really enjoyed a welcome drink Staff is very attentive and welcoming 
423153,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location is the only slight downfall DONT get a taxi from or to the airport 55 80 euro get the train about 10 euro , The staff are really helpful The beds are also so so comfy
423154,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, wifi connection poor signal bath poor quality and faults so expensive but bad location no shuttle from to the airport, small lake Staff was friendly
423155,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, You can not check in earlier unless you pay 20 extra , It was very close to the train station that took about 20 mins to the city center of Amsterdam The room was big comfy and modern The receptionists was friendly and willing to help 
423156,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, A bit far from the city but the access to train station is very easy , The hotel looks very nice things are new and clean The staff is very helpful and gentle 
423157,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, None that I can think of 3n of good sleep , Got a free room upgrade Don t really mind walking for 10 mins to the station as the price is of good value Also the hotel is included in the list of the airport hotel shuttle so its really convenient
423158,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Rooms were dirty and not cleaned for us arriving or anytime during our stay Blood or something on bed sheets that was there the whole time we stayed so bed sheets not cleaned Bathroom was dirty Didnt state on website how far away hotel was Took 2 5 hours on transfer bus which i would not recommend Food and drink vert overpriced Staff spoke little English but couldnt understand us most of the time Hotel called riverside no view of river unless you pay for upgrade each night Busy motorway right next to hotel 15 20minute walk to metro which it also doesnt say on website Wont stay again Not good value for money , The main part of hotel was nice 
423159,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Was charged 35 per night for extra bed in room for a teen Bed was not even a very nice comfortable one was like a camp bed Did ask prior to leaving UK if they would consider charging less as staying 4 nts but they refused Will not mention distance to City as I knew from other reviewers about this so it was expected and was fine got plenty of excercise 10 mins walk to stn then 15 mins on metro to the central stn ok, Nice quiet hotel accommodated extra bed when requested from home prior to arrival Good value compared to hotel prices in city didnt cost much to travel back and forth from city to hotel
423160,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Only problem I had was I didn t realize it was so far away from the city centre metro was only down the road so wasn t so bad Taxi cost 40 euros one way which was not great , Fab hotel staff were great Food was gorgeous bed was soooo comfy Value for money was excellent Loved it 
423161,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, location is a bit far to visit different places also taxi bit far to valued that all also didnt have a properly swimming pool , hotel is a lovely place to staying also staff is good standard helpful and discussion thing i need 
423162,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Lovely hotel too far from Amsterdam central good transport links but if you just want to be where all the attractions of the city are then it s a bit too much out of the way hard to find at first once you know where it is it s ok off the highway and a bit scary walking back to it from metro in the dark no problem with the actual hotel just the location 
423163,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Staff unaware that road works by flyover made hotel hard to find and not very helpful on phone when asked for alternative directions Kettle did not work properly had to hold switch down until boiled, Comfortable Room Good parking
423164,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I felt like the ventilation in the bathroom was too weak After the shower the mirror is fogged up for like 10 minutes which is annoying Our room had a shower bathroom combination and it was very small too tight to shower comfortably and too small to take a comfortable bath , We had dinner at the hotel twice They have many different meals to choose from and the food quality is great The bed is very comfortable and the hotel has very beautiful rooms I liked the location of the hotel it s very outside of the city very quiet and comfortable and you re out of all the city noise For an introvert like me especially after smoking it was very positive to have a quiet area to rest at 
423165,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Nothing at all, Although not as close to the City as we expected it was only a 15 minute walk from the Metro The staff were helpful and very pleasant 
423166,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It was very far away from the metro station and no transport was offered Having to pay a 25 deposit for each night we stayed was not discussed before we had booked nor after in fact and was only told to us when we arrived to check in This made us feel like the hotel did not trust us and it felt like a scam Our rooms were not cleaned the entire stay , the rooms were beautiful with a great view 
423167,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Mini bar in the room was empty When I asked the room service to put some stuf in to the refrigerator they informed me that they would charge me extra 6 euros for bringing up the drinks in addition to the cost of the consumed items I think this was very unusual so I gave up , Very clean calm and peaceful place Helpful staff There is a camp close to the hotel where you can rent a bike and ride all the way to Amsterdam 
423168,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location is far from central station which wouldn t be so bad if there wasn t a 10 minute walk to public transportation With luggage it was a pain and without annoying Should offer bikes or shuttle to transit station , Nicely renovated comfortable 
423169,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Maids just straightened quilt ignoring crumpled sheet each day Only got one change of sheets on day 5 of 7 night stay Bath was never cleaned properly , Very comfortable bed Lovely river view Mini bar useful for keeping drinks and snacks cool Effective air conditioning Spacious room Good wifi 
423170,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Room service is horrible used cups are not cleaned reception is impatient when explaining their wrong prices on the charge bill, Price of breakfast in this hotel is unreasonably high compared with the food it serves
423171,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Okay first of all if you would like to experience Amsterdam s night life Golden Tulip is not what you re looking for The last metro leave the centaal station around midnight and if you are tired after a long day you will find it difficult to take a 10 min walk to the hotel Plus they charge a 25 euro deposit per night wich I personaly think they should ve mention in their official page Not cool being charged in advance and not being aware of what to expect I find it ridiculous to pay 16 euro for breakfast per day when you can buy groceries and cost less than 15 euro for 4 days The personel was a bit distant and our towels never got replaced , Big room
423172,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location is too far from the city I rent a bike in city center so it took me more than 1 5 hours from city center to hotel also metro station is 25 min from hotel so not close , Hotel room was alright however my room was really close to motorway so sometimes I couldn t sleep in night because of noise 
423173,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It is quite far from the Metro about 15mins walk It might be a problem if you are carrying luggage and if is raining No supermarket and restaurant near the hotel , Very clean and nice hotel There is a mini bar and kettle in the room Hair dryer is also provided Bed is nice and hotel surrounding is quiet 
423174,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Only down side was the location 10 minute walk to the tram station along busy roads which are hard to cross then a long 20 minute tram journey to the city If you don t mind a 30 minute journey from hotel to city centre then it s fine , Clean large modern rooms with comfortable bed and good wifi 
423175,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I booked a deluxe twin room with bath and balcony for me and a friend when we got there we were upgraded to a double room without bath due to overbooking by the hotel If we had wanted a double bed we would have booked that We then had to pay an extra 20euro per night to get a room with a double bed and a sofa bed without bath and without balcony Then when the extra set of sheets arrived there were dried spots of blood stained onto the quilt cover Then to top it off on the second night when we returned from the city our key card didn t work anymore Would never stay here again , Staff were friendly good atmosphere in the bar
423176,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, There was no shampoo nor soap in the bathroom The coffee cups were not cleaned after I used it on the first day and there was no refill , The staff were nice and helpful 
423177,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location was not ideal as you had to get the metro into the city which took 20 minutes and the walk from the hotel to the metro 10 minutes was very secluded at night , The hotel was spotless and rooms were of perfect size 
423178,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, location is far from public transport at night there is nobody from the nearest bus stop and you have to walk in the middle of nowhere to get the hotel , the bed is very comfortable the breakfast is nice apart from the location everything is fine I find this hotel a bit expensive 
423179,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The main factor that was a bit frustrating was the fact it was quite far out of the central Amsterdam as a young couple we wanted to experience the nightlife a bit more Perhaps an organised shuttle service for late night transport would be a good idea for people in a similar situation , The bed was so comfy the general facilities were of a high standard overall enjoyable experience 
423180,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Breakfast could be cheaper I didn t eat at the hotel because of that There s a deposit of 25 per night you stay which I wasn t informed of prior to my arrival not sure what would have happened if I d said no , Reasonably priced and close to public transport for the city centre Staff are helpful and friendly Good coffee in the room Comfortable and clean rooms 
423181,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Needs improvement No bellhop to help with luggage though there was a luggage cart which I had to use myself Dirty carpet floors unvacumned Booking com has noted it as a 4 star hotel and usually gets it right but this one was not 4 out of 10 maybe , The girl working at the front desk I am not sure of her name was very polite and gave sincere apologies for the issues 
423182,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, While the location of the hotel was only 10 minutes walk from Gaasperplas Metro Station it became tedious very quickly Restaurant food was nice but with a limited menu, The room was spacious and well equipped with all the usual items you can expect from a 4 star hotel 
423183,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Nowhere on the website did it tell us we needed a deposit of 25 per night We stayed for 3 nights and it left us very short on cash as I only brought enough for what I needed and couldn t use my card as I didn t tell the bank I was visiting There was also a small issue of ants as we were on the ground floor and had a big window in our room and our suitcases had surprise visitors which was unpleasant , The views from the hotel were amazing as it was located right by a river and there was a windmill right by so you felt like you was in Amsterdam Holland straight away It was also a very short walk from the metro station and the walk was through a lovely park full of really pretty flowers 
423184,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It s really far away from the center We went to the restaurant to order some food and they wanted to charge us just to bring the food to the room 6 , Everything
423185,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Spaciuos and very clean room great professional and helpful staff good location within a 10 minute walk from the metro station Nice view from the window cosy summer garden by the river to chill in the evenings Free drinks at the reception desk were a nice surprise 
423186,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is about a ten minute walk from the metro along the edge of the park which isn t bad but not fun pulling suitcases there isn t any taxi service available Also the route isn t well sign posted and we just had to ask directions from a local vendor and walk until we found it The hotel itself isn t really located near any other restaurants or pubs so you have to get the metro most places if you wanted to eat out The hotel menu isn t bad but it s not very extensive The food was nice but needed a lot more of a selection based on nothing else being around , We upgraded to the honeymoon suite which was offered to us by the hotel for the week for 120 extra and it was well worth it the front desk were very good with us The hotel is in a nice location next to the lake and the park and great for people who enjoy the scenery and little walks or cycling The hotel was clean and tidy and the dining space was quite large including a very nice outside area over looking the lake You could sit right on the lake edge which was a bonus The staff were very friendly and helped us to learn a little bit of Dutch They were also very helpful with information about local shops and bike hire which are both handy enough There is a supermarket one metro stop away almost right outside the station You can buy a 30 per person travel pass from any station machine for 7 days or travel or varying prices for varying amount of days and travel on any tram metro or bus which is excellent the transport is very well maintained and regular as clockwork 
423187,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I booked the room as a birthday gift for my partners birthday Unfortunately I received a room in bed condition Dirty carpet hair in the bathroom and the walls where dirty also Evening when I went to the restaurant I was served by a waitress who forgot our order I hoped more for the money what they asked me for the room , The staff was friendly
423188,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The menu in the restaurant was pants no variety The location of the hotel is not suitable what so ever if you are looking for nightlife in amaterdam Having to worry about getting the train ans the 20 minute walk after or a 40 euro taxi put a dampener on the night , The hotel itself was lovely very spacious rooms comfy beds although they did roll apart as 2 singles were joined for a double and the staff were friendly and really helpful 
423189,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, I booked a room with a lake view and when I got my room it had no lake view because it was blocked by the roof and I told reception I booked and payed for lake view she said you can see a little bit sorry the roof is blocking And worst of all I was there early and me and my girlfriend were tired so we needed the room even though the room was ready and all they made us pay 25 euros for early check in which was meaningless, It was clean and the bed was amazing and they had a lot of tv channels that were in English
423190,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It s not that I minded but just for information This hotel is some way out so it is a 10 min walk to Metro station note ticket sales are automated but easily understood and it is about 15 mins on Metro into Amsterdam Central very clean and interesting journey we actually enjoyed seeing other parts of Amsterdam, Friendly and helpful staff not over bearing
423191,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The staff could have warned us the night bus was not going to the hotel due to a HUGE highway construction which made it extremely hard to get back to the hotel the fist night Staff was far from the best and friendly one Could have provided coffee in the room for the last morning there was coffee for the first 2 mornings The shower couldn t provide really hot water due to strange broken faucet there was hot water in the sink faucet , Quite nice location away from the center 25 min away from Central station with M53 spacious clean rooms 
423192,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Everything was amazing at this hotel couldn t fault it Jus the location from centre was 30 drive But once found the metro was easier Deffo would stay again Amazing the views and the grounds are superb Great hotel staff also Helped us all 
423193,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, At the end station of the metro there was an absolutly authentic place for breakfast or quick lunch It was a container or food truck Cheap but nice I took bitterballen with fried potatetos currry and ketchup Toast for breakfast 
423194,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The requested deposit of a 100 euro ahead of being handed the room card We were not aware of this condition nor read anywhere it was a Hotel policy, Hot water kettle facility in the room was a plus as it complented the amenities available in the room The possibility to purchase drinks and light snacks off vending m c located in the reception area The greetings offered to us by the receptionists on leaving and entering the Hotel
423195,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Booked a superior double however given a twin Complained and was upgraded, Meals in the restaurant were beautiful and value for money Rooms very clean and comfortable
423196,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location is a bit out of the way 15 minster walk to metro , Very helpful staff Excellent hotel brilliant food good value for money If we decide to return we will be back here
423197,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location was awful really difficult to get back to centre especially when it s pouring with rain no sign posts from the metro either so had to ask pedestrians, Rooms were comfy and clean and the hotel was quiet The food in the hotel was really well priced
423198,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, We had trouble finding the metro station the first time we looked for it as the receptionist was not very good at giving clear instructions However once we headed in the right direction it was simple to get to only about 5 10 mins walk away across the road in a straight line After that it wasn t difficult to get around once we found our bearings , The room was comfortable clean spacious and felt quite luxurious especially the enormous and really comfortable bed The hotel s location is a little out of the city centre so it takes about 20 mins by metro to get to the centre of Amsteram We quite enjoyed the train ride and the fact that the area around the hotel was in a quieter less frantic area than the city center It made the hotel more relaxing We also very much enjoyed walking in the area around the hotel Gaasperplas park is really close to the hotel and I would highly recommend going there on a sunny day for a picnic or a walk around the lake Compared to the famous Vondelpark which is always bustling with cyclists and people Gaasperplas park is much quieter and idyllic and we actually found it more enjoyable to spend a day in We also found several smaller grassy areas near a residential area by the station where there were lots of rabbits This hotel is a good place to stay if you want somewhere more relaxing than Amsterdam s crowded city centre yet still be close enough to the city to be able to get there easily This hotel definitely offers a very comfortable stay 
423199,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, There isn t any I can possibly complain about about the Golden Tulip The staff are great very friendly and helpful The cleanliness of the hotel is second to none I will definitely use this hotel when go back to Amsterdam in August 
423200,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, Hotel is 5 min walk away from the metro station Beautiful hotel well maintained Complimentary nespresso coffee machine was a nice touch topped up everyday Nothing was too much trouble for the staff Highly recommend Lovely riverside view from the room
423201,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, 17 Euro for breakfast that s simply crazy It s 1km away from the metro terminal station and no public transport comes closer No big issue but with big luggage someone could find the way uncomfortable , A calm place really nice and big rooms I think for that price you ll not find any nicer hotels It looks much better from the inside 
423202,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Have to pay 12 50 per day for parking Seriously 12 euros for a very marginal breakfast The high price for normal room should have that included , Staff very friendly 
423203,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The room had barley been cleaned when we got there There was an empty toilet paper roll still left on the rod and a bunch of hair in the shower There was blood on our sheets as well , Beds were comfy 
423204,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location is a bit far ofd but cant be altered Also food was overpriced in hotel with nowhere local to eat out Couple patches in room which could have been better cleaned and some small hairs found in bedsheets but nothing major , Bed was lovely and was lucky enougj to recieve a room with a balcony which was added bonus Staff left a welcome message as they knew it was my birthday which was lovely Most of the staff where very friendly and spoke good english Enjoyed my stay
423205,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Staff are less engaging FNB staff are not friendly at all no greeting me and my friend standing in front of the restaurant at 10pm but no one engaging us end up we looking for seat by ourself TOO FAR FROM EVERYWHERE NO FREE WATER IN ROOM , Bed was really comfortable 3 View from the window was good 
423206,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location is not the best for non drivers 15 minute walk or so to the train station but no a major problem, The beds were amazingly comfortable Staff were very friendly and helpful Very clean
423207,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, too far from station far from city centre but frequent trains, room is very spacious leaned daily bathroom facilities decent size stocked with toiletries very very clean
423208,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, There was a minor bit of disrepair on the surface of the bathroom but only so minor that I didn t notice it until the 4th day Could be a bit out of the way for people wanting to go between hotel and city centre multiple times during the day but only a 15 20 minute metro and they run every 10 minutes , Comfy beds decent space in room Very friendly and welcoming staff Good transport links Quiet area there s some roadworks on nearby at the moment but couldn t hear them at all during the stay Would stay here again 
423209,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Got asked to leave 75 euro deposit without having much of a choice This has to be at the discretion of the guest , Comfy bed nice and helpful receptionists 
423210,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Nothing Really we had no complaints, Everything was of great quality We expected the bar minimum but no It was well beyond that of a base line hotel It was well decorated clean and we had a great view from our balcony There was no cheap skating like asking us to pay for every little thing we wanted like wifi When we had the food there was huge portions with prompt service and again high quality food for a reasonable price 
423211,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It takes around 15 20 minutes walk from the hotel to Metro Station And the road from the metro station to the hotel is quite dark and just becareful if you plan to walk alone , Pleasant place to stay with friendly staffs around 
423212,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It was clean but some spots in the bathroom and around the coffee machine were really dusty , Nice view coffee machine in the room good breakfast buffet staff was very friendly ane helpful
423213,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is far away from the Amsterdam city center and there is nothing around However there is a metro station and buses 10 minutes walking The double bed was actually to singles together so eventually they split and the first day they did not do the room, Rooms are quite spacious the bathroom is also big and that is something valueble in Europe 
423214,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Too far from City centre It was right at the edge of Amsterdam Metro station within 12 15 minutes walking distance Footpath between the motorway and a camping site Breakfast too expensive 16 5 Euro per person the price of a main course for dinner in Amsterdam city centre There are no other options in the area unless you take the Metro into the city Our floor was turned into a temporary warehouse for a couple of nights Check picture When we got into the room one of the towels was dirty Staff wasn t the nicest , The rooms were modern 
423215,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It was really far away from the city center There is a metro line about 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel and takes around 45 to 60 minutes to go to the city center by metro It was around 40 by taxi from the city center to the hotel Which means you have to pay around 80 per day for a taxi transfer from and to the hotel to the city center , The hotel was very clean and the bed was really comfortable Also both the accomodation and the food prices were fair Plus the channel view with ducks and other water birds were really good at the room 
423216,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, On booking com it showed u pictured of a different hotel the hotel was expensive for juice and the staff couldn t understand what we were saying We ordered a double room and it was 2 single bed put together,No Positive
423217,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It was a 10 15 minute walk to the metro station Which was like walking on a dual carriageway Very daunting at night time , The hotel was very modern Beautiful riverside view Extra comfortable super king size beds Food exceptional 
423218,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It cost about 75 from the airport to find out that we went west side golden tulip This was down to poor advertisement of the hotel on booking com they do not specify exactly what golden tulip hotel you book and there are about 5 scattered over Amsterdam The golden tulip riverside is the furthest away from Central Amsterdam you can get it is the last stop on the train and roughly 50 in a taxi, It cost about 75 from the airport to find out that we went west side golden tulip This was down to poor advertisement of the hotel on booking com they do not specify exactly what golden tulip hotel you book and there are about 5 scattered over Amsterdam 
423219,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, On booking the hotel I had requested a double kingsize bed when arriving me at the hotel j was told there would be an extra 20 charge to upgrade which I thought this was unfair as I had requested it at the time of booking The hotel was about 10 14 mins from the metro which was a downside There was only 4 towels in our rooms also which is quite difficult to work with when you have long hair Also we went to the restaurant one evening and there was what seemed to be a complimentary bottle of water on our table but when the time arrive to pay for the meal we were charged 4 for it, Very friendly staff 
423220,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location is quiet far from the last metro station and there are no taxis to travel to hotel Especially in the dark its very scary Either provide some sort of shuttle service between the hotel and the metro station Even calling a taxi from hotel was hard because the distance is too less to the metro station and we have to travel to the next metro station Honestly this makes the stay itself pretty poor irrespective of how the hotel is ,No Positive
423221,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, i could not find my room for ages despite following the signs for my room number it was no where to be seen so i had to do some exploring of my own to find it it was in the opposite way than what the sign was telling me , The staff were incredibly helpful and lovely I also loved the location despite being a small walk from the metro which I knew before booking it wasn t a hard walk and there was a huge park to go exploring in right next to the planetarium I loved my room too clean and well maintained the only issue i had was with the fan in the bathroom which I m not sure ever turned off but closing the door helped to muffle the sound 
423222,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The price of breakfast to expensive there was no shops anywhere around hotel it was next to motorway in the middle of nowhere we had to walk 10 mins to metro to get anywhere especially if you need of see sites in city centre if this is the case then avoid this hotel , There was a bath it had English channels on tv and a fridge in room
423223,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, gym could be a bit better equipped with some free weights which dont cost much breakfast too expensive compared to rest of menu i assume they do this as in morning there is nowhere else to get b fast whilst in afternoon dinner ppl can easily go to centre , helpuful staff good restaurant nice room
423224,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The distance, The hotel is nice clean but very very far from the center Even after taking the trem there is a 15 minutes walk in a lonely way you can t even get a taxi from the trem to the hotel and at a cold night it s not plesent at all 
423225,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, the location 10 min walk metro station 20 min metro to centrum station , the deluxe rooms with terace are very comfortable the view to the lake is very relaxing
423226,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Bad WiFi in our rooms we lost the connection as soon as we walked down the hallway where our room were but the staff offered us a new room near the router if it was a problem but we didn t want any badly marked from the train station where the hotel is f e no signs or nothing and you need to walk at least for 4 5 minutes until you see that the hotel is in the end of the street , I liked the bed good deals on the prices and the restaurant was good along with the waiter that were servicing us 
423227,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Very expensive small room far from Amsterdam central also far from the train station to the hotel it s in a remote place Some staff are nice but not everyone , Beautiful hotel nice atmosphere 
423228,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, More choice of English food we only ate once during are stay n felt it was all a little too foreign for us, After upgrading to a dulex room are bed was very comfy 10minute walk from metro so not too bad but a bit of an inconvinience if u want to just pop out I d stay closer to the centre next time but the hotel was lovely just a little too far out
423229,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location really far from the city centre Could cost 30 for taxi to Amsterdam centre or choose to walk to the nearest metro station which could take 15 minutes of walk, Good value for money room was big and nice plus staff was quite helpful for us 
423230,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Bed really uncomfortable and double seems to be two single beds pushed together with two single duvets I myself am a receptionist in a hotel I this isnt a double room or even a zip twin Said to reception was offered another room didnt move as the next room was the same so just gave up and put up with it We knew about the distance from waterloopen central airport but got annoying next time will stay in waterloopen Also could serve food later considering the last metro was 11 45 then u have a 20 30 min walk When you get in and all there is are overpriced pringles and chocolate the closest shop or anything is the 20 30 minuite walk and a metri ride, Restaurant bar staff where lovely Couple of receptionists really friendly others not so much Hotel was clean
423231,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location is a bit too far from the city center 20 mins on a metro and 7 min walk If you plan to go out during the night this hotel won t be really suitable , The beds were supa comfi and a very hot water which was handy given the weather conditions snowing 
423232,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location wasn t the best but the hotel was gorgeous so we dealt with it, The room was amazing Before booking my boyfriend put a request for rose petals on the bed and when we walked in they was done perfectly with a towel shaped in a heart It was gorgeous
423233,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Small complaint the toilet leak and a little noisy pillow on the bed could have been smaller and more comfee but that could just be a matter of opinion so in all a good hotel , very good location with Brilliant transport links straight to the city staff polite and hotel very clean and tidy will be staying again thats for sure 
423234,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is a short trip from the metro which is a 10 min walk away, Clean and beautiful hotel with a gym bed was the softest bed I have ever slept in
423235,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location was terrible Nothing on the menu Checking in way too late in the day No facilities such as a pool jacuzzi Only beer and wine on the drink menu Felt like the staff didn t really want us there either , The room was nice
423236,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Far away from City and RAI After the first night stay the room was sold to another guest The second evening i came the room was occupied They searched for another hotelroom and reserved the last one at The Fletcher Hotel called a taxi and apologized , Bed and breakfast OK Staff very friendly
423237,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The runner across the two single beds were covered in semen The deluxe double room states double again it was in fact two single beds pushed together not very convenient for a young couple Extremely far from the center Undisclosed 50 charge for use of anything from the restaurant which was not stated online and was asked for upon arrival Not happy to provide coffee refils Front desk staff extremely rude and we heard them slating other customers staying there , One of the night staff provided us with delivery menus for food outside of their restaurant This was great as a young couple we could not afford the extortionate prices of the hotel food 
423238,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The only slight disappointment we found was that there was no cider at the bar But Amsterdam is known for beer and not cider so that was hardly a surprise They have a wide selection of wines beers spirits and soft drinks so plenty to compensate anyway , When we walked in the doors of the hotel we knew it was a great choice the photos here don t do it enough justice The price was amazing for the what we got The hotel looked lovely inside and I don t have a bad word to say about the rooms The bed was so comfortable and the view of the river was beautiful The hotel isn t central but there is a metro station just a ten minute walk away and a metro from there will take you straight to the centre the travel card we purchased from there sorted us for metro bus and tram travel in and around the centre for 48 hours and only cost 12 50 which is way less than even a one way taxi to the centre Absolutely 100 would go again 
423239,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Location is not idea for a younger crowd looking to go out 15 walk to the metro and a 20 min metro ride to downtown The metro stops running around 12 30 so you are limited in the time you can stay out Warning Taxis are obnoxiously expensive in Amsterdam, Great facilities clean friendly staff and reasonable price
423240,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The only thing I wasn t too happy about was that there were no atms anywhere The nearest atm was one stop away on the train The train is also a 12 minute walk away from the hotel which was a hassle of you needed cash , The view from our balcony was lovely The room was very pretty and spacious where I slept like a baby in that super comfy bed The facilities were good and the staff were always helpful and friendly It was a really good stay 
423241,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Roomdoor to the hall slams too hard when leaving the room , Heater did not work After reporting this to the reception I got a portable heater and the next day another more luxurious room for the rest of my stay No extra charges 
423242,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Nothing about the hotel just reviews that people put on about how far it is from the city centre This site tells you that in the information It didn t take that long to get to and from the hotel We had a fun ride on the metro people watching and a 10 minute walk to the hotel , Friendly staff comfortable large rooms fridge and kettle provided quiet location
423243,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The hotel is about 35 40 minutes from Central Station Check last Metro times, The bedroom was large and comfortable It was my birthday during my stay and the staff made a birthday cake
423244,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Extra charges which weren t disclosed Distance from Amsterdam was advertised at 12mins walk not 15 miles 30 mins drive Superior room didn t have a bath Breakfast shocking for the price Restaurant poor choices, The bed was comfy Clean rooms
423245,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside,No Negative, From minute walked through the door to reception it was welcoming the receptionist that checked us in was extremely friendly and helpful telling us how to get to metro and giving us times and details as we were just there for the weekend room was 10 10 massive clean and very much worth the money we paid We will defo be booking with this franchise of hotel again 
423246,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, It s a bit located in a rather isolated area Their internet doesn t work with tablets What they call a gym is a tiny room with just balls maths and tricycle No weights of any sort It should be called exercise room When I asked for an iron and board the receptionist told me to come and pick it up from the reception so I didn t bother They should have a porter , Nice room decor and a quite environment 
423247,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Parts of the hotel smell of cigarette smoke due to the smoking rooms Fairly lengthy walk to the station from the hotel , Spacious room with all of the mod cons that you would want for a comfortable stay Excellent furnishing and facilities No problems with parking which is on site and secure 
423248,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Terrible location low water pressure from the tap and shower heads weak heating nice view of a busy road overpriced breakfast and every service of the hotel is actually overpriced A bit unkind hotel staff Dirty glasses dirty towels Etcetera Unfortunately a lot more Should ask for a partial refund I think , The only positive experience was the cheap parking 
423249,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, We arrived and our toilet has feces in it There were pubic hairs on the shower walls and drains the shower screen was not cleaned either We reported it to reception immediately and the next day after house keeping were in there were more hairs all over the walls when we would shower and the room would steam you could see the absolute filth of the place we took loads of photos to send to them to show them what we were talking about The carpet in the room was darks and stained from dirt I was disgusted with the lack of clean linen every set of sheets we received on our week holiday had marks on then of some sort ink blotches oh god sadly recalling the holiday is a bit of a drag The breakfast was 16 99 for dried up buffet food nothing was covered and there were flies flying around and you can be sure they had laid some eggs on something of other The food was very disappointing in the hotel to pay so much money for a cesar salad and it was so bland and normal I could have made a nicer one with a salad bowl and some meet We only ate the once in the hotel and ate out afterwards Considering the hotel is a 15 min fast walk from the metro and the bus station I would have expected the food quality to be at least decent The staff were friendly except when they tried to charge us extra for out late check out We are regular customers of the chain and loyalty members to receive no acknowledgement for this was just such bad customer service We will be staying the the Amsterdam West from now on and will never return to the Riverside Golden Tulip which is a shame as we will be travelling three times a year with a group of 55 tourist and we were scoping out the area They let the team down BIG TIME Filthy and I wouldn t be back onless they refurbished the place It looks so nice on the pictures but they have great ways of airbrushing all the dirt away No apologies were made for our issues , The chain of hotels but this property was no were near up to scratch it s been declared a 4star hotel and is no more than a 2 star if even that 
423250,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Breakfast was not included in the price and the meals were pricey so we didn t eat at the hotel The location is fairly remote but the Gaasperplaas metro stop is about 800metres away , Very adequate and quiet room with everything required including tea coffee facilities and was better than we were expecting But note that this was the Golden Tulip Riverside Hotel with the rennovated rooms The Tulip Riverside Hotel is actually in the same building with the same reception but the rooms here are not rennovated So make sure that your booking is in the Golden Tulip 
423251,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Staff Too cold , They should be honest about how far from the city the hotel is Staff are BT very friendly or welcoming and I was very cold I complained but nothing was done 
423252,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The Hotel is extremely far from Amsterdam city centre and especially badly connected to reach the hotel it is necessary to take the metro 53 up to the end Gaasperplas and then walk for a long distance along a lonely and scarcely illuminated road The room was not very well heated and during the night the temperature dropped down uncomfortably ,No Positive
423253,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The cleaning staff that bothered us 3 times within a time span of 30 minutes The location is not ideal but it takes about 30 minutes into the city which was not too much effort , The bedroom was very nice and big with a comfortable bed Practical if you have a car 
423254,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, There is a parking fee parking fee is very expensive staff very indifferent The locations of the room s very difficult in short a terrible facility , wonderful views of the lake the rooms are clean room in equipment quality 
423255,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Had no complaints at all, Overall a great stay The staff were amazing and very helpful didn t have any meals so can t comment on the food The room was spotless and the bed was extremely comfortable It is out of the way of the centre of Amsterdam but travel is convenient and only a short walk from the metro 
423256,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Too far from the centre 40 min by train or pay 35 euros for a cab I arrived at night on foot Surroundigs are very dark , Room was comfortable clean Place is silent 
423257,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, My complimentary teas and coffee was not replenish and I had to ask throughout my stay , Room was very basic Expected more from a 4star hotel However the restaurant meal was good value for money 
423258,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Personal at the reception was indifferent at best with only one exception No explanation that you were charged for parking no info about breakfast and no goodbye or thanks for now which I would consider being standard on a hotel Already at arrival I was cut off while explaining something And since the reception is the first and last thing you meet this has quite an impact on the overall experience We had trash in our room that was never disposed during our two day stay Unless I were to find an amazing offer I would not go there again , Nice personal in the restaurant Nice rooms and a good bed Food at the restaurant ok to god depending on course 
423259,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The website is misleading for distance to the centre really bad price over rated Not happy at all The metro didn t even work 2 of the 3 days we stayed so we had to take 2 buses which took most of our time up Taxi to town 35 euros which was ridiculous , Staff were lovely
423260,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, The location is roughly about 30mins from Amsterdam centraal It is about a 24min metro ride on line 53 Gaasperplas and then 8 10min walk to the hotel Can be a issue when the weather is bad or if you end up walking to the hotel at night Additional there isn t much near the hotel which makes getting drinks or snacks before you head to the hotel even more important If you do decide to buy drinks or food from the hotel be prepare to pay a lot for it 3 50 for drinks , Very large clean and comfortable rooms with nice staff 
423261,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Too noisy and so didn t sleep well Disappointed with the location so had to take taxis Breakfast was disappointing and not good value for money dry and looked like it had been out all morning , Dinner Comfortable bed
423262,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Didn t enjoy ironing at the end of a hall ,No Positive
423263,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Lack of shower acessories water and poor breakfast, Coffee near canal
423264,Golden Tulip Amsterdam Riverside, Too remote with Little to do in the area , Friendly staff
