227993,Boutique H tel Konfidentiel, No one at the reception between the hours of 9 pm and 7 am You enter with a code but some people might not like the fact there is no one there at night , Very courteous staff and lovely decorated and appointed room on the top floor Excellent location next to the Louvre and a lot of good restaurants Quiet street Had no street noise in my room which is important to me

227995,Boutique H tel Konfidentiel, Need self service coffee tea in room for the morning The pink Marie Antoinette on the wall takes some getting used to , Quiet room when windows closed Each room is on its private floor Comfortable bed Ironing board Polite staff 2 min walk to the RER station in Les Halles Hundreds of restaurants and bars to choose from within walking distance 
227996,Boutique H tel Konfidentiel, We re so disappointed with the hotel It doesn t come cheap and I felt like being ripped off Nearly 300 for an old dusty and lack of amenities in the room We stayed in the duplex one on the top floor and our king size bed was made of two single beds and you can easily tell when you lie down Doesnt have dental kit in the bathroom Low quality bathrobes and towels No restaurant serving breakfast only in room dining The only thing great about the hotel is their location other than that definitely consider other options in Paris You can get a lot better deals than this , Location
