71660,Novotel London Greenwich, tea and coffee facility area was crammed into a very small area and the bathroom layout was a little impractical though that is being very picky The most impractical thing for me was the lack of good lighting by the mirror in both bathroom and bedroom , The bed was large and very comfortable the room was reasonably spacious and included a small sofa 
71661,Novotel London Greenwich, It was fine Not much room around bed but apart from that I think was okay and starter place for our tour , The room we had on this date was much nicer than the one we had at the end of our tour at same hotel 
71662,Novotel London Greenwich, As above, Air conditioning wasn t very good Paid 60 pounds for late check out on last day but staff woke us with buzzer and phone call at 7 30am first lie in in 2 weeks Primitive shower bath in room Staff couldn t find booking when we arrived back We stayed before and after our tour around Europe Most 3 star hotels around Europe were better 
71663,Novotel London Greenwich, No air conditioning in the individual rooms I was on an upper floor and the temps reached the 80s This hotel given the cost of the rooms and the hotel looks to be fairly new it should have A C throughout the property , The bed was comfortable and the room was the right size for one person 
71664,Novotel London Greenwich, The bed was quite firm not very forgiving on my old joints There were no washcloths in my room Do they not have these in England , The staff were excellent Whenever we asked a question they not only answered it they gave us a map The allowed us to check in early after an overnight flight which was most appreciated I accidentally left clothes in the closet and they found them and stored them until I could return a few days later They were the best 
71665,Novotel London Greenwich, the room temperature could have been a little cooler although it was unusually warm that day, gave me a late check out with no extra charge very accommodating and helpful staff 
71666,Novotel London Greenwich, I stayed here a month earlier my room wasn t great Very tired looking and could have been cleaner I also encountered a very inpatient bad tempered member of your staff He was quite scary , Friendly helpful staff delicious breakfast waffles with maple syrup yum a pleasant room Comfortable bed 
71667,Novotel London Greenwich, Breakfast buffet was a little limited , Excellent location for London sightseeing DLR trains and buses Very clean and comfortable free Wifi Good value 
71668,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing I can think of here , I loved the fact that the toilet was separate from the bath shower room That was really useful Everything was spotless and easy to use The staff were brilliant too 
71669,Novotel London Greenwich, Sausages slightly under cooked at breakfast , Rooms really quiet despite being next to the train station Reception staff really helpful and well informed 
71670,Novotel London Greenwich, Although the breakfast was adequate we were asked to move to the bar area when we were having our final coffee We were not asked if we had finished our breakfast , The rooms were clean airey with all facilities needed 
71671,Novotel London Greenwich, Rooms size was adequate for the three nights just could have done with a little more elbow room Quirky on suite arrangements but were fine once you became accustomed to the lay out , Very close to the British Rail line and DLR services which was great for most travel needs Has an underground car park as well Nice quiet part of Greenwich just away from the crowds But only a few minutes walk to the centre of Greenwich and its shops cafes markets and of course Cutty Sark venue the museums and Greenwich Park Check out the Davy s wine vaults and bar which are next door 
71672,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Being right next to the Greenwich DLR and NetRail station is excellent Having a car park under the hotel is very useful too Lots of good pubs and restaurants nearby 
71673,Novotel London Greenwich, The room carpet was filthy and the room smelled musty We paid for a superior deluxe room and this was very much a let down , Lady clerk at the front desk was very helpful
71674,Novotel London Greenwich, We stayed in a disabled room and the bathroom floor was not that clean Shower had quite a bit of timescale There was nothing to keep the door open for when we entered the room with the wheelchair which made it awkward for when I was trying to push my mum in her wheelchair , The bed was very comfy Choice of breakfast was great also The staff were really helpful too Tea and coffee facilities in the room were great 
71675,Novotel London Greenwich, I paid 170 for a one nights stay here with my wife which by my reckoning is quite a lot of money However we read on the menu that they were going to charge us 17 each for breakfast We declined Surely they could have included this within the price This is outrageous especially when we also had to pay 17 to park our car in their car park overnight So very expensive Also the tiles were cracked around the shower control handle make the whole unit lose on the wall By the way I don t normally give negative feedback but on this occasion I will ,No Positive
71676,Novotel London Greenwich, The price of the accommodation was higher than we would have liked 198 for one night bed and breakfast but I suppose that s London prices especially when Celine Dion is playing at the O2 She was amazing in concert by the way , The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was excellent 
71677,Novotel London Greenwich, Bed was a bit too firm for me Breakfast choice a bit limited for the cost Chewy bacon , Clean well equipped room Big bed Friendly helpful staff Onsite parking Free wifi 
71678,Novotel London Greenwich, Decor bit dated Bathroom was clean but unpleasant smell from plug hole, Location was chosen for proximity to o2 arena Hotel is right outside Greenwich station
71679,Novotel London Greenwich, The bed room carpet was a little stained this time , We always stay here when we re going to a concert at the O2 Arena we like this hotel friendly staff comfy bed spacious room clean and tidy apart from a few stains on the carpet plenty of choice to choose from at breakfast all lovely also the bar and dining menu has a good choice to choose from all very nice Checking in and out was very easy friendly helpful staff at reception we had a query about the new eco bed linen they are using this was answered to our satisfaction

71682,Novotel London Greenwich, Thought breakfast price high so did not use that service, the bed was first class air conditioning system also very good Also liked that the window could be opened if wanted
71683,Novotel London Greenwich, Havnt found much to dislike about the place , Very good location for all the attractions including Greenwich Park which is no more than 5 to 10 mins away and DLR is only a couple of mins walk Meals were good and reasonably priced and the staff were excellent and very helpful Also good place to stay for the O2 
71684,Novotel London Greenwich, Plug points could be more conveniently placed there was none by the bed in the room I had , Friendly Staff and excellent location Very convenient to get in and out of London 
71685,Novotel London Greenwich, Noise from railway line right outside window Bed and pillows were not comfortable , Friendly helpful staff and good breakfast Good location geographically
71686,Novotel London Greenwich, Sadly the steam room was being worked on RECEPTION staff did not inform us on checking in Some of our party was arriving later which we informed the front of house Astonished when told one of the party for that room would not be able to access the room Due to the lead guest not being present despite having paid in full for both room After making a strong enough argument she was able to access the room , The interior design of the hotel was relaxing clean lines and modern location nice and central for things to do in Greenwich The wifi worked well with two of my devises 
71687,Novotel London Greenwich, The facilities in our room were comfortable however this was let down by the fact that the toilet was separated from the ensuite shower room and it did not have its own hand basin We therefore had to walk through the bedroom to the shower room to wash our hands after using the toilet This was not ideal The room decor is in need of update ,No Positive
71688,Novotel London Greenwich, The carpet in the lifts had stains and should be renovated The desk light is fixed to the desk right next to the tv There was no reading light next to the bed , Very clean bedrooms and bathrooms Very helpful staff Lovely breakfast buffet The bed is very comfortable

71693,Novotel London Greenwich, We didn t have breakfast because far to expensive The toilet had no toilet seat cover The shower was of poor standard you could not stand underneath and just shower it had to be held in your hand The room was classed as executive room far the the word executive ,No Positive

71695,Novotel London Greenwich, No negative thoughts about my stay , Very friendly staff Very accommodating g laid on a very early breakfast for London marathon runners Staff provided ice after the marathon 
71696,Novotel London Greenwich, At the hotel restaurant I had to wait a while to order There was a single staff member serving and at the time I arrived he was busy with something in the kitchen , I found the hotel to be very good for what I paid The hotel facilities as well as the room were clean and in order and I found the room to be very comfortable In addition the staff were courteous and friendly As for location there are good transport links with the station just next door and plenty to see and do in the Cutty Sark area a short walk from the hotel 
71697,Novotel London Greenwich, only thing that let it down was our room backed directly onto a train line which was noisey late at night and 1st thing in the morning It didn t bother us too much but annoying nonetheless , The breakfast was fantastic and the staff really friendly Ideal place for one night We would book again for going to the o2
71698,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Location to train station made travelling to City so easy short walk to beautiful Greenwich with it s lovely cafes market parks etc we will return 
71699,Novotel London Greenwich, Basically let down by housekeeping and room size Rooms are not big enough for families although advertised as such Often used glasses and trash were not removed Random number of towels each day no room service despite having a room service menu they answered the phone but said nothing was doable so we gave up and the room was over heated not helped by four people in a very small room Hairdryer didn t work and safe ran out of power locking our valuables irretrievably inside until it was re charged , Good location Greenwich and Blackheath are great plus Canary Wharf is a 10 min DLR ride away and accessible to the rest of London within 40 mins plus all usual amenities such as gym bar and restaurant Reception staff helpful and friendly 
71700,Novotel London Greenwich, Hotel is right next to the DLR and train station room was extremely hot and with window open it was very noisy , Bed was very comfortable Big room with separate bathroom and toilet Bathroom had a bath and shower 
71701,Novotel London Greenwich, Didn t stay for breakfast as the price was high Try Heap s Sausage Cafe nearby , Close to DLR and rail stations and well placed for Greenwich attractions Very quiet room 
71702,Novotel London Greenwich, I did not like the fact me and my husband paid 200 00 for a executive room which had been used by somebody else bed slept in and the room was dirty We was advised that room was clean We have pictures to tell otherwise It was disgusting I have a great deal of pictures to attache , Hated every minute at that hotel Unfortunately did not like anything 
71703,Novotel London Greenwich, I ve stayed here often the rooms are starting to feel a little tired Maybe it s the carpet but could do with an injection of fresh , Good location and if you re lucky a reasonable price Staff are courteous and professional I use this place when travelling into out of City airport 30 mins public transport easy 
71704,Novotel London Greenwich, You have to ask reception for vouches before having breakfast The Bose sound box in the room does not support 3 5mm or bluetooth so it make no sense , There is a Bose sound box in the room The TV is good 
71705,Novotel London Greenwich, Liked everything , Excellent hotel with super friendly staff ready to help you with anything you may need Breakfast although not included has a wide selection of hot and cold items 
71706,Novotel London Greenwich, Would have liked more choice of main meals , Very comfy bed and pillows Heating and ventilation easy to regulate Quiet Excellent breakfast Very friendly and attentive staff Easy access to wifi 
71707,Novotel London Greenwich, Once I arrived back around midnight I wanted to make the most of the 24 hour Room Service I was hung up on twice once the phone was answered the girl on the other end was so rude I was told room service would be and hour before I even ordered I was then told nothing s available She could and I quote Do me a mozzarella and pickle panini But this would be an hour and twenty and she was adamant there was a 5 tray charge before anything else and then she hung up Disgraceful service and it ruined my whole stay I was in an executive room which average at best , Location is great I was visiting the O2 for the boxing It was easy to find from the station and close to the O2 The reception staff were fantastic very welcoming and extremely helpful 
71708,Novotel London Greenwich, Room was far too hot and aircon didn t work , Good location for sports bar opposite and close enough to o2 Reception and all staff were very good and friendly
71709,Novotel London Greenwich, Breakfast prefer my sausages to look cooked brown not part cooked Seems most hotels these days do the same , Staff were courteous and very friendly in all areas Very helpful Requested room with space and near to elevator as my husband has a disability We had an excellent room which catered for our needs 
71710,Novotel London Greenwich, The hotel taxi service Was asked to inform the receptionist 15 20 minutes before we wanted to leave so she could order it Unfortunately for is the taxi disn t turn up and after waiting 45 minutes the receptionist went outside to a waiting black cab and sent us off in it Meant we were late for our show at the O2 , Staff very friendly Room a nice size and had everything in it including a fridge although it was empty Good location to stay if seeing a show at the O2 10 taxi ride for a ten minute journey to venue depending on traffic 
71711,Novotel London Greenwich, Although the options for food for breakfast were excellent the tea and coffee were awful both in the room and at breakfast , The staff were excellent and very helpful 
71712,Novotel London Greenwich, Food in the restaurant was variable quality but reasonably priced, Right next to overground and DLR Greenwich station All the facilities work reliably Polite and knowledgeable staff The coffee machine in the room and the water in the fridge is a nice touch and very welcome Breakfast was a buffet self service and had a good range
71713,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing really They had forgotten the toiletries in the room but not a problem Think there is limited parking for those in a car but it is London so that s always a problem , Great location right by the DLR and no serious noise even though facing the line My stay was short and did not have breakfast but had a snack in the restaurant which was ok for 9 30pm and served by friendly people 
71714,Novotel London Greenwich, The temperature control in my room 438 was fine My brother and sister in law in 436 had a few problems We didn t think it was bad enough to complain but we should probably have mentioned it , The ice maker by the lifts the 5 voucher for not having the room cleaned the power outlets a three pin socket and two USB over the bedside table the separate toilet and having both a bath and shower were unexpected by me but very welcome 
71715,Novotel London Greenwich, The breakfast was disgusting wish I hadn t of bothered closed an hour before they said they did as well so good job we went when we had Also the beds were ridiculous got no sleep as was so hard Like sleeping on a bed of bricks we paid more for a nicer place to stay and regret it A travellodge would of been simpler and got the neccassasaties right Also got to the hotel and had to pay full price for the room again as I d had a new card for my account and it wasn t the same number is my old one but the same account details Told Me I wouldn t notice it and 3 days later still not gone back in Hotel is a joke , The rooms were gorgeous and hotel itself was lovely 
71716,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing we were happy with everything , Good location the room was spacious clean adequate temperature and very comfy bed Staff is very helpful and polite Nice cafes restaurants only 10min away 
71717,Novotel London Greenwich, Food in bar seemed expensive, Very large bed facilities clean with an option not to have room cleaned everyday in exchange for a voucher for the restaurant
71718,Novotel London Greenwich, Toilet in room needs an air vent as there is no window and the walls are grey felt a little claustrophobic , Dinner was very scrumpy and tasty I wanted seconds Staff were friendly and helpful always with a smile on their faces The bath was a good deep size 
71719,Novotel London Greenwich, the first room they sent us to was a basic double and we had booked a superior However they did move us but spoilt the booking settling in process All took time out of our day too , we liked the good quality and choice of breakfast
71720,Novotel London Greenwich, Couldn t rub off the feeling that its getting a little tired to be in the 4 Star category , Location and ease of access to DLR Not so expensive as city centre 
71721,Novotel London Greenwich, Overall there was not anything negative to our stay, Staff very friendly and room was nice and clean the bar area was a little bit small but we enjoyed our quite drink in there
71722,Novotel London Greenwich, Breakfast was just ok not as good as I have had at other Novotel hotels , Fabulous location and facilities Perfect for a short break to see a show at the O2 
71723,Novotel London Greenwich, Only downside was the weather , Great location easy to find plenty of shops and restaurants nearby We visited the Observatory Planetarium and the Cutty Sark and they were all easy to get to about 10 15 minutes walk from the hotel beautiful surroundings We enjoyed our time here 
71724,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, I was waiting for the car park A very nice man came and helped me by finding a space in the otherwise full car park was very grateful to him as the nearest alternative was about 15 mins walk away and I needed to make a quick getaway in the morning for work He was very pleasant and helpful but unfortunately I didn t get his name Liked the room breakfast was great location awesome and would definitely stay there again and recommend to all my friends and family 
71725,Novotel London Greenwich, cost of breakfast was very expensive , Location was great on bus route next to train station lots of cafe s bars around area underground secure parking worth the cost even though on high street traffic noise was minimal 
71726,Novotel London Greenwich, The room was far too hot and airless The air conditioning was ineffective and noisy It did not respond to wanting the room at 5 degrees The water glasses were not washed or changed Strange arrangement of a separate toilet but no hand washing facilities so had to go around to the bathroom not very convenient or hygenic No grab rails in the bathroom The beds were not as comfortable as expected for this type of hotel Not as priceworthy as hoped ,No Positive
71727,Novotel London Greenwich, I suppose it would be best to provide the rooms with a shaving and dental kit from the very onset rather than having the guest request it, The fact that the staff were so helpful and friendly
71728,Novotel London Greenwich, The booking was completely messed up and cancelled without my knowledge although this was mainly the fault of booking Com who were suppose to deal with the problem and refund me the extra 70 00 I had to pay I have heard nothing from them very poor practice, The location
71729,Novotel London Greenwich, Not sure I like separate WC from bathroom but not a problem Will not prevent me from returning Just a personal comment , Staff were friendly and helpful we have stayed before and hope to return Good selection for breakfast 
71730,Novotel London Greenwich, Bed just a little on the firm side but only a very minor thing , Fantastic location for everything around Greenwich transport venues cafes shops pubs Very modern clean room staff very friendly We shall return without question 
71731,Novotel London Greenwich, walls in bedroom were quite marked so could be done with a paint touch up More drawers for storage of underwear etc as only one drawer in room a wardrobe for hanging up clothes so a bit of a squeeze for two people , Nice close to the DLR train station for comuting to from London Staff were very pleasant and helpful Hotel is lovely food was very good and no noise whilst upstairs in your room 
71732,Novotel London Greenwich, What we found not very nice that we had booked a room it was on the first floor when I asked on the Booking form for an upper storey room we thought that it would be higher up and the fact that when looking out of the window this room was facing a brick wall not very nice at all even though it was just for one night , Staff very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable 
71733,Novotel London Greenwich, Bar service, Nice room great location for what we wanted it for nice breakfast did wait to be served at the bar for over 10 mins had to ask at reception who said will be there In a minute Barman saw us then went away so a little frustrating
71734,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Veggie sausages available for breakfast without having to ask for them Excellent location for going to Charlton Athletic to watch Sheffield United
71735,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, This hotel we always stay at when we re going to a concert at the O2 Arena clean and comfortable lot to choose from at breakfast we had a lovely evening meal in the restaurant the menu had a good selection to choose from the staff were very friendly and helpful we will definitely stay here again 
71736,Novotel London Greenwich, The lay out of the room the toilet was seperat from the bathroom and had no sink so in the night you have to use 2 room s well presuming you wash your hands as most people do it s not like an on suite I don t know if all rooms are like this if so it would put me off staying again we love Greenwich and apart from the apartments have stayed in all other hotel s , Friendly and helpful staff great location and wonderfully comfy bed 
71737,Novotel London Greenwich, none, The room is a good size and clean The hotel is right beside a train station Good place to stay in Greenwich but also easy to go to many places in London Good breakfast and fast wifi
71738,Novotel London Greenwich, Overall a very disappointing experience The hotel gave us the vibe that they were running a factory rather than a hotel The hotel doesn t place much value on the customer experience Although the place wasn t bad per se there was nothing special about the hotel or its service Even on the smallest level the place was disappointing such as really cheap sand paper like toilet paper in the bathroom and no moisturiser It also felt that the hotel had no respect for its customers such as being required to pay for your room service on the spot rather than charging to the room Room service wasn t even brought into the room it was handed to me at the front door and the food was very average At most hotels it is a nice experience when staff wheel the food in when you stay with your partner It makes the evening special To be honest in all the years of ordering room service in hotels I have never had someone just hand me a tray at the front door Very disappointing Why did we waste our hard earned money on such a dull experience Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is after a special night If you are a business person and you just want a bed then maybe it will meet your needs but I would recommend purchasing your own toilet paper and eating out We went there for a romantic evening The hotel didn t make any effort to make our night feel special despite paying for a deluxe room , The location 
71739,Novotel London Greenwich, Room was too hot Bed not very comfortable, Spacious clean room very quiet considering on a busy road Excellent breakfast very attentive helpful staff 
71740,Novotel London Greenwich, Noise from party at ground floor disruptive but to be fair when complaint made staff apologised and had volumes reduced to acceptable level , Location and efficient helpful staff
71741,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing All was good, Nice Hotel very clean and comfortable The bed was huge Very helpful staff The hotel is really central and right next to the train station
71742,Novotel London Greenwich, One of my guests was charged 100 extra which took best part of week to be refunded but only when asked , Location value is ok clean good rooms breakfast has wide choice 
71743,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, I had a tour to join early so a breakfast bag was given to me which was really nice but I already bought an apple to take with me so decided to leave the breakfast provided by the hotel 
71744,Novotel London Greenwich, Bar service was a bit slow at times and they need to check cleanliness of glasses before serving drinks, The toast machine was perfect Bread went through ONCE and was perfectly toasted
71745,Novotel London Greenwich, Air Con unable to turn down Dreadful coffee Poor selection of bread Limited opening hours of gym for eary workers, Shower and bath Comfortable bed Fruit at breakfast Gym adequate
71746,Novotel London Greenwich, railway right next to the room but no excessive inconvenience thanks to the great insonorisation of the room, comfy bed great location close to Canary Wharf

71748,Novotel London Greenwich, Would not describe the bedroom as superior standard Room needs updating and Strange bathroom arrangement , Beds very comfortable Extremely friendly and helpful staff
71749,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Great to make tea coffee in your room large single beds that were very comfortable very close to the light rail station staff very helpful couldn t have been better 
71750,Novotel London Greenwich, The parking there were not enough spaces and I got a ticket outside The closest places to park are a bit of a walk away , The room was big and spacious I liked the separate toilet and bathrooms The bathroom had a bath and a shower which was great The bed was soo comfortable and the couch in the room was an added bonus I booked to stay for one night with my wedding group and the room was just perfect 
71751,Novotel London Greenwich, Slightly strange layout in the room Toilet separate to the bathroom but no hand washing facilities in the toilet meant you had to walk through the bedroom to access the bathroom before washing your hands Breakfast felt chaotic and looked like a bomb site Cereals scattered everywhere no saucers for the cups a hunt for the cutlery marmalade over spilling its bowl ran out of bacon but wasn t replenished very quickly Food marks up the wall against our table a bit off putting , Clean modern and contemporary Beds very comfortable lovely staff who demonstrated good knowledge of the local area Good facilities in the room Couldn t have wished for more Even an Ice machine for guests to help themselves 
71752,Novotel London Greenwich, Bed wasn t very comfy Room fairly small Shower and sink taps could have done with a proper clean Lots of limescale Have asked staff on 3 occasions for an invoice and still not received asked staff on reception twice and called once For 218 for one night would expect more , Location

71755,Novotel London Greenwich, There was only 1 member of staff on checking people in and out and sorting left luggage The car park entrance door did not open and the car in front was there waiting for a response for 20 minutes Eventually an engineer came and opened the door only for that car to be stuck inside in between 2 barriers We were there for over an hour just trying to check in and park It was like Faulty Towers Air conditioning in room hardly worked Staff member was hovering the hallway outside our room at 8am on a Sunday morning , The room was comfortable as was the bed 109 was still good value despite the problems 
71756,Novotel London Greenwich, Why is he lamp located to the left of the TV which covers some of the screen U can not move it so very unhelpful and was in the way when watching TV Also I requested and paid for a double bed but had 2 single beds pushed together , Great Location 
71757,Novotel London Greenwich, Staff unhelpful at bar Poor options for room service after 11pm only 3 options doesn t cater for very many peoples tastes Poor service at bar waited 15mins for change as staff member didn t know how to use the till plus they made my drink wrong Pint of Guinness took 30seconds to pull should be 2 and half minutes I m Irish I know how it should be done Staff don t know how to pull a proper pint none of the pints had heads Toilet in bedroom is in completely different room from the sink very unhygienic to have to open the toilet door then the bathroom door after using the toilet before being able to wash hands , The bar area was comfortable Bed was comfortable Friendly reception staff 
71758,Novotel London Greenwich, We booked the room to go on an Expat Coach Tour a 6 30 departure This appears to be a regular pickup point provides guests for the hotel There is no facility to get an adequate and early breakfast for these guest We were offered a take away breakfast that included a cookie This seemed an expensive and inadequate option We bought yoghurt from the supermarket This seems to be a significant oversight by the hotel , Clean comfortable
71759,Novotel London Greenwich, The room wasn t made up properly prior to our arrival I had asked for the sofa bed to be made up for our son This wasn t done as a consequence my husband had to assist the receptionist to make up the bed As a result there weren t enough towels and toiletries however this was quickly remedied once pointed out There seems to have been some cut backs since our last visit as a result the stay wasn t as enjoyable as it had been in the past , The beds are very comfortable Staff were very helpful particularly Linda on reception Breakfast was good
71760,Novotel London Greenwich, Bathroom was separated into two different rooms , Good location near Greenwich attractions and Greenwich university Friendly staff Conformable bed Good facilities 
71761,Novotel London Greenwich, breakfast was very poor and dining room for breakfast was very crowded we have waited for seat bathrooms are too small , Location is excellent very quite place there is no problem for transportation with London city
71762,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing really if I was picky perhaps a pot of tea with breakfast rather than flasks , Easy access pleasant and happy staff Beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean and tidy 
71763,Novotel London Greenwich, There was absolutely nothing I disliked , This hotel has thought of everything you could require for your stay from interactive games for children to a well stocked bar for adults Rooms are large and comfortable with plenty of electric sockets and USB ports Separate toilet room Bath had a plumbed in shower for hair washing and also a separate shower cabinet 
71764,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Greated with a smile and very friendly staff Really comfy rooms Toilet was desperate had a bath and a shower and very comfy bed and sofa bed if you needed 
71765,Novotel London Greenwich, Needs a complete refurb the interior is tatty and the toilet being in a small cupboard separate to the sink and shower is just such a bad design, Location is perfect Right next door to the train station and in easy waking distance to lots of lovely bars restaurants and cafes 
71766,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing coukd be better , Rooms were excellent The lady that checked us in was marvellous Also the Manager Flourian was charming funny and welcoming 
71767,Novotel London Greenwich, If you are a tourist visiting the center of London or west London please keep in mind that this is a 30 minute train ride from the Hotel to city center Also this hotel is 90 minutes from Heathrow using the underground Also I was there during a hot day not typical and the A C in the rooms were not as cool as I am used to for a normal hotel , Big Room clean next to underground and national rail Close walk to Greenwich park and planetarium 
71768,Novotel London Greenwich, The way I was treated on arrival There seems to be a mixup with my booking and the staff at front desk was not accomodating at all , The breakfast was good and staff at breakfast very helpful Room was clean and beds comfy 
71769,Novotel London Greenwich, The hotel room was good overall but the shower was useless The hose was twisted and try anything you couldn t get it to face outwards which made for quite a useless shower Such a shame ,No Positive
71770,Novotel London Greenwich, We are a healthy active couple and were given a room for handicapped people That is ok but in this case the height of everything from sink basins mirrors to hanging space was too low The carpet had significant cigarette burns in many places which made it unpleasant So much for a non smoking room No sofa lounge so little comfort compared with the good Novotel room we had in Southampton on the previous night , Location
71771,Novotel London Greenwich, the price of the bar drinks if they had been cheaper I would have spent more time and money there , the room was large and comfy and the breakfast was excellent
71772,Novotel London Greenwich, There were not many plug sockets No sockets near bed at all Having the toilet seperate to the sink and bathroom was strange and akward, Best part was the friendly staff All were extra smiley and willing to help Very professional and warm customer care

71774,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Friendly and helpful staff made our touristy week end in greenwich even more pleasant will definitely recommend and book again very good value for money and close to all attractions
71775,Novotel London Greenwich, The staff in the restaurant is not the best One of the waiters was keeping making inappropriate comments Plus we booked a table for 5 30 but it wasn t ready and forgot about the booking They also don t give tap water Additionally this was the 4th time we stayed at this hotel and didn t get any rewards or anything , The room was nice very clean and the bed extremely comfortable 
71776,Novotel London Greenwich, The bedroom was dirty with stains on the carpet and marks on the wall the bar area had wallpaper hanging off the walls and it just needs to have a tidy up Some of the staff struggled to speak good English Car Park was full and I had to park away from the hotel , The location is good and the hotel design layout works well Check in staff were nice and polite 
71777,Novotel London Greenwich, Minimum varieties for breakfast , For my stay in nobotel hotel before my euro trip with group Freindly staff Wifi availabe All room facilities availabe Close to the train station
71778,Novotel London Greenwich, The front of the Hotel is on the road Greenwich High Street and the back on the railway station If you cant sleep with aircon and need the window open then it is noisy all night , The location is excellent just a short walk from all the attractions of Greenwich and the hotel is clean modern with good facilities the staff really helpful and friendly the beds just right Had a superior room on the railway side we could hear the trains When I asked about this they moved us with no fuss to a quieter room over the lobby on the 4th floor We were disturbed by vehicles all night 
71779,Novotel London Greenwich, Breakfast was too expensive St Christophers Inn had breakfast for half the price of Novotel , The closeness to all transportation Very polite and helpful staff 
71780,Novotel London Greenwich, The lay out of the rooms is very French and does not correspond to our standards We like to wash our hands in the toilet We do not like to have to walk to the bath and wash hands waking up the other person in the room There is no proper night stand for a glas of water and reading glasses etc ,No Positive

71784,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing , Perfect locAtion to the dlr hotel was great nice bar restaurant breakfast was delicious rooms lovely staff very friendly close to town 02 not far Perfect 
71785,Novotel London Greenwich, If you need a reminder that the old saying you get what you pay for is usually untrue may I present Novotel It was not my first choice but I hoped the rather steep price would be offset by a spacious room with all the expected facilities The room was not small but still cramped Facilities a letdown Tiny insubstantial coffee cups and a TV with no programme guide i e for some reason it was one of the functions channels they d blocked Who really cares about a mini bar an in house laundry service or an ipad dock when you have a dodgy tv dodgy tea service and a strange two part ensuite arrangement shower and bath in a large screened off area toilet in a wardrobe size compartment which is almost in plain view of the person entering the room , I liked the location
71786,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Everything was excellent I could not fault this hotel at all the staff were so friendly and helpful the bedroom was clean and a very good size also quiet did not hear a thing in the room Would definitely return 
71787,Novotel London Greenwich, I didnt stay long enough not to like anything , The lovely receptionist who received me and offered to give me a packed breakfast at 6 30am when i checked out 
71788,Novotel London Greenwich, the rail line to charing cross was closed reopening in August , for my purposes Maritime museum excellent location quite got a good night s sleep
71789,Novotel London Greenwich, Breakfast menu limited and the restaurant food choice was also limited and of pub and not restaurant standard, Staff very friendly and professional Location very good for places of interest in Greeniwich and for the dock lands light railway
71790,Novotel London Greenwich, Noisy main road but can t be helped if the wife likes sleeping with the window open , Buffet breakfast not cheap but plenty to eat hot and cold Receptionists very helpful and cheerful Great location for DLR into London next to station 
71791,Novotel London Greenwich, Did not like that had to pay for car parking for my overnight stay , Greeted really well by staff on front desk helpful friendly and professional Room very comfortable and love option of bath and shower The breakfast was great 
71792,Novotel London Greenwich, Breakfast a bit pricey across the road breakfast half the price and very good , A friendly welcome on a arrival bar meal very nice bar staff very nice bed and pillows compfy
71793,Novotel London Greenwich, Toilet facilities walls not clean looking Rather expensive when only in the room to sleep For a few hours as I was out from an hour after check in until 2 3am Car park should be free considering cost of room is so much Cost of rooms should be reconsidered Train near by right outside window which wasn t pleasant Tv screen is very small , Comfy bed separate bathroom to the toilet facilities which I liked bedroom was clean shower room was clean Sofa I m room was comfy Nice coffee machine which I didn t use 
71794,Novotel London Greenwich, Food and drink are very expensive could have been cheaper for room service , The bed and pillows were very comfortable The breakfast was average I think the fried food could have been fresher We had a drink in the bar was very relaxing Excellent staff 
71795,Novotel London Greenwich, No 24 hour room service They can get take away but would have preferred non greasy food , Great location Good soundproofing and comfortable beds right beside the station and the heart of Greenwich
71796,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, We have stayed at this hotel before so knew it was in a perfect location for getting to and from the O2 Clean comfortable quiet with good facilities but above all the staff They were without exception the warmest friendliest most helpful group of staff members that we have ever encountered in any hotel ever 
71797,Novotel London Greenwich, We where charged for a breakfast that we never booked or received But only charged us when we had left the hotel This is twice it happened also I tried to claim our Accor rewards to find they had been put back to zero so never received them We have being using that hotel as we have family living in that area We will never use it again so please take us off all mailing lists and don t contact us again I rang the hotel to tell them not to send me any details and take me off all mailing lists and guess what I get this email you really do listen to your customers Please no more thank you and goodbye don t contact me again,No Positive
71798,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing, Reception staff Linda in particular were so helpful Loved the location Linda was helpful with useful info on public transport local amenities and things to see and do Will definitely visit Greenwich again 
71799,Novotel London Greenwich, I think The breakfast was too expensive for a family stay , Very helpful kind and polite staff Very clean room and comfortable beds I would definitely stay there again 
71800,Novotel London Greenwich, Disappointed the room toilet had no wash hand basin so that meant having to go round to the bathroom as the two we separate , The location made it for us being near the DRL station and within walking distance of the tourist attractions with plenty of eating establishments on route 
71801,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Location was excellent It is close to the station and was within easy walking distance of all the things we wanted to see Also easy to access the river boats that take you into London Staff were very obliging and breakfast was exccellent and well worth the cost We would definitely stay there again 
71802,Novotel London Greenwich, Overall we like the hotel and think the personel have a nice attitude On the downside it is rather strange and not very hygienic with how they have separated the toilet from the shower and bath facilities due to the toilet lacking a sink to wash yourself You have try not to think of all the places in between the toilet and the shower room where people might have put their hands on the way to having them washed ,No Positive
71803,Novotel London Greenwich, Bathroom developed a leak on final morning Veggie sausages at breakfast a bit bland soya or quorn based would be better , Heating easy to deal with room clean tidy Public areas looked after Wifi bonus 
71804,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Couldn t fault a thing we arrived early so they relocated our room to check us in early too Fab location for the O2 arena comfy bed great sound proofing excellent choice at breakfast Like I say can t fault a thing I can t wait to come back 
71805,Novotel London Greenwich, Bathroom was a little dirty and shower not the easiest to use dated Would prefer a toilet with a lid to close and the toilet was a little high Although understand we were possibly in a wheelchair friendly room so may be why Would like plug sockets close to bed but this seems to be an issue in most hotels , Comfy firm mattress Temperature was just right Location ideal for Greenwich Check in out was quick and easy with very friendly staff and foyer was well kept 
71806,Novotel London Greenwich, What looked like complimentary water in the fridge wasn t There was no indication it was subject to a charge of 2 75 per small bottle There should have been a yellow sticker or something to indicate but there was nothing I was impressed with the providing of mineral water as it is a done thing in hotel rooms A minor negative reminds me of restaurants that offer bread and butter which you haven t asked for them charge you when you take it without it being made clear there will be a charge , Great staff very attentive Best breakfast Lovely experience Will be booking again 
71807,Novotel London Greenwich, The only down side was that in the room the toilet was in a separate cubicle to the Bathroom and washing facilities Very weird , The Receptionist was the most welcoming I have ever encountered I was made to feel very special Through out our stay we were always greeted warmly 
71808,Novotel London Greenwich, Not much Could do with a touch up of paint in some small areas it had recently been re carpeted which did have an aroma of adhesive and that is being ultra picky , Staff were excellent comfortable room at a decent rate nice bar area and a good selection for breakfast close to train underground plus taxi rank very close by 
71809,Novotel London Greenwich, The lack of parking was terrible we drove to the hotel after a show at the o2 after previously being told by a member of staff we could double park we got back to find there was no space for us and was told to use a pay and display 5 10 minutes walk this was not acceptable and at first the staff did not seem to be bothered until we put our foot down and ended up double parking behind another guest the car park must of fitted about 20 cars there we aren t from the area and did not feel safe parking anywhere insecure not good if we were disabled and after a long day walking did not fancy another long walk after leaving our car in the middle of nowhere , The room came with free bottle of sparkling and still water and the nepresso machine was really good the beds were comfy and tv had a vast selection of channels bathroom facility s were spot on also although the bad service of parking facility s and lack of communication between staff the staff were very welcoming and friendly
71810,Novotel London Greenwich, We attended an event at the O2 getting back to the area quite late We were quite hungry having skipped tea but everywhere in the area was closed when we got back at midnight We thought the hotel might have some snacks for sale or a vending machine but there was nothing The lovely night porter gave us some peanuts from the bar but if we hadn t asked we wouldn t have got I guess this isn t a problem for anyone staying here who isn t looking for a midnight snack but something to bear in mind for others attending events finishing late at the O2 , The hotel was in a nice location It was right next to the local DLR station with links to Canary Wharf and central London which was ideal Cutty Sark and the Thames Clipper dock were within walking distance as was Royal Observatory It was really nice inside and very clean The staff were very friendly polite and helpful It was well worth the money 
71811,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing for us all was good , We were treated very well by all the staff made to feel that they were there just for our benefit unusual these days Nothing was too much trouble Best breakfast I have had in a hotel of your size for a long time 
71812,Novotel London Greenwich, The room was never very warm and the central heating was a bit of an enigma to turn up or down The bath was a reasonable size but would have been a bit small for a 6 footer Maybe some of the fittings were getting a bit dated Refurb , Good location of the hotel for all visits in and around London Good transport and very nice base for the local museum Cutty Sark O2 and the rest The hotel itself was tidy and the staff were very professional and hospitable The bathroom was of good size and the bed felt comfortable And maid service was daily And free Wi Fi was a bonus 
71813,Novotel London Greenwich, My only complaint was the drink price where a little on the high side but that s to be expected for London Just whish we stayed a little longer , Very close to the DLR trains for travelling into central London Staff very accommodating and breakfast was all you could want with a great selection on offer They also do a great Burger menu at a decent price would recommend the almighty Nice little bar to have a drink in the evening although a little pricey The front desk where extremely helpful and informative 
71814,Novotel London Greenwich, Only thing I would say is the bathroom being separate in a very small cupboard was not great but did not hinder our stay or enjoyment, The staff were very friendly and helpful We celebrated my partners birthday and they gifted us a free drink each in the bar and left a birthday card in our room We felt very flattered and it really made our day 
71815,Novotel London Greenwich, Nothing, Very convenient location i had booked a superior room and it was money well spent Staff couldn t have been anymore friendlier or helpful 
71816,Novotel London Greenwich, Our room was too warm With the window as far open as it could go we then had the Friday evening noise from outside , Friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and the location of the hotel Parking was easy to access and reasonably priced too 
71817,Novotel London Greenwich, Having to leave , Appearance of a hotel is a start Friendly welcoming staff Layout furniture that I could see vey well thought of and nice Room was A little tooooo comfortable did not want to leave For a first time stay at a Novotel hotel extremely impressed with ALL ASPECTS of the hotel and theaccomadation 
71818,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Linda on reception was most helpful and obliging All the staff acknowledged you with a friendly smile as you passed through reception Very close to station buses cafes and restaurants
71819,Novotel London Greenwich, I did not like that there was no dresser chest of drawers to unpack my clothes I was only able to hang up my coats in the small closet Would have liked even just a couple of drawers to store my clothes in so I didn t have to live out of my suitcase The ice machine did not work on a few of the floors but that was only a minor inconvenience , Great Location and was very quiet despite being near bars The hotel was clean and the room was very comfortable Close to bus stops that go further into Greenwich and up into Blackheath but also an easy walk to anywhere in Greenwich My room had a lovely view and the room was never too cold The bed was comfortable and I liked the couch in the room Overall I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely be looking to Novotel the next time I am in Greenwich 
71820,Novotel London Greenwich, The key to our room didnot work but after letting reception know it was immediately fixed, Proximity to venue for a wedding we were attending The position of the hotel was ideal for travelling into London The restaurant and food were very good 
71821,Novotel London Greenwich,No Negative, Received free upgrade on arrival staff were excellent can t fault the hotel other than hammer drill going from 3 6pm on Saturday afternoon when we were having a nap before a night out 
71822,Novotel London Greenwich, One minor issue reported to the desk The silicone or rubber on the shower door had slipped so the door would not close properly and hence water leaked onto the floor , Thoughtful design of room Separate toilet Very comfortable 
71823,Novotel London Greenwich, Disappointed that although I had used this hotel several times in the past they could not grant my request to be allocated a room at the front Noise from overland rail DLR affect rooms at the back Price of breakfast at over 16 extortionate the public house next door far better value , Location nice rooms well furnished and comfortable 
71824,Novotel London Greenwich, The shower leaked into the room This was due to poor design of the bathroom This allowed water to leak from the shower basin , Excellent hotel very helpful staff and all round excellent value for money 
71825,Novotel London Greenwich, The room they provide me was for whilechair and it was not really friendly for me Because I was not used to use short of accessories and was not handy for me , I like the location and the area

71827,Novotel London Greenwich, The hotel does not try hard enough to deserve four stars plug that didn t work in the bathroom cheap toilet paper only basic toiletries relatively limited and poor value breakfast lack of information in the room , The hotel adjoins the Greenwich rail and DLR station 
71828,Novotel London Greenwich, Hotel bedrooms could do with bit of upgrade e g New carpets smelt a bit musty Having said that the rooms were well serviced and cleaned well just a little shabby in places , Location was great plenty of places to eat nearby and close to station for links to central London Staff were very courteous professional and helpful Room was good size for London and comfy bed with good quality linen Food was very good especially the breakfast 
71829,Novotel London Greenwich, Breakfast was OK but expensive for the choice and overall quality Toilet in the room was separate to the bathroom and was very small with no wash basin , Staff very helpful quiet hotel despite being yards from the DLR station Room very clean bed was nice and comfortable nespresso machine was a nice touch 
71830,Novotel London Greenwich, No bad experiences at all , The location is perfect for most major tourist attractions the tube network and sights of London You can walk to most places too if you have the energy And the view from my hotel room overlooking Tower Bridge is worth travelling around the world for 
71831,Novotel London Greenwich, No continental breakfast or coffee in room available Restraunt quite expensive , Location was very good right close to the train rooms and bed quite comfortable and well appointed Staff was very friendly and helpful Very good cafe right down the street Plumtree 
71832,Novotel London Greenwich, Air condition in the room did not work It was constantly 27 28 deg celsius in the room despite an open window 24 7 Complained about it and was informed that at this time of year there is only heat available in the central system, Conveniently located directly at the DLR train station
71833,Novotel London Greenwich, The room was not ready on arrival and the bed was two single beds put together I booked a twin room as I traveled with my sister , A voucher for a free drink for my sister and I as the room wasn t ready for us on arrival The double bed was changed to twin beds upon complaint fairly quickly The staff were friendly and helpful 
71834,Novotel London Greenwich, The shower falling off the wall slightly injuring my shoulder On showing the reception staff the photo we got an astonished apology nothing else forthcoming We are very very annoyed Photo available not yet posted , Location cleanliness bar and bar staff

71843,Novotel London Greenwich, A few hiccups during my stay no replenishment of mini bar with water late return of laundry My room was overlooking the railway station wake up guaranteed at 5h30 , Greenwhich is a very nice district of London 
71844,Novotel London Greenwich, I asked for a room at the front rather than the back because of the noise from the railway I believe this necessitated the hotel making a change in room allocation The room I was given at the front had a very unpleasant looking large dark stain in the carpet I pointed this out to the Front desk when I was leaving the next morning It s not a room that should have been given to anyone and surely the housekeeper should have been informed prior to my notifying the Front desk , I ve stayed here several times in the last few years because the hotel is ideally located for travel and my office 
71845,Novotel London Greenwich, Whilst the pancake making machine was quite exciting the hot breakfast buffet was a little disappointing mainly that it was not kept stocked and there were a lot of empty trays no beans or sausages etc , Literally a few steps from the station and you are in the Novotel And its around 5 mins walk into Greenwich and the Cutty Sark Maritime Museum etc Very comfy bed had a great nights sleep 
71846,Novotel London Greenwich, I had an early start for the day I paid for breakfast but it was not ready in time They did pack me a takeaway but it was not worth the extra money I paid for it , The front of house staff were very friendly and very welcoming The bar staff great very helpful
