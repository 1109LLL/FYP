497242,Best Western Hotel St George,No Negative, The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful Very convenient for metro bus tram Breakfast was good No cooked food but lots of everything else you could wish for Room was fine for a single guest Wifi was strong signal in the room 20 euro taxi from the airport Afternoon tea and cake was a great idea 
497243,Best Western Hotel St George, There is no parking You can park in the street but you should put a ticket 8 00 19 00 Or you can use valet service which costs 24 EUR for 24 hours There are many bars in the neighbourhood but also homeless people sleeping next to the hotel It is good for couples but not for families , The room is very big clean and comfortable
497244,Best Western Hotel St George, The bathtub had glass doors that did not cover enough of the tub wall and since the shower head was across from it water went everywhere The parking in this area is terrible but if you don t have a car its in a great location Some street noise Not handicapped accessible , The room was beautiful with a partitioned bedroom since it was a triple 2 TVs Lots of desk space Breakfast was delicious Great location as long as you don t have a car Lots of restaurants and shopping Busy location 
497245,Best Western Hotel St George, There are a few stairs before the reception I didn t find it annoying but i think i should mention it , Close to metro station 2minutes walk 160m distance Nice breakfast you should try the lemon pie 
497246,Best Western Hotel St George, San Siro museum was very disappointing Very few trophies on show mainly old jerseys worn by stars of the past very little historical information too Not worth the 17 Euro feeand not a patch on Nou Camp Bernabeu Old Trafford or Easter Road , Very friendly and helpful staff Hotel is very close to the shops and many top quality restaurants nearby too Close to metro station too which is very easy to use and inexpensive too with one or two day tickets to travel anywhere on the main city lines 
497247,Best Western Hotel St George, Breakfast finishes earlier than advertised Staff actually lock people into the dining area to prevent anyone else getting in during the last few minutes This is rude not hospitable Also the hotel has pictures of a superior room in the standard room section Misleading your customer is never a good start , Location is fine
497248,Best Western Hotel St George,No Negative, Nice and clean room WIFI worked well About 15mins walk from Milano Centrale Helpfull staff they helped to get our suitcases up and down the stairs from the front door to the reception Instant coffee and tea in the room were a pleasant addition Everything worked fine in the room 
497249,Best Western Hotel St George, Parking was important to us Hotel never replied to my booking com online inquiry about the parking proceedure It was marked that the hotel has parking but nowhere on the booking com it was mentioned that it is a valet parking at a fee of 25 euro per day From the information on booking com we understood that parking is part of the property facilities and icluded Couldn t use the safety box even after the instructions from the receptionist The hotel would be considered great if it were 3 star property far from being best as 4 star hotel,No Positive
497250,Best Western Hotel St George, Ground floor is actually 1 story above the street without elevator access so only stairs which wasn t great with a stroller There are two elevators but both are small Even when dry the bathroom floor and the bedroom was extremely slippery , Great breakfast selection given the room price Central location within walking distance a small effort from the train station Helpful and friendly staff 
497251,Best Western Hotel St George, There was nothing to dislike , The custard in the croissants was a bonus indeed the breakfast was superb The staff were brilliant The afternoon tea was novel The recommendation for dinner at Mamma Rosa on Piazza Cincinnato 4 was inspired The staff were brilliant and would particularly like to mention Letizia and Fallilico The hotel was a nice walk from the Duomo but could have used the tram system The trams were a bit like the old Blackpool trams with loads of character Did the Hop on Hop Off Bus and really saw the city Was there for 2 nights and one full day in the city Could have done with another day The Milanese people were very welcoming 
497252,Best Western Hotel St George, Shower was broken and the breakfast And the guy he Works and Night on the Rezeption Not really frindly and he didnt no where is a Bar or Restaurant around the Hotel, The one Young guy from the Rezeption he where we Checked in Very frindly 
497253,Best Western Hotel St George, Polystyrene cups for tea making in room never experienced that before tea n coffee needs to be a cup , Staff were exceptionally accommodating nothing was too much trouble super helpful 
497254,Best Western Hotel St George, Too noisy you can hear the tram and people from the streets you hear every opened and closed door or even your neighbors not reallly sound proofed , The bed was very comfy the room was very clean the breakfast was exccelent for me and the staff was very friendly and helpfull 
497255,Best Western Hotel St George, Despite the room was cosy it was quite noisy in the morning because of the street cars trams roadworks all these produced a lot of noise The window is equipped with a special glass section to reduce the noise didn t help a lot but this also blocks the flow of fresh air Also I didn t like breakfast the only place where staff wasn t friendly at 10 00 they asked to leave the dining room Normally 4 hotels never do this they just kindly ask if you would like something else to take because the buffet is going to be closed But not at this hotel The rest was quite good , My room was quite cosy there was a wooden floor a safe tea coffee facilities The bed was very comfortable The staff on the reception was very friendly and this is really valuable The hotel is very conveniently located 15 minutes by walk and you re at the Milano Centrale 1 2 minutes and you are at the tram station And also if you want to go to see the POI at the downtown by walk it doesn t take so much time 
497256,Best Western Hotel St George, The room was newly renovated I believe and the leather used to cover the bed edges had a strong smell The room is a bit small for two persons , I particularly liked the bed it was quite comfortable for a hotel one The staff was very helpful and well prepared to cater for our needs The room is equipped with all the amenities for a good stay The location is also quite convenient near Porta Venezia just three metro stops from the Duomo 
497257,Best Western Hotel St George, noise from the street and from the corridor slamming door unpleasant smell in the room even after opening the windows small bed not a real double , ok breakfast very welcoming staff car park service
497258,Best Western Hotel St George, i dont often comment on hotels but very very noise on the road side bad smell in the room moisture uncomfortable bed and pillow disappointing shower size and equipment dont worth the money, the only good thing is location
497259,Best Western Hotel St George, The windows have to be improve to isolate noise from the street and the cable car that runs until 2 00 am and makes difficult to rest, Very well located nearby Piaza del Duomo metro station and Train Station
497260,Best Western Hotel St George, Air conditioner wasn t working for first 3 nights of our stay we couldn t sleep of hotness and when open the windows the sound of the road so crowded Poor breakfast Small room, Location
497261,Best Western Hotel St George, Soundproofing in the room could be better There was an unknown funky smell in the corridors and in the room could be from the cleaning products , Conveniently located near a metro station Milan s central station is within a 15 minute walking distance Satisfactory breakfast Suitable for a short city break
497262,Best Western Hotel St George, Our room was at first floor where the breakfast was served so it could be a bit noisy in the morning from time to time since the heavy door divides rooms from the salon I didn t mind it a lot but if someone has light sleep perhaps can ask for different floor Other than that you can also get good rest since it is not a noisy area during the night Which is important after long walks in lovely Milan , I really enjoyed my 3 nights stay at St George hotel Location is really good close to the Grand central station and Republica square so you can even walk from airport shuttle bus drop location central station or take a taxi from central station to the hotel for up to 10 euros if you have a lot if suit cases Metro station P ta Venezia is really near to the hotel which can get you wherever you want in Milan but it is also very close to Duomo and other sites if you like to walk Breakfast was excellent nice spread Not only sweet breakfast as you can often see in Italy but full spread scrambled eggs hams cheese etc Staff was really helpful and pleasant We stayed for Labor Day Holidays so we asked receptionist Stefano to help us understand if some locations were working or not and he called them for us and was generally very helpful Same as other members of the staff Probably as part of genius booking status we came an hour earlier before usual check in and were able to check in immediately I sent this note to hotel in advance via booking as well I would definitely recommend it and stay there again when in Milan 
497263,Best Western Hotel St George, Breakfast room didn t have enough capacity and we had to wait in the foyer area to be called, Very efficient and friendly reception staff Matteo and Litizia
497264,Best Western Hotel St George, The only negative point was the shower position inside of the bathtub but was a small detail The electrical connector is a little different but was solved by the technician in few minutes , It was pleasant to stay Hotel well located We moved from the airport on the shuttle to the train central station and from there by taxi to the Hotel Very attentive people serving breakfast and acceptably varied Happy with my stay The people from the desk friendly and always try to help You Hotel Recommendable 
497265,Best Western Hotel St George, We could not really open the window at least there was a huge glass panel that we didn t dare open The room was quite stuffy The coffee at breakfast was instant coffee and undrinkable Only found out later that you can order good quality coffee from staff Breakfast overall was only average Definitely not a 4 star hotel That being said the price is quite acceptable and we would book here again , Very friendly and helpfull staff Excellent location with lots of restaurants nearby Close to public transport 
497266,Best Western Hotel St George, Very small lobby Lift travels very slowly and at the bathroom WC height is much higher than the standard , Perfect location close to shopping area and to Duomo
497267,Best Western Hotel St George, Very strong smell of some cleaning chemical like in hospital and no shampoo only shower gel but rest very nice, Very good position clean hotel and nice personal and window you can open 
497268,Best Western Hotel St George, Overall summary Decent location but do not stay here if you want a decent night sleep or air con We stayed for 2 nights and when we arrived in Italy the temperature was a warm 21 degrees The hotel had still been pumping out the heating and our room had had the balcony door shut all day so the room was like a furnace when we arrived at about 4pm A few issues prevailed 1 Contrary to the hotel description on booking com the hotel does not have air conditioning so we could not cool the room down and we I spoke to the hotel staff about the heat in the room they told me there was no air con and due to a law in Milan they could only pump put warm air until told otherwise 2 We did not have a window in our room We had a balcony door but this led on to a shared balcony for the whole floor that then led to the outdoor fire escape stairs meaning that any one could from the street or hotel could walk into oit room This was the main issue as it mean we could not go out for the day and leave the door open incase someone walked in so the room was a constant closed box with the heating on I told the hotel staff about the issues there was no room that they good move me to they had no fan they could lend us and they had no solution and although they were very polite were not much help We went out for the afternoon and eve for dinner hoping that maybe on our return the room would have cooled it had not Neither of us could sleep and exasperated at 4am I was down to the reception staff begging for them to do something or I d not be staying another night They took my pleas a bit more seriously and said they would change our room the next day to one with a window Next day came room changed to one with a window on the main road We could cool the room down which was great but now on the busy road so it s a bit noisy but it was a much better improvement so all was ok we were now just knackered from bit having slept , The location is very central and close to a tube
497269,Best Western Hotel St George, 1 The receptionist promised will inform the housekeeping lady to make my twin beds into a double bed But some how they forgot or what I didn t ask again since only one more night left before I leave the hotel 2 Hotel doesn t have the shuttle bus to airport It s better to call it a car service I guess With one person will cost 100 Maybe with more people can share with a better price The real shuttle bus service is locats at the central station with the cost only 8 p p , Hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful Very close to public transportation 
497270,Best Western Hotel St George, Breakfast could be more diverse but overall it was ok , The hotel location is very good we could walk to center train station stores on Corso Buenos Aires the staff is very friendly and helpful especially Matteo The suite we stayed in is quite spacious and has comfortable bed 
497271,Best Western Hotel St George, For us we found the hotel a little too far away from the centre Also the bath shower combo was odd had to crouch in a corner to stop water spraying everywhere due to a small shower screen , The staff were very friendly and helpful Lots of choices for breakfast to set you up for the day Also complimentary tea and cakes in the afternoon is a great bonus 
497272,Best Western Hotel St George, Rooms neeeds to be renovated Breakfast room was relatively inadequate for handling the hotel guests Reception desk was rather confined and small Lift was small , Perfectly located on Via Tunisia very close to Corso Buenos Aires 15 minutes walk from Milan Central Station Breakfast was brilliant Tea break hour was a very nice gesture Close to a mini market and Carrefour Express Very close to P la Venezia metro station Room family suite was very spacious provided with all facilities possible Staff was very helpful Bed was very comfortable We had a very pleasant stay 
497273,Best Western Hotel St George, We did not complain about it to the staff but the TV was not working properly and neither was the heater AC It was never warm in the room as cold air was coming in through the balcony door and mostly only cold air came in from the heater AC as well , The staff was very friendly 
497274,Best Western Hotel St George, Room was a bit small but comfortable enough Breakfast was a limited to bread and cereals for vegetarians Breakfast room would get very busy get there before 7 45am and there was usually only waiter who was really nice and was working very hard , Location was excellent A short walk to the nearest train and metro stations Quite a few quality shops in the area Centrale station is only 10 15mins walk away Numerous restaurants nearby Japanese Thai Indian Chinese Vegan Raw etc The staff were extremely nice and helpful They always had a smile on their faces and were always willing to answer our questions TV channels in the room are all in Italian but if you re into your football you ll get to watch Premier League games 
497275,Best Western Hotel St George, I stayed at Best Western Hotel St George in Milan 24 28 02 2017 That was the first time I chose the hotel The last day has spoiled completely all the impression of my staying as far as when I returned to my room I found out that my travel bag was searched and my money were stolen I cannot describe my disappointment and frustration I supposed the staff of such a hotel should respect its guests and their property and I was sure my things are safe in my room The room was not cleaned as it supposed to be but it was robbed I am still shocked And after this thing happened I was not even been contacted by the hotel manager to discuss the issue I am sure that someone from the staff has stolen the money and the hotel management should get aware of that and take appropriate measures Taking into account the said above I cannot recommend the hotel at all ,No Positive
497276,Best Western Hotel St George, The room was quite different from the photos I saw when booking There was a column between the bed and the tv which was very uncomfortable , The staff is really nice They have prepared a breakfast bag for me as I needed to check out at 4AM I really appreciate it 
497277,Best Western Hotel St George, No idea I liked everything about this hotel , The location is great very decent area less than 1 mile from the Central Station and 2 subway stops or walking distance to the Cathedral The subway stop is right around the corner and the tram stop a few meters from the hotel Great shopping area also The room has plenty of space and everything you need it is clean and nicely furnished A mini bar and tea coffee facilities are also in the room Wi fi works fine Breakfast suits everyone as it has a lot of choices The stuff helps you at all times I will certainly book this hotel next time I come to Milan

497283,Best Western Hotel St George, The toilet paper was not changed every day One of the TVs did not work when asked staff for help they tried to turn it off but it seems not to be working The hotel should solve this issue , The rooms location breakfast and staff attitude are excellent Also our junior suite was very large comfrotable and clean We have been to this hotel a few times and will definitely return again Great place to stay in Milan It is definetely one of the best hotels in the area and the best value for the money

497287,Best Western Hotel St George, there was a strange pungent smell on the floor but in the rooms a bit too cold in the room even with the AC turned on heat the tram passed right in from on our hotel so it was a bit noisy but not very disturbing so as to wake you up , close to Stazione Centrale Porta Venzia Metro station and suburban train Avenue Buenos Aires and the city center there are supermarkets and pizzerias close to the hotel the staff was friendly and accommodating we had a problem with the light in our room but they fixed it right away breakfast was tasty with cheese Italian cold cuts breakfast cereal yogurt coffee milk juice water biscuits tarts 3 types of pastry butter jam fruit bacon and eggs you had the possibility to make your own fruit juice free Wifi good connection TV in the room complimentary tea at 4 pm newspapers to read in the morning

497326,Best Western Hotel St George, The hotel faces a busy road so you get all the noise from the street Also the walls are paper thin and it s hard to tell whether your neighbors are talking in their room or they have entered yours by mistake and you just don t see them Basically don t expect to get uninterrupted sleep on a weekend , The location is very good within 15 minutes walking from the central square and 2 minutes from the closest metro station The staff is friendly and helpful 
497327,Best Western Hotel St George, breakfast was very poor and tasteless , the view of our room was very nice the hotel is very close to metro station and in walking distance to fashion district
497328,Best Western Hotel St George, City tax 10 for two for each night Crazy We usually get our fridge welcoming refreshments included in the price This hotel leaves you with an additional charge which was a bit surprising for us I kept thinking that the receptionist was talking about extra orders from their bar Very confusing and embarrassing If I have to go into some details about the room itself the shower grout could be refreshed as well as the silicone Mould in 4 hotel should never be present , Perfect room delicious breakfast 
497329,Best Western Hotel St George, Quite a small room Breakfast area was small not enough space for all guests so had to wait for a table to be cleared and re set Not many staff at breakfast and afternoon tea so things ran out and were not refilled quickly had to wait for someone to notice that the juice had run out , Clean very friendly and helpful staff Breakfast and afternoon tea included 
497330,Best Western Hotel St George, Airco was not yet switched on making the room unpleasantly warm early April, Location is good walking distance from Central Station In the area some bars and hotels nice for a drink at the end of a day in Milan Huge breakfast gives a good start of the day Bicycle stand rental next to the hotel and the Underground on 200 m I forgot my coart in the closet and it was kept with our luggage until we picked it up at end of the day great service 
497331,Best Western Hotel St George, 1 The room smelt cigarettes I couldn t fall asleep because of this smell 2 The corridor outside the rooms smelt repairs 3 Not a single hanger in the hall of the room 4 The breakfast was a disaster the dining room was small and there was a queue to sit down at the table The choice of food was really poor it was really strange for a breakfast in Italy I actually booked this particular hotel because I read in the reviews that they have lots of fruit and fresh juices But the fruit was little There was a juicer but no oranges to squeeze The staff at breskfast was nervous and messy , 1 Close to Corso Buenos Aires 2 Spacious bathroom in the single room In fact nothing else was good about this hotel I wonder who gave it 4 stars

497335,Best Western Hotel St George, Bad smell in the hallway and the room it had permeated even the clothes the smell remained even when you return home I think it is of any use of disinfectants or something else Sound insolation completely bad like sleeping on the street or when the door neighbors do or walks seems like everything runs in your room , Comfortable bed good location amazing staff 
497336,Best Western Hotel St George, The only criticism relates to the buffet style breakfast 7 10 00am weekdays 7 30 10 30am weekends Some guests came down 30 45 minutes before the end time to find that breakfast items had run out and not replenished simply told that s all that there is when they asked This included bread rolls running out cold meats fruit and even the urn of Americano coffee which had stood for ages and was strong and stewed anyway If folk have paid for breakfast then it should be plentiful and all items available until the end of the advertised time One tip we learnt from overhearing others ask for Capuccino coffee the waitress serves it to you and it s hot freshly made and tasty much nice than the urn stuff , Clean and comfortable hotel situated about 20 minutes walk from Milan Centrale railway station the airport shuttle terminus and also 20 minutes walk from the Duomo and main shopping area Ideal
