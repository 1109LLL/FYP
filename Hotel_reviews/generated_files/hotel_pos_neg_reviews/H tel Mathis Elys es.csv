137213,H tel Mathis Elys es, We were disappointed that the bar has closed permanently That was a surprise , My family of 7 stayed at the hotel 3 rooms and found it delightful We wanted a quaint boutique Parisian hotel with great location and got it 
137214,H tel Mathis Elys es, There was no storage for clothes in drawers only limited room in a closet to accommodate clothes you might hang up This would be OK for a one night stay but no longer We had to live out of our suitcases Also the shower consisted of a hand held fixture attached to the bath tub which one had to hold up over their head to wash off the soap etc There was no shower curtain or any way to keep from splashing water on to the floor , There was an extra room as part of the facilities as part of a room called a Junior suite Our granddaughter loved having the privacy 
137215,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, The staff was excellent very helpful and really made us feel welcome and at home They accommodated us with all our needs the hotel was clean cute everything you would want for a authentic Parisian experience Would recommend 
137216,H tel Mathis Elys es, We liked everything , Lovely staff helpful and friendly Great room comfy bed with lovely crisp bed linen quiet and air conditioned Good area 10 minute walk to arc de triomphe and lots of other sights nearby Lots of bars and restaraunts right on the doorstep 
137217,H tel Mathis Elys es, The bar that was advertised was never open and breakfast was poor for the money The waiter poured us one cup of coffee but never appeared again to offer a second and when we left I noticed he was in the back room texting on his mobile , Location was very good and the room was quite 
137218,H tel Mathis Elys es, Rooms are small but you are in a big city that is just the way it is , The staff was very helpful and friendly Very welcoming The rooms very fresh and updated linens and towels fresh and fluffy A c perfect since it was 94 outside the entire stay The location could not have been more perfect Near subway bus and walking to most major sights Plenty of places all around to eat We had a great time 
137219,H tel Mathis Elys es, The bar has been closed for two months but there were plenty of nearby places It was just fine for us family of 4 included two 14 year old grandchildren We felt safe there , Excellent location friendly staff clean comfortable
137220,H tel Mathis Elys es, The fancy cocktail bar wasn t open which ws a pity as it looked great on the website very traditional 1920 s style, Very good room clean and good standard of fictires and fittings Despite overlooking the street the room was very quiet In fact whole hotel was very quite A very stylish and well run hotel 
137221,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, What a fantastic hotel The manager went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and we loved our room and the location of the hotel Highly recommend staying here 
137222,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, Very friendly staff Excellent location I read lots of bad reviews about the original elevator but in reality it was a piece of art very original and it fit all of us 3 adults and a child Didnt git the baby stroller but it wasnt a problem as the staff store it down and hand it to us before leaving which was better for us 
137223,H tel Mathis Elys es, Not the hotel s fault but the people next door came back at 4am and were really really loud Felt like they were drunkenly partying in our room , Super friendly staff Loved the decor and fun quirks to the room They made good use of limited central city space Also really appreciated the nice amenities 
137224,H tel Mathis Elys es, Nothing to mention, Perfect location easy access to public transportation proximity to bars restaurants shops etc Very good professional staff Will definitely consider staying at Hotel Mathis once more while visiting Paris 
137225,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, everything was just perfect and moreover the cost effectiveness of this hotel is amazingly high rooms are comparatively larger than other nearby hotels the staffs are friendly In fact the staff quality is the highlight I ve been served by a gentleman who s name is L on his occupational quality is definitely 5 star level we had such a enjoyable stay
137226,H tel Mathis Elys es, Nothing , The hotel is centrally located easy to reach everywhere Leon is a perfect person at the reception He informed us on every way The rooms are very clean complete My son was very happy with the small gifts and the authentic elevator If I come to Paris again I will stay at the same hotel again Thanks for everything 
137227,H tel Mathis Elys es, Small elevator quite difficult to get in with big luggages Mirror is very important to all ladies but here too less and small mirrors , Best bed ever sleep so tight every night Location is good close to important tourist attractions Eiffel Champs elysee and Musee du Louvre and shopping center Helpful staffs with smile Safe place to stay Close to taxi stand and metro Franklin D Roosevelt I called hotel the day before I arrive to pick me up at the airport They sent a very polite and nice driver only 75 euro 3ppl with 3 Big luggages to pick up It s so convenience 
137228,H tel Mathis Elys es, We decided not to have the 18 breakfast upon looking at it There was a few cheese options rolled up ham and yogurt There is a fantastic bakery a block away for a better value The shower was terrible as we couldn t figure out how to turn on rainshower at one point I left it on as I couldn t turn it off The noise at night is very loud with the windows closed you can t hear a thing HOWEVER the room was stifling hot with no fan or AC When we asked how to cool room down in the morning we weren t given a solution or straight answer and we are fluent in French Also if you are facing the street do not open the bathroom window you will be greeted by a flurry of pigeons not to mention a very disturbing sight , The location was very close to Champs lys es and nice restaurants The gifts were a nice touch and the soft drinks were included The rooms were spacious clean and comfortable
137229,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, Bed linens and bed very comfortable Room s extremely clean Quiet Front desk was terrific with dinner reservations transportation arrangements and local suggestions Service was excellent Loved that elevator 
137230,H tel Mathis Elys es, External noise from bars and restaurants in street below Ok if you keep windows shut and use ac otherwise definitely a problem No parking on site despite it saying so on Booking com You have to use 3rd party parking at euro 35 40 for 24 hours Very small feel to the hotel almost as if you are entering an apartment block and not an hotel Very poor that restaurant was shut for dinner without prior notification and because the Telegraph had recommended it so highly It is tiny however and the food would have to be really good to make up for the lack of space Breakfast looked like a buffet a good b b would serve up Rather disappointing experience given rooms are average in terms of decor etc and nothing really exceeds your expectations and you hope for nothing going wrong , Booked this hotel on the strength of booking com reviews and for English customers more particularly on the strength of the overly gushing reviews in the Daily Telegraph travel article of the most romantic Paris hotels dated December 2016 DO not book here on the strength of that review as it is over sold First of all the hotel is in an excellent location just off the Champs Elysee It is in a narrow side street It has a nice frontage but very small foyer which can be a problem if several guests arrive at thew same time The feel is quite nice and the ambience relatively quirky particularly when you take the old lift Room were well appointed with good linens and furnishings Our room 43 had a very small balcony almost too small to actually use other than to step out on but added to the ambience of what was quite a small space Hard flooring did not lend itself to luxury Bathroom and separate toilet were ok but nothing special and the toilet would be too small for very large people The reception service and assistance was good as was the cocktail bar with extremely nice drinks Expensive though All in all a good stay in a hotel missing the mark as an altogether quirky boutique stay 
137231,H tel Mathis Elys es, The heating didn t work so it was cold at night The water didn t heat up enough so I had a lukewarm shower The room was an hour late in getting ready for us , Location was great convenient The room and hotel were pleasant
137232,H tel Mathis Elys es, Cleaning and restocking of the mini bar could have been slightly better we weren t provided with clean glasses the next day and drinks weren t fully replaced , Very friendly and helpful staff great location 
137233,H tel Mathis Elys es, I was expecting a much more biggger hotel Website totallly misleading on the size of the rooms and hotel The website is overpromising is not a bad hotel but misinterpreted , Location
137234,H tel Mathis Elys es, Lobby furniture left carpet and the layout of room, The furniture should be change as well as should open the restaurant area with lobby and serves coffee and deserts
137235,H tel Mathis Elys es, elevator waz very old and the key of the room must to leave it at Recepion, the bed waz very comfortable and helpful and friendly staff the location is most likely
137236,H tel Mathis Elys es, We had booked a gatden room but when we arrived we had been upgraded This upgrade meant our room was right above the nightclub The music was very loud which didn t stop until well after 3am Not a great nights sleep when you are up at 5am to get to the airport , The little welcome pack from sephora with facemask body cream etc was a nice touch especially after a long journey Day staff were very helpful Very cute hotel 
137237,H tel Mathis Elys es, Could have done with a kettle in room The staff said if only we told them they would have sorted it so couldn t be happier , Bed was lovely staff were the best Would highly recommend a beautiful French hotel 
137238,H tel Mathis Elys es, The restaurant was closed apparently for renovations but was open for breakfast The tiny lift didn t work to well coming down but was OK going up , Very close to the Champs Elysees which was what we wanted and lovely little cafes and restaurants nearby Staff were very friendly and most helpful especially when we had issues with the elevator A lovely traditional French hotel 
137239,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, A very nice charismatic small hotel The English and French of course speaking staff is tremendously friendly and helpful The rooms is nice and cosy The location is excellent 
137240,H tel Mathis Elys es, The free Wi Fi cannot access to the room low signal and sometimes off , Location Mathis near Avenue Montaigne and Franklin D Roosevelt Metro station Avenue Montaigne boasts numerous high fashion and accessories stores such as Chanel LV Celine Dior Gucci etc Lots of caf around the hotel so you can find food easily They open at 8am I like the antique elevator in the hotel 
137241,H tel Mathis Elys es, Watch out for the comically small rickety old lift at this hotel Got stuck in it when it broke down between floors No apology from staff Came back to my room after a few hours to find the combination on the lock of my suitcase had been tried which was very unnerving Rooms were poky and extremely hot even in December ,No Positive
137242,H tel Mathis Elys es, club below played loud music until 3am made it impossible to sleep when going out the staff take your key off you They gave our key incorrectly to other guests who were asleep when we returned so they had to let us back in our room so we had no key and staff member was rather rude about the problem, One staff member went out of his way to assist us as much as possible 
137243,H tel Mathis Elys es, Definitely NOT a quiet street Traffic right through the night Over weekend worse with a nightclub around the corner , Location perfect in respect of everything we wanted Just off the Champs Elysees Very near to Metro and Bus stop Very friendly and pleasant staff 
137244,H tel Mathis Elys es, I could hear people walking around in the room upstairs This went on for most of one of the nights causing me to lose a lot of sleep Unacceptable given the cost of the room ,No Positive
137245,H tel Mathis Elys es, the elavator is so small, the location is excellent and it s close to subway and easy to get anywhere and room is very clean and service is quite good
137246,H tel Mathis Elys es, The elevator was small like grave Its only 50cm wide My sister was not able to get access to her room on the fifth floor And the manager was rude and he didnt help us After we mad and come angry he offers us a room in first floor The Corridor leading to the rooms tightness lobby also very very small,No Positive
137247,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, Excellent location very friendly staff Complimentary room upgrade Bed was very comfortable and lots of little nice touches in the room such as sweets and free soft drinks from the mini bar Lovely cocktail bar also with very friendly staff Short walk to tourist attractions and metro Hard to fault this hotel and would love to return if we travel to Paris again 
137248,H tel Mathis Elys es, Nothing except perhaps a lounge to sit in as bar was shut in the day , Really friendly staff very clean and fantastically good location Really well equipped room for a small hotel 
137249,H tel Mathis Elys es, We didn t like the view from our room it was inside the building view so we didn t have the sun and view , the room was clean and modern style Nice location 1 minute from champs Elysee and avenue montagne next to the hotel there is a lot of places to eat 15 minutes walk and you are in louvre
137250,H tel Mathis Elys es, The payment condition on booking com was no deposit but they deducted the one night cost when I made a booking I asked them to check the situation and asked to pay back but They just answered it s strange and did not do anything ,No Positive
137251,H tel Mathis Elys es, No shower curtain , Comfortable rooms Polite and friendly staff I had accidentally booked twice and did not realise this until I arrived Nothing could be done about it so I payed two rooms instead of one but we were generously given a free breakfast 
137252,H tel Mathis Elys es, No storage for your stuff Couldn t unpack No place for toiletries Constantly having to put suitcases on bed to get stuff out , Really comfy bed and linens Wonderful staff Yan was gracious and helpful 
137253,H tel Mathis Elys es, They should think about people with food intolerancies I asked for fried eggs assuming it won t include dairy I received omletts with cheese , We ve been upgraded as our room wasn t ready I never been upgraded before it made me well happy The stuff was really nice and the room was beautiful and clean Locationwise it s awsome 
137254,H tel Mathis Elys es, Nothing , This is perfect very well run hotel in great location Very quiet despite being close to Champs Elysees The desk gentleman are exceedingly polite and willing to help in any possible way Highly recommended 
137255,H tel Mathis Elys es, No full body mirror in the hotel room The elevator is very small , Location is good can reach anywhere easily The staff is friendly and the room is clean and tidy Wifi is good too 
137256,H tel Mathis Elys es, There was nothing at all that we did not like , From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we felt comfortable and welcomed The staff could not have been more helpful The room was lovely spotlessly clean and the beds were really comfy The decor of the entrance and reception was the icing on the cake The location was just off the mid point of the Champs Elysee with cafes and restaurants to suit most pockets close by We would without a doubt go back given the chance 
137257,H tel Mathis Elys es, Even though it was a suite it was quite small and also there was no shower just a tub with a hand held shower head , The staff were very friendly and helpful
137258,H tel Mathis Elys es, No coffee tea facilities Breakfast room was dark and dreary needs renovating The lift was super small making it impossible to take your luggage up in one go 2 trips were needed , Close walk to Champs Elysees Staff were helpful and friendly 
137259,H tel Mathis Elys es, The toilet is sparate from the bathroom The lift is too small Noisy floor , Good location Freindly and helpful staff The room is spacious Drinks are refilled daily 
137260,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, Great hotel with friendly staff and an amazing bar We have stayed in the same room twice now and the one we had was decorated in great style Great location
137261,H tel Mathis Elys es, No complaints at all , Staff was super helpful with room directions tourist suggestions etc It was our first trip to Paris and the Hotel Mathis is centrally located to all the famous sites in the Champs Elysees area so we could walk almost everywhere Reasonable rate for high season We would definitely book there again 
137262,H tel Mathis Elys es, Breakfast should be included in the hotel rate as facilities are present on premises , Great service location Historical site Good Design environment Practical for Business travellers 
137263,H tel Mathis Elys es, The left was very tiny so we can not take my girl s buggy at the room I have met a rude stuff he was very nervous during the check in without any reason Also I have been charged twice before check in and after check out I wouldn t say it s bad but not really recommended , The location was very good
137264,H tel Mathis Elys es, There is absolutely nothing I didn t like , Excellent customer service very friendly staff acommodation very clean with great quality fit outs and toiletries and included all necessary amenities 
137265,H tel Mathis Elys es, Wash room difficult to take a shower without spreading water all over, Very good location nice service interesting elevator BTW all soft drinks in mini bar are free 
137266,H tel Mathis Elys es, Breakfast was expensive so we chose not to include it and we were not told about the restaraunt or bar facilities , Beautiful room with excellent facilities Lovely small touches like free sweets and soft drinks Brilliant location very close to the champs elysees 
137267,H tel Mathis Elys es, The rooms are too small you can hear everything going outside the rooms and the lift is too small its capacity is 2 ppl only, The location is near the Champs elysees The staff is friendly and helpfull
137268,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, OMG the elevator is amazing So Quintessential Parisian It is a beautiful Boutique hotel with newly fitted out rooms Richard Mille shop on the top of the same street screams elite Staff are friendly and helpful There is no dinning area or bar in the hotel but plenty of options on offer on he streets nearby Don t expect tea or coffee facility inside the room which is on the small side 
137269,H tel Mathis Elys es, Shower fixtures were falling off the wall and bathroom light fixture was broken Hall light was out on our floor and while the room was spotless the hall carpet was old and dirty No kettle or coffee pot in the room and the safe in the room was so old the numbers were wearing off Delphine was the front desk clerk and spoke perfect English and was immeasurable helpful And the little elevator was beautiful and tres Parisian We were in room 42 with a charming balcony ,No Positive
137270,H tel Mathis Elys es, Breakfast at least in August you better take outside no buffet this time of the year obviously so 20 for a some eggs and jam with only bread and croissant and no fresh orange juice and fruit from the can is just too much Breakfast room is depressing without proper lighting and no light from outside Bathroom has no shelfs or cupboard Receptionist was more busy for a few minutes to discuss a credit card transaction rather than paying attention to the just arrived guest , Room spacious as per Paris standard not the usual sardines can 
137271,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, The staff were super friendly and the location is fantastic Lots of hanging space in the room iron and board and spacious bathroom too Unbeatable value for money definitely a find 
137272,H tel Mathis Elys es, The internet connection wifi, Perfect location very good service and wonderful staff when I ll come back to Paris i will stay again in this hotel for sure 
137273,H tel Mathis Elys es, The room was clean but scruffy one of the lights from the shower was hanging off the ceiling The rooms could do with a tidy up It was expensive for what it was but not unusual in Paris , The staff in reception were very helpful Location 
137274,H tel Mathis Elys es, No mirror to do make up in and would ve liked a robe to go with the comfy slippers provided , Great location with very comfy beds We had an excellent room with a balcony The staff were very helpful and friendly 
137275,H tel Mathis Elys es, Hard to find parking in this area Or you should parking your car underground around 30 40 euro Per night near the hotel elevator is just for 2 very small, Location
137276,H tel Mathis Elys es, All great , Great location fabulously helpful and very attentive management and staff Nothing was too much trouble As I was waiting for my transport to arrive I was treated to the best coffee that I had had in Paris by our wonderful concierge Would not hesitate to recommend The Mathis and look forward to returning for another visit Thankyou 
137277,H tel Mathis Elys es, what other people said the elevator is really really small but I don t think there is anything that could be changed as this is an older building , Everything management was great Bed was comfortable everything was wonderful
137278,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, Great location nearest to Champs Elisees with bakery and good cafe at the corner Very helpful personal Room was great with bath and enough living space that is not standard for hotels at this part of a town 
137279,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, The staff is extremely careful always smiling and ready to help I love the decoration of the hotel and the room Breakfast is simple but very good
137280,H tel Mathis Elys es, The hotel elevator was so small I could barely fit myself and my one piece of luggage a carry on roller bag However this is to be expected in an older building Just be aware if you have more than one piece of luggage and ask the staff to help you , This was a lovely little hotel off the Champs Elysee in a historic building This is not my favorite part of Paris as it s very touristy But if you want to be centrally located this hotel is a good value The room was a decent size for 1 2 people most older Paris hotels have tiny rooms nicely decorated and with a modern bathroom The hotel was walking distance to our Paris offices and the metro The staff spoke good English tolerated my broken French and were cheerful and helpful I would stay there again on my next business trip 
137281,H tel Mathis Elys es, After a staff change I almost had to check in a second time upon my return Did my colleague copy your passport Did you sign the entry etc When I came home at night after midnight there was a bouncer like figure who didn t want to let me enter The elevator was tiny small and scary charming until it started stalling every 10 cm and we couldn t get out before taking the stairs , For us the location at the end of the Champs Elyses was perfect Small rooms but quiet with comfortable bed 
137282,H tel Mathis Elys es, The four star rating claimed is deception Not even two star Horrible shower Dingy facilities The elevator barely holds two The rate is exorbitant We travelled two weeks in Europe and this was the worst facility at premium price , Location Friendly enough staff 
137283,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, The staff and service were absolutely fabulous we felt extremely welcomed Great location comfortable and spacious room given Parisian standards will certainly book again 
137284,H tel Mathis Elys es, Our unit was right above the night club the staff were very apologetic but I would have liked them to place a family in a quieter part of the hotel , Fantastic locations and staff were very kind to my kid Adorable single bed for child Gave us a free breakfast when we told them about the noise 
137285,H tel Mathis Elys es, I thought 20 euros each for breakfast was expensive especially for what you got although the yoghurt butter and tea bags were a quality item but 20 a couple would have been a more realistic price , The location was perfect for all the major Paris attractions The staff were very friendly and always helpful 
137286,H tel Mathis Elys es, Even though we got early check in it would be nice if check in was earlier , The beds were super comfy and we had a lot of space Also the staff are super friendly and chatty Which makes you feel more welcome 
137287,H tel Mathis Elys es, No drawers in the junior suite just limited closet space for hanging clothes No long mirror Would have preferred a shower installation The appliance with the bath was fine for us after getting used to it but might cause some guests difficulties An optional continental breakfast option might be an idea as the 20 price is reasonable for a full breakfast by Paris standards but a lot for less , Friendliness of staff complementary extras like slippers dressing gowns decor But especially the staff who were exceptional And the location of course which is perfect The breakfast was full with eggs prepared to order 
137288,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, Excellent location wonderful staff nothing was ever too much trouble for them Perfect stay in Paris for our honeymoon thank you to all at Hotel Mathis 
137289,H tel Mathis Elys es, There were two little things I didn t like about this hotel First the room keys are very large which forces you to leave them behind at reception I didn t like that Second the elevator was very very small which did not accommodate my large luggage , The location of the hotel is great I also liked the look and feel of my room It was small but very comfortable and stylish I liked that the toilet and the bath were separate The staff was very friendly and helpful when I requested anything 
137290,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, Not only does this hotel convince with a great location and beautiful cozy rooms but the staff is unimaginably helpful with all kind of requests We had an amazing stay and will definitely stay there again in the future In comparison with other hotels and restaurants we ve visited in Paris we always found the personnel of hotel mathis to be the politest and most caring 
137291,H tel Mathis Elys es,No Negative, The room was very clean and the beds very comfortable The staff were so friendly welcoming and helpful I felt nothing would be too much trouble for them It felt relaxing and welcoming I loved the 1930s feel of the place with the tiny lift and spiral stairs and other features that were typical of the period Located just off the Champs Elleyse it was a perfect base from which to explore Paris 
137292,H tel Mathis Elys es, Noisy party held in the downstairs lounge on the first night of our stay , Clean spacious room good quality breakfast available staff were friendly and willing to assist 
137293,H tel Mathis Elys es, Room 21 bad problem of pigeon fouling in the courtyard as you open window Would not want to stay there in the summer as it smells and detracts from the otherwise charming little hotel , Small friendly hotel excellently located close to the Champs Elysee 
137294,H tel Mathis Elys es, the air conditioning in the room did not really work making it very hot overnight, very nice complementary bathing products location is super friendly staff
