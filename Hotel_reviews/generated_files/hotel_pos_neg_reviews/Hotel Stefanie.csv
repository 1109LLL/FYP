464409,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, This property has preserved all of the amenities that hotels used to provide as a matter of course The staff is lovely the breakfasts are beautifully presented I was only here two nights but I enjoyed my stay even though I was staying in a single room whilst meeting up with my parents in Austria Old school glamour is how I would summarize my stay I am tired of Design Hotels and suspect that others are as well 
464410,Hotel Stefanie, I have no complaints , We were given a high room with a balcony onto the street The room was comfortable and full of light Breakfasts were delicious and there was a wide assortment of food to choose from Dinner at the hotel in the garden was an added bonus extremely pleasant The front desk staff was always smiling helpful charming and willing to provide assistance and answer queries Good location just across the bridge from the beginning of the old city Near the underground station and to a very useful tramway stop

464416,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, The hotel has a sense of style not usually found in hotel chains e g antiques on display in public rooms Good location for public transport most main tourist sites within walking distance Friendly and informative staff Superior rooms were of a good size with a large comfortable bed plus small balcony We would be very happy to stay at the Stephanie should we return to Vienna 
464417,Hotel Stefanie, We needed to use their computer to reserve and print tickets The location of the computer did not offer any privacy as it was in the reception area and it was against a window with sunlight coming in and it was difficult to see the screen Otherwise one of the staff helped us as we were having some difficulty , The location was good pretty close to the tram which we took pretty often We had executive rooms which were spacious enough room and bathroom were very clean The breakfast room was delightful the staff attentive and the breakfast selections very numerous and varied with good presentation Staff at reception desk was professional and helpful We also had occasion one night to have a drink and appetizers at the bar The service and attention were very good This is a good hotel with good location service and we loved the breakfast experience each morning

464419,Hotel Stefanie, I liked it all , The hotel is very lovely and is as advertised The staff is very friendly and accommodating The room was spacious and comfortable The breakfast buffet was superb In addition the bar was a nice respite after a long day of touring 
464420,Hotel Stefanie, All good, The location of the hotel is ideal to explore Vienna Staff are professional and helpful Breakfast sets you up for the day Not a usual modern hotel and that adds a little character to your stay 
464421,Hotel Stefanie, very long walk to bedroom as it was nearly the last room down a very very long corridor nice buffet breakfast plenty to choose from but horrible orange juice not freshly squeezed waiting staff bring coffee to the table but not tea, the bed was very comfortable large choice at breakfast different types of milk provided without having to ask eg soya and lactose free milk very good air conditioning as Vienna was boiling hot this visit
464422,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, This is an excellent hotel in every way Staff are very helpful and friendly What a spread you get at breakfast the best we have ever seen Room and bathroom spotless Hotel is not far from SchwedenPlatz underground and is perfect for exploring this beautiful historic city 
464423,Hotel Stefanie, The courtyard is delightful but is spoilt by smokers We wanted to be able to relax there and have a drink but the space was usually occupied by smokers They also smoked during breakfast We could have sat inside but non smokers should be able to enjoy the outside spaces free from smoke fumes , Our room was very quiet and comfortable Staff were helpful Housekeeping staff were excellent 
464424,Hotel Stefanie, While the staff was helpful it would have been even better if they took more time to explain where things were Being a visitor it is not always obvious where things were located and most names were new to me Otherwise everything worked very well at this hotel , The location is very convenient It is near the U subway network and tram lines for easy access to museums historic places airport etc The breakfast is generous and the staff courteous and helpful There s a grocery store Billa just a few doors down and many restaurants and bakeries within walking distance 
464425,Hotel Stefanie, we booked for 3 nights needed to leave on the second but was advised that this was a 3 night stay minimum surprised as we thought we could change the booking till a few days prior to arrival as it goes we had other family members staying at the hotel so we left the room for them still cost us an extra night rooms were small my mother s room was really tiny , good breakfast helpful concierge
464426,Hotel Stefanie, Liked everything, Loved the breakfast so much to choose from including bubbly and lovely courtyard setting Service was charming and helpful Recommend highly 
464427,Hotel Stefanie, The internet slowed down very considerably in the evening probably because of the number of people using it , The breakfast buffet was quite good with both the hot foods you d find in an English breakfast eggs grilled tomatoes sausage and bacon and the cold foods you d find in a Continental breakfast a good selection of breads croissants cheeses cold cuts jams as well as muesli and yoghurt There was also a good selection of drinks with breakfast coffee and an assortment of teas and juice The staff was also friendly and willing to help out e g airline check in booking a taxi 
464428,Hotel Stefanie, All was fine for our stay , Very comfortable beds and decor charming We so looked forward to our excellent breakfast the best The staff was very friendly and helpful We had a late 2am evening one night and staff was quickly there to let us in Breakfast to go too for our 4 30 am departure to airport We loved our stay

464430,Hotel Stefanie, Have stayed here four times for more than five days each time so we think it s perfect, We love to walk and it was conveniently located within walking into city to St Peter s K rntner Graben shopping and Opera Also close enough to U Bahn transportation for non walkers
464431,Hotel Stefanie, Not many places to eat near the hotel a few I tried nearby allowed smoking so you have to go to old city , Beautiful old hotel helpful friendly staff comfortable room fabulous breakfast provided tea coffee facilities in the room good wifi and computer and printer in the lobby helpful 
464432,Hotel Stefanie, Not many restaurants around the hotel but food in the hotel was excellent good value for money, Hotel staff were friendly made us feel very welcome Hotel is in peaceful location within easy walking distance of the centre Breakfasts were fantastic
464433,Hotel Stefanie, We went with friends and I made the booking for us all All the rooms were double with courtyard view Unfortunately there really is no view of the cour yard Our bathroom was tiny hardly enough room for two people I would recommend single occupancy for room 303 , Lovely city hotel in a great location friendly staff would definitely stay here again 
464434,Hotel Stefanie, Nothing , The location was Amazing few minutes walking to the City Center Near to everything The staff were super super Kind helpful with smiley faces all the time The Hotel is A Historical Hotel refer to 1600 I was extremely surprised existed and Proud to stay in such Hotel 
464435,Hotel Stefanie, Everything was great No complaints at all , A beautiful elegant hotel Well appointed Wonderful staff very helpful Great breakfast buffet Very clean 
464436,Hotel Stefanie, My wife missed the choice other hotels often offer of shampoo and toiletries We had a simple squeezy soap dispenser I would describe the room we had as adequate not large but then we were late booking so missed any choices The morning scrambled and boiled eggs with the cooked breakfast were excellent but an omelet or fried egg choice would have improved the offering The rest of the buffet was choice , Very restful hotel no extraneous noise Just outside the tourist area with a short simple walk into that Access to metro was convenient and easy to use also very cheap and can be used to visit the more remote sites quickly Others who used the bus facility were sometimes held up in traffic Areas were always clean and staff very helpful There were never any noisy nights or early morning door bangs or plumbing noises 
464437,Hotel Stefanie, Despite having confirmed directly with the hotel that I would have a room in a quiet location I was assigned a room on the main road I had return to reception and argue with the man who checked me in who used the tired old excuse the hotel is full If I had not stood my ground and refused to be dismissed I would have been stuck in a much noiser room at the front It was a disappointing start to my stay There are few places to eat nearby so you have to go across the bridge to the centre The hotel only suggested very touristy places in the centre Staff were more responsive to couples and groups than to a single traveller and also to those who spoke German , Beautiful old style hotel individual feel rather than a corporate chain Great sense of history and some beautiful objects on display in the public rooms Fantastic breakfast Quieter location than the old part of the city across the bridge If you ask for it they provide tea and coffee making facilities Quiet in the room until the last two nights when there was a guest next door who had the television very loud all night unfortunately the hotel did not deal with the problem despite repeated requests

464441,Hotel Stefanie, Body soap and shampoo in our room were not as good as we expected We stayed for four nights with same breakfast menu , Staff were friendly courteous and helpful Breakfast was nice Room was very clean Bed sheets were comfortable We are very impressive of Mr Cristian Schafferer of front desk He is warm kind helpful knowledgeable informative and professional He is able to answer any questions about Vienna up to your full satisfaction Breakfast menu offers many choices warm and cold Great coffee It would take about ten minutes to walk to old part of town in easy pace 
464442,Hotel Stefanie, Never let them book you a street side first floor room e g 109 The concrete slabs between the tram rails make a lot of noise when a car passes over them Makes it impossible to sleep throughout the night On the other hand I am sure they would have changed our room if we complained about it the second day , Excellent location kind and helpful front desk people nice clean room 
464443,Hotel Stefanie, The bedroom was VERY basic and unwelcoming In serious need of total revamp Toiletries non existent with the exception of a one product cleans all attached to the bathroom wall I expected more creature comforts from a 4 establishment , The breakfast was excellent and varied truly catered for everyone Staff helpful and courteous
464444,Hotel Stefanie, Would have preferred semi skimmed milk with tea , Friendly staff and an excellent choice at breakfast Clean and comfortable room Restaurant food excellent Tea Coffee tray in room on request at no extra charge 
464445,Hotel Stefanie, Choice of food in restaurant could be more of a general continental nature with a larger selection of dishes That said food on menu was excellent despite a limited selection of dishes , Location was very good for exploring the city The open top bus stop is about 200 m away All staff are helpful and reception staff in particular very helpful on advice to help with your visit Breakfast was excellent with a good choice available with something to suit all guests 
464446,Hotel Stefanie, Nothing to complain about , Room was comfortable and large with settee and chairs Located on second floor overlooking Main Street including trams but not too noisy 
464447,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Lovely staff very comfortable good sized room and great breakfast A little outside the main tourist area but this meant nice local restaurants and bars 
464448,Hotel Stefanie, The room is quite small , The hotel is with long history starting biz in 1600 The receptionists are very friendly and enthusiastic The room is a bit small but the bathroom is very large The hotel is not in the core old city but 10 15 mins walk can take you to St Stephen cathedral Near to the underground easy to go to the main train station The breakfast is very good 
464449,Hotel Stefanie, Missing small luxury items like hand cream Very late to freshen up the room One day we said don t bother as it was already after 3pm Key has to be returned to the reception desk each time you go out which is probably just as well as it is huge and weighs a lot , Hotel is in a good location with a hop on hop off bus stop nearby Easy walking distance into central Vienna Well stocked supermarket nearby 
464450,Hotel Stefanie, Some of the younger gentlemen of the staff is a bit too condescending towards their customers , The beauty of it its old school charm and style Very good breakfast

464458,Hotel Stefanie, Buffet breakfast was extensive but quality and taste was average scrambled eggs not fresh croissants average etc Staff very pleasant but information provided on restaurants and travel wrong every time , Room a good size and bed comfy 
464459,Hotel Stefanie, Church bells next door were very loud although at least not too early in the morning One morning there was no hot water in the shower although that was after a fire alarm so hopefully just a one off incident , Easy walk to the main sights comfy bed good sized room nice shower helpful staff nice breakfast
464460,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Room size was excellent great valve for the price Near to river and 5 min walk into the centre Tourist bus stop 2 min walk Breakfast was worth every penny A couple of friendly bars opposite to have a night cap drink on way back to hotel 
464461,Hotel Stefanie, Whilst out of your control the church clock bells next door starting at 6am meant an unwelcome start to the day , The hotel has a beautiful ambience It is extremely clean and well cared for Staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast was wonderful 
464462,Hotel Stefanie, the fan in the bathroom was a bit noisy it was too hot even regulating the set point to minimum and i kept the window open i was in comfort thank to the window but i wasted energy this makes me uneasy , the breakfast was superb the staff is very kind and professional

464464,Hotel Stefanie, I Should have requested a room with a bath , The staff were friendly and efficient The room was good with a very comfortable bed and spacious well appointed bathroom The breakfast was delicious with everything you could possibly want including Buck s Fizz Stay here you won t regret it 
464465,Hotel Stefanie, The hotel is very traditional which was fine but it meant my room felt rather masculine and old fashioned The bathroom had every thing required but the layout could have been improved , The hotel was very easy to reach from the airport bus stop close to two underground stations It was also an easy walk into the centre Hotel staff were all excellent as was the buffet breakfast My room had good lighting a safe box minibar coffee facilities were provided on request 
464466,Hotel Stefanie, NOTHING, NICE AND WARMTH STAFF HELP US A LOT IN VINEA ESPECIALLY THE GENTLEMEN IN THE RECEPTION GIVE US SOME IDEA IN VINEA AND LOCATION IS JUST NEAY BY THE METRO EVERYTHING IS GOOD 
464467,Hotel Stefanie, The breakfast got a little monotonous but the food was still very good , The staff was very helpful and the food in the restaurant was delicious The location is perfect close to Schwedenplatz U Bahn and not a far walk to Prater 
464468,Hotel Stefanie, Wasn t impressed when we were sat in the lounge on Sunday evening and my husband ordered from the bar and was given a tray to carry it all himself Hotel heating too high , Great choice at breakfast Very comfortable bed Great room but didn t like overlooking the garages Staff very pleasant and especially the waiter who helped us with food and wine choice on the evening of Friday 17th Food and wine excellent Lovely surroundings and impressive antiques Good location for city centre 
464469,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, As a tourist the hotel s location was a short distance to the stops for tram tourist buses underground and airport express coach After a short walk and over the Danube Canal you were in the heart of the city s sites Our room was quiet and the reception staff gave helpful advice to us first timers 
464470,Hotel Stefanie, Nothing could have been better , The hotel was lovely and spotless great choice at breakfast and fab location friendly staff and a great very warm room 
464471,Hotel Stefanie, Service was impeccable a bigger room would have been nice however not always possible in an older centrally located hotel , Bar staff friendly all staff pleasant and helpful Great breakfast my friends enjoyed the champagne as well 
464472,Hotel Stefanie, I couldn t operate the soap dispenser in the bathroom, Staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly breakfast really good fascinating objects in hotel It felt personal charming welcoming
464473,Hotel Stefanie, The bathroom was a little on the smelly side , The staff were really pleasant and attentive beds were comfortable and it was in a great location I would definitely go back again 
464474,Hotel Stefanie, We paid 255 Euro night for Superior Double room incl breakfast for 2 ppl even though it is high category room hence the price we believe we didn t get value for money i e the room was regular size overlooking the inner courtyard two beds connected together nothing special so we believe such room should be priced lower Few problems in the room you could hear loud music into the night until 1am coming from club adjacent to the hotel we slept with open window since room was hot for each of the 3 nights we stayed over weekend very annoying pillows were very uncomfortable we got new pillows after we asked no kettle for tea coffee although we saw in other rooms we got after we asked no body lotion in the bath we believe is basic for such hotel and room category we got after we asked but were told it is exceptional , Elegant hotel stood up for its reputation for the oldest hotel in Vienna but well kept didn t feel old or rotten Breakfast very rich buffet big variety much more then the usual European breakfast Location not in the center of the touristic area but 10 minutes walking distance which was good enough for us we like to walk 
464475,Hotel Stefanie, Front desk guy was snippy though would occasionally warm up , Rooms were awesome and well appointed Very clean nicely furnished Breakfast and the restaurant staff were super The food at the restaurant was incredible 
464476,Hotel Stefanie, The bed mattress was OK ish but not top quality , A big well furnished bedroom and bathroom and a bath in the bathroom much better than just a shower 
464477,Hotel Stefanie, Probably a good espresso would be the cherry on top for breakfast , Excellent breakfast very clean despite fitted carpet on the ground and very good position 
464478,Hotel Stefanie, The room temperature was a bit hard to control so it got a bit warm in the night, Staff very friendly Good location just outside the centre so within walking distance to main attractions
464479,Hotel Stefanie, I could not fault a thing It was exceptional , Staff were friendly and efficient Very helpful indeed Very clean and well kept Good variety of food which was amazing Good location We are rebooking and going back 
464480,Hotel Stefanie, Well here goes The room was so uncomfortably hot and we stayed in feb so it was winter It was a sauna therefore felt i was sleeping in 40 degree heat We did not turn off the air conditioning after day 1 and still unconfortably hot for a winter stay Then they have these green soap dispensers in the shower and by the basin Empty and no soap cakes No little shampoo or conditioner either Hubby and i raided the cleaners trolley in the morning after day 2 realising this was intentional and not a mistake , Staff were lovely and hospitable Loved the baggage guy with his impressive mo
464481,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, All and if like us you prefer staying at the hotel in the evening the restaurant is good with a large choice of Austrian specialities We stayed three evenings 
464482,Hotel Stefanie, Can t fault it, The place oozed class and sophistication we were treated like royalty getting upgraded the ambience the furniture the breakfast the staff 
464483,Hotel Stefanie, It s the oldest hotel in Vienna so expect all the great but also the not so nice things it brings So there are a few issues that one could expect in an old hotel some parts of the hotel had a not so nice smell and the doors have classic keys so you must remember to lock the door when leaving the room Also some furniture parts look a bit worn , The staff was excellent very polite and helpful The hotel decorations are great and things like having a library or the big breakfast room are impressive The breakfast was very good with a wide range of choices The room was clean and quite spacious The location is perfect nice area of the city and many public transport connections nearby

464488,Hotel Stefanie, Lack of provision of tea making facility in bedroom in fairness we could have requested it after our arrival , Great selection of breakfast menus All hotel staff were courteous friendly polite and helpful Very clean Hotel within 10 minutes walking distance of St Stephen s Cathedral Square The Hop on Hop off buses stopped 100m outside hotel 
464489,Hotel Stefanie, Splitting hairs a little but it was very difficult to get the temperature just right in the room , The place has a great old style posh Vienna It s almost like stepping back in time The hotel is decorated beautifully and looks just great It s also extremely comfortable and the breakfast was excellent 
464490,Hotel Stefanie, Nothing everything was great , All of the staff were helpful and polite my room was very clean generously proportioned comfortable Breakfast was delicious I am very pleased that I chose to stay at Hotel Stefanie very good value for money easy to travel around Vienna from this location on the excellent U bahn service 
464491,Hotel Stefanie, Need a bit more meat and cheese variety on breakfast The hotel s bar has no dedicated operator what made us wait for more than 10 minutes before we went to the bar outside , The hotel was very cozy staff was extraordinary pleasant and friendly helped when needed patient attraction promoters and good advises The location is excellent for those who looking for a bit of silence during the evening and night but although close enough to the U Bahn which will take you everywhere in the city just 200 meters away The breakfast lack some variety from the main meal but the things offered was enough and tasty lots of bread variety lots of dessert variety There is a little and cozy bar just in front of the hotel bank stores pharmacies tobacco and liquor stores at a walking distance It s just like living in the middle of a tourist area but without the noise and crowdedness 
464492,Hotel Stefanie, Me and my friend are vegans so we couldn t really enjoy the breakfast So my only negative would be that they could have some vegan options on the menus , Beautiful hotel and the staff could not do enough for us Perfect location to explore Vienna 
464493,Hotel Stefanie, The elevator is obviously a bottle neck of this hotel , I like the atmosphere and the flair around this hotel Staff super pleasant and at hand Fantastic breakfast 
464494,Hotel Stefanie, Disappointed that the rooms were like any standard chain hotel Website gave the impression they were more unique No toiletries just generic wash , Very nice staff 
464495,Hotel Stefanie, Nothing to complain about and I am usually a very picky client , Breakfast was great and the room was spotless It was a cold day and I really wanted some tea but there was no kettle in the room We called the reception and asked if we could have one and it was provided right away with complementary tea and coffee 
464496,Hotel Stefanie, They had a problem with climate in the first room and I had to move in another which was too hot , This is one of the best hotel ever I stay almost 30 years 
464497,Hotel Stefanie, The only thing that I didn t love and this is such a minor detail was that we only had one key that had to be turned in to the front desk whenever we left the hotel , This was a wonderful hotel with impeccable service The staff at the front desk restaurant and bar were all exceedingly polite and helpful The included breakfast was a nice affair consisting of warm breakfast items as well as a selection of breads meats and cheeses Overall this stay was a highlight of our trip 
464498,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, We were made very welcome the staff were very helpful It was very easy to site see from the hotel s location We would thoroughly recommend the hotel

464500,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Great hotel full of charm in a good location in Vienna Staff were very friendly and helpful and made sure I had a good time Your every need was catered for The breakfast was luxurious 
464501,Hotel Stefanie, All good no complaints , Staff were extremely friendly and helpful The breakfast was excellent with lots of hot and cold choice and good quality ingredients A tea coffee tray is provided in your room if you request it There was a very small problem with the bathroom radiator which they fixed as quickly as possible with no distress or hassle to us The hotel then provided us with complimentary chocolates and wine and deducted some money from our bill without request Cannot fault them The room was a very good size with comfortable beds The bathroom was also very nicely done with a walk in shower The hotel is a short walk from the main shopping area but this really was negligible and it was snowing when we were there They also recommended an excellent restaurant nearby serving local food at very reasonable prices I and my family would definitely stay here again 
464502,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Fantastic hotel within walking distance of all downtown sites Extremely nice vintage Austrian hotel wonderful Breakfast and champagne were superb Be sure to include this in your stay well worth it Side note bring body lotion It s probably the only thing that the hotel doesn t give you Everything was amazing thanks 
464503,Hotel Stefanie, The bedroom had a slight musty smell , Very clean hotel Our bedroom was comfortable and glad we had a bath as well Staff in the reception and breakfast room were very polite and helpful 
464504,Hotel Stefanie, The carpets in the rooms should be removed because it is not hygienic It is the oldest hotel in Vienna but still some things should change when it comes to hygiene Also better maintenance is required especially in the bathrooms ex broken tiles radiators not in great shape etc , Good WiFi good breakfast good cleanliness and good beds
464505,Hotel Stefanie, A double bed rather than two singles together and better toileteries , Breakfasts were amazing So much choice and champagne Wonderful staff and good room service 
464506,Hotel Stefanie, old building breakfast could be better need an upgrade on overall furniture and door room locks, good location good restaurant for lunch very good service and very clean perfect for a long weekend good value for money
464507,Hotel Stefanie, Really there was nothing I didn t like , I really liked this hotel and would come back with my family I liked the room food options It felt quite luxurious for a reasonable amount of money thanks to Booking com The Concierge was extremely helpful 
464508,Hotel Stefanie, Lack of tea making facility in the room One miserable rude man serving in the bar , Location breakfast dinner helpful staff except for one the room value for money 
464509,Hotel Stefanie, 5min walk from closest metro station to the hotel But not very close to city center to Stephan s cathedral it needs 10 15min walk , Excellent Breakfast
464510,Hotel Stefanie, The parking lot was very cramped and so it was very difficult to park my SUV and still be able to get into or out of it I recommend not driving in Vienna as the punlic transport is excellent and parking in the city is almost impossible , The breakfast was excellent especially the coffee and the servers were cheerful and efficient 
464511,Hotel Stefanie, Our room was classed as a Courtyard view although the room looked over the courtyard it really was not a view , The hotel and staff were very friendly and efficient the location was perfect A very easy walk into the city The room was very comfortable and warm with an extremely comfy bed and pillows beautiful bathroom with huge shower we also had English language tv stations The restaurant buffet breakfast was incredibly good and we ate our main meal in the restaurant most days the bar was a little small and the snack menu could have had more choice overall we had a very enjoyable Christmas at the Stefanie The hotel also gave us gifts of Christmas cookies candy canes and roses 
464512,Hotel Stefanie, The only concern is tram noise if your room located to the street side of the building but it was not strong annoying factor , Hotel interiors are like museum consists by excellent furniture and clocks and so on from Barocco times Excellent feelings of presence in that times was builded Very clean and the location is over expectations 
464513,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Lovely friendly staff great room we had room 389 superior double really quiet lovely and spacious comfy beds and lovely bathroom Really good breakfasts in a fabulous dining room We enjoyed our whole stay in our first visit to Vienna
464514,Hotel Stefanie, The bed was very uncomfortable We traveled as a couple and we had two twin beds pushed together and two separate twin duvets The staff were also extremely rude and didn t help with any suggestions of the city Also the maids did not clean the bathroom properly They didn t clean the toilet replenish the toilet paper or replenish the tissue box I was actually pretty appalled that it had a 4 star rating as service was 2 star The location was also 20 min walk from center which in the winter feels like a lot , Breakfast was good

464532,Hotel Stefanie, We booked a room months in advance and specified that we wanted two twin beds When we arrived they said they had no rooms with twin beds available at this stage it was too late for us to change hotels Eventually we were given a single room with an uncomfortably small sofa bed To be fair we were given a small discount when we complained at check out The bottom line however is that we did not get the room we booked and the bed issue is hardly a minor detail They could have at least mailed us in advance so we could have booked another hotel , This is a nice hotel in a convenient location Breakfast is also good

464632,Hotel Stefanie, A bit noisy on the outside and courtyard view was not really pleasing The directions from the metro were not accurate , Staff extremely helpful and attentive The breakfast was nice but not too expansive or much variety for Americans Quite close to shopping and sights 
464633,Hotel Stefanie, The breakfast restaurant had too small capacity which lead to waiting times for several guests , The hotel provided a high class experience and a very pleasant staff 
464634,Hotel Stefanie, Single room a bit small , The staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel was lovely and comfortable I had stayed here before about 5 6 years ago and as I enjoyed it then I wanted to stay there again location great 
464635,Hotel Stefanie, the reception staff were not very cooperative especially concerning questions about the website booking we were told that we should read the website carefully first before asking , the breakfast organization and the tall chief waiter was very kind to help with the breakfast and put us at a clean table while the other staff put us at a dirty used table he was always trying to clean the other staff mistakes 
464636,Hotel Stefanie, Hotel is quite old renovation is needed in the corridors, Nice cozy hotel good breakfast and sweets as compliments in the room made our stay very comfortable
464637,Hotel Stefanie, Air con didn t seem to have much effect room was quite small, Really helpful and friendly staff Lovely breakfast Good location within walking distance of city centre
464638,Hotel Stefanie, NOTHING All was just perfect for me , I love old traditional hotels in all countries Close to town center but NOT in town center and therefore more quiet Great breakfast and lunch typical viennois charming and perfect to feel calm in mind in soul and heart 
464639,Hotel Stefanie, Bedroom rather small dull , Helpful knowledgeable staff Hotel very convenient for hop on hop off buses Interesting decor antiques in public areas 
464640,Hotel Stefanie, When we made other reservation we were off by one day and within minuets I realized what I did an tried to fix it but the hotel would not move our reservation up one day and insisted that we pay an additional day and loose our first day Not Cool at all I called 3x We just moved to another hotel instead of giving them another night , Nice breakfast
464641,Hotel Stefanie, Constant queues for breakfast BE CAREFUL before trip they charged us 125 deposit charged and not blocked as receptionist puts it and at the end of trip charged the whole trip They confirmed to me the charged blocked money would be re transfered to my account never happened so far Had to call several times practically begged for it until one month afterwards this very arrogant receptionist told me it would be done without even excusing herself the hotel Very rude call I had with her this week Won t come back Still waiting for my deposit money by the way , Just one bridge away from city centre Good breakfast
464642,Hotel Stefanie, The only negative was the heat The controls on the wall do nothing and are not connected and there was a hidden radiator behind the headboard of the bed below the window causing a far too hot room Opening the window helped but it was only when I worked out how to turn the radiator off lift out the metal grill on the window ledge reach inside and find a knob to turn wash hands as it is absolutely filthy and dusty in there , I stayed here for 4 nights in room 320 The hotel is impressive upon entering with immaculately attired staff This is a fine example for every hotel The room itself was spotless and comfortable enough The minibar has an extensive range of drinks The bed is comfortable and the bathroom good 
464643,Hotel Stefanie, The air conditioning in the rooms didn t work The nights were a bit humid It wasn t bad enough to make me complain I simply slept nude to compensate Vienna weather was a bit cold so I didn t mind Although I like being cold in hotel rooms This was my main issue but it didn t affect my stay too much , Everything apart from the room air conditioning Staff were helpful with a very good level of English They would often suggest things to make your life easier e g Offering umbrellas when it was raining outside Staff were not overbearing but they were happy to help 
464644,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, I would rate this hotel 10 10 in terms of location cleanliness buffet breakfast and last but not least the staff I can t fault it in any way and being a solo traveler I never for once felt lonely or unwelcome 
464645,Hotel Stefanie, Location could have been a little bit better but this is very nit picking It was a couple of 100m to the nearest u bahn hub , Breakfast was very good and dinner even better not included Staff was excellent and the hotel had that historic Vienna feeling in the best possible way There is no doubt that this is where we ll stay again if we visit Vienna another time 
464646,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, We liked the breakfast very much Varied but not too extravaganced The staff were very polite caretaking and also very keen to answer all our questions
464647,Hotel Stefanie, Absolutely nothing , Cosy ambience great breakfast friendly and receptive staff Resturant also recommended Ideally located and overall excellent value from a quality hotel 
464648,Hotel Stefanie, Got a room at the very end of a long corridor the wifi was working only in certain corners of the room You can hear the guests in the other rooms talking Cold reception staff in certain shifts , Very clean very good breakfast
464649,Hotel Stefanie, The room could be a little bit bigger but it was not too small either Rooms require a bit more soundproofing Breakfast was of good quality but could have a couple of more treats, Very clean Good location Comfortable beds We liked the ambience Tasty breakfast also included proseco 
464650,Hotel Stefanie, We paid a little extra for the courtyard view but wasn t as pretty as the pictures May be because of the time of year , Breakfast was delicious even included champagne The bedroom was one of the best I have stayed in very comfy bed 
464651,Hotel Stefanie, My only negative comment would be that at breakfast time it could be a little busy and you had to wait for a table On the last morning of our stay the staff had changed the layout of the breakfast room and this seemed to work a little better , All the staff were very friendly and helpful Room was excellent We had the superior double Good shower Room was nice and large and quiet Went during Easter and the room staff left lindt chocolate bunnies in the room on Easter day Nice touch 
464652,Hotel Stefanie, Walls were a bit thin Especially noise from the hallway could be heard well , Breakfast was great Champagne It felt like you got this great more traditional kind off comfort and service which suits the classical in Vienna 
464653,Hotel Stefanie, Nothing , All staff very helpful and friendly sorted out all our problems Great breakfast ambience d cor Nice rooms good location for all tourist sites 
464654,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Staff friendly and helpful assisting with getting around and going the extra mile Even noticed it was my birthday upon arrival wishing me a lovely birthday then surprised me with champagne chocolates and daffodils in my room Superb and made my day Thank you 
464655,Hotel Stefanie, room was a little to warm opening a window to cool it down but then that caused street noise, breakfast buffet was excellent with a wide range to chose from hotel was in an excellent location close to all the amenities and travel stops staff all willing to assist
464656,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Really friendly great value and location Breakfast was amazing especially as one of the party was coeliac and they produced a basket of bread and pastries she could eat I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to the city Strongly recommend 
464657,Hotel Stefanie, Nothing really Maybe coffee making facilities in the room without having to request them, The staff were lovely I accidentally left my purse on the reception desk and the concierge ran after us to the bus stop to return it to me Breakfast was great Lots of choice and constantly being restocked and cleaned by staff
464658,Hotel Stefanie, The presence of a beautiful woman not the Hotels fault Maybe stronger water pressureMost staff spoke good English or they got help immediately , Old world but very classy Staff very attentive went beyond expected in fact anticipated Needs Mademe feel at home in fact better than home I live by myself 
464659,Hotel Stefanie, Hotel used to me agresive policy hotel conditions at same status n Budape t Prag hotels didint fo the room was not large the staff was not friendly , I like in breakfast keind of chees only 
464660,Hotel Stefanie, Fake wood paneling Didn t make a bit of difference to my comfort of course , Very helpful front desk folks Great breakfast Well appointed room Very convenient location Great value for the money 
464661,Hotel Stefanie, The desk staff were a little vague about the transportation when I asked but bearing in mind the language difference they did well , An excellent welcome even though it was late when we arrived and food was still available in the bar 
464662,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Excellent location The room itself was not very large but it was exactly what I needed I loved the style of the hotel old and luxurious at the same time Would definitely come back here 
464663,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, beautiful hotel and staff were very helpful Great location within easy walking distance of main attractions Breakfast was excellent Would definitely recommend it 
464664,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Staff was super helpful nice and friendly Breakfast Buffet was spectacular restaurant is just lovely Hotel is older but this has it s own charm nice sized rooms and very clean Stayed at several places during visit and we would definitely book here again 
464665,Hotel Stefanie, Typical Viennese old hotel over 400 years old I suppose you could call it quaint but it needs to upgrade and modernise the rooms not great value to be honest ,No Positive
464666,Hotel Stefanie, TV in Bedroom would benefit of being tuned in correctly Could provide some extra personal bits for the ladies in the reception toilets No shops open anywhere on a Sunday to buy some much needed tampons etc Not the sort of thing you want to ask male reception staff for when did told couldn t help as no female staff on duty anywhere , Reception Staff were very professional lovely welcoming people Room was comfortable Restaurant Food was delicious 
464667,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, This is a terrible place By no means a 4 star hotel I mean just look at the towels which should have been thrown away ages ago The reception staff weren t any better I had to wait for more than an hour because my room was not ready The receptionist phoned me one day asking me to turn the TV volume down because my neighbour couldn t sleep I said I could barely hear it and he could come up and listen for himself He apparently trusts the neighbour s judgement and I said I d be leaving in protest Certainly he said your bill is ready He was using me because I paid a non refundable price I left two days before the end of my e booking with Booking com and he charged me the full price 924 Eu If Booking com could help I welcome a refund of the last two days It s not fair although I was glad to get the hell out of that terrible place Please complain to the administration of the hotel and advise your customers not to go anywhere near it 
464668,Hotel Stefanie, We liked everything, The hotel was so authentic staff on the whole were amazing and the breakfast buffet was to die for Location was perfect and would recommend to anyone going to Vienna 
464669,Hotel Stefanie, it would be perfect if there was coffee facilities in the room, the staff was very nice and helpful Very good situation Single bed very large Good breakfast with large choice Clean
464670,Hotel Stefanie, That we couldn t stay longer , A wonderfully comfortable and accommodating hotel Great staff outstanding amenities multiple options for pillows and one of the best breakfast experiences we ve had Traveling with a small dog and staff provided without request a bed water dish and a door hanger indicating a dog was in the room They pay attention to detail at Hotel Stefanie 
464671,Hotel Stefanie, Not a major issue but being used to UK indoor temperatures usually quite low we felt a bit stuffy inside the hotel particularly at night It is possible to switch off the heating in the room but the rest of the hotel was so warm that it didn t really cool off We had to open the windows at night which was fine as we had a courtyard room so no noise from the road , Huge amount of choice for breakfast even for vegans healthy eaters like us The hotel responded v quickly to emails and bought us some unsweetened soya milk especially they have sweetened as standard The bed was very comfortable not too soft well supported and the pillows were soft and bouncy The room was very clean and comfortable too well laid out and with lots of attention to detail shoe horn LED light magnifying mirror toiletries tissues coat hooks suitcase store safe sewing kit There are no kettles in the rooms as standard but you can ask for one with cups etc The staff was extremely friendly helpful and efficient The room was quiet we didn t hear anyone in the next rooms nor any outside noise we had a courtyard room The bar has a good selection of drinks The hotel is 5 mins walk from the bus stop Morzinplatz Schwedenplatz where the direct bus from the airport stops Postbus VAL2 It s only 8 and takes 20mins the train tube station is a bit further away There is a health organic food shop next door as well as a supermarket and some fast food places a few minutes walk by the Schwedenplatz tram station The hotel is easy walking distance to everything in the centre of Vienna it only took us 20 mins to walk to the Secession gallery where there is a little food market which is furthest away everything is around 10 15 mins away If you like walking there s no need to take public transports at all we walked round the RingStrasse in a couple of hours 
464672,Hotel Stefanie, WIFI was spotty It did not work at the desk nor the table It worked somewhat from the bed only and that was not terribly strong We complained but it seemed there was nothing to be done The signal was excellent in the lobby but that s not always convenient , We had a lovely large superior double at an excellent price Breakfast was huge and varied the staff were helpful I liked that you could ask for a coffee tea service in the room The 2 tram is right in front of the hotel making it easy to get around when not walking Great horizontal surfaces and electrical outlets everywhere 
464673,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, The breakfast buffet was spectacular great location very very very nice staff older hotel but that is part of the charm Had Valentines dinner in hotel and it was wonderful 
464674,Hotel Stefanie, Staff perfunctory apart from cafe bar staff who were very friendly and helpful Restaurant closed for conference when I stayed but not informed until 8pm when I d returned to hotel from sightseeing Breakfast a bit disappointing ,No Positive
464675,Hotel Stefanie, TV didn t work Internet was very spotty so had to use my own data plan which was very expensive, The breakfast was excellent the building an public areas very nice 
464676,Hotel Stefanie, Breakfast should start an 6 00am If you are taking a tour you cannot eat , Amazing breakfast Close to different kind of transportation and supermarkets 
464677,Hotel Stefanie, Breakfast room staff gave the impression that they were doing a job they did not particularly wish to be doing Rather sullen What friendliness there was did not come across as genuine , Very kind friendly and helpful housekeeping team especially the porters and chief housekeeper Efficient reception team Pleasant and comfortable rooms 
464678,Hotel Stefanie, A bigger selection of up to date English language newspapers would be nice , My wife and I have stayed at the Stefanie many times over the years and are especially impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the staff The rooms are also very comfortable and well maintained 
464679,Hotel Stefanie, just small things that dont really matter but shaky wifi no toothpaste in the bathroom didnt really care though , great location 3min walk over the nearest bridge and youre smack in the middle of everything staff was great always smiling always ready to help i recommend you go for a superior room quiet roomy and comfortable the hotel is much moore beautiful in real life than on the pictures in my opinion breakfast is great and classy always nice to start the day with champagne i regret i didnt tip moore i ll do better next time 
464680,Hotel Stefanie, We arrived after 10 and reception staff had no suggestions of where to get some food No in room tea making facilities but when i asked was brought to the room , Location is amazing Staff were very nice Room lovely bathroom spacious and clean Breakfast amazing 
464681,Hotel Stefanie, We couldn t fault the stay at all it was perfect , Incredible breakfast beautiful spacious bathroom and friendly accommodating staff Easy access to transport and supermarkets made the location perfect 
464682,Hotel Stefanie, Water pressure was poor shower was not very powerful as a consequence , Helpful staff Got help with directions to places and useful map Location good a few hundred yards from the tram and metro stops Breakfast was good plenty of choice 
464683,Hotel Stefanie, Only one escalator but minor problem A long distance from reception to room 387 Room cards instead od jeys would be an improvement, Nice stylish hotel Beautiful rooms and breakfast restaurant And close to Strassenbahn no 2
464684,Hotel Stefanie, Would have liked a corkscrew in the room , Really friendly and helpful staff We ate at the restaurant where the staff were also really good Breakfast was sensational The room was fabulous 
464685,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, I find the unique ambiance of the hotel always a pleasure and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful the food in the restaurant is excellent and the location of the hotel is superb 
464686,Hotel Stefanie, I was just a little late at breakfast and stayed until 10 10 The ladies working in the restaurant clearly showed they weren t too happy with that That was a pity , Nice staff great breakfast warm in hotel room it was freezing outside good location traditional but gemutlich and that s nice too 
464687,Hotel Stefanie, There was nothing to dislike Perhaps more in the way of a suggestion possibly room heating could be turned down a little to save on heating costs and environmental impact , The Stefanie has a strong even slightly olde world focus on guest service But its olde world in a very nice way The room we were placed in was five star So were the breakfasts and bar meals and service We were also impressed by the level of premises upkeep which maintains this older hotel to a very high standard This was our best hotel stay during a tour over three months that included hotels in the UK the Netherlands Austria and Germany All of the hotels we experienced were more than acceptable most were very good but the Stefanie was the stand out 
464688,Hotel Stefanie, It s very old fashioned Maids run around in aprons and little hats The furniture was heavy The room dark The bathroom old fashioned Breakfast was cold The bed uncomfortable , The staff were very professional and friendly and the location is great 
464689,Hotel Stefanie, Me and my boyfriend had a nice meal It was a new experience for me the meat i had it was very cool inside and I thought it was undercooked but apprently how it should be I got up that night with stomach cramps and had a bad stomach for 2 days My boyfriend was also a little off I have never been ill before from food and usually have a pretty hard stomach We told reception and all he said was that he hadnt heard anyone else be ill On checking out nothing was said either bit of a dissapointment for me at the standard of hotel with the customer relations that no one offered us any water for the room it was a sunday all supermarkets were shut and had to pay 5 for a small water or how we were Also we were told our room had a courtyard view when arrived we had the view of a side street Not a complaint Im just saying advertisement wasnt correct , Early check in was availible for us
464690,Hotel Stefanie, We loved our main courses when we ate dinner in the restaurant but the desserts let the meal down a little dark chocolate mousse was not in fact dark and the cheese board was a little underwhelming but the duck and the lovely red wine made up for it , The staff were very friendly and amiable and the mattress in the room was heavenly to sleep on The location was convenient and the hotel was clean and quiet 
464691,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Locacation all the staff were very helpfull and the breakfast was very nice also the evening meal Also the cafe bar The rooms were allways clean and tidy And both me and my friend enjoyed the hotel very much and would stay there again So thank you all very much

464693,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, The hotel is super Location is great very close to the centre 5 min walking from Stephansplatz 10 min from Hofburg Palace 17 from the Opera The staff is very friendly and helpful The interior and exterior of the hotel is of typical Austrian style which is very nice Everything is clean and tidy Breakfasts are fantastic great variety of delicious dishes for all tastes great coffee and even free campaign Dear owners and employees of the Hotel Stefanie many thanks for my wonderful holidays You demonstrated me the best Austrian hospitality I will recommend your hotel to everyone who goes to Vienna 
464694,Hotel Stefanie, The bedrooms were tired not refurbed since the 1970 s and the beds were uncomfortable Our friends bed was so uncomfortable and noisey when rolling over he could not sleep we asked reception to take a look and provide an alternative but they basically said there was nothing they could do about it as the bed was 200 years old The bed was made of ply wood so how does that work , The public areas were clean and fresh and breakfast facilities were very good 
464695,Hotel Stefanie, Poor internet connection , Great location easy walk to old city and most attractions Tram also very accessible Good sized clean room with twin beds that made our stay very comfortable Buffet breakfast a big plus 
464696,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, All the staff were fantastic they couldn t have been more helpful or friendly The hotel has a lovely atmosphere it feels like your stepping back into the 30 s Brilliant 
464697,Hotel Stefanie, Lack of a fan or de mister in bathroom, Great breakfast and great staff in the dining room and front desk Our request for tea coffee making equipment in the room was filled within 5 minutes 
464698,Hotel Stefanie, Although for us this was no problem the bathroom had a bath and no separate shower , wonderful classic style hotel with very friendly and professional staff very clean and a fabulous breakfast The hotel is walking distance from the city centre and very close to public transport facilities 
464699,Hotel Stefanie, The corridors can be very noisy although this only affected us one night and you can get this problem in most hotels , The reception and breakfast staff are all excellent Everything was very clean and spacious Breakfast was excellent with a generous pot of good coffee The hotel is very easy to find from Schwedenplatz and it is an easy walk to the old town from there 
464700,Hotel Stefanie, The fire alarm went off one night at 12 30 am it took 30 mins to switch them off as it was a false alarm No apology was given the next day ar check out, Location Breakfast Room was large for a single room Hotel was very charming
464701,Hotel Stefanie, No black out curtains dark enough and water only lukewarm in shower , Location cleanliness friendly attitude of staff Abundant and good quality breakfast 
464702,Hotel Stefanie, Nothing dislike will recommend and return on our next trip to Vienna , Friendless of all the staff always with a welcoming smile The breakfast was superb plenty of choice The hotels ambiance excellent value for money 
464703,Hotel Stefanie, I really can t think of anything bad about this hotel , Very very friendly and accomodating staff very close to the underground and 10 min away from Stephandom on foot amazing selection for breakfast wifi that works well and continuously and really spacious and beautiful hotel
464704,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, Liked everything about the hotel yes it was a very very short walk to the actual centre of vienna but everything about the hotel certainly made up for that
464705,Hotel Stefanie, Staff is not very polite Wifi is very very poor in the room we barely have internet connection Room is not very sound proof , Classic decoration clean room
464706,Hotel Stefanie, Restarant food was dissappointing but we found this to be generally the case in Vienna with the exception of the wonderful cakes I guess when the signature dish is Vienne Schnitzel you can t expect Haut Cuisine , Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff in a great location Great breakfast 
464707,Hotel Stefanie, Perhaps a slight improvement on room service but really the bar catered for us with beverages and snacks as and when required, The Hotel offered exceptional service throughout all of its serviced areas and the staff were welcoming considerate and ready to assist with any request
464708,Hotel Stefanie, Some of the staff were lovely some were a bit gruff The breakfast buffet was on the expensive side for the quality of food I went one day as nothing else was open but there are plenty of great places all around the city if you re not visiting on a public holiday , Great location not in a super touristy area but still a very short walk to get to all main attractions as well as several train lines for easy transport The hotel offers a very cheap rate to a gym next door which is handy if you re looking to keep active and work off the schnitzel and streusel 
464709,Hotel Stefanie,No Negative, fantastic hotel for a stay in Vienna very clean classy and convenient for getting into the city centre staff very helpful rooms warm and cosy breakfast very good would like to stay again on my next visit
