89590,H tel des Champs Elys es,No Negative, There were complimentary pastries in reception in the afternoon the bed was very comfy and there was a complimentary safe in the room The shower was gorgeous too and the air conditioning in the room was a must The receptionist was very helpful friendly and spoke very good English He arranged our taxi to collect us from the airport and to take us back at the end of our trip
89591,H tel des Champs Elys es, Lighting was a technological challenge Air conditioning was inadequate to maintain reasonable comfort level on hot late June evenings , Great boutique hotel Room was cozy Bathroom was renovated recently Breakfast was delicious with many options including fresh fruit cheeses eggs cooked to order and breads Staff were courteous and helpful 
89592,H tel des Champs Elys es,No Negative, The hotel is almost on the Rue La Bo tie grocery store restaurents etc close to the middle section of Avenue des Champs lys es with two Metro stations Saint Philippe du Roule and Franklin D Roosevelt in quick walking distance As a result the Arc de Triomphe Place de la Concorde Trocad ro and major museums are either within walking distance or just a few Metro stops away The staff is very courteous and room maintenance impeccable On the noon of May 14th we walked the Rue La Bo tie towards Avenue des Champs lys es and saw Emmanuel Macron waving at us before his sworn in as a new president Quite an experience thanks to the location of this hotel 
89593,H tel des Champs Elys es, Only the Elevator is too small but not a problem , Location is great just 5 minutes walk to Metro Station Great choices of food nearby the hotel Staffs are fantastic helpful and very friendly 
89594,H tel des Champs Elys es, Had to ask the front desk to turn on the AC in my room A small observation as things are done differently in Europe , The hotel staff were courteous and extremely knowledgeable They were very very helpful and it made my trip seamless I felt safe and secure and the bed was a dream Not to mention the view from my room was amazing Great value for money 
89595,H tel des Champs Elys es,No Negative, Technology in the room was Amazing Location was perfect Really close to the Champs Elysees but far enough to still be quiet Room was larger than most paris hotel rooms
89596,H tel des Champs Elys es, Breakfast was very mediocre poor and extremely overpriced 18 Euros per day Not much variety in the breakfast meal and we got more variety of food at different Cafes for breakfast at a much cheaper price than the hotel s breakfast Tiny elevator lift Small tight room, Excellent location 5 minute walk to the Champs Elysees 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower 20 minute walk to Printemps department store Next to alot of small cafes pharmacies local stores Helpful Staff Quick in cleaning and preparing the room Quiet hotel
89597,H tel des Champs Elys es, The breakfast is not to our expectation considering a 4 stars hotel The street was very noisy from 3 30 to 4 30 am due to night clubs in the neighbourhood , The location is easy accessible to the main locations The stuff is friendly 
89598,H tel des Champs Elys es,No Negative, This was a comfortable boutique hotel located close to the Champs Elysees The area has plenty of restaurants bars and cafes Do not that some of these more local intimate restaurants do close on a Sunday 
89599,H tel des Champs Elys es, It is perhaps closer to 3 5 star than 4 and the rooms are small but to be expected in Paris and the location makes up for this , The location the staff who were amazing 
89600,H tel des Champs Elys es, The area is within a night club district During the early hours there are a lot if noise disturbances which resonate all the way to the hotel , The location was great a small walking distance to main street shopping and tourist attractions
89601,H tel des Champs Elys es, The hotel is tinny and the rooms very small There s a night club across the street from the hotel and the hooting and traffic at 4am is unpleasent, I liked help from the staff and the area
89602,H tel des Champs Elys es, Breakfast offered is very expensive can get cheaper in any cafe nearby , Good location close to restaurants cafes and shopping the room was clean and modern wifi worked very well 
89603,H tel des Champs Elys es, The airco did not seem to work well so opened windows instead The wireless did not work at all for me , A small hotel but nicely located near many bars and restaurants It s a 15 minute pretty straight forward walk to the Eiffel Tower The room was great Nice comfortable bed with big TV screen Windows can be openend to look into the streets When closed it s a quiet area even as my room was located on a corner overlooking a few restaurants The light system works with a button panel next to the bed which you need to play around with a bit One of them incl a buzzer to open the door Not unsafe just makes an expected noise if you try to switch off the lights The toilet is separated from the bathroom which is nice if you travel in pairs The shower was nice clean and spacious I would be better to fix it higher than 1 80 meter for people taller than this There is space enough so not sure why they fixed it like this Can highly recommend this hotel for a weekend or longer if you need to be in Paris Centre 
89604,H tel des Champs Elys es, lack of air con in room had to be used in all rooms or none room was too hot Drain in bathroom sink smelled Hotel was noisey in the early hours of the morning We were told we would be able to buy tickets for eiffel tower through the hotel but then told this was incorrect when we arrived, location size of room bed tv large staff friendly enough
89605,H tel des Champs Elys es, The room was very very small the toilet was extremely small price was far too expensive for what we got and breakfast was too expensive for what was on offer , The location and friendliness of staff
89606,H tel des Champs Elys es, the housekeeping is good but could be better, They offered me an early check in around 8 00am for free and they also received my mail before my arrival and found everything in my room when I checked in that was amazing
89607,H tel des Champs Elys es, Nothing really If pushed I would say the lift is tiny as it is in so many older hotel buildings in Paris and the switches in the bedroom are far too complicated I shouldn t need instructions on how to operate the lights But that s a very minor detail , Room was larger than expected if a little excentric in decor think gold and mirrors and checkin out friendly and easy Found a nice place to hold a meeting with my colleague Breakfast was good 
89608,H tel des Champs Elys es,No Negative, Staff is super helpful and i am impressed their pre arrival service to make recommendation while you are around in Paris They response on request is very fast too 
89609,H tel des Champs Elys es, There were no negatives , The communications with the hotel and it s staff were excellent from the word go This continued on arrival until departure with useful information and advice The hotel was a unique find in terms of location d cor and ambience The room was large and well equipped and the bed very large and comfortable The bathroom also was well appointed and equipped had a separate toilet Would I return yes 
89610,H tel des Champs Elys es, The shower was a rainforest head and water pressure was average so not brilliant Shower head couldn t be angled , Staff were super helpful without been in your face Bed was comfy Breakfast was excellent 
89611,H tel des Champs Elys es, Checked us into a twin room rather than double which we booked We didn t know this until we opened the door Swapped without fuss though , Excellent buffet breakfast Good value for money Close to Underground for route into central London
89612,H tel des Champs Elys es, The room was really small should be highlithed better In the photos the rooms appear bigger Also the building was really small , Excellent position
89613,H tel des Champs Elys es, Breakfast cost 36 for a couple of croissants small scrambled egg and 2 little glasses of Orange juice Small bottle of wine 23 the same was in the shop afew doors down for 8 , Excellent location
89614,H tel des Champs Elys es, Maybe the colors of the hotel they re so dark with such a small space and I didn t like that the bathroom has no door, I like the cleanliness and the staff is amazing
89615,H tel des Champs Elys es, The only fault I have is that there was no coffee tea making facilities in the room otherwise can not fault this place , Staff were very helpfull and friendly Location great Excellent bars and restaurants nearby

89618,H tel des Champs Elys es, Nothing really it was all pretty good, The hotel was in a great area close to great shopping and within easy walking distance of a lot of tourist attractions The Metro was just around the corner 
89619,H tel des Champs Elys es, Our room had a toilet in a separate room on the opposite side of the room from the shower sink which was awkward Bed was a little stiff but not bad , Excellent location Staff was very friendly Rooms were very modern and designed well Great value for the location 
89620,H tel des Champs Elys es, Have no complaints whatsoever , Reception staff were really kind spoke very good English and extremely helpful Location could not be better just off the Champs Elyses Will go back 
89621,H tel des Champs Elys es, No hot water When I complained at reception they told me there had been a lot of rain whatever that has to do with hot water I don t know Also no water in the room I was charged 8 for two bottles of water fro the mini bar and also I was charged an unexplained 3 taxi charge Hotel is by no means four star It is weird to say the least d cor is a mix of Asian and 1930s style Hallways are dark and rooms are very small Ok hotel but to expensive for what it is, Location is good very central and easy to get to everywhere
89622,H tel des Champs Elys es, The location was also bad Near a nightclub and was very noisy Ok with the windows closed but we wanted them open , The hotel was small and charming But the rooms were very good size The staff were AMAZING The location was both good and bad Only 2 blocks off the Champs lys es and close to museums

89628,H tel des Champs Elys es, I realise the hotel can t help this as its to do with the location but the traffic noise at night was really bad cars honking at each other quite often all through the night, Staff were brilliant food was lovely hotel was cosy
89629,H tel des Champs Elys es,No Negative, When we went to the hotel our room key wouldn t work our room was not cleaned in the afternoon when we got back so we had to ask for it to be done The room was cold in the evening so we had to keep asking for the heating to be put on there was a ketal in our room we were asked to fill it in the bathroom so we had to buy water outside And when we wanted room service we had to go down our self as they had no staff
