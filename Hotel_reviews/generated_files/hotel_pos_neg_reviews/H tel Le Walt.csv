163573,H tel Le Walt, The bedding very poor quality and uncomfortable It was suppose to be a queen bed however I noticed they were two single beds put together at night they separate and becomes very uncomfortable, The location
163574,H tel Le Walt, room is smell and very normally furnitured which is not worth the price there s no eiffel tower view even though we booked the Deluxe Room , good location with a convinient transportation access to every sightseeing with the subway very nearby 
163575,H tel Le Walt,No Negative, Upgraded to a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower superb It was a quick visit but I really liked the hotel Boutique and well designed The giant painting bedboard was a nice touch Shower was first class Great communication from Raphael to inform me of the special upgrade Worth every euro

163584,H tel Le Walt, The pillows weren t to my standard Too soft , Great location and staff Other than one part of asking for a shirt to be dry cleaned mainly to be ironed I received it back folded in a box which defeated the objective of the laundry However money was refunded and two free glasses of champagne for us both Couldn t ask for much more Thank you everyone at Le Walt Hope to be back soon 
163585,H tel Le Walt,No Negative, Amazing location right by metro station Eiffel Tower 5 minutes down the road beautiful room with a view of the Eiffel Tower amazingly welcoming staff who were very friendly large room size and comfortable bed lovely waterfall shower It was my birthday during my visit and they sent me up a bottle of champagne I was a solo traveller and felt 100 safe and looked after 
163586,H tel Le Walt, The large painting in the rooms were part of the appeal to stay at Le Walt but the bed rests right against it without any glass or partition protecting the painting , Loved loved loved our stay here The staff of Le Walt went out of their way from the time we booked until even after we checked out Robert with the reception was accommodating to our requests as my spouse I were staying for our anniversary They ensured we could check in early as we had the morning train We had a view of the Effiel Tower as requested were provided with robes slippers a complimentary bottle of champagne The bedding pillows were very comfortable Although we were on the street side room 502 we had no issues with noise The breakfast spread was fabulous The pictures do not do the area justice Plenty of seating lots of food It was perfect Location was also great whether you are walking to see sights or hopping on the metro Lastly the staff was wonderfully accommodating in providing luggage storage in the back without an extra fee or hassle Everyone we met was warm generous I ve stayed in numerous cities across Europe Berlin Prague London Bruges Rome etc and this place is at the top

163596,H tel Le Walt, the breakfast was good but wasn t included the house keeper was pretty bad the floors were wood and they were always dirty and there is really no storage in there rooms crazy tight no drawer storage at all and the closet was about 30 wide , the location is superior we could walk to many sites and there were great cafes just out the door the front desk staff was extremely helpful and courteous

163598,H tel Le Walt,No Negative, For the money this hotel scores 10 10 in every aspect I have already recommended it to friends and family I usually stay in 5 hotels in Mauritius Dubai etc all over the world which obviously you expect everything to be 1st class and for the money I didn t expect a lot but was highly satisfied The view was priceless and made the trip 
163599,H tel Le Walt, Attitude of staff We awoke during the night to find water coming through the roof and the bathroom flooded We were moved to another room which was worse than the room we had moved from windows and curtains couldn t be opened in the new room as it was a ground floor room and people were sitting on the other side of the glass eating The air conditioning didn t work in any of the rooms so not being able to open the windows was an issue and we had not paid a lot of money for a room where you couldn t even open the curtains We asked for another room for the rest of our stay we could see from the website they weren t fully booked and the staff one person was incredibly rude a shame the customer service does not live upto the lovely building and location , Location of the hotel is excellent Rooms nicely decorated
