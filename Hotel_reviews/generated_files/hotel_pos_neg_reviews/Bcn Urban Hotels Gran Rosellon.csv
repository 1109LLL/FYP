434272,Bcn Urban Hotels Gran Rosellon, The rooftop pool like almost all rooftop pools in Barcelona is too small to really swim in But this isn t really much of an issue because Barcelona has so much to do and see that most people don t need to spend a lot of time at the pool , Our stay at the hotel was great We landed at 8am and they let us check in immediately upon arrival Every time we walked by the desk the staff greeted us by name and tehy often asked us whether there was anything they could do for us The room was very comfortable and quiet and the location is amazing

434284,Bcn Urban Hotels Gran Rosellon,No Negative, The best location 2 min from underground station Close to the best spots such as good quality restaurants cafes bars The room was with big terrassa with magnifique view The best way to start a day breakfast at the room in terrassa and then just go the 9th floor for enjoying the roof top view in the swimming pool

434312,Bcn Urban Hotels Gran Rosellon, What we found really dissapointing was the fact that towels were not changed for 3 consecutive days And more intolerable was that cleaning ladies folded the towels every morning and put them as they were new ones It seems too strange when you pay 90 per night and face such kind of issues Hope to be solved , Such great very helpful and friendly staff Just after our arrival the recepsion guy Alejandro together with his colleague helped us for everything we asked The location was perfect You can reach by walking Sagrada La Rambla Placa Catalunya etc Also the area around had some great bars and restaurants The room was really good Breakfast was delicious and had everything needed but it could be better
