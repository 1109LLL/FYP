5257,Park Plaza County Hall London, Extra bed was the worst breakfast queue was really terrible It s easy to tell people to come at a specific time though you have to arrange it somehow Parking is far away and hard to come back because of road diversions , Just the location and view

5261,Park Plaza County Hall London, Housekeeping would bang on your door to wake you up at 830am This is your alarm Very frustrated They will continue banging till you wake up until you told them not to clean up your room in such a morning hours Terrible If we need clean up we would put the paper sign out to make up room No respect on guests Don t expect this Housekeeping will refill your bath gel they only keep those bottles which you don t want to use keep on giving you the same unwanted bottles say conditioner They won t give you slippers cotton pads tho they keep it in their trolley They won t refill your tea sugar when u finished your stay was more than 6 days Doubt they changed your bedsheets too in such a long week ,No Positive
5262,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, The location It was so close to the london eye and the rest of the popular attractions that it was easy for my wife to go with the kids while I attendend a course at the hotel The rooms were comfortable and fair enough space 
5263,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast was an absolute disaster 20 minute wait for a table que to get brerakfast and then a que to get toast by which time your breakfast was cold If you got the toast first and qued for breakfast you toast would have been cold No tea or coffee offered for 30 mibns, Room was very well appointed and facilities were good
5264,Park Plaza County Hall London, Large queues for breakfast Room was very crammed booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children no space to go in with a pushchair Not enough lifts to cater for guests at times it took us 10 minutes to go down to the lobby restaurant , Staff was very helpful Restaurant offered great food Excellent location walking distance to Waterloo station and several landmarks 
5265,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Were staying in london for just one night and the location was perfect we paid around 200 for one night for a family suite and it was very well worth the money

5267,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Location was great easy walk to London eye and Big Ben as well as many other attractions in this area hotel staff were great very helpful breakfast buffet was very good food was very fresh and well presented and although very busy staff were very efficient to make sure every one was well looked after 
5268,Park Plaza County Hall London, Housekeeping is not attentive not caring at all Once when I returned to my room at night there is not even a piece of towels in the toilet Also they won t give you enough set of towels Even if they give you they just left a pile for you to sort They never refill your toiletries needs u have to ask specifically everyday The most essential things when you finished they won t refill it for you But only replenish those you already left in full bottles but with even more that is not what you need E g I have 4 full bottles of conditioners 3 full bottles of shampoo but none for bath gel body cream They don t provide you with basic needs like slippers Cotton pads wools Q tips But we saw it in their trolley Not even refill teabags milk sugar Rooms are considered not clean to normal hotel standard ,No Positive
5269,Park Plaza County Hall London, expensive breakfast especially when you only want a coffee and croissant We went to Starbucks around the corner for this , location to city attractions The room was comfortable and quiet Bathroom was clean and the hot water in the shower was plentiful 
5270,Park Plaza County Hall London, the traffic near the hotel was madness but that was likely due to the construction going on nearby once that is off the traffic will be better , the location is the perks here it is walking distance to the london eye and everything near it it is also about a 10 minute walk away from the nearest tube station there are many little cafes nearby so overall it is really convenient 
5271,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, It was a great stay for me and my family everybody in the hotel was so helpful especially COURTNEY at the reception desk Everything in the hotel was excellent including breakfast When we go to London again we will definitely stay in this hotel 
5272,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Convenience location 10 mins walk to Waterloo tube station 3 mins to London eye Suggest to choose a room with outside view finally paid 20 per night to upgrade 
5273,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, LOCATION perfect STAFF we went into the wrong hotel initially thinking that the Park Plaza Building at the westminster bridge is the same as the county hall hotel It wasn t The staff at the Park Plaza Westminster hotel were all very warm and welcoming Their hospitality felt genuine right from the guy who greeted us at the main entrance all the way up to the lady at the reception who gave us directions going to the Park Plaza county hall hotel which was the adjacent building at the back They were all smiley and happy to assist us On the other hand the staff at the county hotel were polite and did their job alright The lady at the reception gave us a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited and they checked if the room was the ready It was a quick 10min wait which was fine No greeting nor smile at all from the bartender and the waiter at the Spectrum Bar It was 1500H and the bar was definitely not busy The difference between our experience between the staff from both Park Plaza Hotels was just really evident that I had to put it here ROOM SUPERIOR Room We stayed for our anniversary We got a complimentary full bottle of wine greeting card and they decorated our room with petals and swan folded towels We were also assigned to a corner room with a view of the big ben and london eye which was very beautiful at night The TV monitor in the room serves like a multimedia browser where you can view your current room bill do self check out watch youtube videos listen to the radio etc The bedroom and bath were just the right size It was not small but not too big as well We didn t have a lot of luggage with us so it was just right Mini bar was stocked with the basics We liked that there were extra pillows for us to use Bed was comfortable to sleep on but was really really squeaky and we re not big people at all if you know what i mean BREAKFAST good old continental and english breakfast 
5274,Park Plaza County Hall London, Air con control in room did not work properly had to ask reception to turn it off as it was freezing despite turning it to 5 degrees Room very small for a 4 night stay Dispute at check out regarding bar bill all drinks paid for as taken but still had some charged to room ,No Positive

5277,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room was very much smaller than I anticipated It must have been smaller than it should have been because the receptionist informed me that it was very small as I checked in I had expected to have a small living area and that was why I booked this particular hotel as I did not want a traditional hotel room I did not get that ,No Positive
5278,Park Plaza County Hall London, We had a leaky kettle they were light on with milk coffee in the room, I liked that there were crockery cutlery a microwave in the room
5279,Park Plaza County Hall London, Apparently the hotel guests before us had replaced 2 of the minibar drinks with their own and as a result we were charged for the 2 drinks Not many cafes and food option nearby, The location is fantastic about 10 minutes walk to the Waterloo Station and London Eye The Studio Double room is made up of 2 smaller rooms interconnected by a mini kitchenette There are kitchenware and microwave for use One room consist of a queen size bed and a sofa bed in the other Suitable for family of 4 There is a public laundry room for those who would like their laundry to be done 
5280,Park Plaza County Hall London, Leaking shower Electricity went out one night but we were compensated Temperature in room hard to regulate , Plenty of room in the studio double Comfy bed Great location to Westminster sights and right off the Waterloo tube stop 
5281,Park Plaza County Hall London, Long delay to get into room even though I arrived after check in time Room was dirty London eye view wasn t proper as blocked by other hotel shouldn t have to pay for the poor view, Nice breakfast and dinner avaliable
5282,Park Plaza County Hall London, Very poor room cleanliness very disorganised housekeeping no towels in room on second day had to ask twice to get it resolved, Friendly staff good location
5283,Park Plaza County Hall London, The bathroom needs update the layout is awkward and the faucet is old Also the bathtub door is half way there is no way to avoid water on the floor while taking a shower Secondly the beds are not comfortable enough The hotel can do a little bit considering the rate charged on each room Lastly the air freshener used by housekeeping after daily cleaning smells terrible please change it , The hotel location is great It is a walking distance to London eye westiminster bridge parliament square Westminster Abbey Buckingham palace and many more The staffs are great and very responsive to request 
5284,Park Plaza County Hall London, As a family of 4 with two young teenagers the room was a bit tight , It was close to London Eye and some other attractions as well as Waterloo station Room was clean and concierge Ceasar was extremely helpful Breakfast was good

5286,Park Plaza County Hall London, The sleeper couch which acts as the second bed was uncomfortable and not practical when open as it was in the way of the door , Location is great close to the underground and over ground stations Close to super attractions 
5287,Park Plaza County Hall London, Was Not that Clean lot of Things like cushion Cover forgotten happened but staff was Friendly ans fast Breakfast queue, Close to eye and park good f r kids Bit staff is very Friendly and helpfull 
5288,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Staff extremely helpful and friendly Room upgrade on arrival free of charge to a penthouse suite Fantastic for us as was our first time away just the two of us in 3 years 2 min walk from Waterloo station
5289,Park Plaza County Hall London, Was indicated that room family friendly Room was 1 queen and 1 sofa Didn t realise second bed was a sofa bed Sofa not comfortable at all for 2 children 11 plus sleeping together Asked staff if a better bed room was possible which was not Offered to try make sofa bed more comfortable but nothing was done , Location was good room size ok Bathroom size ok
5290,Park Plaza County Hall London, Seemed slightly shambolic I checked in around 7pm and yet I was told I wouldn t have towels until an hour later although when I actually went to the room the towels were there but the bathroom just seemed a little ehhh I kept finding stray hairs around the place that didn t belong to me Bit gross , The location is good 
5291,Park Plaza County Hall London, Milk in the room fridge Off Breakfast staff 3 days out of the 6 I had to ask for coffee No one checked me All other people couples were asked Perhaps a singles thing Otherwise all good Staff friendly and helpful Location brill , Friendly staff Location 
5292,Park Plaza County Hall London, Since we booked studio room with 2 children the hotel did not provide extra sleeping pillows and blanket for the extra bed in the room , Very good breakfast and nice staff for service We would love to stay here again if there any chance
5293,Park Plaza County Hall London, The only thing that mark the hotel down on was the room didn t have a window that opened Not a problem with the aircon on but I like fresh air when I sleep The bed was a little uncomfortable but no bed is ever the same as your own The shower head leaked and made the floor wet but that wasn t an inconvenience to me more of a pain for the housekeeping I guess , The staff were kind polite very helpful and you could have a joke with them too We received a room upgrade upon check in The room was fabulous The hotel was clean and well presented We loved it and would definitely stay again and recommend to others 
5294,Park Plaza County Hall London, The view from our room , Breakfast was awesome Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful The Bar Restaurant was very convenient and provided great service Loved the food and drinks they had to offer The bedroom and shower was nice I enjoyed my stay and would definitely book a room at Park Plaza County Hall next time I m in town In terms of location you can t beat it all the landmarks are within walking distance and Waterloo station is just around the corner so you can get around town on the tube very easily 
5295,Park Plaza County Hall London, The location was disappointing due to all the construction in the area which I was unaware of and which spoilt the view from my room I found the area very congested and noisy so would probably not use the hotel again I realize however that this is a personal preference and other guests may enjoy the area , The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable 
5296,Park Plaza County Hall London, The reception staff were really unhelpful and glum They never smiled Almost any request was too much trouble In a hotel that has no swimming pool or public rooms the reception staff are key These appear to have been poorly selected trained and not proactively managed A poor reflection of the brand and hotel , Great location and helpful porters and concierge staff 
5297,Park Plaza County Hall London, I discussed my grievance with the duty manager who promised me she would address them upon checkout Upon checkout I was told she was busy however she would email me with her findings As of now now communication have been made , NOTHING
5298,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room had a few damaged bits here and there Very clean though the bed was big but I found it as firm as the sofa bed in our room Air con seemed to be low in the day and fast and very cold in the early hours The other main issue was the lifts In busy times we waited 15 minutes as we had a baby buggy with us I had 1 gripe as I m quite OCD and don t like reusing towels i didn t receive the extra towels I ordered from housekeeping twice once each day , Breakfast that was available no veggie full breakfast was very good with nice pastries Staff were nice and sociable throughout the hotel 
5299,Park Plaza County Hall London, Small for a family of 4 A little over priced for what you get however expected for that time of year Not enough pillows House keeping knocked at our door fairly early which was disappointing as we just flew for 24hours , Location of the property
5300,Park Plaza County Hall London, Air conditioning was a problem We had to let them know twice before it was handled Overall we very much loved our stay , upgraded our room went out of their way to quickly check us in The restaurant was a pleasant surprise very good food and service 
5301,Park Plaza County Hall London, Booked a double room but had two single beds pushed together with two single duvets being with my partner we weren t happy as we had to sleep separated due to this Also there is not enough milk coffee and sugar left in the room,No Positive
5302,Park Plaza County Hall London, Booking com has wrong room advertised for Penthouse suite actual room very disappointing Who is to Blame here Staff at reception not helpful about mix up House keeping is very average and be prepared for very long wait for breakfast in the mornings hotel is more concerned about money than the customer 1st photo is what you are shown of room at time of booking next photos actual room After spending over 800 pounds for 2 nights not happy Hotel says there is nothing they can do about what images are shown of rooms yet all there images are copyrighted as per there website has been happening a long time but I believe they are happy for it to keep happening as when you have booked and arrived it s too late money is paid what you going to do attitude , Location was great to be honest but after that it s all down hill 
5303,Park Plaza County Hall London, The breakfast was not how I expected it Also the breakfast staff on the restaurant was not as welcoming , Welcoming staff on the front desk Very helpeful Amazing location and view from bedroom 
5304,Park Plaza County Hall London, I called the hotel to ask if I can pay the last night of our family stay by Maestro debit card and the hotel staff confirmed this is possible When we checked out appeared it is not possible not a huge problem but staff are giving incorrect information , Great central location 5 min walk from London eye Big Ben Waterloo station Very clean hotel and great service 
5305,Park Plaza County Hall London, There is nothing significant to dislike As a way to improve they should provide the following two things especially for families with little kids liquid handwash in the bathroom bottled drinking water because the tap water may not be suitable for young children most hotels around the world in this price range do not charge for water for kids , The kitchenette in the room is just the thing a family needs The view of London Eye is great The staff is quite responsive to all needs This includes everyone from front desk restaurant housekeeping and concierge They were very courteous and helpful to us The breakfast is very good too A lot of variety The hotel location is the best part Very close to the Waterloo station A number of trains to places outside of London originate terminate here Couple of bus stops are also nearby Westminster bridge London Eye and other tourist attractions on the river bank are just a short walk The county hall area has a few decent restaurants a starbucks and a convenience store The booking com offer of free entry tickets to various attractions saved us a lot of money It is a very good offer 
5306,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast was a little busy Hit the peak you would wait but the staff laid out juice coffee for anyone in a queue Breakfast quality itself was excellent, Little extras made a big difference It was a hot day when we arrived to our room yet the staff had left a keycard in the slot so the air on continued to run had closed the curtains so the room was comfortable There were drinks not the normal water but fruit juices which the kids loved We were a towel short 1 evening 1 phone call to reception towels appeared at the door within 5 minutes The location is superb 5 minutes walk from Waterloo train station so easy access a stone throw from the London Eye the South Bank a bridge walk to either Westminster or Soho We were on the 13th floor we could have been in the country It was quiet no road or plane noise at all 
5307,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Loved the location close to two subway stations big rooms with microwave gym and sauna Aurora spa services also great Liked the good security on entering the property Would go back again Especially with families 
5308,Park Plaza County Hall London, It s a family hotel so sometimes there are kids running around like it s a playground Apart from that all good, Superb location and excellent room
5309,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Breakfast was just okay Family suite was perfect Pretty quiet even at night Close to all major London attractions except Greenwich Shakespeare s globe but we walked there just fine 
5310,Park Plaza County Hall London, There was not much options for the vegetarians in breakfast , Great Stay Superb Location Comfy Beds Good English Breakfast Friendly Staff front desk 
5311,Park Plaza County Hall London, Cleaners woke up us too early in the morning breakfast wasn t worth the money and the food hall was too small so we had to wait in line for quite a while bathroom was awkwardly placed in between beds and room wasn t big enough for two people to walk around at once and there was no bin , Location was helpful cleanliness was average reception was nice 
5312,Park Plaza County Hall London, I was disappointed I emailed and went to no end of trouble to explain what we wanted Everyone was confused However we were told in the end we could upgrade for another 100 00 pound a night which annoyed me We did this as the room we had was dark and too small there was always confusion about things The two tvs were so quiet we couldnt hear them so every time we turned them on we had to call the maintenance man to turn them up which was so annoying In the end they left us with their remote so we didnt have to do it Concierge was very good but depended who was on Breakfast was ok but really really busy Overrall I wouldnt stay again as I would rather be in the middle of the town We had to take a taxi to Oxford St all the time , The bed was a good size and the sofa bed was good Good with nespresso machine and microwave We ended up with good big windows and a light room 
5313,Park Plaza County Hall London, Nothing not a thing my son and I loved it , Staff were exceptional I wish there were a higher rating Friendly and chatty while still being highly efficient and making sure our stay was perfect This hotel is an ideal spot for a trip to London we could walk a large majority of places we wanted to go but still very quiet and restful The kitchenette is a lively touch we didn t cook but it apenabled us to store snacks cereal etc And milk and water on the fridge Plenty of wardrobe and storage space Bathroom shower in particular was excellent Breakfast each morning was great and though there are a large number of peopl 14 floors highly organised and efficient Wifi was great easily able to stream Netflix etc And there was a big screen TV with many apps and all the premium channels 
5314,Park Plaza County Hall London, The digging outside the Reseption But of course this will be finished , I have been several times in London This is my best hotel stay Close to everything 
5315,Park Plaza County Hall London, They need to provide slippers The fridge needs to be bigger To give you an idea of its size it could only fit two 1 5 liter soda bottles , The location can t be beaten The separation between the two beds allows parents to hang out in one side of the room while the kids sleep in peace on the other side 
5316,Park Plaza County Hall London, Could have been more child friendly There were kids in the group that were 4 and six No facilities for children to play or be entertained , Staff at breakfast were very good Concierge staff security staff were excellent very helpful Good breakfast for the money 
5317,Park Plaza County Hall London, Small and very dark room , Room was comfortable but very small More intimate than private but clean and tidy Shower difficult to use and poor screen means it leaks on the bathroom floor Compact sink but all in all everything you need and hotel affords a great location 
5318,Park Plaza County Hall London, Sofa bed was terrible did not sleep whatsoever on the first night The bars were poking through the very thin mattress The amount of money paid for the accommodation I was expecting at least a comfortable bed Everything else was terrific The location and cleanliness A1 , Proximity excellent
5319,Park Plaza County Hall London, Our first room was not to our liking We paid a reasonable amount for and upgrade the following day and we were much happier , We were greeted so warmly and treated like old friends by the chef upon our late arrival to the restaurant the first night He was an outstanding ambassador for the hotel and made us feel very welcome and special 
5320,Park Plaza County Hall London, Booked the hotel room one month prior to the check in date to get the the best price possible However I found out that the room rate went down considerably before my stay More than 350 GPB for 8 nights Communicating with the hotel management they did not agree to lower the price Booking com made a wonderful gesture keeping its promise of best price guarantee Booking com refunded me 352 GBP the difference in the price Thank you Booking com for keeping the promise , I like the Location that is close to London Eye Big Ben and the Themes I like the nice room size 
5321,Park Plaza County Hall London, I did not like the bathtub with the shower The shower was difficult to use without getting water everywhere and the bathtub was difficult to get in and out of , The staff was extra helpful and friendly The breakfast was good and the chef made sure we got what we wanted I also like that the hotel was close to where we wanted to be 
5322,Park Plaza County Hall London, Restaurant is dual purpose Good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff Breakfast very ordinary I am afraid Food from the cooked options cold Toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them Tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options Eggs Benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service , Complimentary upgrade to suite well received Room absolutely perfect especially after long working day Location is great for South Bank and County Hall exhibitions and conferences 
5323,Park Plaza County Hall London, The sound proofing of the room is terrible and you could here everything outside the door and in other room The layout of the room is very strange with the bed just beside the door and living room at the end of the room The location of the hotel is ok it looks very close to the underground but actually need to walk 10min from the station Not impressed with the service of the staff either ,No Positive
5324,Park Plaza County Hall London, They purposely not allowed my parents to check in one hour earlier since the room was ready The reason I wanted to check in earlier because my parents took a 15hours flight and need to take a rest before going out but the lady said the hotel policy stated check in time is at 3pm but before that she kept on allowing other customer non asian customer to check in I FELT DISCRIMINATED ,No Positive
5325,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, The room was lovely Small by American standards but to be expected in Europe The beds were very comfy and the room has a coffee and refrigeration station Plenty of storage for your clothing and bags Perfect room for 2 people Lovely hotel Would stay here again Location is superb 
5326,Park Plaza County Hall London, It was a bank holiday so breakfast was not served at 6 30 AM as expected We had to wait until 7 7 15 AM so a rush to get to the airport for our early morning flight , Doorman was very helpful obtaining a taxi for a early morning flight Helped with our luggage and opening the taxi doors for myself and my travel buddy 
5327,Park Plaza County Hall London, Only one point toilet paper holder doesn t work the roll keeps popping out, The hotel staff were lovely and I loved the layout of the room Also my mother called in to do something special for my birthday and the hotel staff were great about it Big thank you to them 
5328,Park Plaza County Hall London, Disappointed by Bar staff was ignored for ten minutes bar was quiet and staff were chatting to each other and when I finally got attention and asked for half a lager I was told rather rudely that I d need to wait until my allocated waiter was free I waited for a few more minutes I had been walking in 35 degree heat and finally gave up , Comfy beds and sheets huge room with fridge and microwave two tellies Very polite and helpful reception staff 
5329,Park Plaza County Hall London, There was a lot of construction in the area and the outside of the hotel is not picturesque but location makes up for this I would recommend asking for a room with a view I didn t even think about this when booking but was so happy with our room location on an upper floor The bathroom had a sliding glass door which lacked privacy this was not a big deal as I was traveling with my husband but might be weird if traveling with friends , We had a corner room on the 11th floor with two large windows Spectacular views of Big Ben Palace of Westminster the London Eye and the city skyline over the Waterloo train station This location is awesome to go to all the Southbank attractions restaurants Waterloo train underground station Westminster Bridge and longer walks along the Thames with easy access across the many bridges into the center of the city Summer night life is so much fun as the sun didn t set until after 9 30 pm and we enjoyed a glass of wine or a pitcher of Pimm s at the Southbank Centre almost every night The room was spacious especially for a hotel in London and the bed was large and comfy This is a high rise hotel so not a boutique hotel experience but the location and value for the price can t be beat The staff were super friendly and very helpful We didn t eat at the restaurant on site so can t give a review but would highly recommend this hotel 
5330,Park Plaza County Hall London, TV didn t work Poor lighting in room Poor toilet roll fittings No dressing gown or slippers Could have been cleaner Room had no privacy as overlooked by other rooms Also room overlooked restaurant Not up to 4 star rating Shower difficult to operate, Nothing in particular
5331,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, This is the first time I d stayed in this hotel but it certainly won t be the last From the staff on the reception desk and the concierges to the staff in the Italian restaurant I could find no faults Everyone was very welcoming and friendly By London standards the twin bedded room was surprisingly spacious and the bed pillows so comfortable 
5332,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room temperature and debris falling from the air conditioning , The way we were checked in by Mariah giving us a good room and making our wedding anniversary so special 
5333,Park Plaza County Hall London, Getting woken twice up by drunken people shouting and hanging around in the corridor at 4am Not what you d expect with security about only sorted it once we called reception Bad night sleep ,No Positive
5334,Park Plaza County Hall London, The traffic was a shambles outside the hotel, This hotel was very nice a great location near Westminster Bridge for city access The breakfast was very good A bonus was the free laundry for guests which was great after 2 weeks on the road The concierge was very friendly helpful as were the baggage guys on the front door 
5335,Park Plaza County Hall London, There were no actual shops nearby I like to step out on the street and have things to look at We had to taxi to the main centre of London, We didnt like our first room It was too dark but for more money we got shifted to a bigger room with great light We had continual problems with the tv volume Everytime we turnef it on we had to call maintenance to fix the volume That was annoying The buffet breakfast was excellent but room service meal terrible They refunded our meal though 
5336,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room was a little hot during the night even with the air con turned right up as no windows that could open in the room, Ideal location just a stones through from Waterloo Station Clean rooms beautiful bathroom Kettle fridge sink which was handy and iron ironing board in the room which was nice Two TV s was a nice touch so that people in both parts of the room could watch TV Comfortable bed too 
5337,Park Plaza County Hall London, Impersonal , Modern rooms close to nearly tube station and a short walk to the London Eye Great location if you want to be close to tourist hot spots but dont want to stay in a super busy area Clean and suitable rooms 
5338,Park Plaza County Hall London, Each day breakfast we had to ask repeatedly for a spoon for our coffee Sometimes we had to ask several times Even then sometime we never receive it Not impressive Major construction in front of the hotel It was loud with a lot of dirt and dust being thrown into the air Careful you don t get it in your eye or breath too deeply Everything else was good , The staff on duty in the lobby and at the front desk were GREAT 
5339,Park Plaza County Hall London, poor wifi all staff were nice except Ramzi at the bar who was unwelcoming and seemed to hate his job , Nice central location lovely view from our bedroom most staff were very welcoming and nice 
5340,Park Plaza County Hall London, The tv in the bedroom was inset too far into the cubby where only one person can see the tv , I liked the room layout because the bath room kitchen separated the room with the queen size bed and the living room which had a pull out couch that our 19 year old son stayed in 
5341,Park Plaza County Hall London, the images they showed for executive studio city view while booking had a great city view and when i physically saw the room there is this hotel right in front blocking the view It wasn t worth spending the money , The cleanliness of the whole location 
5342,Park Plaza County Hall London, Crowded reception and queues Room 109 room is next to something that makes noise during night which sounds like patio being opened Appalling breakfast grumpy staff queues and restaurant crammed tables too close to each other not big enough for restaurant, Bar staff were attentive and service great
5343,Park Plaza County Hall London, Nothing location was excellent staff were super helpful and their Italian restaurant a had extremely good good at reasonable prices, Extremely clean modern and updated great room set up for a family with two children The double bed is in one room and the kids have a fold out couch in the other 
5344,Park Plaza County Hall London, We couldn t open the curtains in the morning because of the heat The airconditioner did NOT cope Hot I don t know how you could stay there if the weather was actually hot The view from our room was Waterloo Station , The location was great Close to major attractions and transport We enjoyed the breakfasts We heard very little noise from Waterloo Station despite our room overlooking it 
5345,Park Plaza County Hall London, Noisy until 2 am Adults and children talking in the aisles slamming doors and no one from the hotel asked them to be more respectful , Amazing Staff Great customer service Spacious clean and comfortable room 
5346,Park Plaza County Hall London, Cooked breakfast option was dreadful Bacon looked like it was mechanically shredded no rashers just bits Scrambled eggs tasted disgusting Beans were only warm Stuck to the much nicer fresh option Triple room flooded as soon as shower went on Spoke to reception who said she was unable to reduce the bill , Plenty of selection at breakfast Attentive staff 
5347,Park Plaza County Hall London, Too many issues to get sorted with the room Bath plug not working no remote for the T V piece of skirting board kept falling off which had a nail sticking out had to keep asking to get tea and coffee renewed and for the sheets to be changed Staff were very helpful and kept sending people up to sort problems but for what we were paying we expected more There were also a lot of roadworks outside the hotel which meant we didn t use the hotel cafe and it took longer to walk some places , Comfortable bed and a good sized room Able to make hot drinks and having an ice machine in the hallway was a bonus Water and sweets were left for us on arrival Staff dealt with problems with the room quickly Could to see part of the London Eye and Big Ben from the window so we enjoyed the view Laundry room was useful when you have a longer stay 
5348,Park Plaza County Hall London, A bit of construction around the area, Very close to London eye and across the bridge from Big Ben and Westminster abbey A small supermarket nearby and Starbucks Close to Waterloo station
5349,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room wasn t cleaned very well during my stay cups were stained and they left my PJs on the table but despite this the place was quite clean overall , Great room with large size flat screen TV that had you tube videos and TV Excellent staff and consierge service Would come back here again to stay 
5350,Park Plaza County Hall London, Although I wrote through booking com two different request and question to the hotel I never got an answer for the question and for the request only on the day of arrival The breakfast area is very small and though we were lucky and never had to wait but if you arrive around 9am be prepared to wait Some of the waiters are not always on the top of their job had to ask several times to refill eg milk and also came across a bad fruit salad once But overall nothing major and the good intention is there Last thing we were unlucky I guess our room for 3 was on the 2nd floor looking to the train station meaning bad view and WiFi was fairly weak in or room , Superb location starting with London Eye and Westminster Abbey Big Ben and some more within short walking distance Public transportation and train stops also very close Ideal if you don t have much time but want to get as much as possible as tourist Though in the center and recent construction next to hotel but our room was very quiet provided noise cancellation I guess Staff was very friendly and helpful highlighting Magda on reception our cleaning lady Nadia and one member I think Sarah at the breakfast 
5351,Park Plaza County Hall London, Would have appreciated a late check out say 3 00 pm for freshen up prior to train journey , Staff were friendly and very helpful Very impressed that we were afforded an upgrade which was appreciated as we had booked months in advance Buffet breakfast more than adequate and restaurant foyer in evening provided seating and food for guests wanting a smaller meal also staying in hotel Conceirage secured baggage during the day of departure while we were out

5353,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, The location is fantastic for exploring the south bank and walking along the river The room was on the 13th floor so had amazing views of the London Eye Comfortable bed overlooking the views of London 
5354,Park Plaza County Hall London, Not for business travelers I requested a quiet room but was awoken by kitchen preparation resteraunt etc every morning and evening, Nice breakfast Good kitchen staff
5355,Park Plaza County Hall London, Strange layout with toilet in the middle of room with kitchen part and with sliding door didn t have much privacy Breakfast area over crowded and difficult to move around does not seem big enough for size of hotel and food not really fitting of the rest of the hotel, Room size was good and quiet and always cleaned
5356,Park Plaza County Hall London, All in all a great hotel , Perfect location near Westminster Bridge Waterloo Mainline and tube stations and 5 minutes to South bank promenade and the London Eye Close to all sights and facilities We stayed for 8 nights in a large king sized suite with a separate large living room with view of the Shard Also had small kitchen with fridge and microwave Clean comfortable and great for an extended stay Great staff super helpful and has the bonus of a guest laundry with washers and dryers On site restaurant bars and great nearby bistros and restaurants 
5357,Park Plaza County Hall London, Would have preferred a room with a bath the room we were given was fine o list wanted to have a bath after walking so far , Overall hotel was centrally located and close to tourist attractions staff were courteous and helpful With information and very welcoming
5358,Park Plaza County Hall London, I liked everything , The view of the London Eye was amazing especially at night The bed was so comfortable with a puffy duvet and quality linens Breakfast included had a huge buffet with custom omelets 
5359,Park Plaza County Hall London, The hotel like many central London hotels for obvious reasons doesn t have its own car park and the excellent one right next to it that we usually use was closed due to road works and layout changes We found one online at Upper Marsh which had the advantage of booking in advance and has an attendant but it is more expensive and on getting home we found a nail in one tyre and a screw put into another and couldn t think where else it could have happened There are other parking options not too far away particularly if your vehicle doesn t need the high clearance room ours does Will ask the hotel for parking advice in advance next time or fly , Excellent staff who are wonderful with children light spacious rooms with good facilities Excellent central location easy walking distance of many sights two tube stations river boats and tourist buses multiple eating options Westminster Southbank and London Eye all nearby From reservations and reception to housekeeping and room service the staff couldn t have been more helpful or accommodating This is a really good hotel and great for family visits Ours was a special family visit with grandparents parents and four grandchildren two children visiting for the first time and as a birthday treat The reservation and reception teams thanks to Courtney Michaela and I think Sara apologies for any incorrect spelling helped organise rooms with a wonderful view and facilities which made the visit very special for the grandchildren and grown ups The children also enjoyed the glass lift Reception staff were absolutely wonderful Alba was so welcoming and made an instant friend when she gave our grandson a lollipop on arrival and arranged birthday balloons and chocolate cake in the room Being able to arrange breakfast in the room made for a more relaxed start to the day and room service and housekeeping were so efficient and responsive managing to get our breakfast to us when we wanted it even when we forgot to put down the time for one of the rooms making the quietest meal delivery for the babysitters when the children were asleep and restoring order to our chaotic rooms while we were out This is the second time we have stayed at Park Plaza County Hall and given the high quality of the rooms and the excellent customer service we intend to return

5361,Park Plaza County Hall London, Excellent location Very close to the London Eye and the Waterloo train station Unfortunately this 14 floor hotel has 3 very slow elevators Once it took me 10 minutes to reach my room at the 13th floor from the reception With the price they are charging it is simply ridiculous to have such an experience,No Positive
5362,Park Plaza County Hall London, House Keeping should be able to speak and understand english as when i asked for something we coudn t communicate, The bed was very comfortable and was offered an upgrade with an awesome view of the London Eye with an early check in

5364,Park Plaza County Hall London, Couldn t open the windows to the room to let in fresh air and the pillows were too thin which made the sleep difficult, Staff were great and went the extra mile
5365,Park Plaza County Hall London, Receptionist attitude on checking in to be told they didn t have 2 rooms next to each other even though an email had been sent requesting this and a reply received back says no this had been noted and was no problems , Staff in the bar at lunchtime were lovely and the food was very good
5366,Park Plaza County Hall London, I had to make an emergency phone call to Australia and my phone wasn t charging I asked staff they said of course I didn t think to ask of cost They charged me 100 pound for a 10 minute call disgusting , On the whole it was excellent

5369,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast was disorganised and needed more than one chef Queued for a table and breakfast staff seemed stressed and not that helpful No toilet brush in bathroom which could prove unpleasant with people sharing especially children , Room size was good and kitchen facilities were a great addition for drinks etc Great view over London towards the shard and steps from the attractions on the embankment

5372,Park Plaza County Hall London, The hotel was clean and presented very well but the bar area looked like it needed some updating the chairs and carpets were worn , Had a great time in London we were really close to transport if u want a boat trip on the Thames or an open bus trip The underground and train station are close too We did a lot of sightseeing on foot walking to see the sights and even enjoy the parks and open spaces The weather was glorious for our stay so having a walk in a shady tree lined area was good during the hottest part of the day After each busy day we didn t have far to go back to the hotel to get changed and ready for the evening Hopefully will visit again soon 
5373,Park Plaza County Hall London, as above breakfast was expensive an food quality was poor you get better food at school , room had no window it is noisy with staff talking outside the door I feel ripped off
5374,Park Plaza County Hall London, Everything was great I thought we staying across the road which had a pool this one dident, Great hotel would stay again the only odd thing was was seats in the bar area were really old tatty and uncomftable which was really odd as everything else was great 
5375,Park Plaza County Hall London, Service in bar a little slow but that s just looking for a negative really , On arrival room wasn t ready so they swapped our room and gave all 4 of us a complimentary drink Excellent location to explore London Parking was not with hotel but around corner 20 for 24 hours looks rough but perfectly good service 
5376,Park Plaza County Hall London, L italiano restaurant was pretty poor which is a shame because the hotel was wonderful but other than that it was brilliant , I only added a little request in my booking about it being my mums birthday We were overwhelmed with the view the balloons the wine and the card It was one of the best trips to London ever Thank you you made my mother s birthday 
5377,Park Plaza County Hall London, hair dryer doesnt work i can ise just once if you are booked on booking com They will give worst room in hotel my room hasnt got any view bathroom isnt so bad, pillows smells like french fries but bed was so comfortable

5379,Park Plaza County Hall London, We pulled out the sofa bed and used the extra blanket which had a large yellow stain on it and the extra pillows had some stains on the pillow casing , Excellent location Housekeeping was very quick to respond and deliver our requests The night concierge was especially terrific 
5380,Park Plaza County Hall London, Considering the price you ve got to have a room overlooking outside , Great staff esp Mariana receptionist good breakfast and location We were allocated in a very small dark twin room for the first night and asked for a room change next day The new room was comfortable with natural light 
5381,Park Plaza County Hall London, The fact that the shower flooded the bathroom due to the floor being all one level nice idea in principle but in practice it doesn t work well We had to use some of the towels to dry the floor Also a member of the cleaning staff knocked on our door at about 0830 to see if they could get in to clean the room Checkout wasn t until midday and if we had checked out early then this could have been relayed from reception as to what rooms were ready to clean Disturbed a very rare lie in for my wife and I View from the room was to the inner atrium so all you could see were more rooms This was a shame as being on the 13th floor it would have been nice to have an external window, Location was ideal for what we were doing in London thames cruise London dungeons and sea life centre
5382,Park Plaza County Hall London, Couldn t alight in front of the hotel as there was road construction blocking the front entrance, Can extend late check out up till 6pm by paying 10 pounds per hour
5383,Park Plaza County Hall London, We were 3 families and had 3 rooms One of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used The staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room They kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day They just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower They used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay The hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care The hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations They must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required The only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night ,No Positive
5384,Park Plaza County Hall London, Construction near hotel makes it difficult for Taxi to arrive and depart and even walking road is difficult Not a fault of the hotel though I had requested for early check in but room was not ready which forced me to upgrade the room Hotel did not force situation forced me But the upgrade view was good with London eye Big Ben Westminster Abbey all visible from the room window , Excellent location with many major attractions like London Eye Big Ben Parliment houses all at walkable distances 
5385,Park Plaza County Hall London, We wanted to buy a bottle of wine from the bar but they didn t have any that was cold as apparantly fridges were broken , The room we had was for 3 people and it was like a mini apartment with a double bedroom small kitchen area and then the sofa bed set up in the lounge Great value between the 3 of us 
5386,Park Plaza County Hall London, The location of the twin rooms overlooking the inner courtyard very dark and gloomy this made us change to the next category room which was way better,No Positive
5387,Park Plaza County Hall London, Lots of road works going on having to pay for the Internet also breakfast not included in the price expensive but in a good location , In the center of London 
5388,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Staff were so helpful to make the night before and morning of my wedding lovely and stress free From providing a special room with a view to assisting with deliveries of flowers etc everything was great The suite with London eye view was wonderful Thanks to all staff particularly concierge 
5389,Park Plaza County Hall London, The bed was uncomfortable The TV was tucked in the corner of the room Front desk staff was unpleasant , The front desk staff was unfriendly We got a room facing all the construction Asked for a room not facing the street construction Not sure if the lady at the front desk was having a bad day but she gave a tiny room where the TV was tucked in a corner So only one side of th room could see the TV The bed was horribly uncomfortable 
5390,Park Plaza County Hall London, A significant drawback was the sliding glass door of the bathroom which meant that anyone using it during the night woke everyone else up with the noise of the sliding door and the bathroom light lit up the rest of the studio very brightly A proper door would give much better privacy to everyone inside and outside the bathroom , Location and views great Studio itself was lovely with good amenities Soundproofing of the windows was also good 
5391,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room was small for a superior room and poorly lit especially as it was an inside room and overlooked the inside wall of the hotel No view therefore needed better lighting within Restaurant tables were not well laid and had to go searching for cutlery at breakfast , Location was good and within easy walking distance of transport Restaurant was ok and staff were friendly and helpful 
5392,Park Plaza County Hall London, It might have been useful to know there are roadworks ongoing outside the front entrance This didn t affect me as I was at the back but some customers might have been bothered by the noise , The hotel was lovely staff were friendly and helpful I had an amazing room with a sitting area and kitchenette plus large bathroom with bath and shower Plus I was happy to have been allocated a quiet room Brilliant location about 3 minute walk from Waterloo station 
5393,Park Plaza County Hall London, I found that the receptionists although speaking reasonable English were sometimes hard to understand and sometimes it was hard to make them really understand what it was you meant They were however always polite and helpful , being upgraded to a suite It made the hotel visit so much more enjoyable The staff in the dining room were most helpful friendly and welcoming 
5394,Park Plaza County Hall London, house keeping kept the door to the room open after cleaning mattress felt little lumpy elevators take forever to come to the 14th floor esp in the morning maybe good idea to allocate an elevator for the top 3 floors only to avoid the over crowd reception staff are not so friendly even little rude and ignorant , gym was well equipped penthouse was spacious and well designed 
5395,Park Plaza County Hall London, We were there from Friday afternoon until Sunday and our room was not cleaned on the Saturday they did apologise and gave us fresh towels, Everything was perfect especially the Italian restaurant where the food was outstanding Everyone were extremely nice and helpful and I mean everyone 
5396,Park Plaza County Hall London, Hotel italian restaurand had automatic 12 5 tip added Small print bottom of receipt and i also left 5 for 56 meal so they got 12 for delivering 2 main courses Failed to mention when i gave extra money Disappointing, 10 min max walk from waterloo Got bus back to victoria station for airport transfer outside door Had a sick family member and got checking in early and option to upgrade which we gladly accepted for 20 per night
5397,Park Plaza County Hall London, Extractor fan in bathroom was on constantly irratating noise when trying to sleep Room was too hot air con was not working as it should , Convenient location
5398,Park Plaza County Hall London, Dealt with above , Excellent location for The London Eye Royal Festival Hall and South Bank Staff were very helpful as we had a slight incident with our first room and rectified the situation effectively upgraded us Our Junior Suite had a lovely view over County Hall and the London Eye and was very clean 
5399,Park Plaza County Hall London, The only complaint unfortunately was the restaurant area which is nowhere near enough to cater for the number of guests breakfast in particular where the queues at peak times are huge and led to us missing breakfast our second day which we d paid for The warnings are very clear to be fair to avoid peak times but this isn t really the point everyone should be catered for correctly and be able to choose when they want to eat , The whole surroundings of the hotel and in particular the rooms were superbly furnished and catered for The view over the city was outstanding And the location you literally couldn t hand pick a better spot to explore everything in London 
5400,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room which we had was meant to be a family room the bed was fine but the children had a sofa bed which was the noisey as hell any time the kids moved in there sleep If squeaked so much ,No Positive
5401,Park Plaza County Hall London, the bed was not that comfortable and the temperature of the room was very hot even when the gauge was set to low, location of hotel was perfect the staff where very helfull and tended to our ever need 
5402,Park Plaza County Hall London, Food in the bar could have been improved I would have liked more choices for breakfast , Agtha in the breakfast room was extremely nice friendly always had a smile on her face so helpful she impressed us the most 
5403,Park Plaza County Hall London, The bathroom was a wet room but unfortunately when using the shower water spread across the whole of the floor so you could not use the other facilities until it had drained away which took at least half an hour , The excellent dinner in the restaurant 
5404,Park Plaza County Hall London, The drinks were slightly pricey but you have to expect that in London anyway , We upgraded our room as we arrived early and it was only a small extra charge the room was amazing with a great view Staff were really helpful and the location is amazing It s only a 5 minute stroll to the London Eye so you re right in the middle on everything couldn t have asked for more 
5405,Park Plaza County Hall London, Staff at check out were a little inexperienced but always polite and trying their best, Very children focussed welcome pack on arrival vouchers for icecream and drinks at bar 
5406,Park Plaza County Hall London, The promised sauna steam room were not working I phoned the reception they said they were but when I went down they weren t and I wasted half an hour out of a tight schedule needlessly They also didn t respond to my complaint about it Very disappointing , They upgraded my room unrequested and free of charge which i appreciated 
5407,Park Plaza County Hall London, We had a drink in the outside veranda at around 23 00 At 10 00 the following day our empty glasses were still where we had left them and the ashtrays were still overflowing Gives a very poor first impression as this is next to the entrance , Upgraded a standard room to a mini suite for just 20 00 
5408,Park Plaza County Hall London, The biggest thing is the lifts always when to top floor first and make its way down when it got to our level the lift was full most of the time making us wait longer for a lift , Good location with good size rooms 
5409,Park Plaza County Hall London, More space between the door and the bed but that was a very minor issue Road works made walking a bit roundabout but nothing to do with the hotel , The bed was very comfortable and our room very spacious We arrived on an early flight and we re lucky enough to check in early The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing easy access to Waterloo or Westminster stations and close enough to walk to lots of things if you have the time We have stayed here before and would definitely stay again 
5410,Park Plaza County Hall London, See above, My room was excellent in all respects especially the bed tv bath etc I checked in at 7p and I had not realised that my internet booking did not include breakfast and I had to leave the hotel by 6 45am in the morning a Saturday Breakfast room was opening later than usual as it was a Saturday so no breakfast for this 75 year old At the price I paid for the one night 198 a hot something should have been quickly prepared for me or open the kitchen for a quick sustaining breakfast eg Eggs or porridge etc or given me a packed breakfast 
5411,Park Plaza County Hall London, The bed and pillows are very soft which i did not like Also they need a good maintenance for the room facility and i wish if they can change the white lights with yellow lights to get the modern look of the room just an opinion , The room was nice and clean and fully equipped with the essential equipment needed while traveling e g ironing microwave hair dryer etc The hotel is close to London Eye Big Bin 5 10 minutes walking and around 15 25 minutes away from Hyde park and Oxford Street where all the well known shopping shops are Breakfast was fine and the food is delicious 
5412,Park Plaza County Hall London, I felt the bathroom could be a little cleaner Because the chrome in the bathroom was not polished up by that I mean just a wipe over with a micro fibre cloth it made me look closer and the bathroom shower cubicle especially taps ect could of been cleaner it was a shame that something so simple let it down for me , Food was excellent Staff were extremely professional and polite 
5413,Park Plaza County Hall London, smell of drains sewer in bathroom brekfast too crowded tables too close and knocked by people children pushing past hotel not received booking regarding children, location quiet room
5414,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room was a little small and the room window looked at the inside of the hotel, The pillows were lovely and soft and the cleaner was very good at her job
5415,Park Plaza County Hall London, There wasn t anything we did not like this was our 3rd visit to this hotel and it has been great each time we have stayed , Fantastic nights sleep bed was so comfy 
5416,Park Plaza County Hall London, Loads of roadworks around entrance made access on foot tricky Couple of sidelights in room did not work Shower controls a bit of a mystery , Convenience to South Bank attractions and Old Vic theatre
5417,Park Plaza County Hall London, Stayed 4 days with my family for the London Marathon Not a good experience The hotel is always crowded and not relaxing Rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed In the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed Satellite TV always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions The first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true Queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators The queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that I was with my parents who had to wait 15 mins standing before sitting Inaccurate room cleaning One day room was made at 16 00 the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap The next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes The first day they started to knock at the door for service at 8 in the morning with people still in the room Breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel Staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions Location near Waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate Beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street To find some bars Overall this hotel was a terrible choice ,No Positive
5418,Park Plaza County Hall London, We booked the restaurant in evening and when we went to pay we asked if we could split the bill as we were with friends and we had our son so ours was more and we were told it would take to much time and he was to busy to do it and we would have to do it ourselves so we then had to go off to one side and get our phones out to work it out for him We paid a lot to stay there and brought another 2 couples with us and I just felt his attitude was not in keeping with a restaurant and hotel like that and I would think twice about dining there again Other than that the other staff were lovely and helpful especially the concierge who was so friendly and helpful , Fab location lovely rooms most of the staff were very helpful would definitely stay again 
5419,Park Plaza County Hall London, I did not like breakfast at all Except the omletes cooked by chief Restoran for the breakfast very small so creates long waiting list in front of restaurant , Location was perfect Room service was really good Rooms were clean and tidy all the time 
5420,Park Plaza County Hall London, Not happy with the service in the Italian resteraunt very slow Automatic service charge added even though it took over 2 hours for 2 course meal of which the one of the courses was a cold starter People that were seated after us were served preferentially,No Positive
5421,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room is a bit dated The fridge is a bit too small since a large part of it was locked , Great location with close proximity to a number of Tube stations
5422,Park Plaza County Hall London, The double room was very small with two twin beds and very little room Given the price this was not worth it The breakfast was nice but cost additional 20 pounds per person Also requested a 1 hour late check out and was charged an additional 10 pounds per room Seemed unnecessary , Staff was very accommodating in particular a concierge named Gerry He was pleasant kind and generous even loaned his phone adapter to my son We had two rooms upgraded one to a suite which gave us more room and was a big upgrade to a Superior room Location was great for the London Eye and numerous restaurants in the area 
5423,Park Plaza County Hall London, At peak times the queue line for breakfast could be long but either the family room would be open additional seating upstairs or the line would move fairly quickly , The hotel is in a great location with close proximity to Waterloo station It was very easy to get to the hotel from Heathrow Airport via the Heathrow Express and Bakerloo line from Paddington station The staff was very friendly and helpful For a hotel room in Europe the double suite was a good size for a family of four We also had a great view of the London Eye from the 5th floor The children loved their coloring packets and were excited to use their Park Plaza Euros at the bar I would highly recommend this hotel 
5424,Park Plaza County Hall London, I wouldn t recommend this location for travelers with cars as parking is difficult and the London Congestion Charge is prohibitive The breakfast lines were a little long but the staff managed very well and kept everyone happy and the breakfast was good , Extremely friendly and helpful staff Good location for tourists who can walk to many attractions A happy and vibey place to stay 
5425,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room cleaning could be improved , Cables of open lifts causes steady noise clack clack that disturbs at night in some room After a roomchange it was okay 
5426,Park Plaza County Hall London, Upon arrival our superior twin room was very disappointing No external view as requested even though I know not guaranteed Our room which overlooked internal diners was very dark and hot during the night so no other choice except to sleep with the air con on which is not ideal Had it stated upon booking that there was limited rooms with an external view I would not have booked this hotel as for the price you can stay elsewhere that has an external view A nice few days spent in London however would not stay at this hotel again , Good location to Waterloo station 
5427,Park Plaza County Hall London, Very tricky getting a reasonable gluten free breakfast despite putting it in the details and phoning ahead Took 3 attempts to get something and several incorrect rounds of information being given despite a 3 year old being coeliac and waiting patiently for his gluten free food Balcony was lovely but it appeared to be the only one missing outside seating which is a missed opportunity given the view Room was a little tired and worn decor wise but a fab size , Overall I d highly recommend this hotel especially for those coming into Waterloo with a young family Fab upgrade to a penthouse fantastic views and very kind and helpful front desk staff Children made very welcome 
5428,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Upgraded to a studio for 20 per night Great view over the city Excellent location for Westminster the West End and Waterloo station 30 minutes for a great walk along the Embankment into the City of London

5432,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast although nice and plenty of choice was far too expensive cheaper and better choice at local restaurants and bars, View from the site was excellent location to attractions was first class
5433,Park Plaza County Hall London, It took some time for the cleaning service to do the daily cleaning, Good location near the key attractions for the family London Eye Shrek Adventure etc The Italian Restaurant was very good excellent Margarita Pizza and Cheese Cake 
5434,Park Plaza County Hall London, Air conditioning noisy no ventilation room to hot Room service meal only warm Breakfast disappointing queuing for table then table reset as collecting self service meal Selfservice meal warm mushrooms and tomatoes cold , room was ok and ready early
5435,Park Plaza County Hall London, Had to alert maintenance twice on issues which housekeepers should have picked up on and rectified before my arrival Faulty lamp in bedroom and faulty shower head This was POOR Both issues were resolved swiftly and efficiently upon request however Had to alert reception that I was being charged for breakfast on both nights of my stay as my rate quoted was inclusive of breakfast This was POOR , The service reception concierge room service maintenance housekeeping overall was good efficient and friendly Used room service three times The service and food was of a consistently good standard 
5436,Park Plaza County Hall London, I purchased the breakfast package but there was limited seating and a long line for breakfast We ate there twice and it was fine but I was disappointed not to be able to take advantage of something I had paid for , Loved the proximity to transportation and activities 
5437,Park Plaza County Hall London, Strange definition of city view we could only see the rails of waterloo station Poor breakfast service queuing for 45 minutes before gettting a table in a conference room Being obliged to watch children movie on a big screen while having breakfast Poor quality of food especially bread We had to call the reception every day to have a complete towel set ,No Positive
5438,Park Plaza County Hall London, Please clean the windows Since there where so many kids staying at the hotel there should be an entertainment room for them The breakfast room is too small and is a pity that there isn t i a coffee machine , The location The feeling of welcome the staff gave us They were very helpful The family room was very roomy and comfortably Its was very good for us to have a laundry room 
5439,Park Plaza County Hall London, Standing in line each morning for breakfast was poor not enough tables to support hotel Seemed to stand forever waiting on lifts to and from room level Prices in bar where over the top and had the cheek to charge me 12 5 service charge serving me a beer over the bar , Location and price for family room was main attraction 
5440,Park Plaza County Hall London, Warmer welcome would ve been better Appreciate 3 tired dirty but polite workmen walk in to reception may offend But think my money is as good as anyone elses Breakfast was poor especially grey bacon left in bains marie or combi too long Plaza opposite Westminster Bridge much better, Nice clean hotel Comfortable bed 
5441,Park Plaza County Hall London, The breakfast buffet area was too small We were disappointed about no pool , The beds were very comfortable The rooms were lovely The staff were pleasant 
5442,Park Plaza County Hall London, The elevators are so slow and everyone is upset about it Every morning there is a long waiting line for breakfast very frustrating to wait about 20 min for a table , The room was nice 
5443,Park Plaza County Hall London, Overall the stay at Park Plaza County Hall met my expectations The only inconvenience was the lifts It felt like you were waiting quite a while for lifts to call at your floor , The room was small but clean and comfortable The staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast was very good with traditional english breakfast food The hotel was conveniently located near Waterloo train station Westminster via a short walk over Westminster Bridge as well as the London Eye and numerous restaurants coffee shops and pubs The gym facilities were very nice with the added bonus of a sauna and steam room The concierge and bell man services were very helpful and professional 
5444,Park Plaza County Hall London, Parents room quite small no view they were looking into middle of hotel bathrooms could be improved very big step to get over into bath and no lock on bathroom doors , Really nice helpful staff perfect location Family room good for up to family of 4 
5445,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room was probably a bit smaller than expected and the staff were generally very good breakfast area was a bit crowded and the breakfast tables and seats were very close together breakfast service was a bit hap hazard particularly when queueing for eggs, Location of hotel is fantastic particularly small kids who don t want to spend too much time walking we had a great weekend break
5446,Park Plaza County Hall London, one of the hotel stuff ruined our bag by mistake they didnt offer any compensation, very good resturant close to london eye and big ben very comfort with smart tv
5447,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Receptionist from Italy sorry i forgot her name she s very nice to us saying welcome to London and to the property she also upgraded our room with a fantastic view of the Big Ben and Londoneye during our 4 nights stay 
5448,Park Plaza County Hall London, Restaurant is very unexciting and feels a bit like a cafeteria Bar area unexciting too Felt this was a shame as did not encourage use of either , Room gave you privacy whilst accommodating a family and the location with the easy access to Waterloo and the river The view from the room was great 
5449,Park Plaza County Hall London, City view through Waterloo railway not nice at all limited number of adapters available at reception early breakfast recommended or longer waiting time , Comfy room and bed very helpful staff good breakfast near to Waterloo tube bus trains near to Westminster Bridge and London Eye
5450,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Stay was wonderful Staffs were friendly Enjoyed the yummy breakfast especially the scrambled eggs Loved the room and we got upgraded to a bigger room Would definitely come back 
5451,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast was average with some of the food a bit bland Lifts were terrible and expected better but overall a good stay, Location and views from the rooms we had were good
5452,Park Plaza County Hall London, The breakfast option seemed good but we didn t book it as it was too expensive per person Perhaps more pricing options would have encouraged us to take breakfast in the hotel , When we checked in we were given a complimentary upgrade to our room and it was amazing The staff were friendly welcoming and helpful nothing was too much trouble for them 
5453,Park Plaza County Hall London, the breakfast is so basic for its price The food assortment is very limited for the price of 20 pounds I can go and have much better breakfast in the cafe I also recommend to come earlier for the breakfast because the restaurant is not big and possibly you will have to wait for the table, good location and big room number you also have the little kitchen in the room
5454,Park Plaza County Hall London, there was no welcome water bottled at the room and there was no black tea in the mini bar the TV is located in one side and it hard to watch TV from the other bed side , Location of the hotel is very good and the kids gift is a nice idea specially the park plaza money 
5455,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room 1024 and the filthy windows which were so dirty you couldn t see out of them Staff were happy to show us alternatives but perhaps it would be better to employ a window cleaner , Impossible not to like this hotel Great staff super breakfast which is free for kids and even cheaper if you pre book at check in We also used room service who provided a delicious supper at sensible prices The staff even prepared a lovely little chocolate cake for our daughter s birthday with a signed card a great little detail We were initially booked into room 1024 which faces onto the Westminster Plaza dark and dank plus the windows were so dirty you couldn t see out of them To be fair the staff were very flexible and offered us a tour of alternative rooms We decided on a junior suite room 1027 which looked out on Big Ben County Hall and the Eye It did cost 20 more but if you re doing this trip just once go for it Worth noting that the traffic here isn t too busy at night and a taxi back is not too expensive 
5456,Park Plaza County Hall London, We were able to hear our neighbours which was a bit offputting Also we could hear the restaurant noise as it was directly below us We didn t take advantage of the breakfast which we were glad of as the queue for breakfast was very long at 8 30 am , The hotel was in an excellent location 5 mins walk to London Eye and Westminster Bridge The staff were very helpful we even received an upgraded room as our allotted room was not ready Everything was just as I expected from a large chain hotel The room was clean and well stocked and the shower in the bathroom was amazing 
5457,Park Plaza County Hall London, Wardrobe inside light was not going off when closing the doors so was lit all night Poor views from our room though just used it for overnight mostly WIFI poor speed , Housekeeping excellent Two TVs good thinking 
5458,Park Plaza County Hall London, Rooms were sometimes not made during the day Restaurant was not big enough to cope with breakfast, Location makes this a clear choice Was easy to get to and close to the attractions and inner city
5459,Park Plaza County Hall London, This room was not worth 200 night I believe that the Premier Inn adjacent to this hotel would have offered a more comfortable room with better bathroom facilities The amount of space around the bed offered little chance of decent movement around the room The wardrobe was inadequate in size to offer enough clothing storage space for 2 room guests The bathroom sliding glass door could only be fully closed using great force is liable to break should a strong young man use such force In this case it could result in that person sustaining injury I would suggest that you use this tiny room as a storeroom ,No Positive
5460,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room cleaning was great when they did it But there were a couple days we came back from being gone all day and they hadn t gotten to our room yet Not a big deal but worth mentioning, Breakfast was definitely one of the best parts of this hotel To be able to get up in the morning with two kids and have a full breakfast made was invaluable My kids could not get enough of Agatha one of the breakfast hosts she was fantastic Which made the mornings a breeze 
5461,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, location is the best of all 3min walk to westminster bridge Super helpful staff proper modern star hotel better value than the Park Plaza Hotel opposite to it 
5462,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast could have been better coffee was very poor on the 3 mornings , Location room was lovely and staff were very nice Hotel was clean and restaurant had reasonably priced menu Security was good too as they asked for room card at night Overall it is s lovely hotel and would recommend to friends and family visiting London 
5463,Park Plaza County Hall London, Some of the bathroom towels were frayed and worn looking , We had a complimentary upgrade to a penthouse room which was lovely Having said that I always find the rooms very clean and quiet 
5464,Park Plaza County Hall London, The cost was a bit too expensive but considering the location I ll make an exception The noise of people opening and closing doors was immense Also the sound of water running through the pipes from upstairs was very loud It was evident everytime someone flushed the toilet The sound proofing needs a bit of work to say the least Lack of USB chargers in a modern hotel is questionable , The location was perfect The hotel was clean and modern looking The staff was friendly 
5465,Park Plaza County Hall London, The fact that you couldnt open the windows unless you was on pent house level was misleading I did not like this at all THe temperature in the room was constantly boiling even if heater was off I asked to move room and turned out I couldnt as none of them have windows Not good , The little kitchen in the room 
5466,Park Plaza County Hall London, Reception for my mobile phone, The room was exceedingly comfortable very very clean much better than some London 5 star rooms very impressed one tiny problem was I had zero connection to my phone breakfast was excellent price very good I will definitely stay again as the hotel is perfectly situated for the heart of London 
5467,Park Plaza County Hall London, A picture is worth a thousand words Added photos are not taken from a construction site this is central London and what you see through your window if you can after paying about 200euros per night in a 4 star hotel not like the amazing photos on the website right Needless to say the view is accompanied by construction noises starting at 7 30 am in the working days Sure they do have double glazed glasses but I am a very light sleeper and requested an upper storey room for this reason in my reservation Seems no one reads or cares what is written there In the room there was no coffee machine as declared on the booking com website the hot water pressure was so low that a quick shower took ages Housekeepers knocked our door two times by mistake as they thought we need additional sheets or a sofa bed After all yes the room was clean excluding the muddy windows and spacious but the rest was enough to ruin our anniversary We will never step in Park Plaza again even if it is the only hotel in town and I will make sure that this outstanding quality will be seen and known by as many as other people so that same cannot happen to them , The best thing was the location of the hotel
5468,Park Plaza County Hall London, We had an internal view quite disconcerting Would have requested to change it had we stayed longer, Fantastic central location Came into Waterloo and walked from the hotel everywhere We arrived early but were still able to check in which was a bonus and facilitated changing shoes and using the bathroom Good breakfast
5469,Park Plaza County Hall London, It was very very pricey to stay here The breakfast on day 2 had a long line and it did not seem that they had an organized plan to seat people for breakfast , The location is great and the property is modern clean and comfortable The Italian restaurant was fantastic and the wait staff was very attentive The breakfasts were plentiful and delicious The bar at night stayed open late and we had a great time 
5470,Park Plaza County Hall London, I wish the staff could speak better English I found it very difficult at times to be understood and for them to understand me and the food and everything was nice but the service could have been faster I m not sure why waiting staff didn t think to come back after they ve dropped your meal to see if you would like something else or tea coffee dessert etc A small thing but annoying , It is really well located and a very nice hotel The facilities are good and bed comfortable and the room pretty quiet for London The restaurant and food were excellent and pretty good value As a lone traveller I felt very safe and comfortable there 
5471,Park Plaza County Hall London, Because we stayed six days and ate the breakfast on site every day because we paid for the included breakfast it would have been nice if they had changed up the menu from one day to the next It would have been really great if they had offered French Toast pancakes or waffles sigh But that said we had no problem with being seated right away as some reviewers have And the food was fresh and hot with plenty available , We stayed in an executive suite and it was very nice Water pressure was great in the shower a big plus in my book and the sofa bed was very comfortable Also the property was very clean and every staff member we had contact with was friendly and helpful Great stay overall I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the Westminster area and or plans to do much day tripping as Waterloo Station will connect you with just about anywhere you want to go 
5472,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room size was smalle the temperature in room very hot there is no buses or tubes stations neer from hotel The waterloo station 10min walking from the hotel The hotel doesn t provide room dining 24 hours and just one restaurant in the hotel which is italian restaurant , The room was clean The staff were very friendly The laundry service was good but expensive
5473,Park Plaza County Hall London, The rooms was not big enough for 2 or 3 persons We asked for 3 beds but did only get 1 bed and 1 crap sofa The WC dosen t have a proper door so there is no privacy ,No Positive
5474,Park Plaza County Hall London, Hard to find anything wrong My single room was tiny but this is normal for Central London , Very high levels of service met at check in with a hot towel and a fruit drink and had my bags carried to my room Super friendly and polite staff Good value at 162 actually cheaper than the nearest Premier Inn that night 
5475,Park Plaza County Hall London, HD TV was confusing and I am not convinced was working properly That is ITV1 continually showed a Sky trailer I could not get any ITV1 programs TV guide was also not working , Room layout was highly original and excellent Breakfast 
5476,Park Plaza County Hall London, The shower didn t work and wasn t looked at until the 2nd evening of our 2 night stay after we spoke to reception the afternoon of our day of arrival the following morning and afternoon The room was incredibly hot despite also informing reception of this on the 3 occasions we complained about the shower We were told the room temperature was controlled by computer and that it would be adjusted This was never done I was also given a discount card and told I could use this for a 5 discount on the hotel bar and restaurants When I purchased a rum and ginger at the bar I was told this discount was for soft drinks only and charged the full 9 90 for my drink that s not a typo it was nearly 10 , The location was good for access to attractions and central London all in walking distance
5477,Park Plaza County Hall London, Nothing , Great service friendly staff and perfect location We were lucky enough to have the room upgraded and so it simply could t have been better 
5478,Park Plaza County Hall London, 1 Frontdesk is soso I asked for an adampter wehn I checked in and was told I have to come tomorrow morning 9 00am When I came eary in the following moring they said it is first come first get and dont have any So I have to buy one in B1 Suggest the hotel to tell the client clearly what you can help and if you can t let us know as well 2 The price is higher compared with its service , The location is excellent 5 10 minutes walk to Waterloo station and can walk to many famous places such as Big Ben London eye Hyde park Buckingham palace Britis Museum etc 
5479,Park Plaza County Hall London, The underground Waterloo is very busy between 8 30 9 00 am we had to wait for six trains before we could ride along in a cart stuck like sardines in a can We arrived at the wrong chain reception showed us no smile at all didnt appoligized that we are at the wrong location She just did not care at all But this is the case in all London hotels I ve noticed Specially with the east European staff members Their accent showed through The sighing especially so rude Spending 200 a night should not give this service at all most annoying point was that we mentioned that we want a business invoice and mentioned it on booking com but they refuse to give us ons Only after consulting the manager we were granted what we wanted As a business traveler this is not convenient and very time consuming and annoying , Location was great but hidden behind their big brother from the same chain The restaurant served excellent food for reasonable prices The reception gave us discount coupons and upon their recomm we ate their Room were soundproof so we could have all the piece to study for an exam Big Ben at walking distance Great view from the hotel 
5480,Park Plaza County Hall London, Our superior twin room was small and dark overlooking a narrow internal courtyard which meant that we had to have the light on at all times of day Not very comfortable and not good value ,No Positive
5481,Park Plaza County Hall London, I requested a higher floor room but assigned a 1st floor room In the room the door s inside key was broken so could not lock The bed was terribly hard and I had a backache next day , Location
5482,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, If you are looking for sightseeing this is the place to stay as everything is close to this hotel The couch became a double bed while we had a king size double bed as well When we walked in everyone was open and started complimenting me and my friends 
5483,Park Plaza County Hall London, The airconditioner was warm and I found out just on the last night when I asked for a fan that the temps can be dropped by the staff It would have been nice to know that is advance pre authorization on your CC is needed in advance if u want to order room service Should be part of the initial CC pre authorization I shouldn t be paying each time I order something , Nice touristic location close to Wesminister and Big Ben Walking distance to London eye and many attractions Waterloo station is a 5 min walk and is serviced by a good bus network There is also a Starbucks for coffee lovers 2 minutes away 
5484,Park Plaza County Hall London, Not much to complain about perhaps the price but then again given the position , Position is hard to beat slap bang in the middle of the city a 2min walk to the London Eye Really good place

5497,Park Plaza County Hall London, Didn t like coming home because had a great time , Liked hotel staff location room cleanliness view and the general simplicity and helpful support you need when travelling as a family 
5498,Park Plaza County Hall London, Valet parking should be cheaper hourly rates which then would create more business UK needs to adopt free valet parking and get away from the system what is deemed as luxurious and get with the times , Concierge absolutely helpful excellent customer service
5499,Park Plaza County Hall London, A solid door on the in room bathroom instead of a sliding frosted glass door Had to pay for wifi , Hotel was close to the London Eye Westminster Bridge Parliament Building Big Ben Clock tower

5533,Park Plaza County Hall London, Lack of parking mitigated by valet service which however costs 45 for 24 hours which might put off some people , Travelling to London was stressful as I had never driven into London before however it was not as difficult as I had anticipated it was easy to pull up at the hotel and park temporarily it is unfortunate to know that the hotel does not have parking on site this was however this was mitigated by the hotel having valet service which was excellently efficient however left me out of pocket to the tune of 45 however this was still cheaper and less stressful than using public transport The hotel itself was beautiful the accommodation we had was tastefully decorated you could see a lot of thought and investment was put into it the bed was comfortable i m sad to say it was better than our own for a fantastic experience I would recommend the last floor 14th the views were fantastic from the balcony The staff were excellent you could tell they didn t just pluck anyone from the streets give them a 10 minute induction and let them loose they were very knowledgeable and eager to help without being intrusive I can t comment on their food as we didn t eat there there is plenty of restaurants around though can t rate them though as we only used one which was actually good The sites nearby were excellent which was the main reason for our trip The london Eye Parliarment Big Ben London Dungeons amongst others were all within a very short walking distance away others could easily be reached either by train or buses All in all I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone 
5534,Park Plaza County Hall London, Lack of extra pillows Our room smelt when we first went into it wasn t pleasant We waited 15 minutes for a lift and ended up taking the stairs Our room keys kept failing to let us in our room we must of had them re programmed 4 times When we returned to our room about 11pm there were children playing football in the lift area near the restaurant which I thought was really bad as no staff seemed to be stopping them I requested early book in but was not given this although they stored our bags for us which helped I wouldn t stop here again for money we paid , The bed was really comfy The location was great 
5535,Park Plaza County Hall London, Nothing It was all good , The staff were very welcoming and helpful The room was great it was very comfortable and clean The restaurant was excellent and we throughly enjoyed out meal there The location is fantastic for seeing a large area of Central London by foot but is equally great for access to the tube at Westminster

5541,Park Plaza County Hall London, I was in room 1224 I think and the elevator outside clicks and clocks like a gun every 5 10 minutes But shabby to be honest I don t like gun s I am comparing your hotel to the park plaza Victoria in Amsterdam That hotel is top banana , It s a nice hotel

5546,Park Plaza County Hall London, Everything else I booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week The stay was for myself and my parents I havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before I get married Firstly booking com has advertised the room I was booking with a picture of the room with a view to London Eye or Big Ben Did we get that view Not at all And we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door My mom is disabled so I went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect So they changed our room to a Junior Suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station I have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to Big ben or London eye which they said is not their fault and theres the Shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the Shard is in the city this is the City view You can say that pretty much about anything I appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until I realised that the Spa bookings I have made for myself and my mother have not been made Complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay There were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof I have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes The next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again I have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life , The location is good but you would expect that for this sort of money anyway

5548,Park Plaza County Hall London, Found the bed for the children very uncomfortable it was a pull out sofa bed Unfortunately they didn t sleep very well We had a studio room with a different layout on this occasion the rooms were only partitioned with a desk and pillar rather than the bathroom which makes it more practical so it wasn t as seperate as we would have liked and as easy for them to get to sleep unless we turned our lights off too might be worth requesting this with the hotel , Lovely clean room fantastic location which is why we book here very good for the tube clipper to reach all the attractions London has to offer Usually had a great experience but didn t match previous visits here this one was our third 
5549,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, We had an excellent stay at Park Plaza County Hall Reception and concierge staff were very polite and helpful We will definately try to stay here on our next break in London 
5550,Park Plaza County Hall London, The fact that the restaurant shows you special deals but they don t actually offer it you I found the room freezing even after turning air con off and switched to warm and the fact that I paid extra to have breakfast in bed and they only brought my husbands breakfast and forgot my porridge and only came back to say they had forgotten it as we was about to check out so I paid for breakfast as a package and then extra for room service and never recieved it and never got a refund , I liked the friendly staff warm welcome and beautiful clean rooms
5551,Park Plaza County Hall London, The key cards weren t that great found ourself standing there for ages to try and get in to our room also the room was very hot Even with the aircon on lowest temp so didn t sleep that great, The hotel room was beautiful nice and clean and felt homely Staff were friendly and was easily laid out so could find everything wish we had more time to get the full use of what they had to offer because it sounded amazing

5557,Park Plaza County Hall London, Useless staff in Bar We had to ask five times if we could order drinks Each time they said they would take our order at our table The final time we insisted they took our order at the Bar but still no one made any effort to organise drinks It wasn t busy I have no idea why the four staff were unable to provide an adequate service It was bizarre , Helpful check in staff at Reception 
5558,Park Plaza County Hall London, Your staff did not know where to pool is and instructed me to visit the neighboring park plaza building to be humiliated when I asking if I have my room card and if I am a resident The talk continued for 10 minutes where every service which I originally came for was not available Hence this hotel although modern and pricy is nothing more than a unorganized scam But good job you took my money you are good capitalists,No Positive

5623,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, We love the Park Plaza County Hall because it is so convenient to everything London It is close to Parliament Westminster Abbey and the Eye We love the close pubs and restaurants The train station is two blocks away 
5624,Park Plaza County Hall London, When we booked hotel back in Jan 16 we requested room with a view of London eye In November had email to say our room did not have a view We could upgrade for 300 a night Unfortunately we could not cancel booking without loosing full amount So we had no choice We were on Level 4 and waited on average 20 30 minutes for 1 of 4 lifts Really bad On arrival we were offered Breakfast at an additional cost which we agreed on First morning there was a que of about 45 minutes for a seat in the dining room Not what I would have expected for this class of hotel , The beds and pillows were comfortable Tea and coffee facilities in room 
5625,Park Plaza County Hall London, That fact I booked a penthouse suite for New Year s Eve on the basis we had a view of the London eye based on the images used booking com On arrival we were advised that our room was south facing meaning we had no view of the fireworks what so ever, View was exceptional
5626,Park Plaza County Hall London, There seems to be some miscommunication between this hotel and Booking com We arrived on Christmas day and the hotel was fully booked Upon arrival it turned out that we were allocated two rooms on two separate floors even though I specifically indicated we require either a suite or two connected rooms as we have four little children I even received an email confirmation from the hotel s reservation center for this The staff at the front desk was super very nice and they did their best to solve the issue Eventually they upgraded us to a penthouse at the 14th floor which was great The troubles continued the next day and every day thereafter as my booking for breakfast did not go through either and they had to charge me for each breakfast , Overall we had a very good experience The location is quite good 2 min walk from the London eye across the bridge from Big Ben it is very clean and comfortable The staff is very friendly and helpful They literally saved our trip see the cons part Bottom line Very good experience
5627,Park Plaza County Hall London, Ridiculously overpriced Couldn t cont them on phone number on their website or booking com booking page Staff unfriendly and unhelpful Included breakfast was basic boring and cold Bathroom temperature always set to very high temperature Laundry facilities inadequate we re traveling g for 2 months There for a week and housekeeping room maintenance worse each day Bed not made properly Dirty cups and room service tray left in room plus rubbish Would not recommend this hotel to anyone Email I sent still unanswered , Well promoted Looked ideal as our chosen location for watching NYE London fireworks Short walk from Waterloo Station 
5628,Park Plaza County Hall London, Management is arrogant and unhelpfull Breakfast queues of half an hour way to small restaurant for busy times prebooked and confirmed room not there Reception is eager to add costs ,No Positive
5629,Park Plaza County Hall London, Our check in was delayed 3times as the room wasn t ready the room was small and incredibly bad value for money we have stayed in many London hotels and this is by far the worst the bar was cold due to being located by the front door breakfast was farcical after queuing to get a table on the first day we had no plates out only some cold Sausages available with uncooked tomatoes and warm beans the staff seemed very disinterested in general The friends we were staying with complained and we got the grand compensation of 4 bottles of water from our mini bar reduced from our bill This experience also makes me question the value of using booking com as for over 300 per night we could have booked direct with other far better hotels ,No Positive
5630,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Perfect location a few walking minutes away from London Eye super friendly and competent staff amazing massage good food definitely worth a stay 
5631,Park Plaza County Hall London, Looks like rooms are not cleaned properly We stayed for four nights On the first evening my son unpacked a book and threw packaging under the bed which I noticed later The teared packaging has not been picked up until we were leaving and I saw it and threw away Not a great evidence of cleaning service , Good location friendly staff 
5632,Park Plaza County Hall London, Overpriced hotel Rude check in staff and customer relations Long queue for breakfast area was too small for the amount of people Bar staff put in doubles when didn t ask for them so were charged twice the price Will NEVER stay here again BVooking com need to remove this hotel from their website as it is one of the worst i have ever stayed at , Location
5633,Park Plaza County Hall London, Restaurant too small for a full hotel eating breakfast We weren t prepared to wait and went elsewhere Sofa bed a little uncomfortable, Location was great for London Eye etc Good sized room Kitchen facility and view great Staff friendly and nothing too much bother Food in the restaurant was nice when we went for dinner and waiting staff particularly good Would definitely return 
5634,Park Plaza County Hall London, My 4th but now final stay at the Park Plaza County Hall What has previously been a fine hotel has descended below all expectations 4 night stay in a Studio King Family with plenty of issues 1 Studio King is a lie there is no king bed and reception cheerfully laughed off my complaint on the first day that this was a mis representation 2 Lifts during high occupancy average morning wait on the first floor 10 15mins The lift simply prioritises higher floors every time Yes there are stairs but with a 7 month pregnant wife I shouldn t have to rely on them 3 Breakfast again during high occupancy a disgrace 10 15 mins average wait for a table 4 Temperature control in the room does not work bedroom was a sauna whilst living area was cool 5 Shower Water pressure poor and shower head not properly cleaned with lots of outlets blocked with scum 6 Concierge on checking out did not help with luggage from room despite request link this to pregnant wife and useless lifts after waiting 15 mins I had to carry luggage down stairs with multiple trips as my waiting airport transfer was charging for exceeding permitted waiting time 7 Lobby bar is a nice area providing good value and options of f b but suffered from being too close to the entrance and so was very cold with a constant breeze from people coming and going from the hotel All in all an absolute joke yes I understand hotels struggle during high occupancy but this was simply unacceptable at the rate charged and service expectation What was my go to Central London hotel is now a NEVER AGAIN hotel , Not much to like
5635,Park Plaza County Hall London, The windows didnt open as a result there wasnt enough fresh air into the room and all the smells were kept inside It was extremely hot and there was no way to regulate the air temperature i had to ask twice to switch the heat off at the reception The no of lifts was not enough for all the visitors nor was the no of emploees at the reseption desk Room service food was low quality and very expensive Our room wasnt cleaned every day and the sheets as well The sofa bed for the kids was not confortable we asked for a room in the upper floors with view but we got one in the 4th the hotel has 14 16 floors with no view at all ,No Positive
5636,Park Plaza County Hall London, Beds and pillows were a little hard and the glass sliding door on the toilet offered little privacy should you need it , hotel is in a great location for london eye and southbank rooms are well designed but bed a little hard Hotel staff set up sofa bed for our kids to share which was a nice touch Breakfast was really good too would definitely stay again 
5637,Park Plaza County Hall London, We had to queue for breakfast It was worth the wait but not what we expected , Plenty of room with seprate lounge are where the children slept The children were given money to get drinks ice cream and chocolate from the bar area 
5638,Park Plaza County Hall London, Most disappointed in the heating system as was unable to turn it up and as we would like to have done to complain at least until occasions we were to Cold most of the time the air conditioning unit would only blow cold and not hot , The mini kitchen bar
5639,Park Plaza County Hall London, It is difficult to work the heater in the room It was a cold week , We love the staff They are always kind and helpful Also we love the location We feel we can go anywhere we want in London from this location 
5640,Park Plaza County Hall London, Restaurant seems to be understaffed so service was quite slow Too many new employees probably due to Christmas and they could not answer to questions and provide much help , Good location very clean and nest facility 
5641,Park Plaza County Hall London, Unfortunately we did have a slight problem with the ac the thermostat would not work from the room so I had to call front desk and they would control it To be fair they did also send an electric heater to keep the room warm , I really liked the studio king room plenty of space for a family of four Really clean benefitting from a kitchen area with kettle microwave cups and plates etc I like the fact there was a shower and bathtub 
5642,Park Plaza County Hall London, Some things were in urgent need of repair and attention such as the loose fittings on the shower unit and a corner of the bathroom false wall was breaking away , The service was excellent The breakfast was good fresh and plentiful 
5643,Park Plaza County Hall London, Dining room is too small for the amount of guests we had to wait longtime before we could sit down Breakfast also needs more variaton , Good clean and comfortable rooms Great location 
5644,Park Plaza County Hall London, No kettle in the room even though there were tea making facilities I borrowed one from my daughter in the room next door , Good location and valet parking
5645,Park Plaza County Hall London, That the hotel is not the one in the photos but the one across the road with a view of a wall Not 4 , The staff went out of their way to help by giving us an upgrade to a room with a view 
5646,Park Plaza County Hall London, We noticed that the front door of the hotel lets in a lot of cold air you can even feel it in the bar Other than that this hotel is perfect , The staff were attentive professional and so happy Especially Valentina and Atila I hope I remembered their names correctly The Christmas decorating was beautiful 
5647,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Loved this hotel great location close to the Westminster Bridge and overlooking Big Ben and the Houses of Parlament Very central location for a London base 
5648,Park Plaza County Hall London, Sadly there was no hot water as the boiler had broken but they were working to fix it and did give us a complimentry breakfast, Beds very comfy staff very friendly and helpful
5649,Park Plaza County Hall London, The suite was cold The heating was not working it could not be turned up in December , Excellent breakfast I was very pleased to get Eggs Bennedict Excellent Italian food for lunch Lovely suite Friendly helpful staff 
5650,Park Plaza County Hall London, breakfast at 19 50 was disappointing I had room service and food was cold Vegetarian sausages were just veg fingers and not appetising first thing in the morning I suggest quorn or Cauldron sausages Tomatoes not cooked and toast very pale and cold and the Danish pastry was missing Not enough milks sugars for day , bed was amazing great nights sleep Warm room quiet and clean Shower fab Julia at front desk was extremely helpful kind Foyer is welcoming but waiting to be seen at checking in was very hit miss hard to know where to stand 
5651,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room wasn t ready at check in when we really needed a rest We were given a free drink at the bar though which went some way to compensate , Great location spacious studio room with a fab view of the London Eye an unexpected bonus 
5652,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room had not been made up when we had gone out for the day even thou we told reception we were going out for the day the bath tap shot water out from the side of the filler all over the toilet seat and up the wall the plug in the sink did not work and the shower head water came out from above the shower head it self all got fixed but not the bath filler as found this out on last night taking a bath but did report it so others staying did not have the same problem as we did , staff happy to help very friendly 
5653,Park Plaza County Hall London, For a four star hotel the breakfast was not great and barely better than Premier Inn Watery egg mass produced sausages horrible coffee and fruit juice , Very friendly and helpful staff very comfortable and quiet room 
5654,Park Plaza County Hall London, We were in a studio adjacent to the atrium Whenever the elevators go up or down there s a loud clanging noise The bedroom is near the door right at the atrium It s not a continuous sound so earplugs were necessary On the second day when checking out I asked if one of the hotel staff would spend the night in our room 702 I believe so they could hear for themselves We got complimentary drinks because of our complaint but the first time we complained no action was taken With the extra topper mattress the bed was reasonably comfortable Beware of the metal leg of the sofabed when folded out , The staff was very friendly Cesar at the door arranged for a topper mattress for the sofabed When we got back to the room later all had been taken care of The studio had a little kitchen glasses and cups nice for making a cup of tea in the morning and for a drink at night The location was great close to the London Eye Starbucks and Waterloo Station was only a 12 minute walk 
5655,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, We booked this last minute and were not disappointed Excellent location and nicely appointed rooms kids packs were a nice touch and housekeeping delivered extra conditioner within 3 minutes when requested 
5656,Park Plaza County Hall London, Booked a family room No a c heating working 2 small children Moved room supposedly an Upgrade same problem told by the manager it s because the room has a lot of glass Spent the night in a cold bedroom Not enough towels and poor attention to customer needs A very very disappointing stay will be writing to their head office I still had to pay , Good check in 
5657,Park Plaza County Hall London, Rainwater shower head sprayed and leaked over bathroom floor it was swimming in water and had to be mopped up with towel , Quiet room slept very well 
5658,Park Plaza County Hall London, Although it was the weekend before Christmas it was still a lot of money for the 1 night but my choice and I accept that , Staff are always lovely cannot do enough to help 
5659,Park Plaza County Hall London, The bed just not very comfortable noise in the room at night from pipe work lifts and toilet extract which was off but you could still hear it running somewhere in the building, Smart room really nice
5660,Park Plaza County Hall London, Dreadful wifi connection Don t get a room on the corridor as the lifts are very noisy ask for a corner room, Useful things in the room iron ironing board microwave kettle a whole set of crockery for 4 Hairdryer safe and fridge The most amazing view of the city especially at night Fabulous breakfast
5661,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, We visited to celebrate my mother s birthday I emailed the hotel beforehand about this and was delighted to find my mother had been upgraded to a suite with great views over Waterloo and the Shard There was also a card a bottle of red wine and some chocolates in her room to mark the occasion The reception staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and there were plenty of staff around in the dining room at breakfast to clear tables etc The location of the hotel is excellent We caught the river boat from Westminster Pier just across the river to Greenwich which was a really relaxing way to travel Also visited the View from the Shard which is 2 tube stops away There are plenty of restaurants nearby Thank you very much to the hotel staff for a great stay 
5662,Park Plaza County Hall London, My only downfall is that the rooms that look inside the hotel instead of outside veiw are not the good no natural sunlight cannot feel the morning, I liked everything how the staff are welcoming and make you feel like home with their lovely spirit i like the location the pent house is amazing
5663,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Comfy duvet spacious studio Ideal for up to 4 adults great view of the London eye and a special message on the window written for my birthday wishes and a bottle of wine balloons Front reception staff were very welcoming and professional 
5664,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, The whole place including staff were so extremely lovely and helpful and just generally amazing There isn t one thing I can say against the place Brilliant 
5665,Park Plaza County Hall London, Twin room but beds joined together Moved beds apart but revealed torn carpet and bare concrete Bathroom fittings loose and worn Breakfast expensive at 16 95 per person , Good location a neat and tidy hotel Friendly staff Room comfortable but could be much better Italian restaurant good value 
5666,Park Plaza County Hall London, The view from our window was over the breakfast restaurant This rendered the room windowless like a prison There was NO milk and insufficient coffee for the morning brew The mini bar was locked we clearly can t be trusted then There were so many lights one of them above the mini bar we simply couldn t find the switch for so we covered it up Breakfast was overpriced I know London is a tourist trap but a fixed cost is stupid why not charge a lower price for coffee and a croissant that is usually all most people want at that time of the morning , It was perfectly located in the heart of the capital Room was compact and clean 
5667,Park Plaza County Hall London, Absolutely nothing, Free upgrade given to a junior suite on arrival Junior suite had all necessary facilities and more as well as amazing view of London eye from the bedroom and living area Staff could not do enough to help you Breakfast was very good and catered for all tastes 
5668,Park Plaza County Hall London, We have come here previously and everything was so perfect that we even decided to stay an extra night so was slightly disappointed with this experience When checking in the staff seems very stressed and busy which made us feel in the way some of the time after waiting for 5 10 minutes to talk to the receptionist we was told we had to wait until 3pm just to check in so was told to come back later so me and my 6 month pregnant girlfriend had to walk around for an hour then return just to get into the room to relax which was the purpose of the trip When we checked in I was asked if I wanted to swipe my card to be used for room service which I did but was charged 25 just for doing so When I asked about this she said it was for the extras but soon found out nothing was included Also we ordered two pizzas which turned up burnt and in the morning the full English breakfast we paid 24 for didn t even have bacon The shower door let out so much water we had to lay down towls to stop flooding In the room there are huge windows which normally would be lovely to look over London but on this occasion our view was the Waterloo train station so spend most of our trip with curtains closed Finally when we was getting ready to check out at 11 50 we had staff knocking at the door asking how long we could be then at 12 05 we had a very pushy woman asking how long we would be as well and with a pregnant woman it takes a while to do that And when it came to checking out we was waiting around 10 minutes just to do so It s very disappointing because me and my girlfriend was very much looking forward to this little get away and now I feel like iv wasted my money and should of went somewhere else I will consider returning in the future but on my trip to London it definitely won t be at this resort , Everything looked very nice and clean close to London Eye nice for couples
5669,Park Plaza County Hall London, Attitude of staff The Spa is hurrendows with only 3 lockers unisex changing facilities and sauna steam room only enough for 2 fully grown adults , The staff are exceedingly lazy rude Telling us that if we wanted a cup of hot water then to go to our room and boil the kettle 
5670,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room was cold and the A C s heating did not work Breakfast was boring and did not have anything extra only what is necessary You would expect a little more effort from a four star establishment Also breakfast was poorly coordinated and there was always a waiting before seated , Pillows were superb and the room was quiet Also the location in excellent 
5671,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, The staff were all so friendly and helpful The room service menu was delicious with excellent range of items and speedy service The room itself was modern clean quiet and had stunning views of London 
5672,Park Plaza County Hall London, Queuing for breakfast is not what I like Breakfast not ready at 8 15 shouldn t be Scrambled eggs not eatable I prefer a fresh served coffee or espresso , One of the two beds was comfy Nice view 
5673,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast could have been a little better quite busy had to queue but they coped well Pillows not quite to my taste but I am very fussy , Staff friendly and helpful nice room liked the kitchenette got upgraded to studio great location Clean 
5674,Park Plaza County Hall London, breakfast area was too small and very cramped had to wait 20 mins to be seated No coffee or tea brought to table No cutlery on table and had to get own ordered special breakfast waited 30 mins and then after chasing we was told not available my wife had to have no breakfast when getting breakfast from area people bumping into you and you have to wait 10 minutes for eggs and ask for bacon and beans to be topped up , Rooms was modern and clean 
5675,Park Plaza County Hall London, My stay there was fabulous and I don t have anything that I don t like , I liked how they took care of me I got surprised as well as they have upgraded my room to executive room with a surprise wine for my birthday That s sweet
5676,Park Plaza County Hall London, wi fi was rubbish I never got a stable connection at all Dreadful musak played constantly turn it off Room temperature centrally controlled so was constantly freezing It s possibly a London thing but I felt the service charging on every single thing such as the glass of wine i bought in the bar at 8 50 for 175ml became 9 28 even though my red was served in a white wine glass because the bar lady was cross I changed my mind to breakfast and dinner was excessive and frequently not warranted for the service received , Comfortable bed great view staff prompt with requests but not cheerful Breakfast had a wide variety cooked pastries fruit cereal toast etc Good facilities in the room coffee tea bath robe kettle crockery etc
5677,Park Plaza County Hall London, There was no parking available at the hotel which isn t a huge deal but having parking is always a bonus The staff was really great and helped us find a good car park about a five minute walk away The view from our room was not great we faced Waterloo Station but I m sure the other side of the hotel could see the London Eye The bar staff and the breakfast staff seemed a little preoccupied and we had some trouble flagging someone down but the drinks were good and pretty reasonable at the bar and the management was usually pretty good at noticing things and trying to adjust , The breakfast that was included was a full English buffet and was really good The location was absolutely fabulous close to Parliament the London Eye Westminster Abbey and Waterloo Station Not a cheap hotel but for where it is and the fact that it fit a family of four into one comfortable room a rarity in Europe the value is amazing 
5678,Park Plaza County Hall London, Over 50 people queuing for breakfast anticipated 30 minute wait got a refund Really not acceptable at a modern 4 star hotel Special birthday weekend spoiled ended up having breakfast in Waterloo Station , Reception and concierge staff very efficient and friendly Got a free room upgrade much appreciated Studio room 1108 was superb what a view Fantastic in room facilities and very comfortable 
5679,Park Plaza County Hall London, With only 3 lifts at certain times there is quite a long wait, We like this hotel have stayed before and I expect we will do again The rooms are good and very well equipped
5680,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Was Very Busy when we arrived but the staff were very friendly and dealt with us efficiently Room was clean and tidy No complaints whatsoever Great Location
5681,Park Plaza County Hall London, In my opinion there is no need to pay for breakfast The breakfast area is really small therefore leading to 20 40 min waits to eat We were lucky enough to be guided to a different serving area after waiting 15 min It was not worth the wait However I appreciate the kind gesture made by the staff , Location Location Location You can not beat this location if you are traveling with kids We were steps away from the London Eye and enough children activities to consume a full day When tired we easily walked back to the hotel The next day we were within walking distance to the waterloo train station all of the hop on hop buses stopped near by and the city buses ran through the night with stops very close to the hotel At the end of a long day it was great to lay in bed with BIg Ben and the London Eye as my view No need for an alarm clock Just look up and Big Ben was close enough to tell you the time Can t wait to stay here again 
5682,Park Plaza County Hall London, Very small bed Check in staff not very friendly Breakfast outrageously expensive Bar crowded and dirty , Location was very good Room and bathroom very clean Proper coat hangers
5683,Park Plaza County Hall London, The first impression on a hotel is everything and the front of house staff are first in line to do this i should know ive worked in a hotel for 6 years now and worked my way up from a receptionist to a manager looking over all departments So as soon as we walk in we immediately get what feels like from all of the concierge porters and door staff that we are not welcome all by what we are wearing i know this because everytime we walked in and out of the hotel we got glares and looked up and down and asked if anybody could help us by just stepping towards the lifts They are the first impression you make on a hotel and they destroyed this for us trust me my money is just as good as the people that are walking around in a tuxedo dont judge a book by a cover it also doesnt hurt to smile Im pretty sure thats what youre paid for Also a massive huge thank you to the gentlemen that told us not to get a taxi to the station and get the metro we had been going one way all weekend to waterloo station but he pointed us in another direction you would trust someone in a hotel to know better than you so we turned left rather than right it wasnt sign posted where we needed to go so we got lost for 15mins We finally got to the station running to catch our train from London Euston time we got there we missed our train by 4mins all thanks to a memeber of staff that cannot give directions correctly dont just point next time explain You cost me 230 to get home i sobbed on the platform station all i wanted to do is get home to my baby so thanks alot you can imagine how angry i was another member of staff not really giving a dam about us I was soo frustrated ive stopped myself writing a review for a few weeks Hope you can take this on board and learn your staff to respect and be helpful to all that stay with you , Loved our room it was fantastic the only thing that let it down is it was facing over a railway line and buildings so the view was a bit rubbish but that wasnt a majour issue The lady on the desk Francessca i think she was called such a lovely lady and the only staff member apart from the bar staff that genuinely made us feel welcome 
5684,Park Plaza County Hall London, The temperature of the water in the bathroom was luke warm , A lovely hotel with friendly helpful staff They went out of their way to stop a light flashing on the phone beside the bed which would have lit up the room every minute otherwise 
5685,Park Plaza County Hall London, I was disappointed with the view all the pictures on the website seemed to show river views We were overlooking a rather busy Waterloo Station , The room was perfect good facilities just right amount of space for a family of 4 Lovely and clean and comfy beds too 
5686,Park Plaza County Hall London, We checked in early at 10 45 ish and was told to return after 2 pm to get our room key we left our bags and returned about 5pm after a busy day and was told they were still working in our room and it would be another 10 minutes We complained as we had to be out at 6 and they gave us another room but we thought this was really poor , Really comfy bed room was lovely view rubbish but very quiet so we all slept well 
5687,Park Plaza County Hall London, I paid the Room Service bill before I actually was given the bill and there was a donation on the bill that would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted to contribute 1 00 I run a cleaning company and overall the place was very clean however was not dusty in the rooms and the mirrors were smeary The taps need descaling but this is me being picky given my profession I know how tight turnaround is There was only one T bag between three people and the room was kitted out for two people even though three were stopping so two glasses two cups two biscuits etc The cleaners were also trying to enter the room at 9 30 and out check out was 12 We inadvertently left our luggage at the wrong Plaza there was no offer to collect which was our mistake but the reception lady said we could ask but the answer would be no Make sure you get the right hotel , The staff were very friendly and room service was very good even though we couldn t eat everything Overall a very nice hotel with excellent views and the price is justified and having been ill for a long time this was a welcome relief and fantastic time was had by all We stopped in a Exc Suite with a City View we woke up to views of The Shard very well worth the money I m glad I paid a bit more but as three of us were travelling splitting this down meant we each paid 80 for one night 
5688,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Hotel is very central We had a room with a view of Big Ben and the London Eye Lovely bar area and decent food We went for our anniversary and the staff made a real fuss of us they d left us a bottle of wine and a card in the room when we arrived 
5689,Park Plaza County Hall London, The sofa bed is pretty terrible and I absolutely hate the door to the bathroom It s a sliding glass door which provides very little privacy , Very clear and modern and the location is great next to Waterloo and South Bank The breakfast is great as well 
5690,Park Plaza County Hall London, I wasn t to please that I was expected to pay an extra 5 to watch a movie, I was really pleased with the service the staff were really friendly I also wasn t expecting such a massive room
5691,Park Plaza County Hall London, The air extractor in the Bathroom ran all night I couldn t sleep past 06 00 The shower fittings fell apart When we reported this at check out we felt no one really cared We too had an overlong wait for breakfast ,No Positive
5692,Park Plaza County Hall London, Staff were disinterested and not helpful except the porters who were most excellent The room was cold and there is nothing in the room to control this Bathrobes were very well worn and tired , The bed was very comfortable the room was quiet and breakfast was available nice and early Spacious room and good facilities kettle fridge even a microwave and crockery 
5693,Park Plaza County Hall London, N A, Loved the location Staff were excellent proffessioal yet very friendly Would especially like to thank Anna at reception for organising a little something special for my husbands 40th Made our weekend Thank you 
5694,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, This location is excellent for families and travel It was very easy to get on the Underground as well as walk right across Westminster Bridge and to all the sights The food was excellent The wait staff was very attentive both for breakfast and for dinner 
5695,Park Plaza County Hall London, the fact our stay was quite expensive compared to similar hotels we have stayed in in London and didn t include breakfast It would have been nice to have been checked in by a smiling receptionist making us as guests to feel welcome and special, loved the d cor cleanliness and ambience
5696,Park Plaza County Hall London, Bigger breakfast area could be an improvement but a bit of a wait and sitting very close to other tables still didn t take away from the beautiful breakfast Delicious , Hotel staff location and breakfast all fantastic Thank you park plaza for a wonderful stay I m very fussy when staying in hotels and this hotel didn t let me down on anything Really quiet in the bedroom and a wide range of different clients who all apprared comfortable Will definitely use this hotel again 
5697,Park Plaza County Hall London, Optional service charge which Is added automatically on room service as well as a tray charge Double recovery not what I would expect, Staff very friendly
5698,Park Plaza County Hall London, Staff gave directions to Battersea which took us on 2 tubes and a taxi costing us approx 25 and took us an hour making us late When we went to come back we discovered it was a train directly to Waterloo costing 5 and took 15 minutes Not impressed with poor advice ,No Positive
5699,Park Plaza County Hall London, Overall very happy with the Room just the Bathroom fittings were tarnished , Used it as a Crash pad for a night while on business Front of House was efficient and helpful Twin room slept well room felt modern and well equiped Room was quiet with window internal to hotel Courtyard 
5700,Park Plaza County Hall London, I am not sure I got the room i booked as it seemed quite small for a superior double room As it was only a couple of nights however I dealt with it Being woken at 9am on the day of check out while the do not disturb sign was on the door too wasnt great Not usually this disappointed, I love to stay at this hotel Staff know me now and are always polite
5701,Park Plaza County Hall London, Nothing to improve, Fabulous room with a view of the London Eye Room and bathroom very spacious with everything we needed Given a gift of a bottle of wine as it was a special occasion collecting an award Breakfast was plentiful and excellent quality Staff especially Magda were lovely and attentive Highly recommended and will visit again 
5702,Park Plaza County Hall London, Inside facing room was a bit claustrophobic as could not open curtains Rubber undersheet on bed took off with difficulty Room not serviced one of the two nights Had to contact housekeeping who put it right , Spacious room good facilities and excellent bed 
5703,Park Plaza County Hall London, We had to ask for a fourth towel despite there being 4 on the booking Also had to ask for more tea bags and milk in order to make one evening drink and one in the morning , Very helpful polite and friendly staff Was my husband s birthday so they left a card wine soft drinks and popcorn for the children 
5704,Park Plaza County Hall London, The bathroom was awful there was a shower a bath and a hose and you got absolutely soaked trying to select the right one something needs to be done about that Also the sink tap was loose and rattled around in its socket and the bath when you sat in it was really difficult to get out of as it was lower than the floor level and you needed a step ladder to get out Also the photo bears no resemblance in any way shape or from to the room I was given no superior twin beds just two ordinary single beds with no gap between them at all I wont be going back there anytime soon, Location was perfect 
5705,Park Plaza County Hall London, Having to que for breakfast I have never had to experience this before and won t stay here again for this reason , The rooms are nice with good views up high
5706,Park Plaza County Hall London, Understandably the hotel had over 400 rooms that needed cleaning however we were told 5 minutes and the room was much longer than 5 minutes however that being said the room was great and the view was fantastic, The room wasn t ready so free drinks voucher were given and you could leave you luggage once you d checked out 
5707,Park Plaza County Hall London, Went to Marriott County Hall by mistake having known County Hall before it became a hotel Park Plaza County Hall is not at the old County Hall although it is nearby I think it confusing to have a Marriott County Hall and a Park Plaza County Hall close together although a traveller without prior knowledge would probably read the website more carefully than I did , We were upgraded to a Penthouse Suite very swish would like to have had more time to enjoy the comfort
5708,Park Plaza County Hall London, Seems to be good value for money but consider you will have to queue for 20 before to get acc s to the breakfast room never experienced this before Just consider also that you will have to wait circa 7 8 every time you want take the lift Basically overcrowded for the facilities offered Management not present never , Noiseless location
5709,Park Plaza County Hall London, I was not very pleased with my stay with park plaza so i took time to respond on this rating i can probably say about 2 3 unlikely to return on this hotel All the while i thought i could experience 5 star experience it was not I was totally disappointed how dirty my room was in fact the cobwebs at the upper lampshade was still there if you look at the left side of the bedroom the carpet was very dirty the room was over decorated at its size very way off on all the 5 star hotels i been through for a 270 a night stay its very unsatisfactory and lastly the buffet was not even close to the top hotels nearby,No Positive
5710,Park Plaza County Hall London, Terrible service when the room filled with water from shower 5 people came after 3 calls not to clean but with us inside the room trying to close even beds with our clothes on them to get access to the floor tubes So 3 of us and 5 of them in a small room without even asking if they can do it just an hour before we check out Getting ready for our bussiness meeting Breakfast small with a tiny cooridords between tables Not worthy , Actually not a single thing 
5711,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful and cheerful from the moment we arrived and were helped with our luggage which was even taken to our room while we checked in 
5712,Park Plaza County Hall London, We had flood every time we showered as shower head too strong for limited space in Bath and ill fitting screen No biscuits or hot chocolate in room and only one flannel left for two of us Also only one chair to sit on and we are two , Location great and staff friendly and helpful 
5713,Park Plaza County Hall London, We had an issue with sofa bed in the room we were in It was broken in the centre prior to our arrival However once we informed the staff we were accommodated in another room fairly swiftly compensated for out trouble, Staff were friendly efficient helpful
5714,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room was dirty dark without view even from the 8th floor The service was slow We asked for an adaptor and we received one two days later Every day during our four night stay we had to queue for breakfast for half an hour The breakfast room was small and we had to wait for the other residents to finish We requested a late check out before arrival as booking com gave us this option We did not receive any reply When we asked at the reception desk we were told that there was no availability unless we paid another 10 pounds per hour It seems that if you pay there is availability if you don t pay the hotel is fully booked ,No Positive
5715,Park Plaza County Hall London, While it was a great idea to have guests decide whether or not to have room cleaned we would have had to give note stating this to reception by 9am I did not even read it until 10AM Why not let it be signed and left in the room or hung outside the door just a thought, The pillowsand duvets were perfect
5716,Park Plaza County Hall London, My only complaints are that the tv in the bedroom area was to the side and it made it hard for us both to see well The sheets seemed too small or were put on wrong and we had to rearrange them And we didn t get enough towels for the whole family We were usually in a hurry to make it to breakfast before the crowd so one child alternated shower days anyway Also extra pillows would have been nice too The kids never complained about the sofa bed , The room was very nice but not much space around beds to move around with four in the room We had a fantastic view of the the London eye but not much of the city from the 6th floor The staff were very friendly and helpful A great hotel that treated children warmly as guests It was very crowded in the breakfast area and they opened up the bar area to serve as many guests as they could The mini bar area with extra sink was very nice as was the very clean bathroom with a defogging mirror 
5717,Park Plaza County Hall London, Didn t like the sofa in the lounge didn t like the little tv didn t like scaley kettle for the amount I spent expected a little bit more than a sachet of coffiee, I liked the location the bed was comftable
5718,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room size is small and dated decor no privacy in the toilet as its separated via a glass door Bed size is small Queuing atleast 20 30 mins for breakfast Not good at all , Location is great close to the main attractions e g london eye etc 
5719,Park Plaza County Hall London, The rooms are situated near kitchen which is very noisy We had to be asked to move in the middle of night because of this They did move us but the inconvenience of this was very tiring and due to this would not stay again , The location
5720,Park Plaza County Hall London, I paid extra for a city view but your over looking the train station and builders working, It was in a good location with a easy easy reach of the train Station 
5721,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room cleaning wasn t as expected Should take care of their staff and follow up on their work , The room has a great view London eye very good space nice bath large TV in the living room medium one in the bed room and very useful kitchen kit Small but very beneficial 
5722,Park Plaza County Hall London, We did not stay long enough, Nice room overlooking the London Eye Handy little kitchen Nice size shower Food tasted great Activities organized by the staff for children over the week end Security guards watching the entrance and requesting to show room cards to take the lift 
5723,Park Plaza County Hall London, When i collected my small lovely coral coloured suitcase from the concierge before leaving it was really grubby and dented , I had booked a suite and requested a room with a nice view as the trip was for my boyfriends birthday and got a fabulous big suite with AMAZING views of the London Eye Big Ben The Houses of Parliament And also they provided a complimentary bottle of red wine and a card which was a lovely touch Bathroom was lovely with a great large walk in shower The hotel bar was also great which serves food until late if you fancy a late bite with a few drinks Breakfast was also great with a lovely variety of dishes and a perfect start to 3 busy days Definitely would stay here again as it made the mini break extra special 
5724,Park Plaza County Hall London, I hated that the bathroom didn t have a real door It was only separated by a sliding partition that didn t offer much privacy The checking in and out process was not smooth Room was not ready when I was told and had to come back a couple of times before it was ready When I checked out I was given somebody else s bill I did not feel that the accommodations equaled the price I was charged , The staff was very accommodating and tried to help make my stay pleasant 
5725,Park Plaza County Hall London, Claustrophobic common areas and mediocre breakfast If you stay here choose a room only rate and go out for all meals there s plenty of choice nearby , Great views from our Penthouse which had a separate living room and wrap around balcony Easy walk to the Southbank and across the river on a choice of three bridges 
5726,Park Plaza County Hall London, Staff are too stressed may be they are under staffed Never seen so furustrated receptionist like this before We waited an exctra time to get the room which was not ready After a long journey we needed to change and kick off for a prebooked activity The delay did not help I did not expect this from such a big and pricy hotel Yet the staff were a smiley as they could be Not entirely bad , I stayed with my wife and 3 kids in an excutive suite The hotel is in a great location near London s famous attractions Very clean and modern Also food was very nice and the room was very well designed 
5727,Park Plaza County Hall London, Sofa bed very very uncomfortable even for the children to sleep on Requested an extra duvet to put as additional mattress to try and make a little more comfortable , Room was very clean and the sofa bed made up on arrival Very pleasant front of house staff allowed us to store our bags until we could check in as we were early Requested extra duvet and pillows no problem Liked the monopoly money the children could exchange for items nice touch 
5728,Park Plaza County Hall London, You have to wait a lot of time to have breakfast it seems the area for the breakfast was too small for the capacity of the people they sleep in this hotel There was a lot of dust in the room and especially behind the TV set The bath towels seem to be very old almost becoming gray from white Too expensive,No Positive
5729,Park Plaza County Hall London, Beds could have been more comfy , Stayed in a family suite during half term perfect as the two areas meant we were separated from our kids by the bathroom Great view of the County Hall and London Eye Staff very friendly and welcoming Location is just fantastic and the breakfast was fab too 
5730,Park Plaza County Hall London, Sofa bed in family room was a bit lumpy and bumpy , Family room was brilliant small kitchenette with microwave 4 x plates bowls cutlery mugs Tiny fridge but enough for mlk and a few supplies Perfect for making snacks for the children Sound proofing excellent 
5731,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room was nice and contemporary the bathroom sliding glass door is not practical makes too much noise when opening and closing especially in the middle of the night when others are sleeping AND it is far from sound proof when showering and getting ready while others are still sleeping , We arrived at 8 30am and the staff offered us an option for a room right away which was reasonable and allowed us to clean up before hitting the sights in London Great Although the view was far from good it didn t matter to us since we were leaving however NOT sure they should have charged us extra given the view I think if you are going to charge an extra 30 pounds for early access then for the money something should be provided like a view But we greatly appreciated having a room to store our stuff and clean up after such a long flight from US 
5732,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room was too hot despite turning the air con as low as it could go You need persistence to get room service to answer your call , Courtney on the front desk was excellent The rooms were very well furnished big and clean The shower was superb A kitchen area was a welcome plus The hotel catered for food allergies The hotel was close to Waterloo station near Westminster Bridge and the London Eye London Dungeons Sea Life 
5733,Park Plaza County Hall London, The sofa bed was too squeaky and noisy the other bed was too soft and the rooms were too hot due to not being able open windows , The staff were nice it was clean and the facilities were good

5735,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast far too pricey at 19, Studio apartment was great location brilliant for all nearby attractions and waterloo station Staff in the bar Angela and Georgia were very professional and friendly 
5736,Park Plaza County Hall London, We spent over 10 minutes waiting for an elevator the day we were checking out They definitely need more elevators , This was our second time staying at this hotel and we love it It s so central with a great family room set up And the view of the Eye always makes me happy This time there was a mistake on a room service food order but it was quickly remedied and the charge removed 
5737,Park Plaza County Hall London, everything was perfect, great hotel amazing location i will go back to this hotel on my next trip to london there is a security gard at night wich is very good
5738,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast Had to queue for ages 20 minutes at least to even get a table Queued right along the corridor , Very comfortable room and easy check in and lovely staff 
5739,Park Plaza County Hall London, Breakfast let it down a bit The food was nice but the organisation of the breakfast service could be inproved , Great location and service Friendly helpful staff We arrived early and as our room was ready we could check in early which meant we could get on with the rest of our day 
5740,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, The view was amazing from our room and all the elemis goodies in the bathroom was a lovely surprise excellent location friendly staff can t wait to come back 
5741,Park Plaza County Hall London, long queues for breakfast and then another queue to get fruit and toast we had to join the same queue for people wanting cooked breakfast restaurant to small for the amount of guests low water pressure on 13th floor took ages to run a bath and the plug leaked and water was not hot always normally use premier inn and wanted to make this visit special v disappointed, staff were helpful on arrival and at the main desk
5742,Park Plaza County Hall London, The bathroom smelt of damp drains room 413 No signal on EE within my room and wifi kept cutting out on my iphone , Breakfast selection was good Nice room and free upgrade to a studio apartment room 
5743,Park Plaza County Hall London, Staff lack warmth all very brusque Housekeeping woke us too early with insistent banging on our door repeated 40 minutes later I printed our boarding cards at guest computer in basement keyboard needs replacement characters almost completely faded and illegible, Comfy beds very clean tea making facilities and microwave in bedroom
5744,Park Plaza County Hall London, temperature control was difficult and bedding was too warm with no alternatives Restaurant was expensive and meals a bit disappointing but plenty of alternatives nearby , location size of room was good Staff were very cooperative and friendly Very convenient to many attractions and waterloo station Microwave and small fridge were welcome
5745,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room was quite cold even with AC turned up to max There was no heating as such just a cool breeze coming out of the vents that coupled with mostly tile flooring made it a chilly stay , The staff were very helpful and the overall facilities were excellent 
5746,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room view had windows that don t open as the view is within looking over the restraunts very unusual and no Fresh air, Hotel was nice room was terrible
5747,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, The staff was really friendly and helped me in every way possible Also my room was clean and the location of the hotel couldn t have been better 
5748,Park Plaza County Hall London, Rooms were a bit small but all we needed we were hardly in them except to sleep , Location was excellent could walk to many tourist destinations Staff was helpful and polite Restaurant was convenient with delicious food 
5749,Park Plaza County Hall London, For the money that we paid there was no swimming pool and the beds were really uncomfortable it was like sleeping on a camping bed i found that beds in a premier inn were a lot more comfortable , The staff were nice and friendly
5750,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room was pokey odd sounds from water heating pipe work that sounded like a dog Room was cold we ended up switching the a c off One pillow each not two and bed wasn t as good as a Premier Inn, Breakfast was good and Eden who assisted us at breakfast was very friendly
5751,Park Plaza County Hall London, Service at the restaurant for dinner was slow but it s only a small criticism , Fabulous hotel family room was spacious and comfortable From start to finish this hotel ticked all the boxes Location was fantastic too 
5752,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room was small and hot and the a c was noisy and ineffective Little space to relax certainly not possible to enjoy a comfortable breakfast We should have booked the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge which has a better atmosphere, The location
5753,Park Plaza County Hall London, Room size for single occupancy was just too tiny I could hardly fit in 2 bags no view atall Tv channels were vintage too with no music channel even a basic movie channel and all was paid , The bed was comfy breakfast buffet was good enough and location was close to Westminster which is tourist hub 
5754,Park Plaza County Hall London, It took ages for us to be able to check out The staff at the checkout desk were oblivious to which customers were next in the queue due to there not being a queue system set up My husband I were waiting patiently for a long time for the 2 or 3 staff members to serve their customers when a rude man another customer went in front of us soon as a staff member was free she didn t say anything like Sorry these customers were in front of you so we had to wait another half an hour It was far too slow , We loved the size of the bedroom the bathroom was also lovely Great roomy shower too 
5755,Park Plaza County Hall London, Nothing to complain about, Great location and value for money Stayed her for our anniversary visit to the big smoke When arrived discovered there was a bottle of wine in the room as well as petals on the bed which made our 25th Anniversary even more special
5756,Park Plaza County Hall London, The room is kimd of narrow so there is limited space to put 3 luggage in and able to fully open them , I like that the room has a small kitchen in it very convenient Staffs especially concierges are very helpful Great location near everything 
5757,Park Plaza County Hall London, It was needed to ask for 2 hours late checkout I was unwell and outside was a heavy rain weather I thought that they will contact with me to confirm or reject my request I spent a lot of money during my stay I was just asking for 2 hours for free The staff did not call me I thought that they are accepting my request In fact they by themselves cut the money and took some extra money as donation from my accounts with unauthorised way which were impolite and very bad behaviours I was perhaps going to cancel my request or extend one night instead of cut more money for just 2 hours It looked like stolen issue therefore I really would like to refund my money The supervisor did not care I confirmed to her that I will complain she was laughing and showed me her name on her T shirt as a kind of the confrontation , the location was good 
5758,Park Plaza County Hall London, Stayed in an accessible family room my husband and I had to sleep on the sofa bed mattress extremely thin and uncomfortable this was really disappointing and effected our impression of the hotel room overall We expected much better quality for the price charged , Very nice hotel in a great location very clean staff very pleasant 
5759,Park Plaza County Hall London, Immediate payment request for room service Majority of hotels accept signature on delivery receipt , Ideal location not far away from various London tourist attractions Nice and clean rooms with amply sufficient space 
5760,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Excellent property no matter what the reason your stay in London If you wanted to be close to many of the tourist sites this is the place The life of the city This is the place And in walking distance 
5761,Park Plaza County Hall London, I have stayed several times at Park Plaza hotels in this exact area their are three within several hundred feet This being my first time at Park Plaza Country Hall I expected the same gold standard that I have experienced at the other hotels I was staying in the Penthouse on the top floor for the weekend which means I expect Penthouse level customer service I had several issues with house cleaning security and most significant of all was the decor in the Penthouse The Penthouse has an amazing view of Big Ben Parliament and London Eye The decor is staggeringly outdated and resembles a 70 s era theme room which is not what I believe they purposely set out to do All of this really soured my experience at a hotel chain that I exclusively choose to utilize when I am in London This experience may deter me from using this specific hotel during any future trips to London That being said I reached out to Hotel Management about my experience and they showed great concern which is in the what did you like section please read , Hotel Management promptly reached out to me after reaching out to them to voice my concerns with my Park Plaza experience They were apologetic and quickly spoke to the departments that I had experienced sub par hotel service to try and address any issues Hotel Management also was very generous in their offer for compensation to compensate for my poor experience even though I declined any compensation I was very pleased with their desire to correct my issues to be consistent with standard Park Plaza experiences After speaking with Hotel Management I feel more comfortable with the possibility of returning to Park Plaza 
5762,Park Plaza County Hall London, Can t think of anything we didn t like , Helpful staff very comfortable bed excellent food in the restaurant and very quiet given the location 
5763,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, The location was the main reason for the choice of this hotel close to all the activities we had planned and choice of parking Room facilities were great didn t eat so can t comment front desk staff housekeepers were all excellent 
5764,Park Plaza County Hall London, Requested a quiet room in advance and this was confirmed at reception unfortunately our room was on a gallery and overlooked the lift area from which banging occurred at night and day but not so noticeable then The noise seemed to be produced by the counter weights on the glass fronted lifts Apart from this very annoying interruption to our sleep everything else was good Have stayed here previously but not in this area of the hotel , Nearly everything 
5765,Park Plaza County Hall London, Nothing an ideal venue for our visit , Great location close to Waterloo and then an easy and comfortable walk via Westminster Whitehall to the West End very enjoyable 
5766,Park Plaza County Hall London, There was nothing I could complain about, The staff were extremely helpful they upgraded my room for free which had the view of the London eye they also left a bottle of wine and a birthday card for my partner The room was luxurious and had lovely elemis shower gels and body lotions in the bathroom I had an amazing stay and would definitely book there again
5767,Park Plaza County Hall London, Every time you enter the hotel you have to show your key to make sure you are a resident of the hotel but they need to fix their attitude while asking instead making you feel as you are a intruder want to enter the hotel In addition time of check out they staff didn t help in taking the luggage from the reception to the car they asked me to ask the driver and that it s not their job to do so this single incident made me think twice to come back to this hotel or not Other than that everything was good, The whole experiance that I don t need to interact with the staff
5768,Park Plaza County Hall London, everything was great we had a fantastic time , The breakfast was the hit very nice and worthwhile and the Italian Restaurant is worth a try The beds and room we very comfortable and had a lot of space in for two People room no 723 We slept very well no noise from outside traffic Very pleasant place to stay with Family and tube Station very Close Very helpfull and friendly staff 
5769,Park Plaza County Hall London, Reception was a not efficient I tried to pay for the length of my stay upon checking in but the reception was adamant that I pay the first night I told her that it was better if I do only one transaction on my card but she won t have any of it but after we have done the transaction on the card she asked me if I want to pay the rest of my stay So I thought that was really bizarre She wasn t friendly at all and just get on with what she was doing Came down the following day to pay for the rest of my stay and no greetings only after the transaction she remembered that she ought to ask if my stay was so far any good , Location is great
5770,Park Plaza County Hall London, Reservation process for family was a mess Moved to a room in front of the elevators Breakfast was always full and had a long waiting queue to get a table , Location is superb
5771,Park Plaza County Hall London, The breakfast was on the expensive side for what you get , The location was perfect within walking distance of the London Eye Westminster Abbey Big Ben and the Thame River There are many cute restaurants close by 
5772,Park Plaza County Hall London, Eggs at breakfast tasted like powdered eggs and the mushrooms were tinned , Staff went above and beyond what was expected The situation of the Hotel was very central both to attractions and transport The Italian restaurant food was delicious 
5773,Park Plaza County Hall London, The breakfast could have been priced lower It was a little on the expensive side , There was a small microwave sink dishes and refrigerator in the room
5774,Park Plaza County Hall London, The bathroom shower drain produced random flapping noises through the night room 518 The bathroom was grubby around the corners of the shower and floor The air con was noisy and the room was very stuffy with it off Because we paid by debit card the room fridge was locked so any milk we brought to the room could not be kept cold Very limited clothing stowage no draws of any good size the hanging space was limited due to the ironing board spare quilts and pillows OK once they were taken out The safe was just above floor level so on your hands and knees to open it and lock it , The bed was excellent as was the Italian restaurant 
5775,Park Plaza County Hall London, 100pounds were charged in case of extras at the moment of checking in and I do not remember having been properly informed , Comfortable room big clean and equipped with basics for a quick dinner if not wanting to go outside
5776,Park Plaza County Hall London, Temperature control in the room was not very good Just a knob with no temperature feedback Hard to get it right as there was quite a delay in the change, Location room was good microwave handy as well as a small cooler space Staff were helpful and friendly 
5777,Park Plaza County Hall London, This hotel does not have parking bay and it makes it difficult to get dropped off or take a taxi We stayed in a family studio and found a sofabed too soft The rooms at Park Plaza Westminster Bridge opposite were more spacious and more comfortable , Location is excellent 
5778,Park Plaza County Hall London,No Negative, Room extremely small so upgraded then upgraded again because we were so disappointed So the money we did end up spending could have been spent on a much nicer hotel Room was freezing cold and took a very long time to heat up Room felt commercial and not what expected Bed was small always looked forward to the big bed in lovely hotels but not this one Sorry but I wouldn t recommend On the plus side the view was good 
5779,Park Plaza County Hall London, There was nothing to dislike , Room size was excellent Upgraded to the City view Worth every penny to see the sun coming up over London Will definitely return Check in was seamless although many people checking out Dealt with straight away 
5780,Park Plaza County Hall London, Only down side was our view from the room as we was looking out over the old euro tunnel station But nothing the hotel could do about this and didn t want to move room as our room 504 was really nice , Nice hotel very clean and staff friendly plenty of choice for breakfast Attractions are within walking distance and if you did need to get a taxi the park plaza opposite has a taxi rank with plenty of taxis waiting our hotel room had a kitchenette with microwave which was great as we have a toddler so was easy to warm her food and milk for the evening Overall our stay was very pleasant and we would recommend 
5781,Park Plaza County Hall London, We had to call housekeeping due to stain covered bedsheets for sofa bed which stank took half an hour before anybody came and replaced didn t help put new sheets on Kids were shattered so didn t help matters Staff seemed unhelpful was this due to Not wanting extras , Great location
5782,Park Plaza County Hall London, room good have been a bit bigger breakfast room a bit crowded on weekends, very friendly and cooperative staff very good breakfast nice bar nice room located very closely to Waterloo Station Big Ben Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace
5783,Park Plaza County Hall London, I had asked at time of booking that the room be feather free especially bedding as feathers trigger my husband s asthma This was not done and so we had to ask again at reception and then wait for someone to swap the bedding Overall staff seemed too busy , The location was great for all the activities we wanted to do The milk and cookies bed time treat was also just right for my son and me 
5784,Park Plaza County Hall London, N A, 2 min walk to london eye Westminster south bank waterloo station Had a lovely room which accommodated us as a family of 3 perfectly Breakfast was great too 
5785,Park Plaza County Hall London, Bathroom had a smell which we tried to mask with perfume Also didn t like the frosted glass doors on the bathroom , Room was comfy Breakfast was good 
5786,Park Plaza County Hall London, Would have liked breakfast to be included in our room price or at least be a little cheaper , Very friendly staff and family friendly as described Lovely room with view of the London Eye Nice restaurant Location is great ideal for exploring the sights of Westminster the South Bank beyond and easy access to other areas 
5787,Park Plaza County Hall London, No fresh air No ability to open any kind of window It was very warm on our stay and it felt claustrophobic I appreciate we were on a high floor but maybe a smaller window that would allow some fresh air in would have been good , Location and views could not be beaten
5788,Park Plaza County Hall London, The cooked breakfast wasn t as good as I expected the eggs didn t taste like eggs and the mushrooms should always be fresh and not tinned The toast machine wasn t working either , The rooms were very nice and the bed was very comfy The kitchen facilities in the room were an added bonus 
5789,Park Plaza County Hall London, As above but rest OK Room small but it is in Central London, The breakfast layout was shambolic The food under cooked meat Staff wandering around not knowing what to do All in all breakfast experience very poor 
5790,Park Plaza County Hall London, I never get a respond to my email asking for early check in which they didn t accept at the hotel which ruined my first day in London after such a long flight the WIFI is very bad you barely can browse or send text messages ,No Positive
5791,Park Plaza County Hall London, Elevators were kind of small and slow and for some reason many people were riding them up and back down again for no apparent reason they are glass but the view is only the inside atrium making them crowded , Great location and views Kind of a roundabout walk to get into Waterloo station but very easy to walk to Queens Walk and cross over the Thames to Westminster 
5792,Park Plaza County Hall London, Small room the desk chair did not pull out all the way from under the desk Mattress needed to be replaced I m used to having a flat sheet in between me and the comforter No wash cloths in bathroom , Great location modern looking hotel staff was very nice Marianna remember who I was the next day when my key card didn t work 
5793,Park Plaza County Hall London, Bathroom let the suite down as it didn t look up to standard compared to the rest of the suite taps and shower looked as if it needed cleaning with a goodlime scale remover , The suite was excellent for our short stay with family and staff were very helpful and friendly Hotel was in an excellent location and hotel facilities were good 
5794,Park Plaza County Hall London, There was nothing i didnt like about the hotel But maybe instead of red wine maybe a bottle of schloer or some other sparkling grape juice But i didnt mind becaus ei know i didnt put that in my notes so staff would not of known but again no complaints i was just as happy with that thought , The buffet breakfast was had evrything in hand was well catered for has nothing went empty even the orange juice was well topped as i was drinking faster than water I was also offered veg sausages which was a surprise very tasty When i checked abit on the 1st night at 1am staff were helpful in giving a short car park space to allow my sleeping kids out of the car into my room my buggy luggage were taken up to the room after a speedy check in service allowing me to then go find my booked car park at briannia Also prehand i was emailed the room might not be big enough for my kids allowing me to find a quick cheap upgrade to a bigger room my other questions were answered just as quickly I told the hotel it my 10th anniversery in my extra comments when booking so staff can congtraulate my wife when we checked in or maybe at later stage they did one better by leaving a nice surprise im hotel room with a nice bottle of wine some fancy luxury popcorn strawberry cream flav for her belgian choc for me Very nice But we dont dont drink alchol but i was well impressed with the thought effort put in the welcoming Top marks Also on the 1st moring when we were planning our day out on sat moring on our way we forgot about the fresh milk to give to my 2 year daughter but the lady bartender saved the day in helping getting us some warm milk With no charge Thanks 
5795,Park Plaza County Hall London, The bathroom had a seperate door for shower which was not able to close completely and before we realized the entire room was flooded , Location is good but not there is no parking or taxis to stop near the hotels
5796,Park Plaza County Hall London, I prefer to include breakfast in the hotel rate I paid to be more competitive with other hotels in the same class , The hotel is very close to Waterloo station London Eye Shrek Adventures Sea Life Aquarium and other important Points of Interest we planned to visit 
5797,Park Plaza County Hall London, The rooms were never made up until later afternoon despite us taking off any private signs on the door It was just too late to clean the room And the breakfast room is too small for the size of the hotel We had to wait way too long to get a table , The location was terrific and close to everything we needed with young children The room itself was a good size and offered space for everyone to sleep comfortably

5805,Park Plaza County Hall London, We shared a room with my brother who was visiting and the hotel provided a pull out sofa bed That was fine Unfortunately the pullout bed was near the window and the regular bed was nearest the door My wife and I slept on the pullout bed just because of the access to windows and natural light I thought that the main bed should be closest to the window instead of the sitting area pullout bed Seemed like a bad layout plan The pullout bed was tolerable but we cannot comment on the main bed because we didn t sleep on it , Staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the day and night Very close to the London Eye

6043,Park Plaza County Hall London, Attitude of some of the reception staff particularly at check in Studio was smaller that I expected It came with a kitchenette but it was a squeeze to make a cup of coffee Also fridge space could just about accommodate a 2 litre milk bottle Not enough toiletries provided for a family of four Two tellies provided but acoustics made it impossible to use both at the same time There seemed to be a time lag and echo between the two sets Had to wait ages for sofa bed to be made up on the Friday and Saturday night Not good when trying to maintain a routine for young kids Steam room and sauna area needs to be cleaned more regularly Lots of hair lying about and robes were tiny Also black algae in our shower surround Had to repeatedly get key card reactivated Room was showing signs of wear and tear Faucet tap was loose Mirror was cracked Worst of all was the stench from the drains This was stifling some times usually at night , Location close to Westminster Bridge Soundproof completely missed the storm on Sunday night Housekeeping left a nice message and some sweets for the kids on Day 1 Ice making machine on our floor Swift action taken to rectify faulty faucet when the problem was reported to the front desk Relieved to be able to block authorization of purchases from exorbitant minibar Tiny serving of jelly beans was 4 Terribly tempting for little hands Express checkout

6065,Park Plaza County Hall London, Personally we found the room rather claustrophobic difficult to explain the layout as the outside of the room was actually inside the building so had no view or natural daylight which was quite confusing at 2 45 this morning when I happened to wake Just felt like we state of semi darkness the whole time we spent in the room Fine for one night but had we have had a longer stay I would have to have asked if they had an outward facing room I don t like to sound like a cheapstake but breakfast was 18 each we opted to take a 5 minute walk around the corner and found a small decent caf and had a very adequate breakfast for 5 each, Well located and on the Eye side of the City Was as expected for a reasonably priced City Hotel Rooms clean and comfortable Beds very comfortable with cosy feather pillows and duvets Microwave and crockery in the room if you wanted to do some sort of mini self catering 
6066,Park Plaza County Hall London, A little confusion over the room I booked a superior double and was told that the room was a studio room This just put the booking in doubt Also when we arrived in the room there were balloons and a bottle of wine with a card it was my partners birthday but the card had a different name on not my partner after I queried this the goodies were collected but it left us feeling that we were given the wrong room , It was the ambience and the weekend was a success
