221154,Balmoral Champs Elys es, I think that the hotel is more for business travellers Family friendly but atmosphere shows that you need to be really quiet Kids playing at the common areas noise may be an issue , This is the second time that we stayed in the property The rooms are very modern now plus the bathroom is big for European standards 
221155,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, Everything about our stay was amazing very friendly and helpful staff beautiful and comfortable room and an excellent location right near the metro We stayed as a family of 6 and everyone was comfortable and well looked after Delicious breakfast that catered for us all with superb service Thank you for making our stay in Paris just perfect 
221156,Balmoral Champs Elys es, No microwave You eat at great restaurants and end up with leftovers you can not reheat , The staff were friendly and helpful The hotel was beautiful and in a great location I was married and Paris and it was my first time there I had a great time Only thing is I wish they had a microwave to heat up our leftovers from restaurants we went to But it was great otherwise 
221157,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Very expensive and poor breakfast You can find many coffee bar and have breakfast less than 5euro Donot buy breakfast in the hotel , Good location friendly staff
221158,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Nothing to add , Staff very attentive nothing too much trouble Good location for key tourist sites Some great eateries in immediate area Deli cafe s resteraunts Also right next to Metro station 
221159,Balmoral Champs Elys es, The courtyard had people coming to it so sometimes they could make noise for you while you are n your room sleeping Breakfast room depending where you are sitting is a bit tight , Location near to the Arc de Triomph metro and as well the city tour bus stop Breakfast was great Rooms were very comfortable and the bathrooms were quite spacious our rooms had a mini courtyard before entering the main building I would definetly recommend this hotel
221160,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, Staff were unprecedented in their ability to make one feel comfortable The hotel is in a perfect quiet location Easy walking Grocery store across the street Can t say enough about the staff the hotel and the location Stayed 5 nights in a prestige room with my 86 year old mother Wonderful time

221162,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Breakfast could use more variety Our superior double room opens to the terrace which was a slight discomfort in this cold weather , Good location staff and cleanliness 
221163,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Cold room and the door of the shower was broken which made the shower experience very frustrating The occasion was an evening after my wedding party Also there was a daily fee not informed and completely non sense , Nice and neaty room Cosy and comfortable Was inside the expectations 
221164,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Only thing that could have been better was having my reading light working we were told that it couldn t be repaired until Monday the day we were leaving which meant that any time I had to get up in the night I had to switch on main light which woke my friend up as well , The staff couldn t do enough for us the location was 2 minutes from the Arc de Triomphe and a short walk from the Champs Elysee there were wonderful restaurants near by and staff were happy to book a table for us beds were very comfortable The manager emailed us before we arrived to ask us what we would like and how they could make our stay perfect we had information sent to us to review prior to our arrival about restaurants famous sights and monuments and how to get to them and how to get to the hotel from Gare de Nord which helped us plan our trip in more detail saving us time when we got there Everything really

221170,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Could not be able to make late check out 12 30 pm makes our life tough as our plane was at 9 pm, The hotel is very pleasant boutique hotel Everything was great Despite the fact that upon check in we could not get our room request in the booking however we have been upgraded to a suite which is a real plus to the hotel Staff are professional and perfect Everyone was prompt and great especially Anne Claire Location is superb Sure will come back 
221171,Balmoral Champs Elys es, The beds were way too soft and not good for the back a few nights in a row , The two joining rooms on the top floor were perfect for a group of 5 Location was excellent 
221172,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, Very clean hotel tastefully decorated Excellent location 1 min walk from a major metro stop 5 min walk to the base of the Arc de Triomphe and a 10 min walk to the Champs lys es lots of places to eat around the hotel Extremely courteous and helpful staff who solved every problem and issue for us if there were any Rooms are big by Paris and European standards Absolutely no complaints and would repeat our stay here whenever we are in Paris Breakfast is good but could have been better but maybe since all other aspects of the hotel set such high standards we are being a bit harsh Lovely property and amazing hospitality from the staff 
221173,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, The suite was very spacious and well presented The staff were very welcoming and were able to accommodate our requests very quickly The location is ideal for shopping and sightseeing as well as jumping onto the metro 
221174,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Unfortunately thought the apartment would suit four adults better though it would have been fine if two were a couple , The hotel was very nice as were the staff Location also very good I am told breakfast was very good also 
221175,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Skip the 18 Euro breakfast in the lobby if you re on a budget Plenty of decent fast food places nearby , Excellent location on a quiet street tucked beside the Arch de Triomphe Tastefully appointed room and spacious state of the art bathroom The staff couldn t have been more friendly and helpful A great value for Paris lodgings 
221176,Balmoral Champs Elys es, nothing , This is my second stay at Balmoral It is a comfortable resting spot while visiting Paris The location is perfect and the staff and breakfast wonderful I will return 
221177,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful They got our tickets for the museums recommended places to eat even got our boarding passes when we were leaving We will most definitely stay there again when next we visit Paris 
221178,Balmoral Champs Elys es, The night desk attendant wasn t as knowledgeable on how to get around the city as I would have expected He struggled to tell us how to get to a restaurant which was a couple blocks from The Eiffel Tower , The staff prior to arriving was exceptionally helpful The room was clean The location is very good 
221179,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, This hotel was nice Very clean close proximity to the Arc de Triumphe and room was nicely decorated However we visited on our honeymoon which we advised the hotel of before arrival and this was never even acknowledged I wasn t expecting freebies but a congratulations on arrival would have been nice Not a big issue but it did deflate our initial excitement at arriving in beautiful Paris Hotel is quiet so this is a good base if you plan on being out all day and want a nice hotel to come back to in the evenings to sleep All in all we did enjoy our stay but would perhaps avoid for a special occasion 
221180,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, The location was perfect close to the metro The hotel was very clean and staff were warm and welcoming We were also upgraded to an executive room which was a cherry on top
221181,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and made me feel welcomed The room was small but clean and well organized The location is very near the Arc de Triumph and the metro very convenient for sights and city access 
221182,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Twin rooms in the hotel were overbooked upon arrival We have been unpleasantly pushed into queen sized bed but were given twin bed after some resistance We were two work colleagues traveling It just didn t feel right for such a place The porter was a story himself Should have more common sense , Everything just perfect except for checking in experience 
221183,Balmoral Champs Elys es, The bed was a little too firm , The baby cot was a wooden one which was much better than a usual travel cot The staff were very friendly and helpful Our room was lovely especially the bathroom for long baths We had a wonderful time 
221184,Balmoral Champs Elys es, The only negative side I would give is the special request I made through when booking special welcoming , The staff are friendly nice and supporative The space of the rooms are great enough to put your luggages and sit happily The location is close to the train approximately 3 minutes walking 
221185,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel between 21st 24th Decmber On check in the front desk staff were very helpful they spoke English and assisted us with our luggage The room was small typical for Paris but very clean and practical The front desk staff printed off our tour vouchers for us and gave us some advice on nice places to eat around the local area The location of this hotel is perfect Round the corner from the world famous Champs Elysee but yet still very quiet and peaceful There is a Metro station about 200yrds from the hotel entrance and a newsagents type shop 10seconds away Breakfast was good but I did expect a little more choice of hot food My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be returning 
221186,Balmoral Champs Elys es, very small lift expensive breakfast didn t try it so cannot comment on quality small room no proper desk to work at, Comfortable bed good shower quiet room fast free wifi location friendly staff received email before arrival asking if I had any special requests

221188,Balmoral Champs Elys es, I can t remember things i didn t like , Its not my first time here Staying in this hotel is the true paris experience The quite neighborhood even though the crowded champs lys es is a few steps away the parisien style the comfort its very worm feels home lovely staff very clean and simple And being rated as 4 stars is an advantage making it a luxury place without arrogance Its far from the noise and in the middle of the crowd i usually take the superior room of 20 m square which offers an elegant and spacious bathroom which is quite important for us as young couple the charles de gaulle etoile metro station is just down stairs giving you an access to all Paris The facilities in the room are so generous I strongly recommend this hotel specially for couples and of course it will be my choice each time visiting my beautiful Paris 
221189,Balmoral Champs Elys es,No Negative, The helpfulness of all the staff the e mail before you arrived asking you if you have any requests and the generous amount of tea and coffee in your room

221191,Balmoral Champs Elys es, Realy thier not honset with me because of the following 1 The sofa bed in the room was broken instead the admit and plogized they send the labor with supporting pieces to confuse me it s oky and it will not harm my kids 2 After that they offer another room and told me it s oky without any problem when I checked it s with the same problem and same soultion what is making not trust them it all when I ask for suite with queen bed the answer all it s equipped and the room offred to me after 15 min from my request was queen bed the location not near to champs elyeesa need more thant 12min walking To be far with them after hard discussion they gave me 50 discount for the night I stay The elvator too small, No thing
