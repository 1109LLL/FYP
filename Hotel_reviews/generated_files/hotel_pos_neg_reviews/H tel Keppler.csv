22226,H tel Keppler, Although we had an executive room it was a bit small particularly the bathroom When we checked out the hotel challenged whether our breakfast was included although I produced the paperwork to prove it Eventually the hotel agreed and said they would take this up with you , The hotel decor is beautiful and of the highest quality The staff are very helpful and friendly and breakfast was one of the best we have had Excellent restaurants nearby 
22227,H tel Keppler, The bathroom door and walls should be cleaned also because there was stains I used to clean with Detol wipes The air conditioner wasn t working and I used to open the window but There was noise coming from the street , Verry Friendly staff and welling to help
22228,H tel Keppler, WiFi was very slow at some moments but I can t say it was bothering us because most of the time we were exploring the city , Super location 3min to Arc de Triomphe It s also quite hotel we stayed two days at another hotel the windows were facing main streets so we kinda had sleepless nights Staff is helpful and friendly We would definitely return to hotel Keppler 
22229,H tel Keppler, No tea coffee making facilities Came to turn down bed at 1740 when we were getting ready to go out which was much too early Left us with 2 mini snickers for our pillow which you don t expect from a Parisienne hotel It was my daughters 21st birthday the day of check in but although notified hotel did not do anything to mark the occasion , Location and uniqueness of property Arrived at lunchtime and rooms were ready so could drop off bags and explore Only a few minutes walk from Champs Elysees but quiet location Rooms small but had all you needed and the decor was amazing Look after our bags after check out The porter was very good being extremely helpful and informative 
22230,H tel Keppler,No Negative, Suddenly I like everything Usually I am not a big fan of hotels in the center of Paris Because of very small rooms strange designes views from vindows etc etc Here everything was very ergonomic I loved location and design Staff is very polite and helpful

22235,H tel Keppler, The room was a little too hot at night but possibly because we did not operate the air conditioning properly, The breakfasts were very good and the staff there were so helpful We honeymooned at the hotel Keppler 59 years ago but it was no where near as upmarket as it is today
