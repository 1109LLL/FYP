212739,W12 Rooms, It was a little noisy early evening with the traffic boutside but we didnt notice the noise after 10pm and it remained quiet all of Sunday morning , The room was very clean and nice and new We had a lovely view out to the park and the bed and pillows were very comfortable 
212740,W12 Rooms, Room at top of property quite small and difficult to navigate around a pillar in the middle of the room No lift, Location adjacent to Shepherd s Bush Station was very convenient Bathroom well appointed
212741,W12 Rooms, Best to get rid of those air fresheners they really don t smell nice and make people think you are trying to cover up a worse smell , Bed very comfy Lovely to have bourbon biscuits with my tea 
212742,W12 Rooms, Shower broke but they compensated and fixed this immediately No lift if on high up room however they help with your luggage, Very good will be staying again Great room condition clean lovely design and convenient technology 
212743,W12 Rooms, The duvet cover had what looked like mould on it and the building was clad in scaffolding which I knew about before the trip, Excellent location brilliant facilities including air conditioning which was silent very good price 
212744,W12 Rooms, Please get rid of the captive portal and switch to a WPA2 encrypted WiFi it s 2017 there is no need to limit data transfer anymore but more reasons to have an encrypted connection, I ve stayed there before so I knew what I bargained for I really like the location just next to a Central Line station as well as the nice cozy room staff was always friendly and helpful as well as the housekeeping staff keeps it clean In the area is a shopping mall as well as a lot of restaurants I ve used it as a jumping point into the city 
212745,W12 Rooms, The bed there were dirty bedsheets even with dried blood I almost don t sleep there Also this is not a real hotel just a high quality rooms building , I loved the bath the shower was literally amazing 
212746,W12 Rooms, No lift hotel goes to fourth floor If you don t like stairs ask for a low floor , The hotel appears to be recently refurbished redecorated as of July 2017 Very high tech electronic do not disturb signs and contactless room keys Slightly boutique feel to d cor rather than bland business style hotel Fantastic location next to Shepherds Bush tube runs 24 hours short hop to central London and overground rail 24 hour reception Bathroom very high standard double glazed Air conditioning unusual in UK Good value for the standard location and price paid GBP140 one night in July 2017 
212747,W12 Rooms, Stairs are a bit difficult with luggage but the staff came and helped which made it easier Location a bit noisy but great for getting around right by tube bus and overground train, The rooms were clean comfortable and the bed linen especially the duvet super snuggly Room felt like a bit of luxury Bathroom modern and stylish Loved the shower
212748,W12 Rooms,No Negative, Beautifully decorated very clean and comfy bed Brilliant location just next to Shepherds Bush tube Station The staff extremely helpful and polite along time since our luggage has been taken to our room for us and looked after after we had checked out so we could browse Westfield Shopping Complex without having to drag our luggage around with us We would certainly stay at this little gem of a hotel again 
212749,W12 Rooms, Mini bar options , My third stay here in two years Staff are friendly and helpful Location is close to two underground stations and ideal for sightseeing and retail therapy 
212750,W12 Rooms, Only complaint was that the room was very small BUT for the price and considering everything else definitely would consider staying here again , Wonderful staff very accommodating and helpful The location is perfect for anyone looking to stay outside the busiest areas of London but close enough literally less than a minute away from the tube station to explore London Close to Westfield mall as well which is a plus 
212751,W12 Rooms, Flights of stairs needed to be climbed to get to reception and another to our room so not very suitable for small babies in Prams or buggies, Room was very clean bit small but was very comfortable Shower room was very clean and modern would definitely recommend this hotel for convenience and price
212752,W12 Rooms, The facade is being repaired so you cannot open the curtains Remember there is no lift , Very clean and plainly much higher standard that you would expect for such money in London Tube is just next door though it takes time for the train to reach City Westminster It is not possible to have a breakfast in the hotel but there are plenty of places to eat in the 2 minutes range Cash dispenser is at the ground floor Condition was excellent 
212753,W12 Rooms, Room quite small shower could have been cleaner , Great location in an interesting area of London Couldn t be better for the tube and overland Comfy bed and nice bathroom Air con effective hot weekend so this was much appreciated 
212754,W12 Rooms, We couldn t figure out how to shut the skylight so heard quite a few sirens overnight , Very friendly and helpful staff in a great convenient location Just off Shepherds Bush tube but absolutely no tube noise at all 
212755,W12 Rooms, The shower temperature control was fiddly and a bit hard to manage , The bed was fantastic with crisp bedlinen and comfy pillows and the tv was great with fast guide The room is pretty small but good value for central London Fantastic location right beside a Tube stop and near a more major one On bus routes handy for Portobello Rd market and next to a lovely green Perfect for the fabric shops of Goldhawk road Staff were warm and welcoming and helped with bags very useful as there s no lift and I was on the third floor It s on a busy road so take earplugs if that will be a problem for you There was an aircon in the room keeping it nice and cool in the London summer Two minor niggles the shower temperature control was a bit hard to manage and a couple more coffee sachets might have been nice But overall near perfect I would definitely stay there again 
212756,W12 Rooms, Room was very small Bed and pillows cheap and not that comfortable A c was set to freezing when I got in Room smelt musty , Suited for a cheapish place to crash after a late function Nothing special 
212757,W12 Rooms, I felt unsafe with the luggage on stairs , Friendly staff and cozy house and room Close to the tube and good bus connections 24h hour shop around the corner 
212758,W12 Rooms, Our room was on the very top floor certainly private but quite a climb to get to without elevator The only window of the room was 2 meters above our heads and the room itself fairly small , The location is fantastic because close to the Tube the Mall restaurants and supermarkets Staff very friendly and room and bathroom clean We could also leave our luggage before and after check in check out We would consider coming back 
212759,W12 Rooms, The only thing I didn t like about the place were the towels They were nos as soft and fluffy as one would expect of a hotel The rest was good , The place was clean cleaned our room if we left early enough and even thought there was some minir work done on the front of the property we didn t hear them at all It is around the corner of a tube station near McDonalds if you come back late and a block away from a mall 
212760,W12 Rooms, Noisy public street amateurish sound insulation Some sewage smell in the bathroom Despite single use of a double room a very cramped room layout Single rooms have a more efficiently room layout , Good furniture decoration staff amenities etc Subway close by 
212761,W12 Rooms, Lovely room in the attic which Ok but if you were older was up a lot of stairs hotel is on 4 floors No herbal tea supplied vegan customer so couldn t have hot drink Also no shampoo conditioner in bathroom soap and body lotion supplied tho , Perfect position round corner from tube and across the green from O2 Empire for our concert Really nicely decorated staff very friendly and WiFi available tea coffee biscuits in room Accommodation comfortable and clean very modern Comfy bed soft towels TV hair dryer 
212762,W12 Rooms, Room temperature was very warm and as with many London hotels difficult to regulate by opening a window due to the road noise This hotel is on a main road and the sirens from emergency services will interrupt sleep This is not the hotels fault clearly I had a deluxe room and my friends a standard other than size I couldn t see much difference One thing I didn t like was I had to show ID on check in I stay in hotels across the UK and the world I understand passports are required by foreigners in different countries but not in ones own country and the lady on reception was not the friendliest The manager however was very friendly and helpful and made up for these difficencies , Very handy for the tube right next door and Westfields shopping centre The room was clean and functional and the bathroom nicely appointed 
212763,W12 Rooms, The room had an awful odor The room wasn t cleaned I found stains dirt and hair on every surface Mold in the shower and brown stains on the towels provided , Close to underground
212764,W12 Rooms, The room was not what we expected I booked a double deluxe room and the room in which we stayed seemed very small in comparison to photos , Underground station was right on our door step which made it really easy to explore London Very clean and staff were happy to help on arrival 
212765,W12 Rooms, When I was checking in I was asked to sign a three page document concerning the duration of my stay and the cost When I started to read the document the reception told me just sign it I did have to say that I need to read what I am being asked to sign before I sign I did not like this , Clean and comfortable room with quality bedding 
212766,W12 Rooms, Nothing to do with the property but it was very noisy e g people talking outside late into the night car horns police sirens and at 5am roadsweepers , Air conditioning was a bonus as we had to sleep with the windows closed Staff on reception were lovely They were available 24 7 and very accommodating when we experienced a blocked plughole The receptionist put on his rubber gloves and sorted it immediately Just wonderful
212767,W12 Rooms, Not a problem for us but worth noting there is no lift and a lot of stairs which could be a problem for some Ask for a first floor room then you only have one flight A member of staff helped get my case up to the room and from reception down when we left This property is on a very busy road so there is some unavoidable traffic noise although all we heard was a low hum in the morning from the 4th floor , Ultra clean and modern looks recently decorated Lots of thought given to those extra touches air con hair dryer small fridge tea and coffee in room nice quality toiletries etc Good quality bed linens and comfy bed Very convenient for the O2 Shepherd s Bush Empire and Westfield No breakfast available but plenty of options on Uxbridge Rd and in Westfield itself 
212768,W12 Rooms, No breakfast the premier in was the same price but had breakfast included but further away from the venue we wanted late check in 3pm wasnt to good as had to go shopping and then cut the trip short to check in and then go back to the shops not so good would be nice to have checked in at 12, I liked the staff carrying up your bags to the room and showing you in lovely I love the late check out 11 is good really close to the empire It was loude outside but they had lots of measures in place to prevent the noise The heating was on and It was boiling when we arrived the the lovely aircon sorted this out 
212769,W12 Rooms, The bathroom could have been cleaner The room was quite warm and stuffy , The location was wonderful There were great restaurants and bars nearby We walked just about a mile to Poppy s a Thai restaurant The food was excellent at very reasonable prices The underground station was just around to corner from the hotel not even a 2 minute walk The room was very comfortable We left our luggage there as soon as we got to London When we got back to the hotel near supper time our luggage was up in our room waiting for us Staff were helpful and courteous 
212770,W12 Rooms, In the first room the A C didn t work so the room temperature was 28 degrees which made for an uncomfortable night Option to open the window but with the noise of the tube station outside meant it wasn t ideal Plus with work taking place to the exterior of the building with scaffolding covering the entirety of the exterior there was no privacy or safety if the windows were open The staff moved us to a second room where the A C was still not working and just left the windows open The drain was blocked which meant water in the sink and shower just collected and drained extremely slowly Overall all a terrible experience and poor customer service as no form of compensation was offered and no attempt was made by the staff to rectify the problem before the next guests , The interior decor where clean is modern 
212771,W12 Rooms, Over all a good experience for the price in London As I saw beforehand many complaints about noise I asked specifically for a quiet room At reception I asked if this was taken into consideration and I was assured it was It probably was the quietest room available but it was noisy nonetheless I slept with Oropax and it was ok The bathroom was clean ok but the shower was not cleaned thoroughly Also the bed had some stains as sheets were ok I did not bother but not very nice either , Very friendly personnel who brought our luggage to the third floor as there is no elevator Daily cleaning of the room Position of the hotel is really really good you have tube station Shepherd s Bush in front of the hotel entrance so ideal for city trips Easy to reach Victoria station from there 
212772,W12 Rooms, The bed was too small for two The bathroom was not cleaned properly Insufficiently communicated that there s construction going on and therefore the curtains are drawn the entire time There s scaffolding outside the windows , Close proximity to the tube and rail station Only a couple of stops away from Oxford Circus 
212773,W12 Rooms,No Negative, Hotel was lovely and clean in a very central location right next to a tube station We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to London Thanks for a lovely stay Laura and Colin
212774,W12 Rooms, Outside sign easily missed , Whole hotel very clean and modern Loved the air con in the room Very well sound proofed too couldn t hear the traffic outside Excellent location too next to underground station 
212775,W12 Rooms, No lift Couldn t stay longer had to be somewhere , Location great Shopping mall next door Staff very friendly efficient helpful carrying luggage
212776,W12 Rooms, Nothing except maybe the tv chanels choices , Very easy access to the undergroud the train and many good buses routes to downtown It was my 2nd stay in this hotel and it for sure will be my first choice the next time I am in London 
212777,W12 Rooms, We purchased a Deluxe room it was unbelievably small floor space and head space slanted ceiling with random poles in the room WINDOWLESS and not at all as represented in the pictures essentially a glorified cupboard in the attic It is noisy you can hear everything anyone says outside and the show outside of the tube entrance downstairs The door had a large gap at the button which meant the light from the corridor lit up the room all night Bed was soft but again very small and we aren t that big people We asked for a replacement or a cancellation but the staff were fairly clueless and said we have to wait for the manager to get in on Monday we only stayed 1 night on Saturday Overall very disappointed as it was our anniversary and had I known how small and claustrophobic the room was I would have spent more to stay somewhere else , Wallpaper
212778,W12 Rooms, slightly worn out bathroom the bathroom radiator was very hot so be careful especially kids , Pleasant staff decent size room comfy bed great location nice decor

212791,W12 Rooms, The shower was a little tricky to work and could do with some maintenance It was difficult to turn the temperature down from boiling hot but eventually got it , Staff were very helpful and friendly We arrived on the back of a long trip away and were able to check in early which was a real bonus as we had been travelling overnight Very thankful to the staff for this The room was just what we needed ultra comfortable views of the streets and park below which we loved 
212792,W12 Rooms, The receptionist made me pay 30 for late check out without informing me on arrival date that there would be a fee for extending my stay till 2 00 pm, A guy working there called Faisal he was very supportive and helpful

212803,W12 Rooms, The walls are cardboard thin A group of people came in at 1am in the room next to us and we could hear every word they said most of it vulgar from being drunk not to mention someone sexually gratifying themselves Whilst this was going on they had the tv on very loud Couldn t fall asleep until they did which was well past 2 30 am , The owners put in a lot of effort to make the rooms stand out from competitors such as heated bathroom floors luxury shower and thick windows to block out noise from the busy road in front of the hotel I ve to have complimentary bottled water as well which other hotels over charge for Amazing location 
212804,W12 Rooms, Housekeeping come around a little later than usual which if we had been out would have been fine except we had returned around 2pm due to illness To most people visiting London who would have been out it would not have been a problem Housekeeping did offer more tea and coffee etc, Excellent location lovely staff Great room clean and tidy Great air con and heating system

212833,W12 Rooms, We were placed on the 4th floor and there is no lift This hotel would not suit people with mobility issues, The property was accessed from a small doorway which was off putting However once inside everything was clean and elegant Reception staff were friendly Despite its central location it was peaceful The en suite and fluffy towels were fab Please there was air conditioning in room 
212834,W12 Rooms, There isn t anything I dislike about W12 but there are a couple of things to note there isn t a lift it s all stairs but only a few floors so that isn t a big deal But be aware if you are with someone who has limited mobility Also outside is Shepherd s Bush station which is hugely convenient but noisy at night But again nothing a set of ear plugs won t cure , I ve stayed here a few times previously and will do again I like the place Clean comfortable great value and a good team working there Perfectly located for transport routes Westfield Waitrose O2 Shepherd s Bush and a plethora of bars and restaurants

212849,W12 Rooms, Bit of a fuss at check in over not having photo ID never been asked for photo ID anywhere in the world before when checking into a hotel , Clean and convenient ideal for one or two night stay 
212850,W12 Rooms, Noisy if room is street facing No Breakfast option on premise , Very clean The ensuite was a fair size and excellent walk in shower Bed was okay but would have preferred a firmer mattress All in all for the price I d stay here again Better than a lot of budget hotels at similar or more money 
212851,W12 Rooms, The shower could have been cleaner And I didn t feel like the room had been hoovered , The style of the hotel and the room Very spacious and comfy Beautiful interior all over 
212852,W12 Rooms, Room was small and there was a lot of street noise outside Secondary glazing was installed but did not eliminate sirens traffic and noise from people coming and going from bars and restaurants This a room only venue so not hotel food and drink offering available , Room was clean comfortable and tastefully decorated Very convenient for Shepherds Bush tube and overground and excellent shops and restaurants nearby 
212853,W12 Rooms, No lift and shower in the bathroom could have been cleaner, Bed was comfy decor was pretty overall it was a really nice room and quite spacious Great location close to the tube and right next to Westfield
212854,W12 Rooms, The room was too noisy as could hear the traffic but in addition walls so thin the noisy neighbours kept me awake, Fantastic location for shopping and very clean
212855,W12 Rooms, On noisy street but the double glazing really helped and it is only to be expected given the location I would still stay here again any time I go to London , Very clean very comfortable very friendly staff excellent value right next to tube station for easy access to centre of London 
212856,W12 Rooms, Maybe double glazing on windows to reduce street noise but I didn t mind it , Brilliant location friendly welcome good price Would definitely stay again 
212857,W12 Rooms, There is no elevator and the staircases have more than the normal amount of steps Room was arranged well but isn t large If stairs are a problem for you then choose another hotel otherwise it s an excellent choice , I liked everything about W12 Rooms other than the lack of an elevator Very attentive and friendly staff Shepherd s Bush is West of Central London but the hotel is a short walk to the underground and bus terminal and still zone 1 underground All supplies were full bath towels large amenities nicely presented Nothing I didn t like other than what I noted Room has a classy 1950s feel with updated bath My wife and I felt that it was an excellent hotel and a good value We would stay here again and we ll recommend it to friends 
212858,W12 Rooms, Small hole in bed linen and part of the bed drawer was missing didn t affect my stay just minor presentation points My room faced the main road which is good for people watching but the traffic noise starts quite early Was not keen on the use of plug in air fresheners something natural would have been a lot more pleasant , Unbeatable location just a few steps from the underground and overground stations as well as Westfield shopping centre Good shower 
212859,W12 Rooms, No elevator bed slightly uncomfortable Pillows a bit too hard for my taste Liz cafe 5 mins away is great for breakfast , Great staff great location clean quiet From heathrow go to Shepards bush market only one change in hammersmith then 
212860,W12 Rooms, We were on the top floor Good thing we are fit because the stairs are steep , The rooms are cosy and nicely decorated with everything you need The location next to the Underground and Westfield Shopping Center is excellent The price is reasonable for London 
212861,W12 Rooms, Staff at desk seemed unhappy but we re not rude at all No breakfast facilities but places nearby so not too big a deal , Small rooms but ideal if just using for a base Right next to train station and shopping centre which was just what we needed Very clean and well decorated Expected it to be noisy but surprisingly it wasn t Would stay again 
212862,W12 Rooms, Shower door broken which was never fixed for the duration of my stay despite mentioning it several times and bathroom sink smelt a bit , friendly staff great location very clean and lovely looking hotel Rooms small but very clean and nicely decorated 
212863,W12 Rooms, A bit noisy since rooms face a busy road But still managed to sleep ok Room was a bit too warm at night And since there was no top sheet on bed could not sleep with just a sheet Was a bit uncomfortable , Very handy location close to buses and trains Very nice room comfortable and clean 
212864,W12 Rooms, Bathroom could have been a little bit cjeaner, The decor was beautiful and room was quite spacious given it was in central London The location is perfect too right next to the tube station and Westfield shopping mall 
212865,W12 Rooms, when I come in from the street I could walk through reception with no one even noticing me very scary considering the location Internet was basically non existent and had to tether I phone No restaurant For 4 start hotel this is dismal , staff were nice
212866,W12 Rooms, Had to climb many steps of stairs to the room Choice of convenient location traded off with noise of traffic , Location is very good Staff are nice and helpful 
212867,W12 Rooms, Rooms are tiny this is a great place to crash for the night not a place to hang out in if you are staying more than one or two days as I think it would start to feel cramped , Friendly and helpful staff Thick double paned windows help keep the street noise down so you can sleep Comfy beds Clean Super close to underground access Notting Hill great restaurants nearby to the west as well 
212868,W12 Rooms, Plumbing was very noisy in my room and if it is next to a busy road which may be an issue for light sleepers , Decor very nice good location right next to tube station with shops and coffee shops next door The soap in the bathroom was lovely Small double bed for single traveler was great Appreciated a couple of bottles of water in the room Staff were friendly and efficient 
212869,W12 Rooms, The room was a tad bit small No other issues, This hotel was good value for money You get what you pay for The room was spotless and everything needed for your stay was there 
212870,W12 Rooms, Would prefer to be able to open the window or skylight for air rather than have to use aircon because it s stuffy inside when it s pretty cold outside , Beautiful hotel
212871,W12 Rooms, The duvet could have been bigger A shaving mirror in the bathroom would be a benefit, Very friendly helpful staff Clean compact room and bathroom D cor shabby chic with luxurious feel Lots of eating places all around A few steps from Shepard Bush underground and 5 minute walk to 02 Shepard Bush venue
212872,W12 Rooms, Would benefit from having a lift but we appreciate space is at a premium , Great location next to the underground station Westfield Shopping Centre Cinema across the road and restaurants Staff were very helpful and friendly Bedrooms are clean and nicely decorated if a little small shower rooms are lovely and well equipped 
212873,W12 Rooms,No Negative, Although the room is not big it is really welcoming new clean and cosy The location is perfect since the underground is just next to the hotel and the staff is so nice

212875,W12 Rooms, There was no breakfast in the morning, How close it is to the train station and Westfield Also the room was not too big and not too small just the right size I basically liked everything 
212876,W12 Rooms, For my purposes this time this was ideal , Relaxed efficient staff check in and check out very simple and quick Room and en suite finished to very high standard for price bracket Would definitely recommend 
212877,W12 Rooms, Stairs I stayed on the 2nd floor which was 2 flights up Please note this was not an issue for me at all just pointing out if you have a lot of luggage but I believe the porter is on hand to assist in this case Main road is very busy especially on Saturday night with bars across the road Again please note this was NOT an issue for me I prefer a main road with lots of amneties and noise was not sigificant enough to disturb my sleep or stay but just wanted to point out To be fair for the location this is expected no way around being so central and avoiding some noise , Excellent cleanliness and decor of room and bathroom very much like a boutique hotel exactly like I saw in the photos Fantastic location right on the main road and next to shepherds Bush station Large flat screen TV was good size for the room the room was small stayed in the single but functional and with all amenities was cosy for me which I had no issues with Read a few comments prior to stay about wifi and air con issues just a heads up that my WiFi was working perfectly enough to stream a movie even and room heating was also working fine Staff were very prompt and functional No small chit chat or any interaction other than check in and check out which took all of 3minutes which suited me fine Porter man very friendly and helpful showing me to my room and greeting as soon as arrived Overall excellent value for money I booked a discounted deal rate for a very cosy stylish room in a great location 
212878,W12 Rooms, Not being on the second floor without an elevator Minor, Location Underground was a few steps away A block away was a great restaurant row Another block got us to the Westfield mall The greatest mall we ever visited 
212879,W12 Rooms, Our room was at the front of the hotel on a fairly busy road so it was a little noisy We had asked for a quiet room , The hotel is right next to the tube The room was small but was well decorated and had everything we needed 
212880,W12 Rooms, Tiny tiny tiny room Not much storage available A bit noisy next to the tube station some nights Bed was a bit too soft for my back , Tube station right next door very easy access to public transport Clean friendly and helpful staff Nice bathroom with shower Reasonable rates for London
212881,W12 Rooms, bathroom small and mot configured well no elevators for a hotel which has 4 floors and reception is only on 2 nd floor entrance is rather ordinary more like a common store, rooms were clean albeit quite small staff were pleasant and helpful good value for money
212882,W12 Rooms, Having to walk up 20 steps with our luggage just to get to Reception and then two more floors up to the room The room was noisy walls between rooms are very thin and we could hear everything from our neighbours including at 1am The room is tiny nowhere to sit other than on the bed and no real space for luggage And I wasn t pleased at being charged for the room six weeks before my stay I was happy to give my card details to secure the booking but didn t expect to be charged until we actually used the service , The room was clean the bed linen was high quality and the bathroom facilities were good 
212883,W12 Rooms, Rooms are extremely small No hangers for towels No space to for our cloth Really cramped Glass wall in bathroom is not great for intimacy I m not fan of seeing my girlfriend defecate while I m sitting on the bed because there s nowhere I can go except leaving the room , Clean trendy and very well located Nice staff Firm bed 
212884,W12 Rooms, Shower hadn t been cleaned properly No shelving at all for any toiletries in our bathroom Room in 4th floor no lift not too bad though , Excellent location right next to the tube station Very friendly helpful staff Room was small but ok Nice big new bathroom 
212885,W12 Rooms, Too many stairs after a long day of sightseeing the last thing you want to do is tackle 4 flights of stairs Very little interaction with the staff , The room was a good size and very clean and although on a very busy road there was little noise 
212886,W12 Rooms, The main road was noisy from 6am and even double glazing did not help but it was fine from midnight til 6am , The bed was comfortable and the bed linen snowy white it felt new and the towels were good quality Right next to the tube Unobtrusive staff 
212887,W12 Rooms, The pillows were very uncomfortable and too hard All 4 of them were the same so I didn t have any choice of a softer pillow , Nicely decorated rooms Great bathrooms and although the room was quite small it was only for one night so it was adequate 
212888,W12 Rooms,No Negative, Excellent hotel Arrived 20 minutes before check in but the room was ready and waiting Stayed in room 401 right up the top and the lovely gentleman offered to carry our bags despite only having 2 backpacks Room was wonderfully equipped and extremely clean and the bathroom was lovely The location was amazing 5 minutes from Westfield right next to Shepherds Bush station and 15 minutes walk from the Kensington Olympia which was our destination Cannot recommend more 
212889,W12 Rooms, I could no connect my laptop to the tv as it was in the wall but it was ok as the to has freeview, This hotel was amazing the staff were 100 and the room was lush as well as having a huge shower I will be staying here next time I am in London as its in top of the Westfield Center and next door to Shepherd s Bush station and only a 10 minute tube ride to the Center or a 30min walk and the sound proofing helps no end top top top place to stay
212890,W12 Rooms, Check out was too early 11am and the staff lady was very bad in calling and nocking on your door to ask me to leave even it was only 11 30am very bad When I asked ok want to stay half day and leave 5 30pm they said no you need to pay full day rate I told them but it is an international standard that if you check out at 6pm you pay half day rate not full rate but they insisted and charged me full day rate even I checked out at 5 30pm This was very bad to be treated like that from the management , Clean near to Westfield mall and many good restaurants around
212891,W12 Rooms, Wifi connection is very poor it is extremely slow unusable There was a visible spot on the bed linen the one that are resistant to washing machine We did not care that much and we did not complain about it anyway they changed them in a couple of day , The position is great it is just next door to the tube station and to Westfield shopping center so you do not need to carry with you your shopping bag all the day They offer you bottle water They change towels every day The room and the bathroom are quite big for London standard The staff is very kind and they also carried our bag on the stairs 
212892,W12 Rooms, A bit of traffic noise from the road at busy times , The room was very sensibly laid out and clearly a lot of thought had gone into the planning Nice big mirror with the hairdryer wall mounted next to it good temperature very comfy bed and really clean everywhere Great shower with lots of hot water and practical bathroom layout too Staff are really friendly and helpful This was my second stay and I will return again 
212893,W12 Rooms, No lift and no breakfast, The location is great just around the coner for shepherds Bush station The room was really nice and confortable very friendly staff 
212894,W12 Rooms,No Negative, Friendly welcome clean spacious secure room Reasonably priced parking nearby as well as tube and buses Great cinema adjacent as well Strongly recommended 
212895,W12 Rooms, Bathroom s heating didn t turn on and they could put more towel holders , Very cozy well located hotel and with an amazing decoration W12 Rooms was a good surprise and I would definetly stay there again 
212896,W12 Rooms, Rooms are quite small but I would t expect anything else for this price and so close to central London , Friendly staff well appointed and maintained rooms Great shower Sound proofing was good despite proximity to busy street Loads of coffee shops restaurants shops on the doorstep Reasonably priced car park in Westfield Great value for the quality of accommodation 
212897,W12 Rooms, Our room over the street on a busy city square was very noisy into the wee hours of the night the winter wind howled through cracks in the windows The shower controls were too modern in the sense that it was needlessly difficult to figure out how to operate them The deep valley bed offered no comfort The owners hadn t bothered to correct their front signage that incorrectly stated that breakfast was included , The location adjacent to the Shepherd s Bush underground station was convenient 
212898,W12 Rooms, N A, The rooms were of an amazing standard comfortable and clean Location was more than ideal next door to the tube station and bus terminal No traffic noise amazing 
212899,W12 Rooms, Noise from traffic Felt like I was sleeping in the middle of roundabout in Picadilly Circus Saying that I did sleep better than I thought I would as bed was very comfortable Also no warning that I would have to climb up two steep flights of stairs , Staff very helpful Location exactly what I needed Room pristine although very small 
212900,W12 Rooms, Nothing to complain about , Staff welcoming and friendly Room comfortable and clean Coffee tea making facilities were provided The proximity to tube station a great help in our stay 
212901,W12 Rooms, No other hotel facilities just a room Rooms very small The noise from outside kept my wife up most of the night , Rooms very clean and modern Plenty of good shops and restaurants nearby Changed our room without moaning when we complained of a smell from the bathroom 
212902,W12 Rooms,No Negative, Excellent reception staff night porter couldn t be more helpful and friendly Rooms perfect clean modern and cosy Small but that reflected in the price of a small single room Would highly recommend brilliant quality for such a central location 2min walk to Westfield 
212903,W12 Rooms,No Negative, We stayed here to attend a concert in the Empire theatre The location was fantastic for both the venue and the underground and overground train stations The staff were extremely helpful and courteous The room was beutifully decorated very clean and well equipped with all the necessities We also managed to squeeze in a bit of shopping due to the location beside Westfield Shopping Centre I would highly recommend and will stay here again 
212904,W12 Rooms, I had difficulty opening the safe box as it needed a private key initially which is usually with the management Nevertheless a staff was willing to open it for me but I was about to leave I ended up bringing my other valuables which made my bag quite heavy I wish it could be made a bit straightforward as guests are usually in a rush , The hotel was quite deceiving from outside due to its small door entrance What welcomed me initially was a staircase However the walls going up were tastefully decorated and had a cozy clean warm colour The reception was right in front of the first landing A staff welcomed me straight away There was no lift but a staff helped carry my luggage after the very check in The room was small but had a fridge flat screen clothes rack and safe box It was very clean and had a welcoming fresh fragrance I really loved The toilet had a contemporary shower and the temperature of water can easily be set The room ovorlooked the VUE and W12 shopping mall on the left side was the Shepherds Bush Tube Station and behind it literally just a few steps away was the Westfield Shopping Centre In spite of its proximity to the said landmarks and other ameneties as eating areas and tourist attractions the noise from outside did not wake me up from sleep The staff were friendly and accomodating The main hotel door was locked at late night and only the guests could enter using their room cards For all these positives I felt it was a good priced stay 
212905,W12 Rooms, One of the main reasons I booked this hotel was the soundproofing I stayed in Room 202 and could hear everything going on outside so the sound proofing didn t ring to be true in my room which meant I had a terrible night s sleep , The decor cleanliness of the hotel was perfect The staff were helpful always asking if I needed a hand with my case on the stairs there is no lift 
212906,W12 Rooms,No Negative, The room was small however perfect for what we needed our trip was to visit shepherd bush empire which was only a few minutes away perfect if you are going to a concert the staff were very helpful and always had a smile The room was clean Free tea coffee and fresh bottles of water a good size bathroom and clean a small fridge and a working hairdryer
212907,W12 Rooms, Very small room a little noisy no option of breakfast, Clean comfortable and modern decor Very close to the underground and the O2 Bush Empire for our gig 
212908,W12 Rooms, I phoned up the W12 Apartments prior to the trip to inform them that although I had booked it it was my wife and 2 daughters who would be arriving They said that was no problem but when they turned up they insisted I would have to supply ID and this was frustrating as I could have supplied them with it prior to my wife arriving, The location for the Shepherds Bush Concert was excellent 
212909,W12 Rooms, There is no lift however the staff will very kindly carry your luggage for you , Although the rooms were not very big they were very clean and comfortable 
212910,W12 Rooms,No Negative, The staff were so SO friendly and accommodating the d cor was amazing The rooms were small but beautiful and boutique style The hotel is basically ON the Shepherds Bush tube station to it couldn t be better for travellers Loved it
212911,W12 Rooms,No Negative, Efficient friendly and fast check in the room was very clean and everything was in perfect working order Great hairdryer which is unusual in hotels Although on a busy road it was well sound proofed so I slept very well and heard no traffic It is right next to Shepherd s Bush tube and close to the Westfield shopping centre so great location Staff were very friendly and I felt very secure in the room too 
212912,W12 Rooms, This hotel is not suitable for those who cannot climb stairs The bathroom cleanliness was not up to scratch more attention to details by housekeeping , The location is excellent for shopping at Westfields travelling into Central London Holland Park for walking Very comfortable bed and stylish decor 
212913,W12 Rooms, Rooms are quite small and there are a lot of stairs , W12 is in a great location located right beside the train underground Westfield shopping centre is literally on your doorstep I also got engaged here on 10 102015 
212914,W12 Rooms,No Negative, Having stayed at this hotel before I knew what to expect The rooms I ve stayed in here have been clean and comfortable Also very helpful and friendly staff Full marks from me 
212915,W12 Rooms, Nothing at all, Really lovely welcome on arrival staff couldn t have been more helpful or pleasant When we came back we were shown to our room which was beautifully clean and had everything we needed Much more than we actually expected Highly recommended and would definitely visit again Quiet and incredibly close to the tube Fantastic hotel 
212916,W12 Rooms, Not really a problem but the room we stayed in was on the 4th floor and no lifts not a spring chicken anymore to climb all those stairs Also no towel rail by the sink to hang your towel on or a shelf to put your bits and pieces on but they are minor details as we had a great stay , We really enjoyed our stay the room was great the bed was very comfortable staff really helpful Not very far from the 02 shepherds bush which was good Would stay here again Excellent
212917,W12 Rooms, Accommodation was lovely but the room was quite small I was solo in a double room I m not sure how comfortably two people would fit in with their luggage , The staff were fantastic Accommodation was lovely and had a lot of character Super close to a large shopping centre and well linked to transport It was great

212921,W12 Rooms, Wifi poor to non existent no lift to high floors room a little small, Extremely convenient next to the Tube and a huge shopping mall and a myriad of eateries Seemed newly renovated Nice bathroom facilities 
212922,W12 Rooms, Room smelt a bit musty and the plug in deodoriser was a bit too strong , Fantastic lighting in the room location re tube station fresh towels every day
212923,W12 Rooms, Initially walked straight past it as the door on the main street was not obvious and I was expecting to see banners as per the picture I saw when booking Room 101 The bathroom door opened so we had to negotiate the room door handle catching ourselves on it a time or two Could have done with the bathroom door opening the other way around A guide for where to get breakfast would have helped , Did exactly what we needed it for to stop over in London following a gig at the O2 Shepherds Bush Empire at a reasonable price Free wifi was great Shower better than most hotels Clean bright airy and not too noisy being on the road Compact and bijou room but high ceiling and air con ensured it wasn t stuffy 
212924,W12 Rooms, The hotel room was very cold and noise I could not sleep at all my air conditioning did not work I was keep asking the reception guy but nothing was sorted terrible hotel I will never come back Very disappointed taking in account the room price was quite expensive , Location
212925,W12 Rooms, that is now complaining at a high level two things in particular i didn t like the noise from the street allthough having two layers of windows and the carpet is extra soft so you might trip easy, the design is gorgeous the room is modern and very comfortable
212926,W12 Rooms, Nothing, Bianca really helped out She made it possible to have an extra person stay there even if everything was fully booked Faical was also very friendly 
212927,W12 Rooms, The hotel doesn t have a lift and the balcony where the fire escape is guests should have access to this it would add value to the hotel , Nice and pleasant clean rooms the location was PERFECT for what we needed Restaurants pubs cinema was right on our doorstep
