493362,Milan Marriott Hotel, Older hotel we had room with bad air condition They Tried to fix it Next day we asked to be changed to another room they did Marriott should update hotel, Nothing outstanding
493363,Milan Marriott Hotel, This is not worthy of being called aMarriott Hotel Terrible service 20 minutes to check in and everything wrong with the rooms like being given a single room for 2 persons We managed to change not thanks to reception but thanks to the concierge which was one of the few with service attitude,No Positive
493364,Milan Marriott Hotel, the whole experience in this hotel was bad, I was excited to book in this hotel as I am a marriott silver elite member and was my first time in Milan Unfortunately the location is not as I read it is far from the center and need like half an hour to get there Also the hotel is so oldd and there was ANTS in the room I was really scared when I saw the invasion of ants in bulks in the bathroom I talked with the front office manager at that time and showed her the pic of ants she changed the room but actually that was just a night before the departure and we were seeing ants from day one and calling housekeeping who used to come just put some antiseptic I am very disappointed the office manager mentioned a compensation for this but never received anything 
493365,Milan Marriott Hotel, The hotel is a bit old and the room s size was small The closest metro station Wagner station is around 750 meters away from the hotel 10 minutes walk which is not considered too close Price if fine Overall this hotel worths a try if you are staying a few days , The area of the hotel was OK A supermarket right in front of the hotel which made my stay more comfortable Staff were friendly 
493366,Milan Marriott Hotel, Looks old s the interior and not value for money and some fasility broken and the house keeping they not doing well, Customer service and transport was good
493367,Milan Marriott Hotel, The hotel is in a pleasant residential area with lots of restaurants and bars But it was further from the centre of Milan than I wanted and the WIFI was not included in my tariff, The room bed and bathroom were very comfortable and clean I must also mention the staff Both those in reception and especially the bar staff were very charming and helpful A hotel that understands the needs of travellors and offers the best type of professional service The price quality relationship was also very good 
493368,Milan Marriott Hotel, Apparently you can t adjust use the aircon in March and so I ended up with a fan in my room And whilst I understand there are cost implications polyester sheets and synthetic duvets are rarely conducive to a good night s sleep and especially when it s warm In a 4 hotel I d prefer cotton and down , I enjoyed great food and attentive service in the Bistro The shower worked well in the well equipped bathroom The concierge service for taxis etc is excellent

493371,Milan Marriott Hotel, The heating air con is centrally controlled which is unfortunate can only alter it a couple degrees Our room was too hot so had to keep opening and closing the window as the temperature changed which was cumbersome , Location great about 12 15mins from central station and 10mins 10 from Duomo and the central area Lovely hotel and across the road from a supermarket which is also a bonus 
493372,Milan Marriott Hotel, We have booked a queen bed at the check in they have informed us that booking com doesn t guarantee room preference so they have placed us in a tween bed room with my wife So we had to sleep in different beds for two nights Also we had two reservations 1 night each because an extra night was a last minute decision they knew it at the check in however forced me to check in the second time the other day Very stupid they could have done it automatically Luckily they didn t change the room for the second night , Room is nice overall
493373,Milan Marriott Hotel, Concierge were helpful but not knowledgable and gave wrong information which made us extremely disappointed , Its was a revisit since last april in 2015 Was check in by the knowledgable colleague Ms Tatayana of the front desk twice of my stay very humourous and polite Someone who is an asset to the Marriott International Group Would highly recommend this place for future reservations Staffs were extrememly helpful even from the heart of house colleagues A never say no spirit existed
