403250,Hotel Midmost, The room did not have complimentary coffee but did have a wide range of drinks and eats in the minibar , The location is absolutely perfect and the hotel is fantastic The deck area is amazing and the views from the roof are just breathtaking 
403251,Hotel Midmost, I do wish the hotel provided chairs to sit out on the balcony they are small but some folded up ones would be nice , Love love loved the roof terrace and the small swimming pool was great to refresh and cool down in though not much swimming could be had due to its size but we knew that before we travelled 
403252,Hotel Midmost, Wifi is free but logging in is unnecessarily complicated I had to go down to reception to solve the issue , The entrance and the lobby are nicely done The personnel was very friendly and the check in was fast and efficient same thing for the check out the room was very nice I don t really like having the bathtub directly in the bedroom but apart from that the bathroom was nicely done 
403253,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, Breakfast was very nice and the staff really helpful Hotel was in the best spot great for shopping and still walking distance to la rambla but away from the noise and crowds Loved it The rooftop pool and terrace area was lovely watching my daughter swim while having a cocktail was lovely 
403254,Hotel Midmost, Maybe incl breakfast and it would have been even more perfect , Everything from the helpful friendly Staff to the Absolut gorgeous hotel 5 star for sure It s more than a home away from home Sad to leave def coming back 
403255,Hotel Midmost, Rooftop bar closed too early we would have loved to stay longer , Great location near airport bus stop shops bars and restaurants Only a few minutes walk to Pla a de Catalunya Luxurious hotel room with lovely toiletries Great rooftop plunge pool 
403256,Hotel Midmost, We had a cot in the room which was a bit rickety and fingers could get caught in between fixings which did happen but baby slept with us so we weren t bothered by it too much , Beautiful hotel in a great location for exploring city on foot we walked everywhere Decor of hotel was lovely and the breakfast room was amazing as was the healthy food and juices Loved the room and ensure and the Super king bed was excellent 
403257,Hotel Midmost, There were a few down sides we had to tell them to clean the bedroom one day ok it was Easter Sunday the shampoo and body wash weren t replaced that often , Breakfast was amazing the terrace lovely to catch some sun The bedrooms and decor is stunning a great place to stay 
403258,Hotel Midmost, Initially booked superior room with terrace which was less than superior particularly in size shower water ran out of shower on to bathroom floor and there was no steam extractor fan the room was too small and therefore we changed rooms and ended up paying more for that , Service at reception was excellent after changing rooms as room booked was not what we expected the size cleanliness and presentation was great 
403259,Hotel Midmost, More water at the front desk just a joke there is a pitcher of water in the front lobby that was so refreshing when we came back to the hotel A few times we came in after someone ahead of us drained it We were disappointed but hey this is the only thing I can think of that I didn t like and I had to think hard to come up with this one thing , The people at every level front desk restaurant cleaning were very friendly and helpful They all made us feel welcomed and went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay and got the most out of our time in Barcelona with helpful hints on sights and public transportation and assistance with our room and eating Location was excellent near subways taxi stand out front walking distance to Playa Cataluna 24 hour shop across street restaurants around corner ATM a few door down The rooms are very nice and clean and modern Efficient use of space 
403260,Hotel Midmost, I didn t like the air freshener used in the public areas I think it was supposed to smell like strawberry Very artificial But my company did like it so this was personal and not really a complaint , Perfect location Very big room and clean Everyone was really friendly 
403261,Hotel Midmost, Nothing , Everything From the location to the staff everything was perfect especially for the money we paid Most of the sightseeing stuff was in walking distance of course except for Sagrada Familia and Park Guell The staff was really friendly and helpful They are always willing to help out if we need anything The facility was modern and clean The bed was really comfortable 
403262,Hotel Midmost, Would appreciate a bit more varety in the protein choice of the breakfast , Top location comfort design fixtures service staff Everything 
403263,Hotel Midmost, Could have done with some sound proof windows especially when Barcelona won the football game and they seemed to celebrate all night long , A beautiful boutique hotel very comfortable warm and welcoming Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Healthy breakfast and yummy Loved the roof top bar too Definitely recommend and I will certainly stay here again 
403264,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, Amazing hotel just perfect I love the taste of the hotel all details seems so outstanding Jacob Jensen telephones bronze deco white and midnight blue colours organic toiletries cotton slippers illustrated postcards warm and helpful staff great location Recommend everything 
403265,Hotel Midmost, The breakfast was quite pricey for the variety of food on offer, The location was brilliant the staff were really friendly and helpful and the room was clean
403266,Hotel Midmost, Nothing, amazing breakfast amazing stuff great design and perfect location We were at the hotel for our honeymoon and we have made a perfect choice The hotel is one of the best that you can find in town I m truly recommend it 
403267,Hotel Midmost, While there is a water heater and coffee machine in the room the price for a bag of tea or a Nespresso tab is shameless , Very good taste of the decoration
403268,Hotel Midmost, The only thing i have to complain is the view from the bedroom Straight to a wall And because of that it seemed to me a bit expensive, The room was really quiet and well decorated The location is great next to several points of interest and transportation 
403269,Hotel Midmost, The big bed is 2 mattresses connected When i see a hotel advertising a big bed I expect a real big bed and not 2 connected ones Noise from the outside is isolated pretty well but the noise from the corridor is unbearable if there is a family or many people in the nearby rooms they will make you go crazy while opening and closing the door for the whole morning , The blinds are really good despite there being a bright lamp outside when closed the room feels like a crypt A very good thing for me i like to sleep in any time of a day Perfectly located we didn t take the metro a single time Any tourist point of interest in the city is within a walking distance The staff did come only when we left as we did indicate by the door sign and didn t disturb our late sleep 
403270,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, Breakfast was very healthy and lovely quiet restaurant Bar on the 6th floor was a little expensive but well worth a visit Staff so pleasant and helpful Will stay here again 
403271,Hotel Midmost, Nothing but the way to close the door when end of breakfast I think it is not good They should take food with out close the door and leave coffee and tea for who want, The hotel is clean too much The staff are friendly friendly friendly Location is the best in Barcelona near for every things and front of hotel you will find mini market and Costa cafe and If I will back to Barcelona I will chose it again and I recommend it for all my friends
403272,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, I absolutely loved the location and I appreciated the small boutique size of this hotel It was spotlessly clean and beautifully appointed with white and gold trim We both found our room to be extremely quiet as we could never hear people coming or going in the hallways The staff was friendly and helpful and always greeted us with a wave or a cheery hola whenever we left or returned We would happily recommend this hotel to others and would consider returning ourselves if we go to Barcelona again It was close to absolutely everything we wanted to do and so handy to every type of transportation including the Hop On Hop Off Bus the Julia Tours office as well as the subway and the bus system 
403273,Hotel Midmost, The bathroom sink was modern glass and the water spilled off a lot Some noise first night from bar down the street second night was very quiet , The staff was very helpful Booked tickets gave directions etc The room was comfortable with a nice balcony rooftop set up 
403274,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, For Chinese visitors it is quite important to have hot water The hotel can provide heater if required We like the bathroom which is big clean and tidy 
403275,Hotel Midmost, As for now stay this way and it s gonna be the best place to stay in Bcn , Very helpful staff great breakfast and super nice interiors Great experience 
403276,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, Excellent style made me feel pampered as did the extremely professional and friendly staff Loved the hotel so much I almost forgot to leave during the day and enjoy the city 
403277,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, Beautifully stylish boutique hotel Few teething problems with the shower flooding due to plumbing issues Otherwise great Good location great staff Nice rooftop bar terrace 
403278,Hotel Midmost, The hotel could not provide a corkscrew either in the room or at the front desk , Great roof top bar staff beautiful modern rooms with windows that block out the street noise Super location with access to metro and Placa Catalunya for amenities and airport transfer 
403279,Hotel Midmost, Towels are so used up i d suggest to bring your own towels Rooms are a bit too small if you have larger luggages , The location is perfect staff are very friendly and helpful clean rooms and nice balcony view 
403280,Hotel Midmost, Cleaning staff were so noisy and woke us up Mini bar wasn t stocked for a 3 days they only gave us tiny towels on the last day , Nice hotel friendly staff and convenient location 
403281,Hotel Midmost, The bed was 2 singles pushed together and through the night would slowly be pushed apart When you spend money on a premium room I would have preferred a proper queen sized bed This would be my only criticism though, The hotel was very clean and beautifully decorated There was a very cool roof terrace and the pool although small very refreshing on those hot summer days The staff were very helpful and friendly 
403282,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, It was a very pleasant return to a well located and very comfortable hotel I simply enjoyed my stay The new branding and fresh look is very welcoming 
403283,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, The staff were all extremely helpful and pleasant and made our stay extra special I have to give a special mention to Ingrid the manager who went out of her way to give us information and suggestions of places to visit which enhanced our stay in Barcelona 
403284,Hotel Midmost, Rooftop poolis 3 deep, Definitely amazing location although I travelled with children this is not necessarily a kid friendly hotel Rooftop terrace very quiet even with windows facing a major street
403285,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, I like this hotel so much I was there 2 years ago when the hotel called Inglaterra Barcelona and I back again this year I like everything and I want to come back again 
403286,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, The location is amazing just few steps from pra a catalunya las ramblas shopping streets and nice restaurants The staff was very friendly and kind and gave very good restaurant recommendations I would definetely recommend you to stay in Midmost if you want to enjoy barcelona in a confortable and relaxing way Whenever I go back Midmost will be my choice of hotel in Barcelona Also very close to all public transportations buses metro and also the aerobus 
403287,Hotel Midmost, No complaints , Gorgeous hotel Perfect location Close the the lively Las Ramblas but tucked away enough to be quiet Roof top bar and pool are very relaxing Room was beautiful 
403288,Hotel Midmost,No Negative, All staff was very helpful and very pleasant Location is great and is very convenient for all amenities including transport We really enjoyed our stay at Midmost will highly recommend this hotel
403289,Hotel Midmost, Even though the A C works fine and is quiet I always find it a bit weird when the windows can t be opened Only four sunbeds next to the pool on the rooftop that are always occupied but loads of empty tables Other than that the place is really great , Really well refurbished hotel situated just off Placa de Catalunya close to lots of bars restaurants and metro stations 5 minute footwalk to Boqueria Market Pool on the rooftop is not suited for lane swimming but to cool down with a glass of cava in your hand it is perfect 
403290,Hotel Midmost, Nothing , The hotel is centrally located The breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious Best of all was the front desk staff Helpful friendly and answered all of our questions Maribel the front office manager was a delight She assisted us in so many ways and really helped make our stay at the hotel so wonderful 
403291,Hotel Midmost, We had 2 superior rooms one of which was significantly larger and nicer than the other these rooms should not have been in the same price category The roof terrace could be nice but is full of very uncomfortable table and chairs instead of relaxing seating Also no proper introduction was given by staff and had to ask many questions to get standard information , Great location and recently refurbished
403292,Hotel Midmost, I think the breakfasts need some rethinking as they were not value for money as there are many places around that offer better value , This was our second stay at this hotel and the only hotel we stayed in that offered tea coffee making facilities When we stayed the first time the refurbishments were nearly completed but they were completed just before our second stay Very good location close to tourist areas and many restaurants around Staff very helpful 
403293,Hotel Midmost, The bathroom amenities weren t refilled daily like the tissues and the shampoo The entrance door of the hotel is extremely annoying for anyone sitting in the reception because when after someone opens the door it BANGS back when it closes , The Hotel was very clean and was within walking distance to La Ramblas and the Marina The staff was very kind and helpful at all times The WiFi was free and fast The ambience of the hotel is very calm and I really loved it especially with the design
