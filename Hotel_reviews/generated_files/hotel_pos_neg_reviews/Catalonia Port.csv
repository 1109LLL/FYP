269113,Catalonia Port, There was not steps or ladder into the pool Therefore it was difficult to get out of the pool , The location was ideal and the facilities were excellent It was very clean housekeeping came everyday 
269114,Catalonia Port, Indoor Lounge area didn t really have much personality A bit stark , Nice swimming pool and water fountains Nice outdoor lounge area The free drinks and tapas at five were greatly appreciated Very helpful and friendly staff 
269115,Catalonia Port,No Negative, Great location close to the beach shopping and various sights Excellent breakfast buffet with a wide selection of different foods as well as excellent coffee Very friendly and helpful front office staff at the reception 
269116,Catalonia Port, There was a problem with a sewage smell on the ground floor We were staying there so it was a little unpleasant which was too bad because the room itself was wonderful The smell was in the hallway and in the room but had nothing to do with our bathroom There were no problems with floors above the ground floor There are only two rooms on the ground floor so no worries for most bookers Please note that we noticed throughout Barcelona that suddenly there could be the same sewage smell especially the closer you get to the water in the city We really don t want to fault this great place for that Just be aware about ground floor two rooms and ask about staying floor 1 and above , The staff were great They gave us champagne when we showed up They helped us get a good taxi to the cruise port Kevin was very personable and helpful The room was clean and modern nicely appointed 
269117,Catalonia Port,No Negative, Stunning boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona but very quiet Lovely terrace and swimming pool Afternoon snacks drinks complimentary Shower huge Would stay here every time

269119,Catalonia Port, There was nothing we didn t like , We stayed in the Junior Suite with excellent views and a hot tub on the terrace The cleanliness of the room was fantastic and the staff throughout the hotel couldn t do enough for you Breakfast had a great selection in the buffet Added bonus free afternoon tea from 5pm 
269120,Catalonia Port, Room was advertised as having separate twin beds which wasn t a surprise but it was a bit strange that they were made separately then pushed together to look like one large bed There was also a shelf in the shower that hadn t been cleaned although everything else was fine , Customer service was fantastic The welcome drink and chocolates in the room were a lovely touch Location is great at the end of the gothic quarter and close to the beach Tons of restaurants and shops nearby

269122,Catalonia Port, The fact you had to park away from the hotel and it made getting luggage there difficult , The room was spacious modern and very clean The staff were helpful and friendly The location was brilliant just a few steps into the port area and the centre could not have been better The only thing is you cannot park at the hotel have to park in a secure carpark up the street which made getting luggage to hotel laborious as you cannot park outside to offload Otherwise perfect We will stay there again it was all in all a really good hotel

269129,Catalonia Port, Can t think of a thing , Location It was so easy to walk everywhere the Gothic Quarter is charming and the beach is a 15 minute walk away Room 2nd floor balconey above entrance was a good size Didn t use the pool but the terrace was a lovely place to drink wine and nibble on the tapas that are free with Tea All of the staff were friendly and helpful We don t usually add breakfast to our reservations but we did this time and it was worth it

269138,Catalonia Port, Nothing, Beautiful boutique hotel with fantastic customer service from moment we arrived Thanks Kyle you made our stay Glass of bubbly upon check in complimentary tapas in evenings Great location and facilities Proximity to loads of quaint little tapas bars and restaurants and overall great value for money 
269139,Catalonia Port,No Negative, Close to les rambles and on the port Free wifi and complementary champagne on arrival Staf were friendly and room was great Views from rooms are non existent but it is an enclosed city hotel 
269140,Catalonia Port, The air conditioning in the room didn t work for heating so when we arrived it was 17 in the room then maximum 19 The guy at the reception was very helpful and gave us a heater for the 2nd night but our daughter in the next room also was cold so she took it and they didn t have another one The water in the shower was also very cold the first minutes so we had to wait The other thing I didn t like too much there s no view from the windows And the last one I didn t expect to be charged for our dog which is only 1 7 kg weight It was the first hotel who charged us ever and we travelled a lot with it , There are 2 great things about this hotel the location and the tea with snacks in the evening The stuff was also nice and helpful 
269141,Catalonia Port, No coffee tea making facilities in room TV in room had very few channels in English much less than TV guide in room indicated and BBC World news repeated issues all day into the following day , Spacious large bed Reception staff helpful Complementary tapas and soft drinks available from 17 30 to 23 00
269142,Catalonia Port, Nothing all was pretty good, Very nice and polite people wanting to help you Clean and spacious rooms late afternoon free tapas in lobby bar No stress and good organization Great location close to everything walking 
269143,Catalonia Port, Hotel was a little overheated , Location of hotel was excellent and the hotel was excellent value for money Staff were very pleasant and rooms were nice 
269144,Catalonia Port, Too expensive it is not a four stars Room very standard othing exceptional access to Terrasse too complex food quite basic It is not a bad hotel but price should be definitely below 100E And access by car is too difficult I do not recommend ,No Positive
269145,Catalonia Port, really underwhelming building For four star and not cheap I was expecting a little bit of the wow factor I have seen more impressive entrance receptions in hostels So was pretty disappointed really And like all hotels the mini bar is a rip off but at least they provided a free bottle of water , really clean and interior was nice
269146,Catalonia Port, The swimming pool was very small For the price paid we may have been able to get an hotel with a bigger pool , The location was excellent for sight seeing close to the Port and La Ramblas Welcome was so warm a great start to our holiday Staff were the best I have come across and Alan printed out boarding passes for our return journey Rooms were very comfortable We had a little balcony which was nice We were looking directly into an office but hotel is in a generally pleasant area and there were lots of other things in view as well Breakfast was very nice but a bit on the expensive side We had dinner on one night in the hotel restaurant It was very nice and value for money Overall we felt very comfortable in this hotel and would return again 
269147,Catalonia Port, Although there was a nice terrace with comfortable sun lounger and small pool I would not enjoy lying there as there are many high houses arround not a nice view However it was not a matter for us as we hadn t time to spend on the pool anyway just to be mentioned, Very good located near La Rambla many further restaurants and port Receptionist was really friendly and helpful Room was nice Snacks and coffee were served for free in the afternoon Breakfast huge variety of food there was nothing we missed Nespresso machine
269148,Catalonia Port, The restaurant we would suggest a local restaurant close by of which there are many The waiting staff could not be faulted but the food needed more attention temperature wise and flavouring We were the only people that night in the restaurant Cannot comment on breakfast as we were out and about first thing We did pass our comments on at the hotel they apologised and cancelled the bill ,No Positive
269149,Catalonia Port, The only thing that could be improved is that the hot meals of the breakfast like bacon eggs and sausages were not kept warm Otherwise the breakfast was very good , Very nice hotel with a perfect location We would love to come back 
269150,Catalonia Port, Pillows uncomfortable Our room subject to a lot of plumbing noise from other rooms They were rather stingy with the soap Asked twice for extra and were given one extra standard tiny hotel soap once I think 30 euro per night for an upgrade to have in room coffee and tea making facilities was too much, Generally good really clean really good location
269151,Catalonia Port, Nothing , Very good location close to a metro station La Rambla the gothic quarter and marina Very comfortable hotel with very helpful and friendly staff 
269152,Catalonia Port, We where switched to catalonia ramblasl without notice and had to wait for the transfer the rest was fine Nice rooms and good location, Good location and rooms
269153,Catalonia Port, It was a pity that the hotel restaurant was closed for the month of August Also the bar arrangements could be improved But this does not distract from the overall impression of the hotel , The hotel was ideally suited to exploring the Gothic Quarter with its quirky streets and excellent small locally owned shops The Barcelona transport system also made it a great base for getting about the entire city and surrounding countryside The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful
269154,Catalonia Port, It was extremely difficult to get the rooms we wanted for the dates we wanted The staff struggled to understand and meet our needs They spoilt the surprise for my wife by telling her the kids had arrived Late check out was very confusing and even after 12 nights at the hotel got charged extra , The location is convenient 
269155,Catalonia Port, A welcome drink whilst checking in , Excellent breakfast wide range of food choice Stayed in Junior Suite perfect to relax from the hustle bustle of the city Polite friendly staff Clean modern hotel Central location close to all tourist attractions perfect 
269156,Catalonia Port, Nothing, Air conditioning a major plus Complimentary tea finger food every afternoon between 5 7 Hotel was spotless and staff were very friendly and helpful 
269157,Catalonia Port, Very disappointed that my request for two single beds had been ignored I was travelling with my teenage granddaughter and only one bed was very awkward , Light airy room with a view over the pool 
269158,Catalonia Port, Nothing , This is our third time to stay at the Catalonia Port Hotel and the standard is still as high as it was the first time Staff are very helpful and pleasant The bedrooms and bed very comfortable and quiet I would stay again when in Barcelona as it is very convenient to Las Ramble and all facilities 
269159,Catalonia Port, I think we had the worst room in the house room 107 it had no real window, Large room good bed nice shower very friendly helpfull staff afternoon snack drinks lovely terrace with small pool
269160,Catalonia Port, Nothing, The room was wonderful and the staff were more than helpful a little hidden gem of a hotel in a busy city We would stay again the suite and hot tub after a day s sightseeing was pure bliss 
269161,Catalonia Port, Leaving to go home , Excellent location to La Rambla port area we stayed after arriving by cruise caught the shuttle bus from port to Mirador de Colom only stop then a short 5 minute easy walk to hotel Staff couldn t be more helpful Clean comfortable rooms Decent breakfast with enough choice to satisfy the pickiest eater 
269162,Catalonia Port, No toilet brush bad sound insulation of a room heard neighbor showering , Very good breakfast nice staff location next to the Rambla and Gothic quarter comfortable room
269163,Catalonia Port, Tidying of room by cleaner was limited she didn t remove dirty cups and removed bed runner on one of the beds Weren t many sun beds around pool, Reception staff friendly and helpful Location superb
269164,Catalonia Port, Tea Coffee in the room and tissues in the bathroom would of been great Small details , Wonderful Staff amazing location Clean rooms lovely balconies 
269165,Catalonia Port, For the higher cost of this hotel mattresses were basic should have been better , Location on a quiet low traffic street that was closer to the water Great balcony overlooking the street Double windows to balcony really cut out street noise Pleasant pool area nice place to relax late afternoon after a long day Staff were outstanding Manager who was working desk when we arrived was helpful and offered us a glass of cava Other staff were also extremely helpful and pleasant Nice bathroom and shower Also we needed parking and the hotel has close safe and secure parking available upon request 
269166,Catalonia Port, On our floor there were a very loud group of people who partied from 5am 7am banging doors and going in and out of each others room constantly However this is not the fault of the hotel obv but was very irritating when trying to sleep , Staff were brilliant we arrived very early 9am as we were just off a cruise there was no problem leaving our bags there and we were told we could check in around 1pm supposed to be 2pm When we returned at 1pm our room was ready we were giving a glass of cava and told our bags were already in the room The pool area was very clean and relaxing with chairs in the shade as well as directly in the sun Free snacks between 5pm and 8pm 
269167,Catalonia Port, The hotel pre charged 1 night for both rooms I booked as the pre authorization charge by the time for checking out the pre authorization charge still not re funded as yet The amenity supplies in the bathroom are not up to the standard of any other 4 hotel Hotel should at least provide 1 bottle of drinking water everyday not only at the 1st day of the stay , Location is absolutely the best the quality of the breakfast worth its value 
269168,Catalonia Port,No Negative, A perfect hotel at a great location Good atmosphere and a delicious breakfast I really liked it next time in Barcelona I will stay in this hotel again 
269169,Catalonia Port, Breakfast was not included in the room price but there were plenty of good little cafes nearby Tea and coffee making facilities in the room would have been appreciated , The hotel was welcoming and stylish I liked the hotel and would go again The staff were great particularly the receptionist who looked after my friend s purse when she left it behind one day We would have enjoyed the little secluded sun deck and pool if it hadn t rained bucketed down all weekend Excellent soundproofing in rooms much needed on a narrow busy street 
269170,Catalonia Port,No Negative, very helpful and friendly people working there great location or old city beach and marina all round very good nice touches like free afternoon tea coffee snacks
269171,Catalonia Port,No Negative, The hotel was modern stylish immaculate and had a friendly atmosphere It was in a good situation the neighbourhood is safe and it is within walking distance of everything After one night we had already booked to move to a posh hotel up the road but after a couple of nights there I wish I had stayed my whole time in Barcelona at this hotel It is extremely good value for money 
269172,Catalonia Port, We were room only and did not eat there their lunch dinner menu was not to our taste, The staff were excellent everything about the room was very good with a nice big walk in wet room shower when we arrived we were offered a glass of bubbly the room also had a view of the pool and terrace which was nice we also enjoyed the location and would stay there again and would also recommend this hotel to anyone 
269173,Catalonia Port, There was no warm water in the shower I assume that this was an exceptional situation break down , Very friendly Canadian Spanish personal taking care of reception and lobby area Loacaiton is central in respect to many things to visit I most likely will come back 
269174,Catalonia Port,No Negative, The hotel is very clean the location is in the center but not too much so it is not noisy and still just a short walk from the Ramblas the gothic qtr and the port The staff is very friendly looking for help and to make your stay always better 
269175,Catalonia Port,No Negative, The staff were lovely and really helpful We were lucky enough to get tickets to El Clasico and a staff member was kind enough to walk us to the bus stop to show us how to get to the Nou Camp The room was spacious and had everything you needed with a huge shower 
269176,Catalonia Port,No Negative, The staff at the desk were amazing they couldn t do enough for us Location really close to fantastic bars and cafes 15 mins walk to the beach with a little person

269178,Catalonia Port,No Negative, Everything was excellent staff food location Everyone kind to me travelling as a widow and staying one night before departing on Cruise Breakfast was decreased to 15 Euros at front desk but was charged 19 Euros I did not complain as I received excellent service and did not wish to walk around looking for a cafe in the morning 
269179,Catalonia Port, Nothing, Very clean bedrooms and bathrooms high standard Staff very helpful and friendly Nice little Free buffet provided between 5pm and 8pm Would highly recommend Convenient for Las Ramblas Gothic quarter Promenade Cruise terminal and also bars restaurants and shops
269180,Catalonia Port, Perhaps the juices should be powder juices improved for breakfast, Fantastic place in the old town Deltious offerings for breakfast except juices Friendly and courteous staff
269181,Catalonia Port, All good if anything just the shower which was a large walking shower sometimes water went hotter then back to temperature you set , Excellent position all staff extremely friendly and helpful everywhere clean and comfortable Nice touch afternoon tea coffee sandwiches and cakes free for a few hours Was pleased when arrived early was told after a phone call that our room was ready 
269182,Catalonia Port, Was disappointed with the continental breakfast we had in our room on my wife s birthday thought it was expensive for what we got the buffet breakfast was well worth the money though, Quality of the staff from the manager to the cleaner all went out there way to help The complementary tea in the afternoon was a pleasant surprise
269183,Catalonia Port, Heating in room was inexistant when it was put on only cold air came out no duvet just an extra very welcome blanket Problem with key card demagnatised 4x but again no problem for the staff and sorted with a smile , Excellent location friendly and helpful staff breakfast is worth it 
269184,Catalonia Port, nothing to add, Reception Jan in particular was excellent Parking nearby a real bonus Location couldn t really have been better We ll be back 
269185,Catalonia Port, There is nothing not to like This is a clean efficient spacious city hotel , Location is excellent easy walk to the metro subway even with two big suitcases Yes the breakfast at 19euros although have a deal on at the moment February 2016 for 12euros is expensive so SIMPLE don t eat breakfast at the hotel there are plenty of local cafes bars just up the street 50m where you can get a good breakfast for two for 6euros Staff were extremely friendly efficient proactive and went above and beyond the call of duty a credit to the hotel If we ever go back to Barcelona then will definitely stay here again 
269186,Catalonia Port, Didn t like unloading the car in such a tiny narrow Street also we thought the balcony was a bit high and restricted the view at the back end of the room , Loved the Antique doors that were used and the layout of the hotel Also the manager was very helpful 
269187,Catalonia Port, Would be better if tea coffee making facilities were available in the room Also I think re pricing breakfast as a strategy would be good for both guests and hotel too expensive proposition versus availability of cheaper alternatives around the hotel , Staff very helpful and friendly Location walk away from harbour and Las Ramblas great for the morning run on the beach and shopping afterwards Room was spacious well equipped and balcony was a plus As hotel has no in room service hotel helped with food delivery 
269188,Catalonia Port, There was nothing to dislike , Staff were lovely Breakfast more than adequate Free tapas were a bonus and a nice way to meet with other people staff Location excellent within easy walking distance of Gothic quarter La Ramblas Port Vell and also hop on hop off tour bus Room was spacious clean and quiet 4th floor

269190,Catalonia Port,No Negative, We were moved from Catalonia Port to Catalonia Square on arrival so reviews are for Catalonia Square which is an amazing hotel Staff were extremely helpful both in the relocation of our room exceptional circumstances necessitated the change and upon arrival at the new hotel Would recommend Catalonia Square and the hotel chain also to anyone visiting Barcelona 
269191,Catalonia Port,No Negative, Location was great It s in the gothic quarter old town area 5 mins walk to the port and bottom part of Las Ramblas Lots of quaint tapas restaurants close by and cafes for coffees and pastries Small and clean hotel Very friendly staff We stayed in the suite 501 Modern small room with large bathroom and walk In shower The best part about it was our private roof top terrace with hot tub However the hot tub isn t hot it s warm We used it on the first night but that was it Wasn t very clean either For the price we paid I didn t think it was good value for money The views were lovely thou and we enjoyed sitting outside of an evening Barcelona is a lovely city We honestly didn t spend that much time in the room until the evening Fab tapas restaurant close by called Sensi highly recommend 
269192,Catalonia Port, My only criticism would be that there was no iron ironing board available at the hotel which we found about half the hotels we stayed at Spain did For a nice hotel I would expect this to be standard, Charming hotel in a fantastic location Staff were very knowledgable and spoke English well Anticipating our early arrival 10 00 they already had our room ready for us Room was very comfortable and we enjoyed our balcony overlooking the street
