162798,Hotel Whistler,No Negative, I loved the quaintness of this boutique hotel The staff were really friendly and helpful The bedroom and bathroom were really clean The breakfast was adequate I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others 
162799,Hotel Whistler, The room was very small without any view Lobby was also small for 4 stars hotel, Hotel staff were very nice and cooperative including the manager Breakfast was very good and specially the staff organizing the breakfast was perfect Location is perfect from every point of view 
162800,Hotel Whistler, There was not one thing that I did not like , While the room was small understandably so due to location it was amazingly designed and organized In fact the hotel in general made the most of the existing space in creative and gorgeous ways I was deeply impressed 
162801,Hotel Whistler, No seating in room , Very clean comfortable and well located for the train station and connections into central Paris Lovely staff very comfortable if small room 
162802,Hotel Whistler, Rooms rather small , Newly renovated boutique hotel a few meters from Gare du Nord Very nice clean rooms very sound proof Perfect airco Exceptionally friendly staff 
162803,Hotel Whistler, Let see Need to go there again but it will be difficult to find maybe something , Everything was perfect first of all the staff was very well prepared even in terms of languages Very sympatical and efficient Location is good No more than 100m from Gare du Nord and 50m from underground entrance Decoration is very nice Everything gives to the hotel a very nice atmosphere Very good value for leisure and business purpose 
162804,Hotel Whistler, The Neighbourhood , Rooms are bigger than expected and have a train sleeper car decoration which is interesting but also functional Bed was exceptional 
162805,Hotel Whistler,No Negative, Very nice staff that make you feel welcome and give a life to the hotel The hotel has a theme to it you on board a train and travelling so it makes you enjoy it so much more It seemed very small from the outside but it just made everything so accessible and convenient especially as a business traveller Room was impeccably clean and big The bathroom was spacious bright and very clean too 
162806,Hotel Whistler, Nothing big really key didn t work first time wifi was a bit slow but minor things , Location was key for me close to the station Quality of the hotel is great an oasis of rest and silence knowing the busy area of the train station Breakfast was very good very nice room and bathroom not very large but big enough for a short stay 
162807,Hotel Whistler, My room Was supposed to be a twin but was a double but the staff were very quick to offer a solution , Right next to Gard de Nord which we needed very clean friendly staff
162808,Hotel Whistler, Although the location of the hotel is pretty central there are a lot of strange people walking around trying to sell something people fighting screaming and also a lot of homeless people So I would not recommend to walk around this area when it s late or if you are alone , The hotel has a very nice interior and is very clean The rooms are not big but comfortable Bathroom is modern and big enough Comfortable bed The location is good close to the Gare du Nord train station and it takes 10 15min to go to the city center by train and about 15min on foot to reach Sacre Coeur cathedral A lot of nice restaurants and cafes around Price is fair 
162809,Hotel Whistler, room a bit small only good for 1day sleep business visit few toilet amenities, Best price compare to any nearby i e Mercure Terminus Nord which was super ugly and horrible super new clean modern hotel big steam room for a boutique hotel great location to Gare du Nord Good staff at reception very helpful and friendly 
162810,Hotel Whistler, It was disappointed No way this hotel can be a 4 hotel I do not know how rated 9 the staff or someone who never been in a 4 hotel The closet was tiny I put the blouses above the coffee mugs No shelf for t shirtsale or underwear A tiny taburet No place to put the soap in the shower I was a real disappointment It ruined a holiday that started wonderful in Deauville I will never use this site again because it is clear that the reviews are not correct, The staff was friendly and cleaning ok
162811,Hotel Whistler, Nothing really It is a hotel in central Paris so the rooms are not huge if that is what you need But they were certainly not small plenty of room for what I needed , Excellent hotel in central Paris just opposite GDN Perfect for Eurostar and CDG connecting train Exactly what I needed The most refreshing element was that the hotel had real character not just a set of boxes with a fancy lobby like most hotels around the world They had gone to town on giving the feel of the glory days of the Orient Express A really pleasurable place to stay The staff could not have been more helpful and seemed genuinely proud of their hotel It gave the place a really happy atmosphere in Paris I know It was great value for money I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a convenient base in Paris 
162812,Hotel Whistler,No Negative, To be honest I was a bit afraid of choosing a hotel so close to the train station because I thought there might be the risk of paying too much money for a finally low level What I experienced in reality 2 minutes to walk from Gare du Nord Completely renovated new hotel All employees were really and honestly friendly and attentive and they obviously identified themselves with their job The concierge carried my daughthers suitcase upstairs and explained the theme idea of the hotel with abandon The breakfast was really good incl fresh scrambled eggs Due to the excellent location close to the metro hub Gare du Nord all destinations for excursions were easy to reach Would go there again immediately 
162813,Hotel Whistler, nothing, Location of Whistler was perfect for my trip Close the all the transport train metro and tour buses The room was comfortable clean and cosy brilliant bed and the bed linen luxurious Good breakfast and the staff exceptional All the great sites are walkable 
162814,Hotel Whistler, The hotel is very nice an welcoming but the area is not very welcoming, Great location if you need to travel through Gard du Nord The hotel is very nice Rooms are small French standard The area is a bit off and not extremely friendly
162815,Hotel Whistler, We were never able to get ventilation to work It was stuffy unless we opened windows and then street noise was loud Breakfast was expensive so we passed Make sure to get two keys otherwise you could leave your partner in the dark , Location was fabulous for the train station Fun decorations New hotel Excellent wifi Small room and bathroom but expected for Paris Well organized within allotted space with big sink and shower Nice placement of outlets Comfortable bed and pillows Soundproofed windows Good elevator Pleasant staff Phone in room dial 9 for front desk 
162816,Hotel Whistler, Needs a small refrigerator in the rooms , Quaint Cosy Efficient amenities 
162817,Hotel Whistler, None, Clean Modern design nice WIFI stuff is friendly close to airport
