11259,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Nothing that I can think of , Brilliant A wonderful property with excellent staff Nothing is too much trouble Incredible attention to detail regarding my preferences from previous stays VERY expensive but worth it for a really indulgent stay 
11260,Milestone Hotel Kensington,No Negative, Timeless elegance to this lovely hotel The staff made you feel special and on hand to help This was a very special treat for us and it was the right choice of hotel 
11261,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Nothing, The room we were given looked better than your pictures Staff were amazingly helpful and when we left I felt as though good friends were saying good bye to us Very personalised service Superb breakfasts
11262,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Room size was so small we could not put any luggage on the floor which means completely unpacking and storing it or putting it under the bed The sitting area was really too small to eat at when we ordered room service Would have liked a view of the park as it was just a sliver Twice the hot water disappeared in the middle of a shower and twice someone was walking on the roof early in the am which woke us up We made our complaints know so hopefully resolved for next guest , The service was absolutely exceptional and they were so welcoming and constant attention to your every need was worth a return trip for sure Exceptional staff and willing to go overboard to make sure you feel like it is your home away from home They were kind enough to store our luggage for a side trip outside of london that we took prepare flowers for an event we attended and clean an outfit that another restaurant spilled on The bar staff especially Jacamo and Angelo were not only a delight but truly made our stay with their personalities and care It was nice to return to them after a day of site seeing or event attending Always upbeat staff The structure itself and decor was so well done and enjoyed the colors and style very much So english and beautiful Nice detail touches the ribbons on the table in the dining room and all the flowers were so well done A romantic and picturesque hotel worth staying at Air conditioner was great 
11263,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Beds are very high in case you are travelling with very small children and they fall off the bed Other than that the hotel and staff were excellent , Friendliness of staff who went above and beyond to make the hotel feel like home 
11264,Milestone Hotel Kensington,No Negative, The staff at the Milestone is what makes this place great I ve never stayed in a hotel with such friendly and helpful staff The hotel is small boutique yet the facilities are great it was pretty amazing to see how much they could fit into this place The location is also ideal just a short walk to the park across the street and close to shopping restaurants and the underground 
11265,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Not worthwhile noting negatives, Possibly the best overall hotel experience especially in UK that we hav experienced in recent years Staff exceptional and apart from one or two genuinely engaged with guests Congratulations to management n staff

11269,Milestone Hotel Kensington, at 2 pm Our room not ready and the check in was too late around 4 pm and early check out 12 45 pm maximum It s too small in space and the break fast by order menu not an open buffet Massage room not prepared for that purpose And it s not too close to shopping center need a taxi , Friendly staff vintage English style Hotel So quite and lovely live night musician I feel such as I live in my own home 
11270,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Pool area could do with some TLC Sauna was good though , Overall service was excellent couldn t do enough to serve your stay The breakfast selection was very good and all at a high standard 
11271,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Bed a little firm but that s a personal choice and not a reflection on the quality and supberb facilities , The attention to detail throughout the enture Hotel should have a rating 11 out of 10 
11272,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Room is very very small Especially the bathroom Hard to walk or eat in the room when you have luggages , Very warm friendly polite and helpful staff I really like them Hotel location is perfect Walking distance to bus and station You could walk to Harrods as well Right face to Kensington Palace I love go jogging there in the morning 
11273,Milestone Hotel Kensington,No Negative, The Milestone was absolutely beautiful filled with character The staff were outstanding always polite with nothing too much trouble First Class We will certainly be back All staff were impeccably dressed acted in a professional manner at all times Everything was immaculately clean All the meals were beautifully presented 
11274,Milestone Hotel Kensington, That we had to leave , Warm and welcoming atmosphere and staff Lovely homely room Quiet Excellent breakfast We loved the various home made m eslis and the ready diced fresh fruits 
11275,Milestone Hotel Kensington,No Negative, Very nice hotel and during our staying we enjoy seating in restaurant was our order afternoon tea and thanks for all staff who service us during our stay in hotel 
11276,Milestone Hotel Kensington,No Negative, The hotel was just fabulous in every respect but it was the staff who really made it different from other similar starred properties in London I was given a mini tour on arrival and a potted history of the building before being shown to my small but beautifully decorated room and given a welcome drink The area was so quiet and the bed extremely comfortable I opted for the healthy option at breakfast which was delicious and everyone I met made me feel extremely special I only stayed for one night but received lots of little gifts in that time I would certainly stay again Yes it was an expensive treat but makes a special occasion extra special and worth every penny 
11277,Milestone Hotel Kensington,No Negative, Afternoon tea was lovely The service was impressive and we really adored Fran who gave us a tour of the hotel and was most helpful in meeting all our needs From the bell hop to the concierge this hotel had the best service we ve ever experienced and we frequently travel via 5 star establishments We will return many times I m sure 
11278,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Cannot think of anything other than the pool was a bit small but it is Central London so a pool was a bonus for our boys , The staff was amazing meeting all of our needs and more Locating a sitter for my boys providing games water for our walks and scooters in the park They were fabulous The location is perfect right across from Kensington Gardens 
11279,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Bit expensive , The staff were very good especially the doorman who helped us consistently the decor was very plush although we were left with no toilet paper one day after the room was serviced 
11280,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Too much knocking on my door in order to be at service sometimes less is the best , Everything was outstanding got upgraded asked for extra day and stayed in my upgraded room for price of smaller one awesome staff warm room fantastic breakfast and service want to go back now 
11281,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Some of the upholstery in the lounge needed replacing , The friendliness of all the staff without being overpowering nothing was too much trouble The bedroom was immaculate with a very comfortable queen size bed The two evening meals we had in the restaurant were superb

11287,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Use of lounge for afternoon tea service tends to put you off using lounge for relaxation as all places are laid for tea service One can still use lounge but I felt I was intruding in some way , Level of service is excellent Great location
11288,Milestone Hotel Kensington, The lounge is used as a venue for afternoon tea so cannot be used just to relax and read etc One can use the bar or conservatory but these are not as comfortable as lounge , Service levels are excellent This is a small boutique hotel so the rooms are on the small side but the level of service provided by the staff is incomparable I just love this hotel 
11289,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Room far too small, Location excellent decor staff excellent however we were in room 105 so small and difficult to even move around disappointing I would think for the price to to expensive for such a small room
11290,Milestone Hotel Kensington, Price too high for facilities and room size Low ceiling due to the stairs at the entrance of the room Limited options for an English breakfast Besides the 5 types of meals which I skipped for a scrambled egg option no other foods were available expected more fruits and drinks , Professional staff Clean Better than the last 5 star Meridian hotel which at stayed at in Vienna In Meridian Vienna some one entered our room and opened the safe and took pounds dollars and Kuwaiti dinars few from each on three different days a total of 3000 dollars were stolen
