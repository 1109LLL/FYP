389503,Abba Sants, loved it all, This is a good hotel with everything we needed and some more The room was big and clean as was the bathroom and breakfasts Its well located to Barcelona sants and the subway which is excellent 3 mins apart to everywhere 
389504,Abba Sants,No Negative, The hotel is very comfortable It is easily reachable by urban trasports The Metro station s Estacio is near to the hotel The room is excellent and clean The prize reflects the quality Staff is kind and friendly We was satisfied with our choise Barcellona is wonderful 
389505,Abba Sants, The bathroom could have been cleaner The shower kept scalding us every few mins Very dangerous for kids babies The electricity in our room was a mess The first day we only had 1 plug that worked until someone came up to fix it , 10 min train ride to center of town The portable crib for our baby waa clean and nice 
389506,Abba Sants, THE ROOMS ARE NOR SOUND PROOF You hear quite a lot of noise even when the room above yours is being cleaned a lot of noise of the moving of bed or chairs probably a lot of noise from the street According to the facilities and the style of the room it is very expensive Very small fridge with not many stuff in it The ventilation works but it is not comfortable as it blows directly at one point and freezes you while the other spot is not cool enough I comment this way because according to the standard of a 4 star hotel and compared to other 4 start ones in Barcelona this hotel lacks things , The staff was great really nice people I have been to many 4 star hotels in Barcelona and the staff of this hotel was great 
389507,Abba Sants,No Negative, Very clean and comfortable room Good central location near to Sants rail station easy access to the metro airport link Great balcony with excellent city views 
389508,Abba Sants, Staff were mostly rude and tried to rush me on check in even though there was no one in line Their air conditioning is terrible It was colder in the lobby than my room which had AC on full blast for hours When i told reception about this problem they wanted to check it out themselves as if they didn t believe me Then when they got to my room they felt the air vent and said yes it is working OMG It was like pulling teeth getting them to change us to a room that was actually cold , Right next to metro station connecting to many parts of town
389509,Abba Sants, The elevators are a bit on the slow side The room was pretty cold when we entered but we could easily regulate the air conditioning to something less chilly I don t know if it is a romantic hotel or not Romance is up to the guests no , The ABBA Sants Hotel is our go to hotel in Barcelona We like the fact that it is very close to the Sants train station plus it is clean well equipped and a good value for the money especially in a city as expensive as Barcelona The staff has always been very courteous and helpful 
389510,Abba Sants, We stayed in one of the disabled rooms There wasn t enough room to get a wheelchair up to the bed to transfer my husband as he can t walk at all so I had to push the bed right over The bathroom was spacious but had a bath shower not a wet room so again not very good for a serverly disabled person When I rang the hotel I did explain how disabled my husband is when I asked about disabled facilities they said the room was good which for a partially disabled person it would be but for someone serverly disabled it wasn t I think it s really important to maybe stress when a hotel has disabled facilities the room has a wet room and not a bath And maybe a picture of the room and bathroom which some hotels do , Location good Very clean Friendly helpful staff 
389511,Abba Sants, No iron or coffee making facilities in room Charge approx 8 for housekeeping to iron shirt didn t use this service , Location and very helpful friendly staff on the front desk 
389512,Abba Sants, Air conditioning didn t work well so you had to open the window There is a dog park directly beside the hotel so you are kept awake all night with barking dogs evidently the locals stay out til 3am with their dogs at the dog park and this was in the middle of the week , Friendly staff Everything was Updated 
389513,Abba Sants, no coffee or tea kit no hair conditioner the mini bar fridge was broken and asked the reception to be fixed but didn t happen , the friendly staff and early check in 
389514,Abba Sants, No complaints at all would stay there again , Friendly staff room was clean and bed comfortable Didn t use the restaurant so can t comment on that but staff guided us to a local bar restaurant very close by which was excellent Main train station Sants direct from the airport is close by and a Metro station for access to the city centre is right outside the entrance so transport links are very good 
389515,Abba Sants, I believed I had booked bed and breakfast so not happy with 30 euro bill we got for breakfast when we checked out , Picked this hotel for the location as travelling on the next day by train
389516,Abba Sants, Temperature of the room was a little bit discomfortable , Location and kind staff moreover the property is well maintained and the room was the best posible one on the penthouse 
389517,Abba Sants, We asked for extra bed for kid But there was a big pillar in a middle of the room So It got a bit crowded , Great location close to main metro lines bus station Very convenient You can get to centre in 15 minutes But it is relatively quiet Comfortable extra bed Nice bathroom clean complimentary toothbrush etc came in handy 
389518,Abba Sants, The hotel is old facility is not good to meet a 4 star hotel standard Not comfortable for the bed The carpet is dirty my little girl got allergy we even found a lunch box may belong to ex customer in the refrigerator , Close to Barcelona Saints station 5 min walk If you plan to take train in very early morning it s a considerable choice The staffs are friendly and helpful 
389519,Abba Sants, the facilities are a bit old the elevator was a bit shakey once we got the destined floor the hairdryer and safety box looked a bit old and tired as well need an update ,No Positive
389520,Abba Sants, Very bad guest service The front office staff don t smile at you They always stare Only two people in front office gave a warm and pleasant response when we approached them The staff for breakfast don t have time to receive and seat you You have to find a clean table to be seated or you have to pick a table and tell them to clean Poor staffing for breakfast The hotel cooling system is not set on during April even though the outside temperature is 20 C plus so the room will be more hotter if you turn it on You will be dependent on opening the windows for fresh and cool air which is unsafe and traffic noise at night Toilets aren t clean , Good variety of breakfast Sants estancio L3 metro just outside the door And Barcelona sants railway station is few minutes away from the hotel Great location for public transportation especially metro 
389521,Abba Sants, Liked everything , Very convenient location Metro station more or less on the hotel s doorstep Train station within walking distance as well Perfect hotel fir a city trip
389522,Abba Sants, Not good value for money for breakfast , Breakfast was not included in the price This was very unclear at the moment I booked the room Also at the spot it was not clear that I had to pay extra for breakfast
389523,Abba Sants, Mattress is uncomfortable Yes the bed is huge but found it hard to get comfy Food in hotel restaurant was okay but expensive for what it is especially there breakfast Would recommend going on trip adviser and looking for something else local, 10 seconds away from two of the main metro lines 10 mins away from main train station The beds are huge One size up from superking 
389524,Abba Sants, Breakfast while good after 10 days could have done with a bit of variety , Location was great metro station right outside the door The staff were helpful and businesslike 
389525,Abba Sants, The safe didn t work properly The noise insulation was poor but luckily we were facing the park and only had to contend with barking dogs , We arrived tired and irritable but the staff remained calm and polite Good location in Barcelona room spacious and clean We didn t take breakfast 
389526,Abba Sants, There was nothing bad but there was nothing special either , A quick and easy walk from the Sants train station once you get oriented Easier during daylight than at night 
389527,Abba Sants, There was no view to speak of but that is hardly a negative in a hotel with that many rooms , The room was very nice The bathroom was exceptionally nice Everything was well cleaned and well kept 
389528,Abba Sants,No Negative, The location of this hotel is excellent very close to Sants Station and in front of the hotel a metro station Rooms comfortable and clean Beds are good 
389529,Abba Sants, I wished for 1 double bed instead of 2 I specified in the reservation , Nice staff good location subway close clean room and bathroom front desk opened 24h 2 elevators Per total v good conditions the only thing that I didn t like were the beds I asked for one double bed and we got 2 beds closed to each other easily departing one from another 
389530,Abba Sants, We had a leak in our bathroom where water ran down the walls on our second day on returning to our room Staff weren t too helpful and we had to ask to be moved to another room which was smaller No compensation for the inconvenience of re packing and unpacking , Wifi dongle that we could take away with us to explore the city 8euro per day Metro outside hotel door 
389531,Abba Sants, Location is nice as it its next to the main train station and easy access to the subway for the gothic quarter la ramba and goudi attractions However if you are planning on going to the beach repeatedly the location is too far and a hassle to transfer trains ,No Positive
389532,Abba Sants, It is only a very minor detail The cold beverages in the fridge are a bit expensive That s why we bought water in the markets nearby , Hotel is 5 minutes walk max from the Barcelona Sant station It came very handy when bought the train station to get info and come back to the hotel to make decision Also there is a metro exit less than 30 meters of the hotel Also the markets nearby are cheap 
389533,Abba Sants, The shower and the air conditioner are broken Also the bathtub sink worked badly Facilities in this hotel are poor I don t think this hotel worth 4 stars Bad value , The location is really convenient 
389534,Abba Sants, A double bed consists of two single ones one always feels a gap between them , Free Wi Fi Service close to metro station lots of supermarkets and restaurants friendly staff
389535,Abba Sants, We asked for a double bed but had twins put together which kept slipping apart Also there appeared a minor leak in the shower , The location just next to Metro entrance was great Asked for quiet room and it was OK Clean and spacious The reception staff were wonderful and helpful 
389536,Abba Sants,No Negative, Lovely clean and comfortable hotel Great location for Sants station Also very near Metro station Had a really reasonable bottle of wine at a decent price form the bar Highly recommended 
389537,Abba Sants, Breakfast can be cheaper and should have been free with the room rental Also the rental can be a little cheaper, Location very near to the tram station Cleanliness Supportive staff 
389538,Abba Sants, The room and bar dining room areas are not to the standard of a 4 star hotel The breakfast buffet was under staffed and the variety on offer was poor for a hotel of this star rating The bedroom furniture and fittings need attention , Location for Sants Station is excellent 
389539,Abba Sants,No Negative, Close to train station metro stop and hop on hop off bus could also walk to great shopping and some main attractions Restaurants in the area good supermarket around the corner 
389540,Abba Sants, Room was too hot and only way to cool it down was by opening the window Some stains on the carpet in the corridor probably impossible to remove but in overall clean and well maintained , Excellent location very near a subway station Parking on a nearby building fit for larger cars Free wifi 
389541,Abba Sants, No English stations on TV unless I was looking in wrong area and no Iron , Location to Metro and Train very happy with room Did not use any of the hotel facilities so cannot comment
389542,Abba Sants, No coffee in room and no take out coffee in hotel restaurant, The staff was superb VERY helpful with directions suggestions and booking tickets for various activities Easy walking distance to metro and Sants train station 
389543,Abba Sants, The style is a bit old fashion but not tired they didn t have an iron in the room , Good location very nice staff I asked t have an iron and instead I got my shirt ironed pretty much straight away 
389544,Abba Sants, Only one thing the housekeeping didn t clean the bathtub enough at the 2nd day , The bed is very large and comfortable Location is ideal Wonderful breakfast Staffs were extremely helpful and friendly 
389545,Abba Sants, Air Conditioning didn t work properly it was too warm in room Way to the beach is too long , Perfect location very close to metro and Sants Estacio giving easy acces to all tourist locations and airport 
389546,Abba Sants, The aircon didn t work for one of the nights that we stayed Also there wasn t a fridge not even a minibar fridge The hotel only provided one of every bathroom toiletry eg toothbrush even though it was a twin room Considering we paid quite a bit it wasn t top notch , It was located right above sants metro station and a short 5 min walk from sants estacio which has connections to the airport The room was fairly clean also 
389547,Abba Sants, There was nothing that we didn t like , It was within walking distance from the train station The rooms were spacious and clean The staff was very helpful 
389548,Abba Sants, Reserved a nonsmoking room but open check in received a room that had a strong smoke smell Once I informed reception they quickly switched my room Shower stall a little tight , Close to subway 
389549,Abba Sants, WiFi and air conditioning never worked properly Had to change room 3 times in 3 days First day arrived at 7pm made us wait for the room and the put us in a room that when you open the window you realized you were inside a warehouse with boxes ,No Positive
389550,Abba Sants, Didn t realized checkout time was 12 00 when our flight was 21 00 We should have been allowed to stay in the hotel few hours more instead of hanging in the street for hours before airport trip , Friendly and efficient staffs
