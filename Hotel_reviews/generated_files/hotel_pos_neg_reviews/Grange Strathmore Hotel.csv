185994,Grange Strathmore Hotel, We had a family room the beds were almost connected to each other While the foto s showed a very spacious room The lift was too small for a family and often used by personel cleaning of the rooms bedlinnen and towels so much waiting or many stairs There was no airconditioning and it was very hot in the small room , The rooms were clean 
185995,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Our first guest room was so tiny that there was no place for our luggage I asked for a larger room and they were able to accommodate us Also the room was a bit too warm for us , This hotel is a historical building The common areas are well preserved and beautiful The service was friendly yet elegant 
185996,Grange Strathmore Hotel, No Airconditioning Rooms are tiny no room for 2 ppl plus Luggage , Staff were helpful able to store luggage after checkout Great location easy walk to tube
185997,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The rooms were very small and desperately need air conditioning ss they were extremely hot and it made it difficult to sleep It was also a little tired around the edges Staff were very nice however , The location was excellent 
185998,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The main thing which disappointed us greatly was the size of our room We booked a superior double room There was nothing superior about it As soon as we opened our door the bed was two steps ahead We had to walk side ways around the bed if not we banged into the Tv Wardrobe and walls Nowhere to place suitcases Me and my partner couldnt get dressed beside eachother as there just wasnt enough room Bathroom was also tiny me and my partner are not large people and our legs were touching the tiled wall beside us when sitting on the toilet Shower was also disappointing just dribbles of water and the shower head kept falling off The bed was extremely hard but me and my partner are used to a soft bed however the pillows were awful very flat and uncomfortable No air con in the room which was definetely needed couldnt imagine what it would have been like if it had gotten any warmer outside Fan was provided though However nice the welcome and people were the room completely ruined our stay when you pay over 100 a night you expect alot better and can say that we would not consider this hotel again which is a shame because the location is brilliant , Location was excellent 3 minute walk to nearest tube 10 minute walk to Natural History Museum We had a room which looked out towards the back so was quite quiet Concierge was very helpful kept our bags before we could check in and also offered to take them after we checked out Very friendly Toiletries were nice also Wifi had a very good signal Plenty of Tv channels to choose from Tea coffe facilities also very nice
185999,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, Three bedroom family room is very spacious and has one massive bed and two singles great for family travel room 221 I think This is the sixth time we have stayed here and its adjacency to the Royal Albert Hall is brilliant we would highly recommend it 
186000,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The room was ridiculously small we couldn t fit our bags in there with us it Was a joke I also didn t like that we seemed to become second class citizens when it was discovered that we booked through Booking com we were told that was the reason why we were not allowed to partake in breakfast even though I didn t enquire about it because I knew that it wasn t included in this booking it leaves an bad taste, The location
186001,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Shame our bedroom didn t have air conditioning during the summer heatwave but the electric fan provided was gratefully received although a little noisy at night A little disappointing calls made to reception are charged at 1 per call I ve never experienced this elsewhere in London and for a 4 star property is surprising , Excellent location close to Gloucester Road underground station making it easy to get around Friendly staff and clean room Free wifi always a bonus 
186002,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I had to change rooms as the one allocated was in the basement and very small with no window Hotel has no air conditioning and in summer this can mean that the rooms can be very hot , Very near Gloucester road tube station Nice rooms nice staff very clean Nancy for the Albert Hall and the museums 
186003,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I didn t like the fact there was no air conditioning and we had to request a fan as one wasn t automatically provided despite the temperature being 28 You couldn t have slept with the windows open due to the road noise from Cromwell Rd There was no iron or ironing board in the room which i have not encountered in some years in hotels of that rating We did ask reception for both these items as we needed to change to go out but an hour later we were still waiting When you are only there for the day and overnight an hour is a long time They need to put a shelf somewhere in the bathroom as there was nowhere to put your toiletries The cost of the breakfast is really high Higher that other hotels we have stayed in in London We bought one from a patisserie around the corner for a quarter of the price There is also a starbucks and a pub within 5 mins that offers breakfast , We had room 221 which had a king size bed plus 2 singles There were plenty of toiletries in the bathroom I believe the other double rooms are quite compact from what other guests were saying so if you can request this room then do so The building itself was beautiful and full of history The bar area in the hotel was nice and they were happy to make sandwiches etc for those who came back late from concerts Nothing seemed too much trouble 
186004,Grange Strathmore Hotel, We didn t have breakfast so can t comment on that , We picked the hotel for its proximity to The Royal Albert Hall and found it was also in walking distance of The Science Museum The Natural History Museum and The Victoria Albert Museum although hotel is in a quiet road Very comfy bed and room shower nice and hot Tube station and several bars and restraunts nearby 
186005,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room smaller than expected No safe in our room but there was one in friends room next door Top floor rooms may be smaller than lower floors perhaps , Very convenient for our trip and well priced for the Sunday night Room perfectly serviceable clean bathroom and good shower No aircon but there was a fan 
186006,Grange Strathmore Hotel, It was a little expensive as we didn t get breakfast included in the price , The hotel was very nice and only a short walk from the tube station The room was of a good size and it had an excellent shower 
186007,Grange Strathmore Hotel, No air conditioning so it s hot in the room on warm days which are quite rare in London anyway , Great location near tube station quiet at night shops parks and museums Bar menu was excellent value and food quality was really good Friendly staff accommodated all our requests like early checkin We enjoyed the stay very much 
186008,Grange Strathmore Hotel, UBER In NO way related to the hotel but our stay was so that we could visit Wembley Stadium to watch Jeff Lynne s ELO Booked Uber 5 hours in advance with a guide price upper and lower limits included As we were in the car I received a text saying there was an increase in activity warranting a price surge and we had 5 mins to decide whether we wanted to cancel or not The car was actually moving The end result was an 8 price surge What a joke of a company , Beautiful hotel in quiet surroundings Excellent comfortable bed The room wasn t massive but had everything we needed It was spotless throughout Friendly staff who allowed us to leave our luggage with the concierge after check out so we could visit the local shops and restaurants We would definitely stay here again 
186009,Grange Strathmore Hotel, What we didn t account for was that it was such a hot weekend that there was no air con in the hotel so the room was very hot Breakfast was very expensive too so we avoided that , Great location staff very friendly Was very clean and smart hotel 
186010,Grange Strathmore Hotel, No air cond nevertheless there was a fan but Fan stopped working just after 4am woke and too hot to sleep then , Location Convenient to business venue south kensington tube station Side road off main street traffic 
186011,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room is very small no enough space to move inside the room especially when your bags are open Breakfast is too expensive in the hotel 24 pounds per person we use breakfast options in caffee outside , Charming classic British hotel in Victorian style that we like Nice classic British lounge Very helpful stuff very good WI FI in whole area of the hotel including rooms The hotel is very clean Hotel has good location in quite nice London Kensington area Plenty of caffee and shops around this area Kensington Park and Palace around 15 minuts of walk Gloucester Road undeground station is just 3 4 minutes walk Direct way to Heathrow Terminals from this undeground station 
186012,Grange Strathmore Hotel, There was no air conditioning and the temperature was over 30 degrees For a hotel that offers modern conveniences this was extremely disappointing We were given a fan which helped but it was an uncomfortable stay , The bed was comfortable The room was tiny but clean 
186013,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Bed was too hard Got diarrhea from tap water in room Coffee in room was not brewed instant coffee in room only Window in first room offered was stuck open and pane was completely broken The window rattled all night long Our first room had no safe and there were no private safes available by reception There were no wash cloths and the staff didn t know what they were TV had to be reset on a daily basis cigarette smoke came into the room via the front door door did not have proper insulation around perimeter elevator was too small, concierge and reception were kind location was good unique character of building
186014,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, Staff was wonderful and accommodating Location was perfect near the tube restaurants grocery store and Kensington Park all set in an adorable neighborhood 
186015,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Bath room was very small but I managed ok and it had all I needed , Great location for the Royal Albert Hall and Museums Lovely quiet area Room was small but just what was needed to rest my head for the night Staff were friendly and polite Clean and tidy 
186016,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room a bit small and tiny windows Shower needed a shelf so you didn t have to put your shower gel Shampoo on the floor Wifi signal was much too weak and needed to be boosted to get to the 5th floor Breakfast was vastly overpriced at 18 each, Good location for Albert Hall which was about a 10 15 minute walk Room was quiet which was good
186017,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The room furniture was a little dated showing chips along the edges etc and the room size was a bit of a disappointment especially as I had booked a superior room There is only one small lift so waiting to get downstairs in the morning required about a ten minute wait The cost of breakfast seemed excessive at 20 for the full version especially as you can have breakfast down the road forhalf the price at Garfunkels, The bed was extremely comfortable and the basic facilities clean Plenty of milk for tea coffee but only 2 breakfast tea bags which seemed bizarre Staff delightful and bar area pleasant Drinks not too expensive
186018,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, We loved how convenient this location was because we were only in London for an overnight stay due to a layover and we were able to take the tube from the airport to the stop only 2 blocks from the hotel And then we did our own walking tour of London ending up at a pub near the London Eye then taking a taxi back which was only about a 15 minute ride 2 hours walking and were able to see many nearby sites such as Hyde Park Harrods Buckingham Palace Big Ben Westminster Abbey London Eye and many places in between The property is old the room was very small and their is no A C but it is historic and in the lovely neighborhood of Kensington We felt safe and cozy and would definitely recommend this property again for short stays 
186019,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Had to wait till 3pm to check in and didnt bring it forward despite request Also wouldnt extend checkout time as we were attending a course in the hotel Did keep bags for us though , Great location luvly rooms and pleasant helpful staff Food fantastic

186024,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room was small shower even small and the lift was very slow and claustrophobic Being on the 4th floor I didn t feel the need to climb the stairs I felt it was expensive for what the room was there was a large gap under the door and with no air conditioning and the weather how it has been not complaining about that al all had to have the window fully open so all in all quite noisy , good location especially for visiting the museums
186025,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The bathroom was tiny No where to hang towels or put wash bag brush etc The shower was a squeeze Room was just big enough for a double bed No drinking water supplied If had to pay full price for this room I would not have been happy , The room was comfortable and clean staff friendly 
186026,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The space available in the room was quite tight However it did not detract from the visit Although the room was spotlessly clean some of the painted woodwork was tired with chipped paintwork in places , All the staff were unfailingly polite and helpful

186029,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The thickness of the walls between rooms isn t good with noisy neighbours we had a very early start to the day , The bed was exceedingly comfortable the TV had a good selection of channels the shower was powerful and hot and the location is perfect for the Natural History Science and V A Museums and the Royal Albert Hall 
186030,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Expensive but London prices for the area I suppose , Lovely comfortable room with very comfortable bed and very generous supply of tea coffee and toiletries 
186031,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I found the room needed refurbished The wallpaper was coming away from the wall There was massive bubbles in area s on the wallpaper The plug socket next to the bed was broken It was sunk into the wall Could possibly be dangerous , The hotel was in a great location 
186032,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Small complaint about the room bedroom window didn t close properly and rattled all night wasn t really taken seriously even though it meant we didn t get much sleep as it was very noisy , A bit cramped but typical for London
186033,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The room was very small and bathroom even smaller Had to shut the bathroom door to get to the sink The pillows were very lumpy and the money spent on the room was extortionate for what it was , Not a lot really 
186034,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Breakfast too expensive to have generator type noise constant noisy housekeeping at an early ish hour Concierge on arrival not very friendly welcoming Staff not fluent English speakers , Shower good clean quiet near Royal Albert Hall
186035,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Pillows a bit firmer but we like firm pillows , Lovely hotel tasteful and clean friendly staff and quiet fab area of London perfect for Royal Albert Hall where we went to a gig Loved there were plenty of toiletries and coffee tea a very good example of how it should be done

186037,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, Comfortable stay and very convenient for sightseeing Rooms were unexpectedly small for a room described as superior We didn t use the dining room as the breakfast was not competitively priced compared to local cafes 
186038,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Stains on the bedding tv not working bath plug not working wrong room given to start with which saw us entering a room that was already occupied very awkward, Near to the venue we were attending nice and quiet
186039,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Arrived at was given keys to room 213 waited a long while for lift as very small and lots of people staying there We get to 2nd floor and there is no 213 anywhere to be found We had to get ready as attending the Olivier awards at the Royal Albert Hall but had to walk down as lifts in use and I have heart condition and told reception and they said yes there was no room 213 it is 212A So why say it is 213 and put on card that number Had to walk up the 2 flights to room and instead of relaxing leisurely I was out of breath Anyway we complained to manager and gave us complimentary breakfast Ironically we left behind our phone charger lead and called and they said would email us if found and within half an hour they did to say it was found but would you believe that on email said room 213 which doesn t exist , Location and history of the actual building

186043,Grange Strathmore Hotel, very small single bed and room i would expect such a small bed in the corner of the room to use the wall to avoid falls, quiet place nice environment
186044,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, Hotel with nicely old fashioned atmosphere yet having many modern touches Quiet location comfy bed Good breakfast made all the better by being served in a dining room where all tables had white linen tablecloths and by the excellent at table waitress service Excellent value for money now my favourite for the price London Hotel 
186045,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, Amazing stay as always at a Grange property Wonderful staff in particular the manager how could not be more helpful and they even upgraded us to a suite with welcome bubbly and free breakfast every morning Even without this unexpected treat it would still have been a great stay

186052,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Tiny cramped bedroom no room to walk around bed it was squeezed into the corner of the room I stayed one night so it was OK but it wouldn t be comfortable for a long stay for someone with more baggage Sound travels through the walls too If you re happy paying extra for something more luxurious this probably wouldn t be as much of an issue , Helpful staff easy to get to places Very nice location and great for sightseeing 
186053,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Too much light in the room bleeding through the door from the hallway just due to the age of the place I guess but it did affect my wife s sleep , Easy check in very easy to find

186069,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Our room this year was even smaller than last year which we thought was impossible Yes we only use it to dress and sleep in but our bathroom at home is larger than the bedroom and shower room It should have a warning that it is not suitable for larger people However it was clean So no complaints on house keeping I was dissapointed at the lack of Christmas decorations considering the time of year The staff were polite and yes we would consider coming again depending on how much a larger room would cost and hopefully experience breakfast , Location for Albert Hall ok

186072,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room a bit small despite a claim that we were upgraded to an executive room Seemed pretty ordinary to me Also info on breakfast misleading on website the price quoted 18 was for a continental breakfast though it didn t say so on the website A cooked breakfast was 6 extra I queried this and got a complimentary cooked breakfast Finally the TV didn t work and was not fixed despite it being brought to the attention of reception shortly after we arrived , Good location and quiet Room comfortable but a bit small Staff pleasant enough

186077,Grange Strathmore Hotel, It was very noisy as no double glazing think walls You could hear far too much traffic noise bins being collected Plus our neighbours in room next door were extremely loud at 5am walking us up with shooting music , Lovely helpful staff great comfy bar bed lots of toiletries very clean Room service did a brilliant job on room in the morning 
186078,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Ohhh well shall we let the list begin with check in 1 The staff seemed more focused on talking to their boyfriends on the phone or discussing the latest hot guy in a magazine rather than helping guests 2 The place desperately needs a facelift I had strong memories resurface of trying to clean my grandmother s flat the dust settling onto a different surface with each step taken The sheets were stained with god only knows what and the bathroom tiles were falling off 3 I appreciate a free upgrade as much as the next guy to come along But when I a solo traveller on a business trip just wants a nice place to lay his head and do some work i want one bed a desk and a chair Instead the free upgrade they gave me consisted of a stained queen bed with two single beds stuffed i to the room as well as if i was a child trying to build a very loose definition of a fort At least i had two ridiculously small non stained beds to choose from I ll give them one thing the pillows weren t bad , The location was relatively perfect A little out of the way but near enough that it was convenient 
186079,Grange Strathmore Hotel, We paid 18 00 each for breakfast We only got a very poor continental breakfast We waited 15 mins for a cup of tea There was no space in the breakfast room Some couples were told to come back later , Excellent location Walking distance of Albert Hall

186087,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Rooms were rather small , The friendly George who went out of his way to help us to print the return tickets Without him we would never have gotten home 
186088,Grange Strathmore Hotel, to less space for my cloths and although thought to fit in for two the room wouldn t have enough space for a second luggage nor for additional clothing I missed a cloth hook in the room in the small corridor for example to hang up my daly coat and I also missed a small radiator in the bath to warm up as days and nights in October starts to get cold, The central located position of the Hotel close to many atractions or quite near by Tube to get there I also enjoyed the quiet and silence area near a privat Park and the friendly staff

186091,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The WiFi was spotty at best There was no shelf or caddy in the shower so you had to hold your soap or shampoo in hand while taking one There was also no control over temperature so it got very hot by morning or if you left the windows open there was no screen so some bugs would get in , There was a lift which was nice The location is great since it s right next to the Natural History Museum and Hyde Park 
186092,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The first room we were given was on the 5th Floor Awful room Tiny and claustrophobic Thankfully we asked to change and were given a nice room on the 2nd floor No comparison but there was a big gap under the door and unfortunately the lift was right outside the door We heard ever sound and conversation from outside the room Including the guest in the room next door mediatating at 6am Also every cleaning store cupboard was open when we passed through the hotel Look awful and unsightly The concierge bar staff hadn t a clue I asked for a coke one evening and I was given the bottle No glass No ice Another evening I asked for a brandy and the barman had no idea what I was asking for or how to serve it My husband also asked for a brandy but there was none left I got the last brandy , Location was good 
186093,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Bed was far too hard and could have done with a few more English Breakfast tea bags in our room Cost of breakfast meant an extra 42 on the room rate , Very friendly and helpful staff We were going to the Radio 2 Hyde Park concert so had our bags etc to drop off first thing before our rooms were ready But absolutely no problems 
186094,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Reception staff a little surly and abrupt Bathroom much to samll also the step into the shower dangwerous as too high Window blind did not work main hotel v dated badly in need of updating , Location very good bedrooms nicely decorated Consierge v helpfull 
186095,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room not ready room small Asked what catagory it was and was told standard we told them that we had booked a superior double room and were told that they re the same , Location and price
186096,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Single bedroom is too tiny for comfort Don t expect much from the continental breakfast, Location location location Underground is 5 minutes away Classic looking building Friendly staff Value for money
186097,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Breakfast is on the expensive side but it is SW7, Well appointed clean rooms if a little hot at this time of year Staff were excellent and couldn t have been more accommodating
186098,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Foyer area was a little tired, We had a family room which was very spacious a surprise for London Well maintained quiet despite overlooking the street
186099,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location for my four year old s first visit to London especially visiting the Natural History Museum The staff were lovely Maria delighted my daughter by greeting her by name shortly after we arrived and throughout our stay Large comfortable bed and nicely furnished room 
186100,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Unfortunately I stayed here on probably one of the hottest nights of the year As it was quite an old hotel there was no aircon That being said about 340 days of the year in the UK you probably wouldn t need aircon anyway I was just unlucky and the room was like a sauna with the windows wide open , Very nice hotel loved the old English style felt quite grand Location was perfect a few minutes walk from the Tube station Staff were very nice even someone to help me with my luggage which was appreciated after my trip from Dublin 
186101,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The inside of the hotel was very cramped up Like the lift can barely take 2 people There was no proper ventilation inside the room and since my visit was during summer I was roasting inside the room despite the window open The staff seemed very unfriendly I wouldn t say this hotel is 4 star doesn t look so grand like in the pictures , Location was very convenient to get about 2 min walking distance to the subway station and the neighbourhood seemed very safe Obviously it s Kensington so it should be Room was all refurbished clean
186102,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Really the only thing I can fault was the carpet it was a bit tatty going in to the bathroom , The hotel was very in keeping with the age of the building Many original features still present Friendly and helpful staff 
186103,Grange Strathmore Hotel, There was no air condition so the room was very warm Even though there was an elevator there were also a lot of stairs which made it a little difficult with baby buggy and elderly people , The location was excellent The staff was very helpful and friendly The room was spacious 
186104,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Initial room was in the basement dark and I cant remember a window but they found us an acceptable room on the 2nd floor , Room was adequate and location very good 
186105,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The bathroom was extremely small Nowhere to put shower gel or shampoo in the shower We are smallish people and still found the bathroom cramped hardly room to turn round The continental breakfast we thought was rather expensive 18 each when all we would want is a croissant and a cup of coffee , Lovely building great location for our plans quiet location the fact that it was more like staying in a homely situation rather than a group hotel Nicely decorated room We loved its connection with history This was a second visit to the hotel and we would certainly stay again

186108,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Beds need Mattress Toppers as we found them too firm for our liken However this was easy rectified after it was mentioned to head housekeeper by placing a Duvet over the top for our stay But it would be worth investing in Mattress Toppers for the future , Really lovely place to stay our room was Gorgeous The staff were always happy to help They all work very hard to make sure visitors are well catered for 
186109,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Very small superior double bedroom with tiny bathroom, Brilliant staff and lovely historic building Good breakfast and very good location close to the Royal Albert Hall 
186110,Grange Strathmore Hotel, the wifi was slow the window in the room was very high and small with only a view of the roof tops and clouds The front of house staff had very little knowledge of the area and facilities on offer including restaurants, The location Very 19th century Lots of charm 
186111,Grange Strathmore Hotel, There was no air condition so it was a little hot in the room The hotel was pretty old you could see cracked paint and dated fixtures In addition the bathroom was very cramped The morning breakfast was okay not great , The hotel was located in a nice quiet neighborhood that was a short walk to Hyde Park There was almost no street noise so you could get a nice sleep and the bed was comfortable 
186112,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I enjoy a glass of red wine But it always tastes correct in a nice red wine glass and not in the silly little glasses you have Puts you off, Everyone was very helpful thank you
186113,Grange Strathmore Hotel, There wasn t anything we didn t like , The room was lovely We were upgraded for our anniversary and because it was also my birthday they brought us a beautiful plate of cake with happy birthday wrote in icing which just made out trip extra special

186117,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Hard matrass and very soft pillows If you book late prices go up and because of that we didn t book our next stay here Other than that great staff and nothing to complain about , Location and area are very pleasant Nice old building with 003 having a fairly new bathroom and spacious room basement rooms have A C When booked early great value for money Bar lounge was very nice wifi excellent no need to log on after 1st time Coffee tea maker in the room as well as spacious safe We even had a couch and coffee table next to a desk chair Bags are left in a locked room after checking out good hotel over all 
186118,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The size of room is very small The price of breakfast is too expensive , The location is excellent Quit street near to the Natural History Museum Victoria and Albert Museum Hyde Park underground station with three lines and good restaurants The cost is good if you think you are in London 
186119,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Very small room especially the bathroom It was not possible to sit at the lavatory pan normally but at diagonal The shower cabin is 60x65 cm no way first to set the temperature of the water before get wet The TV set does not work properly the remote control was so worn out that half of the buttons didn t work and signs on them were erased There s no much choice of food for the continental breakfast , Nice location in an aristocratic borough of London 
186120,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The room was small Had to dodge the tv to get round the bottom of the bed to get to the other side Was hard to use the trouser press as it was in a small cupboard wardrobe behind the coat hangers When checking in I asked for another key for my partner when he arrived to register which reception did and they said it would be waiting for him when he arrived When he arrived he was told there was no second key for him and that I already had one so it would be OK One key does not work , The bed was very comfortable
186121,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Bathroom was very small and loo roll was unfortunately placed by shower door, Great location 10 mins walk to Royal Albert Hall Less than 5 mins from Tube Station Great Hotel bar too 
186122,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The staff weren t very helpful or friendly The bed was too hard couldn t get the to to work and the staff in the morning standing outside the rooms window was uncirtable, The location
186123,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room was small but clean and tidy only there for sleep and minimal relax time so fine , Great location less than 5 minute walk from tube and also less than 10 minute leisurely walk from the Royal Albert Hall Perfect 
186124,Grange Strathmore Hotel, only a small thing and that was that the lift was often busy but it gave me time to look at some of the lovely features in the building, excellent room very helpful staff and a lovely building
186125,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Couldn t sit on the loo properly due to the position of the sink If I d paid full price I d probably have been a bit disappointed at the space , Spotlessly clean great location I got the room on a deal almost half price so good price for the location 
186126,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Only a small niggle the room on a hot weekend had no airco As explained to me later this was due to wanting to keep the original feel to the hotel after refurbishment , Staff location comfort all perfect Great little bar that remained open as long as someone was in it Food was of great quality 
186127,Grange Strathmore Hotel, No parking at the hotel and nearby parking was very expensive for the night , Lovely building staff were very helpful and attentive The room was clean and the bed very comfortable Excellent location near the natural history museum and the Royal Albert hall Great eating out options close by 
186128,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The only issue we had was the TV remote control in my mother s room which didn t function properly could perhaps benefit from upgrading , The location is great the staff friendly and helpful and although very small the elevator was useful for my disabled mother 
186129,Grange Strathmore Hotel, In my opinion overall the hotel looks shabby and doesn t feel like a 4 star hotel For the same price you could probably find a 3 star hotel with far better facilities and overall atmosphere I didn t like that I was asked to pay for the whole stay at arrival Not sure if that was just me or is it the hotel policy The room was very small I believe it s much smaller than advertised 12 meters I had to step out of the shower to shave my legs as there was just not enough space and there are no shelves in the shower at all which is very inconvenient Also I felt that shampoo and shower gel were of not a very good quality so that I had to buy my own which has never happened before Overall probably won t come back to this one , The hotel is located very conveniently just 2 minutes by foot from the Gloucester park underground station The neighbourhood is nice and quiet Also I liked that the rooms were very well cleaned 
186130,Grange Strathmore Hotel, everything after an overseas trip had to check ourselves in stained carpets throughout two people could barely stand up at the same time in room cramped bathroom barely a closet at all old sticky drawers no place for suitcases charging 24 pounds for full breakfast in dreary surroundings The worst hotel that I have encountered in London , the ladies who cleaned the room
186131,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I had to move rooms due to a disturbing noise coming from the bathroom , The staff were very accommodating Lovely hotel and an absolutely fantastic location 
186132,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Being that it was early March it was difficult at first to get the room to a warm proper temperature Heavy curtains aided greatly Great bathroom wonderful shower , Greatly enjoyed the room Staff very accommodating Great location for us staying close to friends who live in London Will certainly stay there again 
186133,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Breakfast was expensive as it was only continental bed was hard and room was weeny The shower was extremely small and I had to get out halfway through my shower as the tray filled up with water and wouldn t drain away I complained to the young boy on reception and he just said he would make a note of it I have to go back in July but will try another hotel , The location was great for my needs Price was good for London 
186134,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room was very small for a twin Concierges looked very bored or just miserable wasn t an inviting welcome to the hotel Refreshment cupboard in bedroom could have been fixed , Very comfortable beds I was on 5th floor but never had to wait for lift and was very quick Everywhere was very clean and tidy Receptionist helpful and pleasant disposition Lots of bathroom supplies Room looked out on lovely sunset 
186135,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room was small to the point that we had to bend forward so we wouldn t hit the TV on the wall had problems getting to the bed as the thin desk and chair was in the way basically the shower was so small you had trouble in turning round but nicely decorated and very comfortable , The location for what we wanted was great staff were really helpful and friendly lovely and clean clean bed and towels 
186136,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was in a fantastic location very close to the museums but on a quiet road The staff were very friendly and made a real effort to make me and my young son feel welcome The rooms were very comfortable and well stocked with tea coffee and toiletries We will definitely be staying again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone 
186137,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Did not eat at hotel resturant Read an unflattering Google review and so elected to eat elsewhere Had morning coffe each day however and that was delicious , Hotel situated in an old English townhome providing wonderful traditional atmosphere Very close to Gloucester Road Tube Station Lounge salon area open 24 7 for coffee wine soda small bites etc Free wifi was very responsive Lots of bandwidth 
186138,Grange Strathmore Hotel, This is only an observation not a complaint To improve the already spot on Scottish theme the well stocked bar could do with a couple of island single Malts to add to the three Highland expressions they have on the shelf Bar service was excellent , The hotel is built and equipped in a classic mode which would not be out of place in an elegant Scottish baronial hotel The location in the heart of Kensington could not be better for the Albert Hall the museums and the Royal Parks For all this the price was a real bargain 
186139,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Unfortunately it was difficult to get in and out of the bath as it was slippery and narrow and I m not big so I slipped and cut my toe on the watercock for the drain , I liked the hotel over all because it was a good sized room clean and in a lovely area as well as quiet location 
186140,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Walls are pretty thin because I can hear other room s toilet flushing , Our room got upgraded for free which is massive Great location to museums and tube station nearby 
186141,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Our biggest issue was that the beds were hard Other minor inconveniences rooms were warm staff unfriendly bathroom VERY small no place to set down shampoo in shower or holder for toilet paper TV stopped working could be overlooked , The price for our rooms was very reasonable Rooms were small but I have seen smaller Very high ceilings and architectural details were a plus You could tell from the ceiling that the room was subdivided from a larger room The location was 5 8 minutes walk to the Gloucester Square tube stop Piccadilly District and Circle lines and also close to South Kensington and the V A Natural History and Science museums The hotel was clean safe and quiet 
186142,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Nothing , The room was gorgeous with generous amounts of tea and coffee My friend forgot her toothbrush and the staff brought up a toothbrush for her It was most appreciated 
186143,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Room 517 was rather small difficult to walk past the end of the bed without brushing the wall mounted television , The hotel is in a perfect location for a visit to the Royal Albert Hall The staff are always welcoming and friendly 
186144,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The breakfast available on booking com is only for the continental breakfast it s another 6 for a hot breakfast and not worth the money at all The room we had was a deluxe double but there wasn t much deluxe about it and there was no bath , The bed was comfortable and the room was warm

186146,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The single room was too small and the bathroom even smaller but at the end of the day I enjoyed it , The laundry service is outstanding quite expensive but exceptional The hotel is located in a strategic area and the neighbourhood is classy 
186147,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Lobby is old and outdated and elevator is tiny Was worried when I checked in but the room was awesome which is all that really mattered , Room was big and clean and well lit Great bathrooms and clean fluffy towels
186148,Grange Strathmore Hotel, We had booked a superior double room but it was Obvious it was a twin room as it was two twin beds pushed together We were offered a complimentary English breakfast out of the blue which was lovely but unfortunately the breakfast wasn t lovely The toast was cold and the food was very poor we went out for breakfast instead , The room interior and cleanliness Fantastic location
186149,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Issues with the wifi connection which meant the TV didn t work However they were very helpful and solved the issue quite quickly Very friendly staff ,No Positive
186150,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Quibbled over breakfast price VAT extra to quoted price Screen round bath made getting out tricky Bedside light bulb blown , Relatively quiet street Adjustable reading lights Comfortable bed Not too hot Several teabags not just two 
186151,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The staff No smiles didn t look happy at all the 3 we met only one was polite that was the young lady on reception whilst booking in The free wifi we didn t use but reception said it cuts out a lot Didn t have breakfast so cannot comment , Near to tube and royal albert hall with shops very close by no noise from the road Bed was comfy plenty of pillows also clean Nicely decorated Bathroom very clean towels were not thread bare like I had previously read about free toiletries plenty of everything in room tea coffee milk trouser press of which I found didn t get hot wasn t able to do trousers hairdryer in drawer and plenty of info on the hotel 
186152,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Tiny Room Concierge could be more friendly and helpful , Very close to Gloucester Road Underground coffee shops restaurants Harrods and Museums Easy to get to and from airport Reception staff was helpful The room was clean and room service prompt Happy we could to open the window in the room and get fresh air 
186153,Grange Strathmore Hotel, the lady at the reception when we arrived at 7 45 am on 14th feb morning from a long haul flight informed us no room was available until 3 pm we had requested early check in but she was unsympathetic and very curt whereas her colleague who came in after her offered us a room at 9 30and even changed it to a bigger room at our request rooms are a bit small and tight, all of the staff was very friendly and helpful excellent location neat and clean and good price for London 
186154,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The beds were very decent although a tad too firm for my taste , Tidy quiet and well equipped room on the top floor Good quality shower products kettle tea and coffee it s all there The hotel is tastefully decorated Very friendly and helpful staff possibility to store the luggage after checkout included 
186155,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The beds and bedding were a disappointment The mattress was rather hard the pillows were old and flat and needed renewing The linen was coming apart at the seams , Good service pleasant and efficient staff Super location for access to the Natural History Museum the Royal Albert Hall and S Kensington underground A lovely old building overlooking Queens Gate Gardens 
186156,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Needed a fridge bathroom needs a heated towel rail or heater of some sort as gaps in window made bathroom freezing main window also very draughty not a problem in Summer but Winter different story was disappointed by size of room as was supposed to be a Superior Twin Room which looks a lot bigger on the photo we had 4 suitcases and had to store them along side between the bed and window door to room kept sticking had to get help on 2 occasions to open it not impressed really as this is not what I would expected from a Luxury 4 Hotel disappointed , Staff were courteous and helpful beds were comfortable and location was great
186157,Grange Strathmore Hotel, We had booked a single room and a twin room We were allocated rooms on the fifth floor The single room was of adequate size but the only window in the room was too high to see out of making the room feel claustrophobic The twin room was poky there wasn t even room to pull the chair out from under the desk without it hitting the beds and in my opinion this should only have been a single room Some of the decor is looking shabby and the carpets worn although the hotel was all very clean There is one very small lift in the hotel It was not what I expected from a four star hotel which I had booked for a treat for my mum s 70th birthday , The location of the hotel is excellent we stayed there to attend a show at the Royal Albert Hall which is within easy walking distance as is the Natural History Museum The staff were very friendly and polite and the hotel was clean 
186158,Grange Strathmore Hotel, It doesn t feel like a four star hotel The room wasn t plush and the finish was poorer than expected , Location was excellent a few minutes walk to the Natural History Museum and the tube 
186159,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Students overtook the bar and myself and my friend just about got 2 seats to eat They were lounging around not eating or drinking and were very loud A couple tried to come into the bar but couldn t because there were no seats for them Felt the students could have been managed better Maybe a more senior person should have been responsible for the bar Barman left the bar for long periods of time and in fact when we wanted to order a drink it was too late by the time he came back to the bar as we were heading off to a show , Location to tube station
186160,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The lift was too small and the bathtub was not easy to use, Perfect location very close to underground station and two museums Very friendly staff and pretty clean facilities
186161,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Breakfast prices room was only just large enough not to bump into walls or fittings when manoeuvring around the bed , Location considerate conversion of an historic building staff were all pleasant and friendly 
186162,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The pillows were very flat and uncomfortable at times Found a few blonde hairs in the bed , The staff were all very friendly and helpful No complaints at all Lovely area for a short trip away
186163,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, Hotel with style history very comfortable and quiet 5 mins walk to tube Rooms with high ceilings gave the feel of space nice beds and modern appearance Good value Would stay again 
186164,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Wifi was provided in the most minimal way possible in order to call it free unless you pay a large additional fee their guest wifi cuts out every hour and requires manual sign in again This is misleading and pointlessly inconvenient and treats what is by now a critical and expected basic utility like a value add The single room was also very cramped contrary to imagery that suggested a more normal scale There was barely room to walk around the single bed without colliding with wall mounted units and the chair at the desk obstructed movement unless tucked carefully away If images represented this accurately it wouldn t be so irritating however for an elderly disabled or even obese guest I can t see how the room would be suitable , Location was good aside from wifi basic conveniences were OK 
186165,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I had requested on my booking a quiet room so that I could sleep well I also requested on arrival Imagine my delight when I had two Spanish groups next door who talked loudly in the corridor outside the room and constantly went in and out of each room letting the doors slam I hung the do not disturb door sign on the door to no avail I reported the next morning on check out that the doors needed to be adjusted as they slammed very loudly It is not necessary for any door to slam especially where door closures are fitted The mattress was too firm to sleep comfortably on I didn t get much sleep at all The pillows were flat I had to use 4 , The location was suitable for my needs The staff were pleasant and helpful 
186166,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Double beds v v hard Single were fine The windows drafty due to age of hotel but they have thick curtains to try to help but a bit chilly, Family rooms really large and highly recommend Staff excellent nice touch to help my Father celebrate his 80 th B day
186167,Grange Strathmore Hotel, We booked what was called a Superior double room We had a tiny double bedded room in basement really only suitable for single occupancy The space between the end of the bed and the wall was a matter of inches and you had to bend over the bed to avoid hitting the TV Also we elected to include breakfast at a cost of 18 each assuming it was a good cooked breakfast at that price In fact it was only a rather poor Continental breakfast cooked breakfast was 24 each At booking you did not specify type of breakfast Definitely thought this a rip off ,No Positive
186168,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The standard rooms are very very small with a tiny bathroom and a shower where it is difficult to wash without hurting oneself We also ended up with the cupboard door knob in our hand and the bar where we suspended all our coats on the floor The personal is young obviously new to the area and not very well trained , This hotel is very well positionned close to a good metro station Gloucester Road in a quiet area and not far from South Kensignthon It is very clean 
186169,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Nothing, Everything was fine Room was not very big but clean and had everything we needed for a short stay Location is good if you want to visit Natural History Museum and area around It is not very far from the subway Area is quite 
186170,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Not much space in the room for two people to move past each other and very little room to get in and out of the shower Continental breakfast expensive , Good location and very little road noise comfortable bar smiling helpful staff Room and bed comfortable 
186171,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Expensive for what was provided Breakfast not included Tea and coffee facilities could have been better , Excellent location room very clean and staff helpful
186172,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Although the staff were courteous and polite they didn t smile much On leaving the hotel the doorman concierge didn t offer to open the entrance door even though I was trying to get through with my overnight bag , Close to Gloucester Road underground station Ten minutes from the Royal Albert Hall and the Science Museum and the V A There are lots of eating places nearby 
186173,Grange Strathmore Hotel, The rooms were very small as were the beds Also we paid 18 per person for a very minimal breakfast buffet English breakfast was not even included We ordered toast and it never came , Excellent location beautiful building
186174,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Just a little cramped to get passed the desk to the bed and the bed was really hard , Location was excellent facilities were good the room although small was cute and the view over the park was lovely
186175,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Unfortunately I found a big bug in my room I thought it came through the window because I had left open the whet some fresh air I slept the first night The next day in the morning I found another one I collected and shared with the stuff they Called the manager but she didn t even wanted to talk to me on the phone for an apology I left the hotel of course Also The stuff is not well trained and very poor in English At the concierge one of the stuff didn t know the differences between J and G while I was trying to give a postal code I don t recommend this hotel for many reasons Also when you check in they want you to pay in advance for the whole amount which seemed very unusual When I wanted my money back they cut the 80 of the night They didn t seemed sorry at all ,No Positive
186176,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Nothing we had eaten before arriving and didn t stop for breakfast so can t comment, Beautiful room enormous spotless and classic I love these Regency buildings and Kensington area is lovely Real London 2 mins from the Natural History Museum too
186177,Grange Strathmore Hotel, When we checked in at reception we were told there was a problem We were told to wait in the bar area The receptionist then came and said instead of a superior double room only two single rooms were available I said I d booked a double room in advance it was my husband s 60 th birthday and she had better sort it out This was very upsetting and stressful after making a special trip in to London The receptionist disappeared again and came back 10 minutes later and miraculously a room was available I complained at the time and was told there was an error in the system and then by another member of staff that some people had wanted to stay an extra night so they were prepared to accept that instead of honouring our booking This was a very bad start and impression to our stay The TV in our room was not working and a member of staff couldn t fix it At breakfast it said continental breakfast but there were no croissants or pastries Some staff did not speak very good English and had a bad attitude The location and overall comfort was good , The location the overall comfort was good 
186178,Grange Strathmore Hotel, There was no bath despite one being listed on the booking page The room was so small it was impossible to walk all the way around the bed There was a rip in the duvet cover Also there was over a five minute wait before anyone appeared at the concierge desk and no bell to ring for attention , The location was very good 
186179,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, Comfort long thick curtains in the bedrooms no lights from outside good beds Plenty to eat room service and breakfast I had a leg injury prior to my trip staff very obliging and helpful Will return when next in London 
186180,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I d hoped for more for my money as far as the room and breakfast went plus bathroom and shower too small, great location staff friendly and very helpful
186181,Grange Strathmore Hotel, No bad experience but staff could have been a little friendlier, Very comfortable hotel with thoughtful touches for guests Magazines in bedrooms good quality toiletries in the bathroom A welcoming lounge area with the morning papers
186182,Grange Strathmore Hotel, A room that was booked and paid for as superior and was in the basement cellar with windows that looked out onto dingy storage cupboards Paid and booked for breakfast not cheap that turned out to be continental with an additional charge of 25 to upgrade to cooked not impressed, Nothing in particular
186183,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Tried to put us in a room so tiny that there was not even space for our suitcases After being told twice there were no other rooms they eventually moved us to a very nice larger room ,No Positive
186184,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I had a single room and the bathroom was quite tight I m 5 foot 8 140lbs and I found it a bit snug You may want to consider an upgrade to a larger room if you are bigger than me Still great value for money , GREAT location short walk to the metro 
186185,Grange Strathmore Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location for visiting the museums of Kensington Also a short walk from Piccadilly line at Gloucester Road The room was small but beautifully decorated and I wouldn t have expected a larger room for the price Very reasonable for central London 
186186,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I was charged 10 for the premium Internet service that was not utilised Despite arguing with Alexandra in reception the charge was not reversed Alexandra could not show me proof that the service was utilised In the meantime I will continue to dispute the charge , Location room configuration of four beds that suits teenage children 
186187,Grange Strathmore Hotel, Facilities very poor wardrobe doors hanging off Bed very hard and uncomfortable pillows inadequate and bedding poor standard Lack of tea and milk throughout stay Staff under trained and not really interested in feedback on departure Payment facilities very confusing , Location
186188,Grange Strathmore Hotel, I have stayed in Grange hotels before and this one is by far the lesser of the group The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful but the overal hotel disappointed The room was okay but the bathroom was ridiculously small why anybody thought it was a brilliant idea to have to crawl over the toilet to get into the shower is anybody s guess though I do appreciate that it is an old mansion and you have use the room you have In the room itself there was nowhere to put any clothing The furniture was rickety and behind the door there was a little cubby hole where some clothing could be hung but the door could not be opened completely due to the door closer at the top of the hotel room door Also the handle was very loose on the cupboard door The bed itself was too hard to sleep on , The location of the hotel is absolutely brilliant Close to an underground station and the museums
