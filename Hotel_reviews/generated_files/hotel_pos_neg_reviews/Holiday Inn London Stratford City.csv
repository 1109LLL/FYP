30655,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Offering a massage facility that doesn t have appointments available , Great location Staff very friendly and helps you out a lot Even to grab a drink in the early hours of the morning 
30656,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, The room we ended up with was a disability room as they only had two single beds in a room left This should be clearer on the booking com website as the listing said either or assuming we could choose on arrival The disability room had wet patches on the carpet in a few places pretty weird , I guess the location was good not much else tbh

30663,Holiday Inn London Stratford City,No Negative, I arrived at 2am and the front desk staff were friendly welcoming and got me checked in very quickly I got the direct coach from Stansted Airport to Stratford and it was a short walk over the bridge to the hotel The room was nicely decorated and comfortable a bit chilly but the temperature controls were easy to manage I was able to order room service from the limited 24hr menu The bed was really comfortable the room was quiet and it had a lovely bathroom with a decent shower There were a couple of dark grey streaks on one of the white bath towels that looked like mascara but apart from that it was spotless Check out in the morning was quick and efficient and I was able to leave my case with the concierge on the ground floor for the day too It s in a great location within Westfield a very short walk from Stratford station and the Olympic Park

30677,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, We ordered room service breakfast which turned up an hour later than requested We had to chase the order twice They made amends by adding extras to our order including glasses of prosecco , Excellent location Inside Westfield Shopping Centre 2 mins from underground station and less than 10 mins to London Stadium Room was spacious and very clean Nice big comfortable bed 
30678,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Plug in bath shower was not user friendly and without any instructions It was obvious that previous guests had also struggled with it A hook on the back of the bathroom door would have been a useful addition , The best thing about this hotel was the capacity to book inter connecting rooms This is by far the best arrangement for a family and made us feel safe and secure We were able to specify a double plus a twin The bed was very comfortable and a choice of soft or firm pillow was a nice touch The room was comfortable clean and a good temperature Everything we could have needed was provided including and iron and ironing board 
30679,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, No fridge , Super yummy breakfast Very helpful staff Perfect location for Westfield shopping a browse around the Olympic park and the O2 a short tube ride away

30684,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Breakfast wa expensive and we had a much better one in Hackney Wick, Hotel was fine and conveniently located to Hackney Wick where our son lives Didn t eat in the hotel as expensive
30685,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Restaurant food very average taxi company that hotel use is overpriced Taxi we used on return journeys was less than half the price very frustrating , Lovely modern hotel very clean and comfortable Good location near Olympic village 
30686,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Air conditioned rooms Bottled water would have been good to have , Breakfast buffet very good with lots of choice All staff very helpful and friendly Asked for extra tea bags and milk in reception and before we had managed to travel in lift back to room all had been delivered Well Done 
30687,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, They lied outright and by doing so made us all sign up to the IHG rubbish They told us that this will give us cheaper rates and late check outs as well as priority bookings but no such thing I ve had this IHG for a few months and it has been the biggest nightmare and a front for the staff at both Holiday Inn and Staybridge Suites to embarrass us as if we didn t graduate from university and wouldn t understand their poor unfounded claims for why we aren t entitled to the very elements we were promised by becoming a member The price via IHG is always extortionate compared to booking com and this will only give you some points of which you need 10 more extortionate stays before you may qualify for a free night Via booking com you would have managed to save enough money to have got 3 4 extra nights for free after paying for 10 via money saved , Having stayed here many times it seems no more 
30688,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, A bit tatty around the edges Bath surround was peeling off and drain didn t work very well Some hairs in a corner of the bathroom which I spotted the first time I went into the room and which stayed there for the whole two day stay even though the room was cleaned Booked a double bed and was disappointed to be given a room with two single beds , Staff generally friendly and anxious to please Breakfast very good Good range of channels on TV 
30689,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Little pricey but completely reasonable for the location , Excellent location just up from the bus and tube station On the street at Westfields Views of the o2 and the Olympic Park from our window We stayed here for a concert at the o2 and a shopping trip at Westfields and it was ideal 
30690,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Nothing This hotel has everything, Very clean contemporary comfortable room ideal for a city theatre break Ideal location for the high speed rail link and central line into London Also Westfield shopping is literally a hop skip and jump away 
30691,Holiday Inn London Stratford City,No Negative, The Bengali staff member was so helpful and friendly and made the stay so worth it I didn t catch his name but he was so helpful give this man a raise 
30692,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, The bathroom had just shower curtains there was no glass or bathtubs They just created a side of the wall and made shower curtains for demarcation when you want to take a bath I find that horrible Also no iron or iron board For 235 per night That s horrible , Proximity to the mall nice breakfast with lots of options comfortable bd
30693,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Could not have a bath as could not get the plug to stay down, The room was spotlessly clean and had everything you needed The breakfast was lovely everything was fresh and hot The staff were excellent 
30694,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, I had two bookings for continuous three consecutive days while I checked in I was given a room accessible to handicap guests I requested to get my room changed and to my surprised a lady at reception told me tha booking com selected any room and hence the handicap accessible room was allotted to me Upon many request to change the room I was didsapointed with negative answer Then finally to my surprise the reception lady asked me to pay Sterling Pound 5 per day to change the room I was charged 15 bucks for three night extra which is weirded Same room but with a double bed Upon asking why extra for another room and I got an answer which could not stop me laughing she said since the beds were king size this is considered as an upgraded room There was no difference in size and interior compared to other room just an king size bed This is not acceptable and I request Booking com to clearly mention the room catogary while confirming the rooms Also there was no refrigerator in room, Comfortable beds and Good location

30700,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, The staff were absolutely awful especially the hotel manager at check out he took my money off my card in a secluded place without me being present or getting my authorisation and refused to give me a break down of what I m paying for He inflated the price because I left two days early so I ended up paying the same amount as if I had stayed the full time I booked All in all everyone was very dishonest and they all kept contradicting themselves ,No Positive
30701,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, I was kept awake by a green light on the ceiling and the hum of air conditioning The hotel took 50 security from my account in case of damages and said it would take 2 days to get refunded I needed that money and should not have to to wait to use my own money Shocked and outraged ,No Positive

30703,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, I couldn t fault anything , When I booked I messaged the Hotel to ask for a room on one of the upper floors if possible as thought it would be nice to see views over London We were put on the top floor which was great so was nice to see my request was granted 
30704,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, The uht long life milk in the room it taste horrible its disgusting, The courteous manner of the front desk staff was excellent nothing was to much trouble the breakfast was delicious well cooked and plenty to eat well done to all staff Very clean with good quality linen plus the added extra of a bath and a shower very comfortable rooms

30706,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, The only thing would be that there was a few more pots of milk for tea or coffee making in the morning I know we could have asked for more if required , We stayed between Friday to Monday being offered a glass of Prosecco with our breakfast on Saturday and Sunday was a lovely touch We would recommend that you included the breakfast in the price as very good value The choice of pillows on the bed if you wanted soft or firm ones 
30707,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, It was 25 5 degrees in the room with air conditioning not working and no way of cooling the room as no windows When I alerted staff to this they already knew but still put us in that room The second night we asked for something to be done and we did get another room which was fine I was very disappointed that we had to ask to be changed to another room as this should not have happened at all I paid around 350 and should have got better We did love the hotel but felt let down by being put in a overheated room, Breakfast was amazing
30708,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Didn t receive wake up call that had been requested Only coffee in room no tea although housekeeping promptly gave us some when we asked Car park not directly attached to hotel so you need to allow extra time to go to hotel to ask for help with bags , Quiet and comfortable bed Great location for Copperbox Needed to urgently print an email and receptionist offered to do it immediately Was extremely grateful

30711,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, TV remote did not seem to work as advertised Got round the problem just in time to see England Italy rugby match , Breakfast was very good value for money and set us up for the day 
30712,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, Unfortunately when my partner broke her nail all we were given were some plasters and no rinse or cleansing agent The room was booked for two but there was only 1 face towel Parking was an issue because we had to be in and out of the hotel several times and had to pay each time Apart from that the stay was good, The veiw was pleasurable as well the room setting Also woke to a really lovely breakfast which was a good treat The room was clean and tidy Overall a pleasant stay

30753,Holiday Inn London Stratford City, One evening we had a fire evacuation at 5 15 am It was badly organised the evacuation message was switched off the escape stair was full of people not knowing what to do and not moving out of the building we did not see anyone from the staff we had moved from floor 6 to 4 by this time Word of mouth came from below it was a false alarm so people started back up the stairs I found a phone and rang reception to ask what was the situation I was told it was indeed a false alarm I asked why a tannoy message had not been put out to this effect to reassure the guests to be told they did not have one Not there finest hour , Location excellent for shopping and travel on the tube Staff very friendly
