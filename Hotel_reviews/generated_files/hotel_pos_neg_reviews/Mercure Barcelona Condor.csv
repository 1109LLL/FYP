468773,Mercure Barcelona Condor,No Negative, Extremely clean modern massive room and bed great awesome modern bathroom breakfast yum Much much more bigger room than pic show Staffs super helpful nice especially Miguel and lady at Reception will stay again here next time 
468774,Mercure Barcelona Condor, The bathroom didn t have a toilet brush the room was a bit old The hotel didn t look like a 4 star hotel , The bed was very nice and the room was quite large Free coffee and tea all the time 
468775,Mercure Barcelona Condor, The bathroom was not really clean upon arrival There were hairs in the shower from a previous resident Not nice to look at Also upon entering the room for the first time it was stuffy and I had the feeling it had not been aired for a few days remember Barcelona has a hot climate After the cleaning staff arrived the next morning the room was up to scratch ,No Positive
468776,Mercure Barcelona Condor, We arranged early check in to arrive and discover our room wasn t ready 2 hours after the normal check in time We then arrived at our room to discover that despite paying for an upgrade to the privilege suite we were given 2 single beds in a standard room After approaching reception and raising the issue we were then told we would have to wait another 2 hours for our actual privilege room to be ready So had we not raised the issue we would have been given an economy room unbeknown to us but having paid a suite price , The rooms were very clean 
468777,Mercure Barcelona Condor, walls were like paper could hear all the speak from other rooms and outside , Wifi excellent breakfast really good custom service good and workers friendly
468778,Mercure Barcelona Condor, If your room overlooks via Augusta traffic may be a bit noisy This is the only thing I can mention because all the rest was very nicen, The staff was always smiling and very helpful in anything I requested Free wifi very stable and fast Loved the free candy Breakfast was excellent as well I was very comfortable every minute of my stay 
468779,Mercure Barcelona Condor, We didn t like the fact that there were no hooks on the doors or somewhere to hang a jacket that wasn t in the wardrobe You don t always want to put your outerwear on your clean clothes There also needed to be more lights and the shower needed to be much more powerful Our room was for 4 people 2 single beds one pillow a piece and a sofa double bed in another room No duvet on the sofa however the room wasn t particularly cold so this wasn t an issue Where the room was supposed to be a living room it was a little difficult to open the balcony door some manoeuvring was required , The breakfast is a good deal if booked in advance for your entire stay There was something for everyone with pastries and cakes and the traditional Spanish omelette cereals yoghurts fruit plenty of different types of bread Coffee teas and fruit juices Loved the complimentary sweets in the reception Such a quirky addition All the staff were very friendly and attentive The hotel is based in a more residential area which is perfect for giving you a real taste of the local life There are many little caf s or sandwich shops if you re hungry after that all you can eat breakfasts There are also many lovely restaurants with all the traditional dishes 
468780,Mercure Barcelona Condor,No Negative, We got the slightly bigger room and it was nice Had a balcony and supplied bathrobe slippers and full bathroom amenities Staff was helpful and friendly as usual 
468781,Mercure Barcelona Condor, It is NOT a 4 star hotel 2 at max Soundproofing doesn t exist you hear every word move of your neighbours Our room was dark small and COLD a c doesn t work on heating only cooling No tea coffee facilities in the room only a nespresso machine in urgent need of cleaning at reception Not a single English French German TV channel available only Spanish Wi fi speed mediocre Cleaning comes at odd hours when asked to return in half hour never does or comes hours later when it s not convenient again They also seem not to know the difference between please clean the room and do not disturb because either way you hang the sign on your doorknob they don t show up , The staff at reception is very professional Large bathroom with natural light Good breakfast Close to subway stations 
468782,Mercure Barcelona Condor, Restaurant could be used and maximised better by opening it in the evening to serve light snacks such as tea coffee and toasted sandwiches , there was good coffee for breakfast Room was spotless and spacious 
468783,Mercure Barcelona Condor, The male staff is grumpy barely speaks English The girls at the reception are much friendlier and professional At the check out the reception clerk tried to avoid giving us change in coins kept us waiting for a few minutes When I insisted he complied by saying it s only 3 eurors ,No Positive
468784,Mercure Barcelona Condor, The WiFi was very poor in today s world that is a must The shower head didn t work properly and the glassseparating the shower was too short and water got everywhere , The staff was very nice the breakfast was delicious and the location was great The room and size were good 
468785,Mercure Barcelona Condor, bit of a shame the price did not include breakfast so we had to pay extra although a bit cheaper if we booked for all of our stay no tea making facilities in the room, Alejandro who was on reception went above and beyond to assist when one of our rooms was very unsatisfactory and found another more suitable room immediately he provided us with a map marking all the places we should visit and what to avoid which was very helpful and he also very kindly recommended an excellent local restaurant to us on our last night there was free coffee in reception breakfast was very filling and showers very good
468786,Mercure Barcelona Condor, The room doesn t have enough natural light You can hear very well what s happebing on the next room and you coul feel the vibration from the metro passing in the underground ,No Positive
468787,Mercure Barcelona Condor,No Negative, Accommodation at the hotel was good Room is amazing Staff is very kind and ready to help Only one thing bad there that no kettle tea and coffee making facilities in the room We really miss it No restaurant or room service there as well 
468788,Mercure Barcelona Condor, Location is good but sadly no pubs are nearby And the last day the front desk staff did a mistake on charge that tax rate had been changed but she didnt know it When we asked her to recheck all price again and she realized the new tax was lower than that , Room was clean and staffs were kind 
468789,Mercure Barcelona Condor, Monotonic breakfast every day without much choice No close 24 7 stores to buy drinks, Perfect location near metro pleasant staff clean rooms Quite rooms even window turned to street 
468790,Mercure Barcelona Condor, Nothing really important If asked to mention something minibar assortment was poor glass shower door leaked slightly which caused a wet floor , Very nicely modern decorated rooms excellent bathroom Comfortable bed While not located in downtown center the hotel is located near several metro and bus stations and all attractions sites can be reached within 15 minutes with direct connecitons Though the very nice neigherhoods Eixample and Garcia can be reached by foot in about 10 15 minutes Good breakfast too with just a bit more options than your average hotel breakfast 
468791,Mercure Barcelona Condor, The cost per night at approximately 100 is in my opinion too high for given that breakfast was not included , The location is ideal for the tourist attractions just a short metro ride or bus ride 
468792,Mercure Barcelona Condor, Staff in reception were not updated on where to purchase tickets for sightseeing Sagrada Familia in our case After we found out how and where to purchase them and were explaining this to another hotel guest a receptionist overheard the conversation and told me off why I didn t let him know first saying it is his job to know such things The bathroom had bad odour coming from the source , Nice bathroom though extremely bad odours from source 
468793,Mercure Barcelona Condor, After we check in and went to the room we found it not clean and the bed was messy they didn t clean after the last guest We waited on the stairs till they finish they didn t even apologies Second day they made up the beds only didn t clean the tables nor the floor we asked more than once for tissue box but no one helped , Location and the space of the room 
468794,Mercure Barcelona Condor, Rooms lacked finishing touches especially in the bathroom Water leaked from shower to the floor Could see unfinished void in the bathroom s ceiling Did expect better for 4 star hotel , Rooms cleaned daily Husband had shaving set provided and changed after using it Clean rooms
468795,Mercure Barcelona Condor,No Negative, The rooms were fabulous excellent value for money The staff are friendly and very helpful The breakfast is huge and delicious Great air con needed after the summer temperatures Loved the place 
468796,Mercure Barcelona Condor, Grey featureless room did not justify 100 per night , Location was just off the beaten track so local resteraunts were cheap and it only took 10 minutes to Plaza Catalunya
468797,Mercure Barcelona Condor, I couldnt faault anything all very good, A surprising comfortable hotel with great helpful staff large room amd very comfy bed
