121069,Phileas Hotel, It is really a little bit difficult to find it you really have to take a good look before you see it , Very nice hotel perfect position very nice rooms 
121070,Phileas Hotel, Terrible personal with terrible conditions I can t advise this hotel to my friends and nobody In our room was dirty bed linen It s not 4 hotel it s maximum 2 And in our room was bed smell I can t understand why booking are selling this hotel like 4 , Nothing 
121071,Phileas Hotel, Wifi was spotty and kept going in and out We weren t the only ones literally everyone was complaining about it The area was kind of remote and felt unsafe especially at night Whatever I saved on the hotel I spent on Ubers and then some , The room and bathroom were very nice 
121072,Phileas Hotel, Front desk was often unattended and it did not look very appealing proffesional , Really liked the room and the bathroom bed was comfortable abd very clean 
121073,Phileas Hotel, Can t believe the housekeeping leave the door wide open when we come back to the room in the night but luckily there is nothing missing in our room , Location is great Very helpful front deck personnel 
121074,Phileas Hotel, We inadvertently booked two rooms instead of one We had to pay the full amount as the hotel made no attempt to rent out the extra room In our confirmation email the two room booking was not mentioned They also got the date wrong and has us booked in a day early which I did see and draw their attention to The shower drain was also blocked , Nothing to recommend here A very poor hotel 
121075,Phileas Hotel, Internet connection must be better it breaks up from time to time , Great location easy access to tube and city center Great breakfast not busy in the morining Great staff ready to help in every monment especially Benoit great guy who helps us a lot during the stay he gives us great instructions what to see and visit in Paris 
121076,Phileas Hotel, Everything was absolutely to our satisfaction , Friendly and helpful staff Wonderful breakfasts of a variety of breads meats cheese and baguettes Room was nicely appointed and comfortable beds Close to transportation and all the amenities 
121077,Phileas Hotel, The room was quite hot and the air conditioning wasn t very good I actually opened the windows a few times because of the heat , Apartment was clean and well soundproofed Coffee tea and water provided
121078,Phileas Hotel, It was 24 degrees when we went and still warm at night yet despite that the air con was not on even after we complain meaning that we did not sleep as well as we d hoped not all the rooms have city views as opposed to the description , The hotel was very good in the middle yet it felt quiet when you ate in it The room we had was REALLY CLEAN both days and the bed was huge and confy
121079,Phileas Hotel, elevator really slow no AC room got very hot made it hard to sleep couldnt leave windows open because way too noisy, location was great 5 minutes walk to Galeries Lafayette a lot of nice restaurants on Saint Lazare street was really close to metro room was nice had your basic needs comfy bed clean spacious shower
121080,Phileas Hotel, The bagno baignoire was old and and samall the Ac didnt work nicely To reache the left had to take stairs with bagages its not easy , The bed is huge and excellent quality
121081,Phileas Hotel, Breakfast has very limited selection but it was fine for us For guest with hight expectations for variety of breakfast it could be a problem , Very friendly stuff and warm welcome in the hotel Room was very clean on the 6th floor stairs to first floor and then there is a lift big and clean bathroom with wide shower Room had really nice design automatic curtains bed was big and very comfortable 4 pillows provided two soft and two heard Localisation was perfect just few steps from metro and RER station It s also good located for longer walks to the Paris attractions We will definitely stay here next time 
121082,Phileas Hotel, All was good , Very close to Gare Lazare train station which made it close to the Hop On Hop Off bus pick up A number of good restaurants close and the ones referred by the staff were good choices The room was small but very nicely decorated Breakfast was continental 
121083,Phileas Hotel, I can t find fault with this hotel but was slightly surprised and disappointed to see that soft drinks in the fridge were no longer complementary as the rooms are not that cheap , I like the fact that breakfast is served until 11 am so you don t have to get up too early on a Sunday The front desk staff at The Phileas are delightful Xavier on a Saturday and Ben on a Sunday always give a warm welcome 
121084,Phileas Hotel, Room was too hot and staff wouldn t turn on the A C Unable to open window due to noisey extract fan on roof and smell of cooking , Close to railway station and Metro Varied choice of breakfast 
121085,Phileas Hotel, Although it has been mentioned that there is a lift in hotel the lift works from the first floor and should take stairs from ground floor to the first It is better to be aware of strict rules of this hotel about credit card I had a reservation and although they had charged me before my arrival they wanted me to show the credit card for check in Since I did not have it with me the receptionist wanted me to pay the whole price in cash and returned the money to the credit card which I used to reserve the room I had no choice because the withdraw had already been done and reservation was completed without cancellation They claimed that they had already announced me when they sent confirmation email to me but I found it later as the last sentence which was written at the bottom I have traveled to many European countries and stayed in various hotels where my passport was sufficient and I had never had such a problem in check in Sometimes I saw that glasses and cutlery were not quite clean At least I could see the water mark on most of the spoons and knives , Self service snack was a great idea It was enjoyable to seat relax in lounge room and drink coffee after traveling long distances in the city during the day 
121086,Phileas Hotel, Our room had a bad functioning AC and the noice from the very busy traffic on the street was quite disturbing , The staff was fantastic and the comfort in the hotel was great The breakfast good and fresh even if there were not so much more than great bread croissants coffee and juice 
121087,Phileas Hotel, Elevator is not coming down to street level so you ll have to walk up one floor and might just as well continue by foot from there Not really an issue for me but for the sake of balancing my review a bit , Sweet little hotel perfectly located next to St Lazare station Once you step in you ll forget the hustle of the neighbourhood I had booked a Luxury XXL room and it was really spacious Very comfortable bed nice boutique decor big shower bathroom well lit Very friendly staff always with a smile Breakfast choice is not overwhelming but it does the trick Quality and taste is good You re in Paris after all I think I found my new home in Paris 
121088,Phileas Hotel, The hotel is set in a depressing road Passers by could almost certainly see into my first floor room ended up drawing the curtains one afternoon , The room was attractive although relatively small typically for Paris Very close to Gare St Lazare with fantastic transport links 
121089,Phileas Hotel, The bathroom in my room was a dirty in a way that made me uncomfortable , The front Desk staff was absolutely amazing Some of the nicest people I ve ever encountered in Paris 
121090,Phileas Hotel, The rooms are way too tiny For the amount of money this hotel charges I had expected more facilities and space For example the bathroom had no shampoo or conditioner just a hair body wash in one , Location was good for my purpose Staff was friendly 
121091,Phileas Hotel, Breakfast is very basic coffee croissants juice yogurt basic ham and cheese flakes cereal jam There were no hot meals whatsoever no eggs scrambled or boiled sausages or bacon In our room shower sealing wasn t good so water was leaking on the floor If your room window faces street you won t be able to sleep with opened window due to noise with closed window it s OK , Good location
121092,Phileas Hotel, Breakfast was only just so so croissants pain au chocolat coffee was plain bad juice was good No free water supplied which was a let down , Bed was very comfortable room was clean good shower good location right next to the Saint Lazarre station Breakfast until 11AM on a Sunday which was good 
121093,Phileas Hotel, In out opinion the rooms were on the small side but as this was the first time we stayed in Paris we really have nothing to compare this with , Friendliness of staff and their support when it was needed Modern way hotel was set up and the location that it was situated 
121094,Phileas Hotel, The location is not good There were beggars right outside the hotel I came back to the hotel in the evening and someone was half blocking the entrance asking for money Not a nice area directly around the hotel but you can easily walk from here to the Opera etc I just did not feel 100 comfortable at night on my own , Nice room spacious Comfortable bed Good decoration Bathroom and shower clean new comfortable Staff friendly 
121095,Phileas Hotel, To reach the elevator you ll need to go upstairs Might be a much needed exercise after a few dinners , Well located hotel next to Gare S t Lazare Nice nice and perfectly cleaned rooms Friendly staff and really godd value for money 
121096,Phileas Hotel, It was a little too warm in the room and the air con didn t work very well The area is very busy and the window wasn t soundproof , Excellent location Staff very helpful and friendly Room very cosy comfy I ll be back for sure 
121097,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, Really friendly and nice staff The room is quite big compare to price range for Paris really nice room and huge bed Room on the street is incredibly quite 
121098,Phileas Hotel, The hotel entrance doesn t look so nice The mini bar was empty except for a small bottle of water AND there was no possibility to order another drink in the hotel , The room was comfortable large and nicely decorated Also very quiet Nice and clean bathroom with walk in shower 
121099,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, The location was right across from the train station which made travel an ease The staff was very polite and helpful and spoke English happily Very professional The room was updated and had a disco shower light 
121100,Phileas Hotel, nothing to much to complain, Rare to find so good hotel for this price in Paris As i travel from Gare St Lazaire which is just cross the street makes this hotel perfect location for me 
121101,Phileas Hotel, A problem with internet once during our staying but it was solved quickly, I will defenately turn back this hotel when I go Paris next time Rather good breakfast for Paris only without vegetables clean quiet and comfortable room bathroom with soft towels that were changed every day extremely polite staff 
121102,Phileas Hotel, Rooms are big enough but don t expect spacious this is Paris after all Wifi signals not top notch so often had to resort to using a personal hotspot which can be pricey There was also construction behind our room so early wake up times but this isn t the fault of the hotel , Breakfast was delish Staff super friendly were able to communicate in french and english Rooms were nice and clean Location excellent 
121103,Phileas Hotel, Very unkindly receptionist Ones at 7 00 morning was false alarm in hotel everybody get up so for nothing Elevator sometime work sometimes not , It was very clean tidy and new breakfast was t so much special Hotel is on good location 
121104,Phileas Hotel, Fire alarm went off at 7 40 am on a Sunday No action needed but still got up and dressed in a hurry Very stressful and hopefully not to be repeated , Staff a delight and have been very loyal to this hotel but feeling a bit Fawlty Towers on my last two visits 
121105,Phileas Hotel, It would be nice if the breakfast can have a variety every other day Also the elevator would be better if it reaches the ground floor for the luggages , The breakfast is great with the capuccino cafe latte and jiuices Our room is quite big for a hotel in Paris 
121106,Phileas Hotel, The road outside the hotel, Hotel lobby is bright and cheery and my room was spotlessly clean well appointed and spacious The hotel interior is as much a delight as the exterior is underwhelming A good experience once inside
121107,Phileas Hotel, I have stayed at many hotels in Paris Phileas Hotel is not a four star hotel at all I still don t understand how they granted four star to this hotel It is hardly three star hotel in fact So it is not the value for the money you pay , The location of the hotel was good
121108,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful hotel immaculately clean very comfortable bed excellent shower superb location great breakfast and a nice welcome from host highly recommended Judy David Nouvelle Zealand
121109,Phileas Hotel, Small issue We had a mysterious leak under the carpet in front of the bathroom that was unresolved when we left but they had been trying to figure that out , Our room was modern clean with a very comfortable bed and the bathroom had a great shower We enjoyed the breakfast room with warm croissants eggs sausage assortment of cheeses meats yogurt and fruit Service was excellent helped us choose the easiest routes each day 
121110,Phileas Hotel, The rooms we stayed in 11 12 opened directly into the very small breakfast area and kitchen The preparations started at 4 30 am even with the very good sound proofing we were woken up Felt very strange opening the door to people sat next to it eating their breakfast City view it was a building site not a city view Breakfast small selection Right next to late night take aways Arriving late at night the children found it a little daunting Given hotel was not clearly signed and lots of people around drunk waiting for their kebab The reviews all said staff were helpful but we didn t find them to be as helpful as they were to the French couple checking in before us Parking is not included and is around the corner at 29 euro per 24 hours This wasn t clear during the booking process , Bedrooms 11 12 lovely clean and comfortable Good central location right next to main train station 
121111,Phileas Hotel, They just need to work on the smell of thr entrance The rooms are very clean but as soon as you enter the hotel the smell is not good , The room is very comfortable small and cosy The location is perfect and the staff are really helpful
121112,Phileas Hotel, Rude personnel Personnel gave us a wrong room Did not want to admit their fault Trying to seem like we were wrong Finally when another colleague came we did get the correct room No apologies were made When we mentioned that the other colleague was rude We were told we were liars To get to the elevator you first have to use stairs Very inconvenient to be climbing stairs with your suitcases Also no hotelstaff offered to help with luggage We had to do it all by outself , Rooms were clean
121113,Phileas Hotel, Close to the train station therefore a lot of homeless and cheap eateries not very pleasant The entrance to the hotel is 2 meters wide and located between doner and Chinese imbiss The receptionist didn t help us a lot with a parking just took money and gave the envelope with receipt and wi fi code The window was on the street and it was very noisy They should change the omelette it is awful The AC minimum temperature is 19C that is very cold but without it there is no fresh air because you can not open the window Overall overrated hotel but quite good , The hotel is centrally located near Opera The breakfast is quite good not only French Bed was comfortable and the room was big by Paris standards The shower is good and with colour lights inside The reception is open 24 hours a day 
121114,Phileas Hotel, No wifi working for the first night and this is not helpful on a business trip Front desk in the morning didn t acknowledge there was an issue with wifi and this is even worse Didn t expect such service as I have had a good experience previously Once again this happens will certainly have to consider other alternatives , Centrally located convenient to get to clean and nice rooms 
121115,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, The staff are brilliant felt so welcome and they do the extra little things that you wouldn t expect but make your stay just that little bit better 
121116,Phileas Hotel, The room was a bit smaller than i thought but its enough for 2 people , The reception staff was super friendly and helpful He explained everything that we needed and greeted us nicely every time The location was amazing and really handy 
121117,Phileas Hotel, Entrance reception bedroom breakfast room everything feels small Slightly noisy street , Room furniture and decoration Comfortable bed fluffy soft pillows
121118,Phileas Hotel, They re slightly short staffed They need one to serve hot drinks and work the breakfast room and another to do luggage checking in out It can t be done in high season by the same person and run efficiently , I love this hotel The staff are delightful the location is central and the rooms are massive by Paris standards It s also clean and comfortable I brought friends out for a rugby match this weekend and they said they d be very happy to return 
121119,Phileas Hotel, Lot s of construction which resulted in waking early to loud noises Also the hotel had no Air Conditioning I have no idea why , Staff was excellent and very helpful Great room and bathroom Plenty of room 
121120,Phileas Hotel, No bath No self service toaster or microwave at breakfast in order to Heat things up You have to ask the waiter for drinks And to Heat food, Bedrooms very comfy Location excellent
121121,Phileas Hotel, The WIFI wasnt working properly for me Especially when I came back late in the night I could not get a connection established and when I informed the reception it was not resolved Even with a new WIFi code the next morning it was not working properly , Good location close to the Google office Bed was comfortable and good shower 
121122,Phileas Hotel, Some wifi issues but staff tried to resolve and did partially , The room was slightly smaller than average sized for Europe nicely decorated and everything there was highly functional nice bed and big showerhead with good water pressure in the shower Front desk staff was super helpful and friendly always proactively looking out for us I would stay here again and recommend this hotel 
121123,Phileas Hotel, Nothing , Such an amazing hotel The personel where very friendly and helpfull and the people at the reception gave the best recomendations for restaurents The location is amazing in walking distance of almost everything Very nice rooms with comfetable beds and big batherooms And the breakfast is great 
121124,Phileas Hotel, The only con is the noise coming from la rue d Amsterdam and the window do not filter it very well Luckily it is quite calm at night , The decoration is lovely the staff friendly and helpful The bathroom is woman friendly which is not the case everywhere else The bed was very comfy as well 
121125,Phileas Hotel, Room service Although the food is good it is very expensive and served on plastic dishes, Location Extremely close to St Lazare very central station right next to the terminal station of the CDG bus Opera Actually right on the route of the bus i asked the driver to open the door right out of the hotel Comfort No negative comments although a paris hotel Water bottles are for free and unlimited very small gesture but wow Staff very friendly Wifi Breakfast very complete and good despite a paris hotel usually the breakfasts are mediocre Sound insulation despite on a very busy street absolute silence in the 1st floor room 
121126,Phileas Hotel, Overall small environment lobby hall way rooms with limited views from the window, Location is great Walking distance to major shopping areas and tourist sites
121127,Phileas Hotel, The internet was terrible Even though I was on vacation I had a few important things that I needed to handle online The wifi when it worked was spotty Even the hotel at the property didn t have an internet connection , I thought the decor was really cute and chic The location was also great Less than a minute walking to the train station but on a side street so it wasn t too busy 
121128,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, Location very convenient to shopping metro stations and walking distance to Le Louvre and most of Paris s attractions Our room was very stylish and big by European standards The staff was extremely polite and helpful Would stay there again in a heartbeat 
121129,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable The room was exceptionally clean and neat The location one block from the Gare Lazare was very accessible Moderate cost restaurants were close Certainly would stay there again 
121130,Phileas Hotel, Nothing Maybe more alcohol and drinks in fridge Not major though Great staff, Very good Lovely staff Caught them at a tragic time the y We re very professional
121131,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff Surprisingly clean and nice hotel for Paris comparing with others hotel in Paris in this price range this one you will not regret
121132,Phileas Hotel, The rooms were a bit small but still clean and comfortable , The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful especially Benoit who worked the front desk 
121133,Phileas Hotel, You could hear some some noise from the street, The staff were lovely at check in the rooms were a good size and clean There were 5 of us and we had connecting rooms which was great The hotel provided free drinks and toiletries It s also in a great location
121134,Phileas Hotel, Some misunderstandings as we were addressing our requests to the night shift staff we checked in rather late in the evening It turned out later they were simply not in charge in certain areas such as e g recovery code for the safe Advice double check with day shift staff , Great facilities shower Modern and spacious room with long hallway bathroom and a separate toilet Newly refurbished Free minibar with water and soft drinks Very professional and friendly staff Great place to stay in comparison to the usual standard in Paris 
121135,Phileas Hotel, not sure why hotels in Europe do not have toilet bidet or at least hose this one is no exception really great though that the toilet is a separate room from the shower so very convenient for friends who need to use both at the same time , location is quite central and near the metro station St Lazare 
121136,Phileas Hotel, Unfortunately there were several things we did not like First it was cold in Paris the night that we arrived in the hotel 40 F 5 C We arrived to our room to find the window wide open and the room freezing cold There were cigarette butts on the window sill obviously someone smoked and then tried to air out the smell It took hours for the room to warm up again The thermostat in our room did not work until the front desk reset it for us Second the shower had a noticeable smell I thought it was cleaner but my fianc thought it was mold though everything did look clean Third the room is most definitely not sound proof We could hear the street traffic a TV in the room next door and people in the hallway We stay in Paris twice a month at different hotels each time and soundproof rooms are insulated from this kind of noise and often even have two layers of windows Our room was in a small hallway with only two other rooms so it wasn t like we were next to the elevator or a central meeting space where this might be more expected To be clear I don t think the walls were especially thin but to label the rooms as soundproof would be dishonest Fourth the Wifi connection was so weak we could not use it at all We booked this room last minute and got a very good deal 99 EUR but even with this benefit we cannot ignore these other issues , The room is beautiful and a decent size for Paris We found the bed and pillows very comfortable compared to other hotels of the same price There is a cool additional light fixture in the shower that changes colors at different speeds In general the lighting in the room is very good We liked the outlets on both sides of the bed for cell phone charging Everything in the hotel looks brand new We felt safe in the location just across from the Saint Lazare train station It was well placed a short walk to the nightlife of Place de Clichy and would be a short walk in the other direction to Opera 
121137,Phileas Hotel, breakfast room a little busy as very small need to come down early but staff very friendly and helpful , staff were fantastic so helpful with directions printing out anything we needed lending i phone charger etc
121138,Phileas Hotel, nothing Let s say I paid the price 167 is not cheap but good value for money , Quality bed Good bathroom Quiet room no noises from neighbors or street friendly staff
121139,Phileas Hotel, They just don t attend to their business center Printer out of ink with hundreds of files awaiting printing Out of paper as well Internet is terrible Manager didn t seem to care just excuses , staff very helpful and attentive good location within walking distance to most areas of interest opera Montmartre shopping Metro station within 5 min 
121140,Phileas Hotel, The room was huge I booked the deluxe double but the closet was still just a foot or two wide with four hangers Despite the sq footage of the room I still had a full week s worth of clothes all over the place It doesn t make sense to have a room that size with big empty space and no closet space for longer stays There was also a huge brown soaking wet stain in my carpet outside the bathroom all week which wasn t cleaned up despite my call to reception I was told to wear slippers and put a towel down instead Also the WORST internet in France It kicks you out on a 7 minute timer and you have to log back in with a user name and password Not at all practical for a work trip , Staff was friendly Bed was very comfortable and the shower was great
121141,Phileas Hotel, Wifi not stable have to sign in multiple times , Very convenient location can walk to Primtemp Lafayette a lot of eateries Train station is closed by The staff are super friendly helpful 
121142,Phileas Hotel, No parking at all we were coming back from Normandy with a Eurocar nowhere to park Please note that there is a Eurocar return in the parking garage the hotel recommends we didn t know that or would have taken advantage , Beautiful room very clean and roomy Please note there are a few stairs even with a lift Excellent staff very friendly and helpful I was impressed Location is great except if you have a car our mistake 
121143,Phileas Hotel, Musty smelling room terrible breakfast canned fruit white bread sweetened dry scrambled eggs but weirdly prosecco Cramped breakfast room Very poor value for money I expect a much better breakfast for 300 a night , Location is good nice big room Wifi fine Roof terrace 
121144,Phileas Hotel, Only one downside very small breakfast room and everybody coming down together there was nowhere to sit However breakfast was very good, Excellent hotel and the staff were excellent in everyday
121145,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, This was a fantastic find in the centre of Paris The staff were extremely helpful and the room exceeded our expectations in terms of quality and style The room was more spacious than I had expected and exceptionally well furnished We were at the end of our trip but otherwise would have loved to have stayed a couple of days longer 
121146,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, 1 Excellent service Mr Beniot and team were very professional helpful 2 Next to St Lazare station easy to take metro next to Bld Haussmann for shops walking distance to Madeline 3 Rooms with space very pleasant bathroom and shower area

121148,Phileas Hotel, The entrance is narrow and doesn t reflect the 4star quality of the hotel Receptionist was very kind and made us feel very welcome , Location is very covenient near metro RER and train station Opera and major stores Printemps etc at walking distance Staff very kind and helpfull 
121149,Phileas Hotel, I could not enter the hotel in the late night Reception is occupied with room serices , Nice location for sightsseing Connection room is good for family stay Friendly and kind reception services 
121150,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was clean The staff were friendly and helpful The quality of the fixtures was high particularly the shower It was in a central location We were able to leave our case there after checkout on the day of departure without charge We were invited to sit in the hotel and have a coffee whilst waiting for our early evening train We would definately recommend this hotel 
121151,Phileas Hotel,No Negative, Location excellent for Garnier Opera Grands Magasins excursion to Giverny and more Newly renovated proper clean surprisingly quiet very friendly and helpful staff all in all a very pleasant experience 
121152,Phileas Hotel, Central part of Paris is a bit expensive in terms of parking The public underground parking next door goes for 29 Euros for a duration between 12 hours and 24 hours for a more extended period there is a discount but the car will have to stay in the parking so why bother coming by car anyway , The hotel is located some 100 meters from the St Lazare station which may be an advantage for those using public transportation The area is rather quiet despite the vicinity of the station The hotel is super suprisingly clean All the facilities are working and it seems it has been freshly renovated The rooms are rather quiet even the ones facing the Amsterdam street The staff are friendly There is no restaurant at the hotel but there are plenty of dining options in the city and in the area For those having late evening thirst there is a night shop across the street
