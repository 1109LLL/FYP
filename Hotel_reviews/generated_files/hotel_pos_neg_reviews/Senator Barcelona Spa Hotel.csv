295331,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Beds on roof wooden and uncomfortable, Amazing from start to finish easy check in clean rooms good breakfast security man taking all our group pictures very friendly Amazing indoor pools spa Roof top pool uncomfortable beds but ok to sit for an hour All of us going back next year 
295332,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The Spa was closed for the duration of our stay , The rooms were comfortable and clean house keeping staff in every morning The breakfasts in the buffet style restaurant were lovely The staff were very friendly and the reception staff were so very helpful when our luggage was delayed Taxis were promptly booked through reception when there wasn t a strike on 
295333,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The spa was closed and they did not tell us until we asked to use the spa They did not tell us the spa was closed before we got to the hotel when I was already communicating with them nor during check in The water in the shower constantly changed from really hot to really cold Just did not live up to the hype at all The location is right next to camp not but is a way out from the beach and the city centre but not too hard to get about on the metro just not ideal , Breakfast was quite nice The rooms were spacious and clean 
295334,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, You couldn t have a proper meal in the evening as they seemed to close the kitchen You could get some snack meals which we did have and although not freshly made on site they were tasty enough This was the only let down as it would have been the icing on the cake to have a nice evening restaurant in the hotel , Most of the staff were very friendly especially some of the young girls The breakfast was amazing and the choice was fantastic one of the best breakfasts we ve had It was also my partners 60th while their and the hotel gave him a Bottle of Champagne and a Card This was a very special touch and my partner was very grateful
295335,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Bad cleaning and skipped cleaning of our room one day for no reason Microwaved food in the piano bar Smelly rooms Noisy Expensive Bad location , The freshly pressed orange juice in the breakfast buffet
295336,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Our room on the 1st floor was very hot and we could nt open the window were told at reception that it s a safety precaution Had to have the fan and aircon turned on all the time made my daughter sick , Very close to Camp Nou my son loved that My daughter loved the pool spa was under renovation Close to metro tram and bus very safe area Security and staff generally friendly 
295337,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Air conditioning goes off when you leave your room so in hot weather you always come back to a room that needs cooling down Suggestion have an extra plastic card that you can leave in the master switch slot so that the air con stays on while you are out , No hassle good commercial hotel everything very acceptable but nothing particularly special 
295338,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, See above, Spa is misleading as you have to pay after a certain time it s not open all day and you can only go for free between 9 12 not very accommodating
295339,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Asked for early check in 13 00 arrived at 14 00 room not ready till 14 45 did ask for high rise room got floor one Not impressed second stay, Good position for city tour
295340,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The spa was rubbish consisted of little pools which were just pools the steam room was quite nice but at 180 Euros a night it was well over priced, Breakfast
295341,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, I had to visit reception two or three times each day to get my key reprogrammed I didn t keep it next to my phone It was just a rubbish system When I suggested a free beer or breakfast might be appropriate recompense for this continued inconvenience the response was it s impossible Pretty poor customer service , Breakfast was good I liked the pool but the pool bar was non existent Lots of rubbish blowing around on the terrace too 
295342,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Darkish fairly small room Hadn t prepared sofa bed for child had to request Bit soulless Not really for families looking to base themselves mostly in their hotel Hard to get info on basics like when meals were where pools were etc Rooftop pool deep would not be suitable for little kids Good for transit excellent for Nou Camp imagine less so for extended young family stay , Perfect for Nou Camp 10 min walk to stadium could see it from the hotel Great rooftop pool really lovely best thing about hotel Friendly staff Good breakfast Nice local neighbourhood area Close to Metro easy access to city centre Very clean and everything worked in room Supplied toiletries hair dryer fridge and safe in room 
295343,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The swimming pool was tiny I had selected the hotel because of it The food in the restaurant offered limited choice but was OK , Cleanliness The floor in my room was shining and I was very happy to walk barefoot on it Quiet even though at a central location Even though Barcelona was super hot on these days there was a little breeze going through my room so I was fresh without air conditioning They supplied fresh water in the fridge every day Good access to Underground 
295344,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Facilities in desperate need of a renovation room very old fashioned floor not cleaned from previous guests pool opening times are restrictive , Easy access from airport with L9 to Collblanc station short walk
295345,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Small poorly designed room really in need of refurbishment Hotel was expensive and the spa treatments on offer ridiculously expensive as was parking in the hotel s underground car park The breakfast also expensive is served in a dingy and gloomy room which certainly needs a coat of paint ,No Positive
295346,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Rooms tired old fashioned room smelled musty Bad staining on the ceiling Wi fi hit miss Safe didn t work Breakfast poor value at 12 , Handy for Nou camp Staff on reception friendly 
295347,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Nothing , Excellent service Left extremely satisfied after booking and relatively cheap compared to other properties The staff are absolutely tremendous and even took the time to leave a bottle of wine as a surprise in the room as it was my Mothers birthday A joy to stay at and would certainly recommend to anybody wishing to go to Barcelona As for the location the Metro was easily accessible from the hotel and can take you anywhere you wish to go Fantastic location if you want to wake up and visit the Nou Camp 10 10
295348,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel,No Negative, Nice hotel 5 min walk from Cayaluna Metro statio easy to find and a 10 min walk from the Barcelona Stadium on the same metro line as the Sagrada Familliar so overall good location out of the centre but very easily to access Hotel was nice although spa is a little strict ensure you are armed with flip flops or you will have to buy disposable ones at 3 a pair plus must take own towels or 10 to hire them dont forget hair band either 
295349,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Nothing expect more than these give and your not in touch with reality , Smooth transactions no dramas perfect location and super friendly staff Restaurant was excellent with an eclectic choice Barman was super friendly and highly knowledgable and interesting too Overall a fantastic experience for my partners 40th even got a magnum put in the room THANK YOU
295350,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, As above and the location was quite away out of the centre of Barcelona, Loved the spa But in the three days I stayed one day the electricity went no refund and the last day they closed early so missed out 
295351,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Breakfast poor choice of food Jim is too small too hot and wet as it is located at the spa , Nice big room Nice spa centre Nice terrace for sunbathing 
295352,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The breakfast not worth 14 at all only had it the last day Opt for the mac donalds down the road , Rooms spacious and very clean Close to the Nou Camp 5 mins nearest metro about 10 minutes Great price for 3 nights 330ish if we stayed in main Barcelona would of been 800 
295353,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, It s a great location for the football but if you re spending more time in the city centre then it s a 20 25 minute metro ride , Hotel is in a great location for the football You can see the ground from the driveway that leads to the hotel Room was comfortable and the staff I met were all good Didn t use the roof top pool or the spa but would consider staying again 
295354,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Was really disappointed that there was a rooftop pool advertised with my stay only to find it was out of bounds when we got there there was nothing to state this was the case in our booking Also found the checking in procedure really slow waited over 20 minutes to be seen and that was with only 2 people on front of us , Bar staff very nice nice clean rooms and in general a very well kept hotel 
295355,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Had to take two metro lines to reach most of city center areas, Excellent bed and very comfortable helpful staff quiet The L 9 is definitely aprivillage to and fro Elprat airport Near Camp nou
295356,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Don t have any dislikes but I would like to point out that negative comments should be taken with a pinch of salt as there is nothing to complain about at this hotel , Staff were friendly and location for us was brilliant as we went over for the football
295357,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Wasn t keen on a bar meal I had It was lukewarm and obviously microwaved Very disappointing Would like two pillows for my bed It would be nice if the complimentary water could be replaced when its used If you are in a room for three people it would be nice if we could have three tea cups at the outset rather than having to take one from the restaurant , Loved the two receptionists Ricardo and Juanma They were very friendly and attentive and took an interest in us Juanma helped us make a booking at a restaurant Breakfast is excellent at this hotel with plenty of food on offer Had a lovely stay there and hotel is in a good location for the tennis tournament 
295358,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, the bedroom we had many issues we stayed for 11 nights and the beds were very uncomfortable and you could feel the springs and the bed is tipped on the head side no pillows are provided so bring your own the pillow they provide is for a baby head if you travel in a cold weather bring some extra duvets because you only get AC so shiver will not stop the lighting system and sockets interact with each other so if you switch the light off check your mobile the power has switch off bathroom extractor does not work so you must leave windows open curtains not provided so in the night you are visible to the onlookers from the flats around you overall this is a one night stand only , the spa was great the reception area was excellent and the restaurant was also great overall the ground floor was the best
295359,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel,No Negative, The staff was amazing some of the nicest people that we ve met They scheduled taxi s provided currency exchange had a great breakfast and a very reasonably priced bar Our room was beautiful We can t wait to come back 
295360,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The last night we went to the hotel restaurant They have a good card but out of 10 menus are just 3 4 possible We went to an other restaurant But we asked in the morning at the reception she said yes it s no problem we must not reserve we can just walk in , Everyday come a woman to clean the room
295361,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Breakfast is a bit expensive for what was on offer and there are shops near by that sell coffee and croissants and a much more acceptable price SPA is only free for 2 hours in the morning , The staff were really friendly and helpful My friend had a problem with her booking and the reception staff couldn t have been more helpful 
295362,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Fridge didnt work We stayed 3 nights when we arrived there were 2 cups 2 sachets of coffee tea and powdered milk despite it being a triple room and booked for 3 adults We stayed 3 nights and despite using the 2 coffee and milk sachets on the day of our arrival there were no replacements supplied during the rest of our stay , Location perfect for visiting Nou Camp which was the purpose of our stay it was 10 mins walk away Barman in piano bar was very good spoke english very friendly but professional Option to pay 30 euros to have late check out 6pm was most appreciated as our flight home was not until 9 30pm 
295363,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, We had to wait more than 1 hours for the room to be ready the room should have been ready latest at 14 00 at check in They almost mixed up rooms from other bookings our card got charged 2 times for one of the rooms There was cigarette smell in our non smoking room All noises came in to the room from the hallway Wifi was useless ,No Positive
295364,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The bed wasn t the comfiest that I ve slept in although I suspect that this is down to personal preferences , The spa was fabulous Plenty of room for the children and in a quiet area Breakfast was comprehensive and the freshly cooked omelettes went down a treat 
295365,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel,No Negative, Staff were fantastic and welcoming rooms were cleaned everyday and they even gave me complimentary champagne on my birthday thoroughly enjoyed my stay 
295366,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Within easy walking distance of Collblanc metro station but be careful of the pick pockets Our phone was taken from front jeans pocket , Breakfast was plentiful and of good quality Staff were friendly and helpful Rooms were clean and a reasonable size 
295367,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, More time in Barcelona we really enjoyed our stay The outdoor pool wasn t open yet Our boys would ve liked it even though it wasn t quite summer yet, The breakfast buffet was excellent the spa ditto Travelling with 3 football fans it was perfectly situated close to Camp Nou Friendly staff that made us feel welcome The room was perfectly dark during the night and no noise from the street or the other rooms 
295368,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, There s not much else near the hotel besides the Camp Nou but still a good base to travel into the city centre with good transport links Recommend getting a BCN ticket which gives you unlimited access to all public transport for 1 2 3 4 or 5 days Public transport runs through the night and is easy to understand , Very close to the Camp Nou 
295369,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Was very quite around the hotel, Not much nightlife around the hotel we had to really go in to La Rambles for that But if you want a quite area it is perfect
295370,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The room was too hot air con not working until May, Breakfast was good lots of choice Location good for camp nou Staff were friendly Spa facilities good 
295371,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, We honestly couldn t find anything to fault about this hotel, We loved everything about this hotel from the great location 5 mins walk from Camp Nou to the lovely staff Breakfast was excellent and the lady who cooks the eggs to order was lovely We decided to upgrade to a superior room when we arrived and it really was lovely We even had champagne in the room so a real treat 
295372,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, I m sure I booked king size room when got there was told could upgrade Was not happy only 2 hour limited spa time which meant only could use once as closed on Mondays No reclining beds as was advertised Also I had a full swim suit was questioned why I was covered so they prefer bikinis to burkini even though nine was still a swim suit , Friendly staff nice spa 
295373,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The room was freezing cold with no heating facilities i know Spain is a warm country but there was no sun in the direction of our room The TV has no English channels except music , The spa and massage was amazing
295374,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Staffs at the reception are not very welcoming Staff at the reception are very rude except for Juana very nice guy and manager was really nice too she was very calm and willing to help during our stay in the hotel I will never stay there again or recommend anyone there , Staffs at the reception are not very welcoming Staff at the reception are very rude except for Juana very nice guy and manager was really nice too she was very calm and willing to help during our stay in the hotel I will never stay there again or recommend anyone there 
295375,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Our room was a little dated in decor but thats just nitpicking really , Fresh Orange Juice Machine was awesome Salmon and Cava at Breakfast A lovely selection of meats cheeses breads and pastried Really friendly staff who were helpful and courteous Swimming Pool area was fabulous 
295376,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Room furniture is outdated The walls in the rooms really need some new paint It does not look like a 4 hotel room As for the wifi they have some restrictions on it because some apps don t work like my default email app which couldn t connect to the gmail or yahoo servers The Gmail app works though , Cleaning service is very good Bathroom is great Bed is comfortable Location is especially good if you plan to visit Camp Nou Collblanc metro station is close The complimentary mini bottles of water are great in a hot city like Barcelona 
295377,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Kept losing wifi connection, Hotel was clean and comfortable Staff were helpful and spa was an added bonus Only a few minutes walk to Camp Nou main purpose of trip was to take our son to the match
295378,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Wifi was terrible We weren t able to check our emails or anything else For the money we have paid I would expect the wifi connection to be better The bed wasn t comfy and with one pillow , Breakfast 
295379,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, No pool available until summer even though the weather is very warm, Overall it was very good Spa is all inclusive and amazing It s a shame the weather is very warm and pool is not open until summer time
295380,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The room serves I was bad did not come one day before departure no showe gel no shampoo provided beside I did not like that no complemaentry ware the staff were not offering any tourist information even when we asked wrong info given far from attraction area very long walking use of metro, Location to the conference was reasonable distance
295381,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Was a nice spring day would ve been nice to have access to the room to relax even if the pool was available Also would ve been nice if they had a tv in the bar downstairs to watch sport , Was a brief stay to take part in the Barcelona marathon As I couldn t use my free spa pass due to the marathon the hotel allowed me to use it the morning I arrived before my actual check in All staff were very helpful and pleasant 
295382,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Well for a 4 star hotel in a hot country air con would of been nice and explained as a king room only difference was size of the bed and room wasn t that big and ice machines weren t working Also described as sound proof but could hear people outside , Staff were friendly but at times struggled with English translation Always willing to help and were available Was close to tube station and nou camp as explained 
295383,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Wish there was more English channels staff told me no shops open on Sunday then found out a massive shopping at maremagnum was open all day Wish the meal choice was bit better , Electric tilting beds amazing breakfast Buffett staff so friendly lovely swimming pool spa 
295384,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Free Wifi is available but it s horribly painfully slow and restricted in what you can do e g wouldn t connect to my secure email server ,No Positive
295385,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, There could of been normal beds in the room for the children instead of sofa bed very uncomfortable was a problem to queue having to wait a long time for the food to be cooked would of been better for it to be already cooked and to help yourself a lot of dust in the room could of been better cleaned room a bit dated , The location was fantastic the food was great would recommend this hotel for the location for camp nou
295386,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, If you want to explore Barcelona s city it s a bit far west , Location was very close to Camp Nou and Collblanc train station so easy to get around Staff were very friendly and helpful 
295387,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel,No Negative, Spa facilities were amazing Such a beautiful a clean spa Staff were lovely and very friendly I left my phone in a cab and they helped me contact the driver to get it back which I did 
295388,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Receptionist at check in was surly She was training an assistant so perhaps that influenced her attitude , Lovely spacious clean relaxing lobby Friendly security man Easy walking distance to Camp Nou Good local facilities bars cafes shops public transport Rooms are fine 
295389,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Everything, Staff are rude other than bar tender who was really helpful Bed was so uncomfortable we have back ache as a result Pointless having a king bed which you can t enjoy Not value for money at all Spa not open Mondays can only use for 2 hours for free Only good thing about our stay
295390,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The bed wasn t very comfortable and the pillows far too soft even with extras they didn t make for a change comfortable night Water in the room would have been a nice gesture Having told us there was an airport bus to pick us up we wasted two hours hanging around , The spa facilities were excellent and breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice The 10 30 finish was good to as it meant you could relax if wanted Nice gesture of a bottle of cava in the room for our celebrations 
295391,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, This hotel unfortunately should be rated as a 3 star The beds are rock hard and the rooms are very dated The wifi is terribly slow that even Facebook doesn t upload We didn t use the spa so cannot comment but it is only free from 10 12 which is not very convenient so that s why we couldn t use it Outside these hours you have to pay I would not go back, The staff who was very friendly If you are going to attend a match in the camp nou then the location is very good
295392,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Tv only had 1 english channel so has to watch rocky 1 through 4 each night The wifi was rubbish and did not work had to pay for data roaming charges The spa was only available for a couple of hours in the morning Never seen this policy at any hotel I ve ever stayed at If I knew I would have spent less on a cheaper hotel with no spa facilities No bath products or water was replaced in the room and it smelled and the rooms were not sound proof there was a mad woman next door screaming at the top of her lungs each night Cleaners kept knocking early morning to clean , Nothing
295393,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The outside surroundings were the only slight negative but nothing that would ever stop me returning , The hotel was much nicer than I expected it to be Very clean and rooms very nice and comfy Shower was incredible most powerful shower I ve ever used Staff were amazingly friendly and helpful All in all was a lovely stay 
295394,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, wifi was really slow struggled to watch videos and browse the internet, ideal for what i needed 5 minute walk away from Camp Nou and enough restaurants and bars around the hotel 
295395,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Tea bags and milk cartons were not replaced each day had to ask at reception for some which was a nuisance when you had been out in cold all day , Breakfast great value rooms clean 
295396,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The opening hours of the spa were limited due to New Years celebrations Additional charge to use pool after midday for guests Pool was freezing when we eventually used it, staff were very helpful printing off our boarding passes very attentive
295397,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Mirrors rusty in the spa and the wood in the sauna was really old and crusty The glass in the external elevator was broken with a hole in the roof The kids fold down bed needed oiling as it creaked with every movement , The hotel room was v nice and the staff were all v friendly and helpful The beds were comfy The lobby was great and everywhere was clean The kids loved the pools 
295398,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Pillows are thin like tissue paper need 2 to make a real pillow the free wifi is dreadful Even when you purchase so called fast internet to overcome limitations of the free wifi this is no faster The business room computers are an utter disaster very surprised sad for this day age , clean convenient for University Barcelona and camp Nou b fast OK
295399,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, coujld have done with more pillows and more signs in English esp the spa offers Would have booked a massage but couldn t translate the offers, spa was excellent 
295400,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Reception desk is working incredibly slow We waited for 30 minutes due to their incredibly slow check in process Hotel looks like it was built for 92 olympics and no renovation was done in the meantime However room is quite nice , Nice location comfy bed and excellent breakfast 
295401,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The beds were really uncomfortable and the tv only had 2 english channels that showed the same programmes all day every day The restaurant menu was quite basic also , the rooms were nice and spacious the staff had good english and were very friendly 
295402,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, terrible team specially the bad humor of the spa supervisor Free Spa limited to short period in the morning breakfast extremely expensive In front of hotel there is a nice coffee shop that worth much better Shower always changing temperature from very hot to cold , Room size and localization
295403,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The Wifi is terrible unless you are willing to upgrade and then it was still below what you would expect from a 4star hotel All a bit 80 s except for the wifi which is more late 90 s , The hotel felt very clean Spa was quite good and generally the service was efficient Breakfasts were generous 
295404,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The bed was not very comfortable The room felt dated The stereo provided had a tape player lol There were no English speaking TV channels The food was not good , I liked the staff They were polite and helpful The hotel was clean and the rooms fairly spacious The spa was great The location to Camp Nou is very good 
295405,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, It said free spa facilities but that was for only 1 hour a day which we were not told till we wanted to use them so had to pay 10 each , Rooms were lovely and big with fully opening windows so lovely fresh air 
295406,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Bar overpriced in relation to surrounding area Double price of local bars and tapas which we relished Booked this because of the pool facilities Was very disappointed Rooftop pool was closed despite not advertised on website as seasonal Guests in hotel had to bring other than room towel to meagre leisure centre Rated as 4 but I definitely rate it a mere 2 Convenient for Nou Camp and also exit from Barcelona by car or train Other than that mediocre, Room was spacious and well equipped Lobby nice 
295407,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, There was a few maintenance problems as one of the lifts was being looking at the fountain outside was being repaired albeit briefly and then fixed the sauna was not in use and one of the jacuzzi buttons wasnt working properly a few things that needed attention but we didnt mind as the rest of it was lovely The breakfast option seemed a little pricey for what it was standard continental breakfast but was still nice , Good location a reasonable train journey into central Barcelona Easy enough to get into even getting back and missing the last train change a 25minute walk straight down was quite pleasant city mapper helps The spa facilities were lovely the pools and jacuzzis we re great after or before a long walk around the city and a few options kept it interesting the cold to hot baths were a nice touch Nice views around the hotel and the hotel itself was quite big and had a few facility options if you didnt want to venture out 
295408,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, the choice of food on the menu card, all in all the room was comfortable quiet however did find the room too warm but the location was great for camp nou
295409,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The location is about 30 minutes away from the main centre LA Rambla and not good at all unless you are a football fan and want to stay near the Nou Camp stadium The surrounding area is scruffy in my opinion and for the price of the hotel you would be much better staying more central We were very disappointed that the spa was closed for a full day during our 3 day stay and when we tried to use the rooftop pool that was also shut due to cold weather It was 22c , The staff are very friendly and attentive and the rooms are a good size with very comfy beds 
295410,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, People should note that the management ignores the message one writes on booking com when booking For example we specifically asked to be given a room in the third or upper floors indicating in capital letters to avoid the first and second floors and they never got back the room we were given was on the second floor Otherwise all was ok , The location of the hotel is good and facilities are ok 
295411,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, More dated than expected Room service wasn t great we had to ring down for toilet roll as none was left after being given a practically empty roll to start with A dirty towel stained with I don t know what was also left on our bath one day goodness knows where it came from , Lovely staff Great Spa 
295412,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The water in the fridge in the bedroom wasnt restocked and the tea and coffee wasnt either and also the cleanliness of the room could have been better , The location of the hotel as it was close to camp nou and away from the main city centre 
295413,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Location Attention to detail in rooms e g drinking glasses not changed daily toiletries were not replenished daily Hotel lacked atmosphere Piano player was not in attendance during our stay No air conditioning Fan noisy , Staff 
295414,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The staff were unhelpful and dismissive the room temperatures were about 30 degrees boiling hot you couldn t breath at reception staff were dismissive saying that we were the only people complaining about the heat in the room they didn t even try to check what was the issue or anything like that It turned out that they had switched off th air condition earlier this month to save money and they wouldn t turn it back on Just poor service Later we met few people at same hotel who had the same complaint but they were ignored too The hotel is outdated with facilities going back to 70 80s Not even clean do not get fooled by the big entrance All the furniture is out of date and dirty Fridge in the room smells and not working Wifi is diseaster doesn t work for emails and extremely slow every few minutes you have to go back to main page to log in into internet Bathroom always had a bad smell and if you careful you will notice there is no window or extractor fan The restaurent don t even try it We had to eat one night there our mistake it was awful taste and expensive we waited a bit for the food we just realised the bartender next door came through the main doors with a bag he went into to buy whats needed to be cooked from opposite shop It is not cheap even Definitely not more than 2 stars , The only positive comment would be the access to the spa which was free for 2 hours Though it was old and dated also they did not allow access to the Sauna however overall the spa facility was not bad Nothing else is worth it at this hotel 
295415,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The hotel is tired As one approaches you see tattered old flags flying by the entrance which sums it up The staff are let down by the management , The breakfast was good 
295416,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, no swimming pool open spa was very poor and we were charged 20 for towel which was refunded when we left spa is also only free for a limited time per day staff were not very professional or helpful definitely didn t seem like a four star hotel experience , the bed was very comfortable and room was clean
295417,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, They made me pay in advance I worried the whole trip something would go wrong Until I checked out I did not know it was going to work The pool was closed and I didn t use the spa , They honored reservation which was prepaid 
295418,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The price for the breakfast was extortionate in comparison to the facilities available just outside the hotel the Internet was awful why advertise it , The spa was fabulous the bed was amazing
295419,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, 1 Access to metro is not close and is more in a residential area 2 I had a bigger room booked for 1 night due to unavailability of room booked for next 5 nights While the staff helped me to find a room that I could continue to use for next 7 nights with out having to shift but since the room tarrif was higher for the 1 night for bigger room I should have got a complimentary breakfast instead of being charged for the same It s a customer experience , Friendly staff and facilities 
295420,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Brekfast was a bit expensive , Breakfast was copious the room was clean and spacious near to the Camp Nou and Collblanc metro station is in 5 min by walk Lots of restaurants Staff was very friendly 
295421,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Paying for spa and towels at different times of day annoying Breakfast disappointing in that special orders for cooked breakfast from someone who kept disappearing , Triple room great location for Camp not super convenient 
295422,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Nothing not to like, Perfect for the nou camp room had everything you need air con kettle tea coffee sugar shampoo soap hairdryer iron 37inch tv mini bar hi fi system power shower 
295423,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The hotel was noisy doors banging all night other guest had no consideration for others Guest Taxi s arriving and departing at the front made too much noise Slow lifts and expensive , Location to Nou Camp was excellent and the recent Metro connection made Airport journey so easy 
295424,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The pool was out of bounds which wasn t very good as it was really warm the weekend we stayed and it would have been nice to go in the pool , The staff were nice
295425,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The wifi is atrocious and couldn t connect the spa is only free to guests for the two hours between 10 and 12 in the morning Our room wasn t cleaned for the two nights we were there , The breakfast is great with a huge choice and lovely fresh orange juice Ideal location for visiting the Neu camp
295426,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The location was terrible and meant so much travel to get to any of the nice areas Unfortunately our room was very uncomfortable with a bad bed and pillows a smell from the air conditioning and was very small and dingy for over 125 night The worst part was the terrible value for money one of the worst hotels I ve stayed in for this Had a beautiful hotel in Girona the week after which was a fraction of the price but which gave such attention to the guests and their comfort unlike the Senator , They had an ice dispenser on our floor and a minibar of complementary drinks 
295427,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The room decor was a little dated The rooftop pool area was devoid of atmosphere and there was no bar but nice if you were looking for peace and quiet You could order food from up there at an extra cost It was a 30 40 mins bus ride to la rambla and even further to the beach , The breakfast was excellent The staff were very helpful and friendly 
295428,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, This hotel receives a lot of groups which is not a problem at all except if one arrives leaves in the middle of a group but this is not the reason for my minor dissatisfaction I felt that sometimes the reception staff was a bit tired of my request for information about hotel services Also I received a bit contradictory information about the hotel services depending on who I asked Also for my needs the sunbathing area is great but the pool was too small and thus crowded and open only late from 10am , The hotel is located very well in relation to public transport bus connection to the centre nearest airport metro station 600 m can be reached by bus Standard consistent with 4 star I did not try the breakfast there are several small cafes within 300 m that serve my breakfast needs better Also I did not try the spa the hours were not suitable for me 10 19 Free internet ok possible to buy enhanced plan you need that for e g webinars

295433,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The male staff who dealt with myself and my partner at the front desk were very miserable to look at and not very friendly when i checked in This let the hotel down I suggest some customer service training is in order , The room was beautiful and literally on the door step on the football stadium and tube metro station 
295434,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Wifi was not very good facilities and room is not refurbished old SPA is free of charge only for 2 hours in the morning , Near the metro station official city tourism bus blue line is very close to the hotel football stadium stop so very easy to hop on and start experiencing the city 
295435,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, No porters How can a hotel claiming to be 4 star not have staff to help you with luggage Rooftop pool is atrocious small cold deep and unsupervised Certainly not suitable for our 3 year old twins The surly member of staff at the spa who clearly didn t want our kids there Well they were impeccably behaved in the pools Water only provided on first day Had put in a request for our 10th wedding anniversary to be acknowledged in some way This was totally ignored , Family room I booked was fine Spacious with large beds Powerful shower in bathroom Location is a bit away from centre but Collblanc metro is 5 mins walk away Breakfast is decent though the lack of fresh tomatoes and oranges is very puzzling for a Spanish hotel Spa is very good Reception staff helpful and polite 
295436,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, When we came to check in they didn t have our amended reservation being told that the booking confirmation from booking com was wrong and they did not have a room for me That it was my fault or booking coms fault and that I had to sort it by the front office manager blond hair not very nice couldn t of cared less I then had to call booking com while my disabled mother and sick brother waited in the lobby after 30 minutes 40 credit of being on the phone to booking com we finally got it sorted did we get an apology oh no the front office manager was too good for that also simultaneously while our situation was occurring I could see literally people to the left and right of me having a similar situation problems with confirmation To be fair Natalia the front office assistant did apologise as the fault was from their reservations department and did give us a lovely room Then during the stay room was lovely however on the second day as standard in hotels we thought our room would receive a full service you guessed it not even the toilet paper was refilled and there was 3 people in the room so we had to call the front desk to ask for our room to be fully serviced when the room attendants came back to service the room all the did was giggle the whole time Then another day I came back after the room had been serviced I came back to my make up all over the floor and several make up pallets had been broken due to the floor impact When I brought all of this up to what seemed to be the GM on the front desk he did give me one complimentary breakfast which was a nice and appreciated gesture however I honestly expected more from a Four Star hotel While I do understand being busy the fact that we were treated so badly on check in by management kind of spoilt the experience , The barman spa ladies and security guard were fantastic I wish I remembered their names but really an asset to the organisation and always had a smile The Spa is amazing and a great facility and a lovely addition to a relation holiday

295438,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, On the roof terrace limited sun beds could have one row of tables and more beds also occasional staff presence would have been beneficial every hour as parents of a young child may have been encouraged coercied to monitor their child while he was using the pool as he was diving and bombing into the pool Did not expect to have to tolerate this type of behaviour , Staff were extremely friendly and accommodating arrived early still able to check in full explanation given about facilities available and how to access them Security guard managed to safely adequately correct the behaviour of guests attending for a football match without incident and not spoiling their enjoyment

295450,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, It seemed that the cleaner didn t change our sheets during our 10 day visit The minibar could have been colder , The staff was helpful and friendly The room and the whole hotel was just what we expected Air conditioning worked well and the room was quiet The minibar didn t contain anything else than the free water so that we could keep our own beverages and food there That was great considering the hot weather of Barcelona The metro worked very well so the slightly distant location wasn t a problem On the contrary it was nice to leave the hustle and bustle of the city centre behind for nights We liked the location also because it enabled us to get to know the more residential area of Barcelona where is more locals than tourists if at all 
295451,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, There was no mineral water or stocked mini bar as was indicated during booking Air conditioning did not work upon arrival and staff did not request maintenance until after we reported it for a second time the next day so we had to sleep in a hot room on our first night The coffee machine was a kettle The restaurant refused to provide a bowl and spoon so we could eat in our room Breakfast buffet was 14 per person per day or 12 per person per day if we paid in advance but we were able to feed ourselves for a fraction of that price elsewhere We paid for breakfast in advance and were overcharged When we changed our minds and asked for a refund we were short changed by 20 which we didn t get back as we didn t realise until later Of three ice machines only one was working and it was on the first floor we were on the sixth but that machine was empty by the end of our stay and I had to go to the restaurant on the ground floor for ice Despite having a free spa session we were required to rent the slippers and bathrobe that were obligatory for entry We used the bar once and were overcharged there as well Housekeeping staff were excellent but we had to ask for more toilet paper and tea and coffee weren t replenished Parts of the hotel looked out dated and though the rooms were supposed to be soundproof I was awoken by the noise of housekeeping other guests in the hallway despite both doors being closed , The bed was large and comfy and the bathroom was new and very clean Location was good as metro was only ten minutes away and had a direct line to the airport 
295452,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, We were astonished that the laundry service offered leave in bag in the room before 10am and it will be returned same day before 6pm turned into being collected same afternoon only as we returned from city centre visiting and after laundry staff were prompted by reception desk The clothes would be back manyana said the maid but it took a reception agent to chase and deliver it himself that next day at 8pm , The bed was King size essential for a 6 plus body and very comfortable We had a very peaceful stay with a great selection at the breakfast buffet The reception staff were wonderful and solved every problem

295456,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The receptionist asked would we like a quiet room and I said yes When we got to the room it was a family room with a door connecting us to strangers next door Light shone from under the door into our room and we could hear every word preventing us from sleeping at night I found this a very creepy experience and complained to reception I was told there were no other rooms I did not like the view out the window of concrete flags covered in cigarette ends and nothing else The bed had a very hard matress and the springs twanged every time you moved I think it was very cheap ,No Positive

295486,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, We stayed for 2 weeks which is far too long time in a room without balcony on a sunny trip This was a none cancellation booking so there was no way to switch hotels Probably our mistake The staff said they couldn t do anything to help us with cutting 1 week off our booking There was only 1 elevator working for almost 1 week Two were out of order and it is just unbelievable how a hotel of this size doesn t do anything about it for such a long time Waiting for an elevator took far too long time The hotel has 3 ice machines on floors 1 3 5 but only one was working the whole time 1st floor This lack of maintenance elevators ice machines for so long time is a huge disrespect to the guests The say free wifi in their ad but really that is a poor wifi speed I had to pay 20 Euros for 1 week of decent wifi speed , Everything was really clean staff is nice and there are lots of restaurants just across the street for breakfast and brunch

295514,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Bed could have been more comfortable pillows not comfortable Room service meal was poor, Nice staff friendly helpful good location as was going to Camp Nou 
295515,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The room was small for family of 4 and air condition was not working We tried to use extra pillows but they were absolutely dirty and seem not being washed for ages and we had to ask few times to have them replaced , Spa was nice and that s about it 
295516,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, For the money there was nothing not to like, Clean hotel and Quiet location away from noisy bars restaurants Excellent location for the Camp Nou Good breakfast selection and free WiFi Taxi to El Prat around 25 Euros
295517,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Cleanliness was very poor dust everywhere was dissapointed with old equipment in the room old hairdryer that takes forever to dry hair and all other equipment there was no bathrobe and no slipers towels washed off if tey were white would be much nicer rooms are outdated and very dark couple lamps were not working if all that would be improoved would give this hotel 5 stars Room requires redecoration , Breakfast was great Lady was making omlette or eggs to individual taste also spoke Russian Breakfast had 100 orange juice that you squize yourself wide choise of other foods Spa was fabulous Just a shame it had only set hours that you can use it and no kids in the evening spa which is not fair location was perfect a bit distant from the central Barcelona but reachable very easy by metro or bus Late check out option is great 
295518,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Breakfast could have been better as in little more variety Early checkout they don t have breakfast available not even on request No staff to take ur luggage to the rooms or bring them down Everything self service Hotel with such a stature should be more cordial , Location is good for people who want to be there for football As we were Overall nice stay but could have been better in some things
295519,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Internet very slow in the room almost impossible to use If you are there for business you cannot work in the room you have to gow down in the lobby very unconfortable , Friendly staff very helpful Good breakfast pleasant lobby very clean
295520,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Nothing to like Unfriendly Personal and the Room Photos has been very lied To little Room and uncomfortable for this Price , Nothing to like Unfriendly Personal and the Room Photos has been very lied To little Room and uncomfortable for this Price 
295521,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The only thing I can fault is the lighting in our bathroom was a poor There was no light in the shower area making it quite dim , The reason for choosing to stay at this hotel was the location It was a surprise trip arranged for my husbands birthday with tickets for a Barcelona FC game Camp Nou was a ten minute walk away We crammed in as much sight seeing as we could and enjoyed every minute of our stay 
295522,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, No where near the city centre Spa isn t include Rooms aren t insulated adequately, Rubbish check in had to pay 3euros for tax not on the website per night Noisy rooms Room service called at 9 to clean room Kettle didn t work in Room and when I asked for a new one they didn t bring it The biggest con is the spa which isn t part of the deal you have to pay extra for it and then you have to rent there towels for 2 euros A massively overrated hotel don t stay here
295523,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Not much not to like menu for evening meal not that great, Bed was electric rooms where a fair size as was the bathroom The room has a stereo in it to a bonus spa was very good
295524,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Lack of staff and the spa was shut on Mondays and children only allowed to use the spa 10 12am when no one wants to use it at that time because you are in Barcelona doing things very poor and family unfriendly and not advertised up front If I m paying for facilities I expect to be able to use them 7 days a week and when I want with my FAMILY I m the paying customer If I want to go in the pool at 6pm with my son it should not be a an issue but it was The Hotel was full of rules and regulations which is a turn off treat your customers with a little respect , Good breakfast
295525,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Didnt refill the fridge tissues and sanitary products that ran out had to ask at reception Not many eating establishments around the hotel so found it hard to eat out in the evening , Excellent Breakfast very clean rooms good location for football stadium Excellent spa too 
295526,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, I think for the price you can find a better accomodation in Barca than in the Senator Spa Hotel , The hotel was a bit old fashion but very clean and cosy Very good location to Camp Nou 
295527,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Bed could have a thinker pillows and mattress and I felt the children used the spa as a play area so it was hard to relax at times, Spa was lovely and rooms nice Staff very helpful and great communication Thanks
295528,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Check 12 wasn t flying till 10pm do we stocked in the main reception, This location is just 5 mins walk to the nou camp and that is ideal with an 8 year old
295529,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Nothing, Stayed here overnight as we came to watch Barcelona FC the hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the Camp Nou and the bedroom and facilities were very good The cost of the food and drinks was also excellent with a pint of lager only costing 4 euros approx 3 20 and most of the meals between 7 and 10 Euros Taxi to the centre of Barcelona was about 20 and from the airport about 28 I would definetly stay here again especially if I was coming to watch Barcelona 
295530,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Arrived to our room to find the workmen using angle grinder doing work outside our bedroom window on the lift shaft very very noisy and reception was not very helpful we eventually moved rooms to one that was not much better also we asked for an extra cup sugar tea and coffee as they only put enough in the room for 2 guests and we had our daughter with us they said we could not have anymore as that was all we were allowed then after arguing they agreed to bring some to the room before 8 pm which didn t happen i then had to go back down to the reception to complain and we eventually got it but its not what i would call very relaxing when you have to argue to get anything ,No Positive
295531,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Very limited English food was unavailable on new years eve and we had to eat in McDonald s, No food available new years eve in the hotel Had to eat in McDonald s Staff had very limited English No one made us aware on the day that there would be no food or room service Would never use this hotel again

295537,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location with metro shops and supermarkets nearby Fantastic value for money The room was large and renovated with a big king size bed big wardrobe mini fridge and coffee tea facilities Overall had a great stay and would highly recommend it 
295538,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Really old rooms needs refurbish Not clean Horrible smell in the bathroom Breakfast very low quality no fresh food Location far from city centre and public transport Spa is open only few hours a day Small staff not really welcoming First thing they ask you when you arrive is to pay the whole stay Will not stay there again, Nothing
295539,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Hotel was nice Rooms could do with a refurb Beds very uncomfortable and dipping in the middle Even tho we booked for 3 persons in the room we had to ask reception twice for bedding for the pull out bed Would stay again if beds where changed and was in summer at its peak when more going on in hotel Wasn t worth what we paid but we didn t spend much time in the hotel Lesson learned Didn t ruin our break tho , Great view of nou camp Easy access to metro Friendly residential area 
295540,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Language barrier Room positioning view of another building, The spa Big room Friendly staff Clean rooms and refurbishment of bath wash and shampoo
295541,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, We had a terrible sewer smell in our room and was not able to use the air We reported it they came and sprayed which covered the odor for a while We should have been placed in another room , Liked location service and price

295545,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Location is hidden and difficult to find I was informed that I had to pay for Parking but did not in the end Not including breakfast, Good location
295546,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel,No Negative, Fab hotel Right beside football stadium but quite a bit away from Las Rambla Not too much going on near it in the evenings and tacis expensive to get to Las Rambla
295547,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The restaurant was only offering microwave pasta if you were looking to have a meal despite the hotel being extremely busy They also closed the spa and swimming pools as well , The location was good as we were visiting camp nou
295548,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, parking is 20 euro per day but could be calculated per used hour if done via reception tv had only 1 channel working other channels did not work no rush policy at the morning check out They were trainigng new person so reception lady was busy showing how it works while line was bigger and bigger , Big and not expensive room good facilities including sauna and other spa activities very friendly and helpful personell 
295549,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Just a little out off the way to the rambla that s about it , Lovely hotel and close to nou camp stadium which was great for us to go watch the game 
295550,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Hotel surrounded by residential block towering above the hotel Pool was ice cold They charge guests 9 for the use of the spa despite thinking I was paying a little extra for the facilities Hotel doesn t give local transport suggestions Staff don t seem to know how to use an iron not well presented Street bin next to where the entrance is Restaurant needs some life I was told I could only use the restaurant if I was a private guest The breakfast could have been better I m sure the breakfast area used to be a stunning restaurant it a sign of changing times , The room was good If you use this hotel there is a bus route just outside the hotel D62 which takes you directly into the city area Ideal for the football arena 
295551,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, No English channels on the television Otherwise no dislikes at all , the Hotel was well located within easy reach of the metro station and bus route 10 minutes walk down to Camp Nou Very clean hotel Staff friendly and accomodating rooms very comfortable free WiFi throughout Hotel inc rooms Spa was lovely clean and well equipped a great perk having free access every day for 2 hours although we booked to go in evening and it was very reasonably priced 
295552,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The spa facilities weren t available anytime Plus you had to pay 19 per person if you hadn t used the spa facilities between 10am 13 30pm , Nice big room and clean 
295553,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, We don t understand the hotel allows people in a Burqa We are in Europe and not in the middle east Wearing a Burqa is against the law This is a reason not to come back , nice wellness but only free between 10 12h and closed on monday Wifi is working OK People are friendly Close to Camp nou 
295554,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Not much else around the hotel Only stayed one night so was unable to use the spa features at a time of our choosing Slow lifts, Very comfortable and roomy rooms
295555,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The bar is only a small cafe bar in reception It s a little bit far from the city centre you need to take 2 metros to get there , The hotel is fab and the staff are lovley The room was nice and spacious 
295556,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, I don t have any bad experience , Very good hotel Room is comfortable staff is friendly and helpful location is perfect near to the metro station lots of shops food fruits cafe beer Camp Nou stadium is 3 minutes walk 
295557,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Only having free access to the spa between 10 and 12, Great location for Camp Nou but not so great for heading down to Las Rambles Although the bus stop opposite was very handy for me to get to the Palau Sant Jordi everyday 
295558,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The breakfast option wasnt included in our booking and they were charging 14 euros per person for this which we thought was too high given that you can get breakfast for a fraction of that price if you step out The hotel might have been understaffed of cleaning personnel In our stay of 5 days our room was only cleaned once although we could see the cleaning staff on our floor each day when we went out , The hotel is at a great location for football lovers just 5 mins walk from the Camp Nou stadium and about 8 mins walk to the nearest Collblanc metro station Right outside the hotel on the main road is a bus stop which has frequent buses that go to La Rambla Barceloneta beach and other touristy areas There is also a tram station behind the hotel at 5 mins walking distance Connectivity is very good The hotel staff spoke good english and they were very helpful There are lot of nice cafes and restaurants just outisde the hotel which are reasonably priced and great food 
295559,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The room was not very clean The ceiling fan had never been cleaned ever I pointed this out to the girl in reception when we checked out and she said oh Ok I ll let someone know and that was it Not even a small apology ,No Positive
295560,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Transportation to the airport It is not like hotels near by Placa di Catalunia which you can go with 1 bus to the airport There is no one direct bus driving you to the airport from this hotel or near by You have to chage buses while you carry your laggage It is hard way So I took a taxi , Location is great for anybody wants to attend Barcelona match just couple of minuets from the Camp Nou stadium 
295561,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The hotel is not worth its 4 stars When entering the room there was a terrible smell which did not go away for 3 days The pool bar was closed and the pool abandoned even though it was quite nice weather Location is not so good 12 minutes walk to the nearest metro station In terms of lunch or dinner in the hotel very poor choice of dishes and none of them is fresh but pre cooked Overall I would not recommend this hotel for a visit in Barcelona , N A
295562,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel,No Negative, Nice hotel to stay few nights Close to Camp Nou Great but small pool on the roof nice place to enjoy sunbathing on the 8th floor 5min walk to Line 5 BCN metro I would recommend it to my friends 
295563,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Wifi poor too much time waiting at the reception breakfast should be included in the price paid From my point of view this is not a 4 stars hotel We should have free access to spa all day not only 2 hours , Spa
295564,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Our key cards were faulty a few times The simple things like toilet roll was not left in our room and were told to buy own Staff could improve with their welcoming Bar looks lonely never seen anyone at it for the week we stayed , Very close to stadium easy to get metro into city centre Taxis aren t so dear either Nice bakery across the road for breakfast Air con 10 10 brilliant Also pool very good Quiet hotel perfect for relaxing 
295565,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, they have a new management look like the are changing all the rules and policy in the hotel but to be worse than before, i been in this hotel before 2 years age the hotel was good but now zero
295566,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, No spa available and the year before we had breakfast included in our price and thought it was the same this year but had to pay extra , Clean good room for a family close to nou camp good parking for out car
295567,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, although very reliable internet connection for surfing the company providing services limit the applications usage only reliable for surfing the web, Very near to Camp Nou Comfort of the room all details in the roam as ironing board safe etc Acceptable distance from metro 
295568,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Very happy overall Pool a bit small but we knew that still enjoyed being able to relax on the roof after a day out, Staff friendly helpful Room clean comfortable Had kettle small fridge which is excellent Not too far from Collblank so used metro to get around as it is a little bit far from city But we managed fine 
295569,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Not knowing that you had to pay to access the spa pool area after the morning even if you were a hotel resident Had to ask for fresh towels and toilet roll , Good wifi and quiet location Clean room and comfortable Great choices for breakfast 
295570,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Front desk was understaffed Spa was shut and notice was only given long after the booking had taken place , Very clean hotel with good facilities The hotel is near a metro stop and the city tour buses stop nearby at Camp Nou Although it is small the hotel has an outdoor swimming pool 
295571,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, im very dissapointed that the SPA was closed during my stay The only reason why i booked this hotel is because of the SPA i came there to relaxed so it kinda Ruin my over all trip I went to reception snd asked If i can cancel my stay but they cant refund my payment Very dissapointong especially when its a bit far from everything , Breakfast is okay
295572,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The reception staff friendliness and helpfulness was variable dependent on which staff you got There were a couple who were very helpful and then some who were clearly not keen on giving helpful tips and just seemed busy and over worked There was no food available in the hotel after breakfast and the rooms were dirty we found lots of old hairs in the bathroom The hotel swimming pool is TINY , Reasonable location Metro pretty close by Affordable 
295573,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Great for its proximity to the Nou Camp Stadium for the football but a little too far out of the centre of Barcelona and ideally could have been more central,No Positive
295574,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Bad smell from the air con sewerage on hot days but other than that everything was great and as we expected , Great value for money we paid 50 a night for a double room had access to the spa in the mornings friendly staff 
295575,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Rooftop pool is very small if there s more than 4 or 5 others in the pool you ll be bumping in to each other the pools in the Spa are much larger at a cost a bit restrained with their coffee supplies though we were told that the maids supplies are counted so they could only give us a couple extra , staff very helpful cheerful Spa was great for an afternoon 
295576,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Not central so had to get taxi s but close to the Camp Nou , We only stayed one night so didn t get chance to use the spa but heard it was very good nice room decent comfortable beds and the air con was very welcome on such a hot night would stay again 
295577,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel,No Negative, Hotel was in an excellent location for our needs Right by Nou Camp Out of the hustle and bustle but close enough Rooms cleaned everyday with fresh towels Could not fault anything 
295578,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, Went to watch a FC Barcelona game and so I booked this hotel First day I stayed no room cleaning showed up I actually had to go and complain to the receptionist to send someone to clean my room House keeping showed up the next day and did a shody job while steeling some of the change I had left in my room I Called room service one afternoon the phone kept ringing while no one answered finally got the receptionist to connect me to them I was promised a free Spa but when I arrived apparently the Spa was closed for renovation Overall due to their unprofessional staff and service this in no way can be ranked a 4 star hotel I would never stay here again , Close to Camp Nou 
295579,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, The food in the hotel was terrible apart from the garlic mushrooms the cheese and ham toastie had processed cheesed and it tasted disgusting Our safe didn t work as when you had to swipe the card to set it up it was to close to the wood panel in the wardrobe and I couldnt move it We had to pay 38 euro in tax on check out which wasn t explained to us when we arrived the young girl said on reception it was like 1 euro 60 but not for everyday and for each person The 0 euro for a deposit for a towel each day is a bit silly should just be a sign in out system without handing over money There needs to be more sun beds up on the roof near the pool or like a soft mattresses placed around the outside of the wool instead of sitting on wood which could get uncomfy When booking I wanted a spa and a pool on arrival we got told the spa was shut which I think is really bad as we should have been contacted about that when asked the stag we got told it was under construction Which I found that hard to believe when it s peak season in the height of summer We got told there was free wifi when in actual fact the wifi was only free for 2 hours it s a bit of a con , The rooms were very spacious and clean the locations was good not out the way but we managed to find buses that would take us where we wanted to go The rooftop pool was lovely nice way to start and end a day in the 30 degree heat 
295580,Senator Barcelona Spa Hotel, There was no notice that the spa was closed until 8 8 15 mini bar was supposed to be stocked with soft drinks as per booking com write up very poor reception when we arrived they charge you for everything, Checking out
