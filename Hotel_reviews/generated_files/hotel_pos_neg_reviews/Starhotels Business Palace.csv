485248,Starhotels Business Palace, I booked an enhanced room with a bath tub according to the pictures of the room and a bedroom and a little living room However on the reception I was offered a suite for extra payment only When declined I eventually was given a plain only bedroom accommodation with a shower cabin It is never said thAt the enhanced room has to be a suite or has a bath tub but the pictures are confusing , The hotel is really clean and spacious The breakfast is various and fresh 
485249,Starhotels Business Palace, A liitle bit far from the center but there is a direct metro line nearby 20m , the family room is very large and well equiped with 4 true beds no sofa Very nice
485250,Starhotels Business Palace, Not that I can think of if ever we will stay in Milano this is the place lot better than the Star Hotel we stayed in Bologna , Bed is comfortable air conditioning great toiletries in abundance Slippers were provided as well even robes were accessible for use Nice location staff were friendly and bellboys were great 
485251,Starhotels Business Palace, The fact that we paid for breakfast but the juices were of the wirst quality and I had to pay 7 euros for a glass if fresh jouice or 7 8 for omelete or etc etc Plus the fact that the parking had a cost of 20 euros per night a real day time robery , The size of the room
485252,Starhotels Business Palace, On arriving at 3am we were told breakfast was until 11 am when in fact it was until 10 30am When we arrived for breakfast around 10 20 staff were in a rush to get us out and there was very little choice available as staff were in the process of putting everything away It was I m sure an unfortunate mis communication , We found the hotel was excellent Clean comfortable quiet and spacious bedrooms and very helpful staff 
485253,Starhotels Business Palace, The area where the hotel is located is a quite dangerous one in the evening almost near the highway at the hotel we were announced that the amount per 1 night was blocked from my Credit card and also a tax of 46 euros for the mini bar in the room it was returned the morning I left although in my booking it was specified that the booking is free of charge , The only positive thing was that it had the subway station around the corner 
485254,Starhotels Business Palace, Accessible only by car taxi 20 euro from the airport Expensive parking at the hotel and difficult to find parking in the neighbourhood Extremely unstable internet , Good breakfast Close to autostradas making it easy to go for day trips in the nearby areas of Milan Close to Metro Quiet 
485255,Starhotels Business Palace, You have to have a car or take the Metro to get around No good restaurants nearby Off the tourist locations , Nice breakfast easy to get to with car Near the Metro station 
485256,Starhotels Business Palace, Parking too expensive 20 euro per night , Very nice big family rooms and very clean There are actually 2 rooms with a large hallway between them Both have sitting area Very comfortable beds You will find tea and coffee facilities and a very large minibar selection At request they offer a set of gifts for kids crayons caps sun glasses etc Breakfast is nice There is a subway station very close direct train to Doumo So you can go very easily in city center Also there is a pizza restaurant at 100 m 
485257,Starhotels Business Palace, I can t think any bad things All was going fine , The room was very nice We really enjoyed the hotel as a young couple The breakfast buffet was huge Friendly staff around the hotel 
485258,Starhotels Business Palace, This is NOT a 4 star standard hotel I was there with my two grown up kids and their room was a small box which was eventually changed There was bird muck all over our balcony the next door room had a collapsed balcony for the first few days We had a problem with our safe and despite mentioning on three or more occasions it still didn t work when we left There s no tea or coffee making facilities in the room not one international news or English speaking channel no help on offer for luggage completely understaffed and reception staff appear to be in a constant state of exasperation I would suggest due to a lack of experience and or training 3 per day for pool towels an empty mini bar and if you asked them to then fill it so you ca use it then they charge a 6 per day service fee When phoning the reception no one ever answered Overall the exterior of the building is very tired rusty frames on the balconies no attempt to clean the place up paint faded or peeling Chips of building material were all over our balcony or was that bird I will not be returning and would not recommend this hotel to anyone , The Pool area and the staff at the bar and restaurant were excellent and couldn t do enough for you 
485259,Starhotels Business Palace, The hotel is old and the breakfast not up to the expectations they don t even cut the tomatoes and no one asks you whether you want a coffee cappuccino or tea , Good position near the metro station
485260,Starhotels Business Palace, hotel cancelled our reservation less that 24hours before arriving when we tried to call them staff spoke very little english and couldn explain what have happened the just said sorry and put the phone down on us 3times we end up doing a new reservation last minute which was more expensive never found out what have happened they just simply avoid the answer, The breakfest was really good 
485261,Starhotels Business Palace, The breakfast could have been better no so much vegetable and every morning the same food again Also it is a real pity that the hotel doesn t have a swimming pool or spa , We have already visited many 4 hotels but I must admit this one was one of the best ones We booked Junior Suite and it turned to be perfect for us Looked exactly same as on pictures It was also only 10 min by metro to the center so again very convenient People at the reception were really helpful and always answered our questions and requests If we are coming back to Milan we will definitely return to this hotel 
485262,Starhotels Business Palace, the car parking was way too small and somewhat dangerous to park a car in because you could scrape the side of the walls easily the breakfast staff was totally disorganized not even having plates first time that s ever happened to me in a buffet one side of our room the ac didn t work I didn t like it as soon as we arrived and you guys wouldn t give me my money back , nothing really
485263,Starhotels Business Palace, late at night the walk from the tube to the hotel might be a bit weird might be better if you travel with at least another person it s only a 1 min walk, Very comfortable rooms I loved the bed close to the airport and to the tube station You were in city center in aprox 10mins Amazing breakfast loved the ricotta cheese and the watermelon tastier than in UK 
485264,Starhotels Business Palace, We had some problems First we wanted take a bath as soon as we got there because we were so tired from traveling but the plug in the bathtub didn t work well so we called the reception and they sent the plumber and he changed the plug Even though we couldn t draw the bath so we asked to change the room They changed the room but that room didn t have the bathtub and smelled like cigarette so bad so we asked to change the room again And they said they don t have spare room so in the end we ended up staying the first room It took two hours to decide the room but THEY NEVER APOLOGIZED Of course they changed us for the normal price and the mini bar And when we tried to take a bath we realized there was only one set of towels and bathrobe even though we booked for two persons so I called the reception and asked I m so sorry to bother you but may I have another towel as I don t speak Italian And the lady said something I couldn t hear it so I said sorry but she just hung up That was so rude I didn t want to try again so I gave up And after that in the night we asked for toothbrush This time my boyfriend asked in Italian and the man came to my room so I said Gazie but he said NOTHING That moment I decided to write this review I ve been 5 stars hotel 3 stars hotel B B apartment etc but this hotel didn t feel like 4 stars hotel even though we stayed superior room The furniture looks old the bath room s tiles were cracked the service was terrible as I wrote They didn t even say hello to us when we ran into them in the hallway Maybe we expected too much but this hotel was terrible I feel so stupid that I wrote this long but that s why I really don t recommend here Please consider another place , The breakfast was nice The location was perfect 10 minutes from duomo by metoro Bedding was so clean and bed was comfortable I think the house keeper did good job Big room big TV some stuff seems nice 
485265,Starhotels Business Palace, The room, Airconditioning in the room was raining all night from the ceiling like a continuous tik tik from a tap and the hotel is in general quite used Not old but definitely not modern The breakfast was very good
485266,Starhotels Business Palace, Staff at restaurant at hotel not friendly Never offered expressor coffee to other guest not speaking Italian which was sad To think it s a hotel where every guest would get same service , clean rooms
485267,Starhotels Business Palace, The breakfast room is underground therefor not very appealing The AC is not the best either super strong and noisy or not working , The breakfast is very nice gym too the staff is very attentive and competent
485268,Starhotels Business Palace, Furnishing is a little dated Quality of breakfast can be improved However no major issues , The price was fair for a busy weekend in Milan with the family The room is spacious and clean 
485269,Starhotels Business Palace, The location perhaps is a bit far from main Milan Centre But then the metro is next door which makes it easy to travel The hotel is stylish and spacious , Stayed only for one night So can t comment on breakfast But the room was super comfortable Outstanding in fact the rates are pretty reasonable as well 
485270,Starhotels Business Palace, The breakfast was a bit disappointing in variety Another guest had mistakenly given our room number for his restaurant bill and we understood that money are taken from our credit card for the bill by chance Although the personnel was vert sorry and provided quick assistance such mistakes are not acceptable for such a hotel , The hotel is easy to reach from the Central station and the personnel was very helpful in providing directions The room was big and comfortable very clean with comfortable beds The room was cleaned every morning and the personnel was kind and helpful The hotel is just a few steps from a metro station and about 15 minutes from Duomo which makes it perfect for sightseeing 
485271,Starhotels Business Palace, Be aware of extra reservation draw after payment The reception staff and serving acted not serviceminded Not many smiles or pround of my job here you are staying in the best place I make sure workjoy The breakfast is okay but the prices for ect omelet or pancakes which is only served on the side with extra charge is headshaking expensive First and last stay ever , The hotel is nice and clean with nice rooms and areas but the staff drags down the overall impression 
485272,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, Nice staff very good connection into the centre tasteful breakfast At the corner of the hotel there is a very good restaurant 
485273,Starhotels Business Palace, breakfast was the same for all the days that we stayed no new options added the breakfast area was crowdy and rather small for the size of the Hotel we had to choose late ours to be served in order to avoid waiting cleaning service entered the room at 08 30 while we were sleeping just to ask when we were leaving to tied up there is an extra local fee tax of 5euros per person for every night you spend, large and quiet rooms king size beds smoking rooms available upon request easy to find and to reach with public transportation the Metro station was less than 1 minute walk far 
485274,Starhotels Business Palace, Hotel was excellent Kitchen closed during lunchtime though and found it difficult to find any restaurants nearby that were open , The room cleanliness breakfast and staff were excellent
485275,Starhotels Business Palace, Once the chambermaid tried to enter in the room although there was the Do not disturb sign at the door On the other day when we were having an afternoon nap with the kid at about 14 30 the receptionists woke us up by phone to ask if we would like the room to be cleaned Although there was a good variety of products at breakfast there was almost nothing for person on gluten free and or vegetarian regime But this is like in all Italy it s the home of pasta and pizza after all , Just few steps from the metro station Porta Di Mare on Line 3 which goes directly to the central square Duomo as well as to the Central Rail Station Although it s pretty far from all places to visit and the downtown with the metro connection it s really just 10 15 minutes to reach Moreover Milano being with tight streets and no parking space at all it s better to go around the city by metro instead of car rent a car Large rooms a lot of elevators kind staff at the reception Although everything looks a bit used it is well maintained and clean 
485276,Starhotels Business Palace, not worth the money basic breakfast ask for coffee usually not available customer service was rude Internet is very bad even paying 8 euro a day Showers is poorly designed and dangerous , comfortable clean and convenient stay
485277,Starhotels Business Palace, Staff at the bar and breakfast very unprofessional reception slow Location near to metro but takes a bit to get to the city center or airport , Room ok Close to subway
485278,Starhotels Business Palace, Room has its finest times behind No iron in the room nor at the front desk such a thing in the business hotel is a must , Located just next to metro station 12 minutes ride from duomo very good breakfast
485279,Starhotels Business Palace, The rest of the hotel and the very poor service at breakfast had to pay extra for it and it was awful No service do it yourself and the buffet looked like it had been hit by a hurricane , The room was stunning Most impressed with their efforts there 
485280,Starhotels Business Palace, Most receptionists have really bad attitudes Free wifi only 500mb a day Its sad booking com advertise them like this not all facilities listed by booking com is provided Photos are different from actual room Breakfast is just edible Superb breakfast review are fake or it is from people having their first croissant Rather have breakfast outside with the price It is a good room just feel cheated as advertises Not worth the money 2 star treatment for 4 star price 3 star accommodation go only if you are desperate ,No Positive
485281,Starhotels Business Palace, Good breakfast variety but quality was average the omelette was not good Broken car windows in the street parking in front of the hotel one should definitely use the underground hotel parking There are minor things in the hotel that need to be renovated or taken care , comfortable room good and relaxing bed the staff were nice polite Big plus the fun making and positive attitude of Alessandro in the restaurant despite the difficult job to accommodate all the guests during breakfast Would stay here again 
485282,Starhotels Business Palace, I asked for additional towels but no one brought it , The bed was comfortable The bathroom is big I liked the open patio inside the hotel The breakfast room was busy but the breakfast was nice apart from coffee which was instant so strange to have an instant coffee in Italy Good variety and prices in the minibar the size of the room is comfortable 
485283,Starhotels Business Palace, Very rude personnel The lady in the reception told us to park our car to hotel s garage because it is not safe outside She said it is very dangerous neighborhood and anything could happen to our car if we park outside If it is such dangerous why would anyone want to stay there The hotel s parking lot is 20 euro per night btw Also the hotel charged the city tax twice We paid the city tax in cash and later found out they also charged our credit card It s been one week and no refund Later I went through the comments of this hotel and read they overcharged many other customers The staff in the reception and breakfast lobby were very very rude No wi fi at all Bad shower Not a good breakfast Very dated room We don t suggest this hotel at all It was a terrible experience , The bed was very comfortable That s the only good thing
485284,Starhotels Business Palace, 1 the heater takes about 10 mins before the water warms up After e shower is being turned off needs another 10 mins to warm up still 2 wifi very slow Can t access when I am on the bed only designated areas 3 requests not being answered promptly, Nothing
485285,Starhotels Business Palace, Nothing important to comment The only thing I noticed is that the hotel could use a bit of renovation , The room was spacious clean and quiet The staff was courteous and helpful Good quality of mattress and nice choice of products for the minibar Appreciated also the small boiler for coffee and tea The breakfast had good quality and enough variety I also liked the location which was appropriate for our needs Although there is nothing around to do in the neighbourhood with metro station just around the corner and easy access to the peripheral road of Milan its easy to go anywhere you want 
485286,Starhotels Business Palace, The water from shower is cold even though I have turned it to the hot maximally Have to wait for 10 min before it started to heat up When I turned it off for a while to apply soap the water was cold again when I turned it on again Had to wait for another 10 min again Lot of water was wasted Wifi was very slow and have to upgrade room to get faster speed , Location is near metro station Staff is friendly 
485287,Starhotels Business Palace, See earlier answer the guy in the bar is good and the receptionists are nice usually most other things are not great , Not so much Lifts were broken Room was dated like 70s style dated and not in a good way coming back into Stylie kinda way
485288,Starhotels Business Palace, The only thing that really annoyed me was the limitation with regard to the free internet , I was very pleased that my request for a quiet room had been taken into account The staff were very efficient and polite I was also pleased with the fact that the hotel is near an underground station 
485289,Starhotels Business Palace, The breakfast was probably the worst European breakfast I ve ever had Amongst a tray full of bacon fat and a few chopped hot dogs they regularly had no coffee which was tasteless no water or juice Asking the waiters waitresses to fill these up were your only hope The bar had only 1 member of staff which took 20 minutes to be served he tends to like to serve 5 people at once then forgetting what it is he is supposed to be doing The price of a 400ml Beer Moretti is 7 which is dearer than some central places The hotel also doesnt provide an iron so if you ve bought yourself a nice outfit and have packed it like any other human be prepared to walk round Milan with creased garments , The bed was comfy room was generally clean 
485290,Starhotels Business Palace, lack of information in the room would have been ideal to have a booklet with basic info of hotel surrounding area and transport Coffee sachets were nice but were not replaced for the next day , Breakfast was good although slow to be replenished when things ran out Rooms clean and comfy Staff friendly Just 10 15 minutes direct metro ride to Duomo 
485291,Starhotels Business Palace, Guys in the XXI century free wi fi 500Mb day limited in business hotel this is not serious Include 1 2 euro into the price of the room but provide better internet , Really a very good breakfast 
485292,Starhotels Business Palace, shower was a little rusty, The guy at the desk was pretty cool We arrived as a bunch of guys at 2 00 at night and he was funny and realm calm Very good coffee Pretty good breakfast Everything was fresh and there was a huge variety 
485293,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, Breakfast is really reach juices are fresh and natural you have everything you need before you start with a tour and more The stuff is really friendly we had a bad weather and they did everything to get us an umbrella Nice thing that you have a free coffee and electric boiler to make it in your room so useful 
485294,Starhotels Business Palace, Where to start First of all the room was nothing like the pictures advertised here They looked old used and had scratch marks pretty much everywhere on the floor and furniture I looked again on the Booking website to see if any of the rooms were like the ones we got and I could not find any At some particular time my card was charged for something from the room I did not have anything consumed yet they did charge it I got lucky I had SMS notification and asked them to refund but if it wasn t then what would it be Also I had a blocked amount on the initial card I had for the booking and at arrival since I did not have that original card with me the total amount of booking has been blocked on another card The unlock depending on your bank lasts for a few days The second day the cleaning lady threw some personal care product of my girlfriend which I find unacceptable Also the wi fi was not working so we got 24 hour vouchers for that which is ok but the signal is very bad and the speed is worst than the mobile connection itself , The personnel is very proficient and willing to help you with any question you might have The place is quiet and fit for a good night sleep 
485295,Starhotels Business Palace, Location is a bit far from city centre , Breakfast is ok Th bed is comfy and the room is quite spacious Close to metro station so very convenient And you can find many restaurants in walking distance 
485296,Starhotels Business Palace, Some renewing in the bathroom is needed The Internet speed is somewhat poor for being in Milan Parking is very expensive 18 Day , Very comfortable beds Nice rooms Very good breakfast with a lot of choices Friendly staff Good position with the metro quite near
485297,Starhotels Business Palace, Cold water in the bathroom and the floor was really cold there as well At least we didnt t find if there was an option to raise the so to say floor temperature , Amazing breakfast and big comfy bed Really good staff as well Metro stop about 400m Porto di Mare 
485298,Starhotels Business Palace, The staff was absolutely useless and rude unreliable and the answers they were giving us were inconsistent When I came the guy told me I paid everything already but the daily fee tax and then the next day the other guy told me I did not pay One day they served us good coffee the following day they refused to do so during breakfast even though they did it for everyone else around us they booked us a taxi and said it would cost 20 euros and taxi charged us 30 Internet was miserable Breakfast was miserable This hotel and its staff made my vacation THE WORST one ever It is very close to the underground and it is clean Other than that if I could I would rate this hotel ZERO ,No Positive
485299,Starhotels Business Palace, Very far from the airport taxi shuttle costs more than 100 euros and with train it takes hour and a half to get their, Room was big and clean the hotel is next to the subway so it was very easy to go the city center 
485300,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, The breakfast was awesome with great variety the room was very spacious and the hotel really close to the metro station Also the staff was really helpful 
485301,Starhotels Business Palace, In our bathroom we had to shower in the bathtub it was uncomfortable The whole bathroom was wet after a shower because there was not any shower curtain or a glass panel , The breakfast was excellent Our room and bed were very comfortable 
485302,Starhotels Business Palace, The hotel is located in an industrial part of the city hence not possible to walk around at night and you wouldn t feel safe doing so And use of the parking garage is highly recommended because break ins for curbside parked cars is rampant note there s a fee to use the underground garage and entrance is very narrow any car larger than BMW 5 seires is not recommended , The hotel itself is fine clean interior decent breakfast friendly helpful front desk staff 
485303,Starhotels Business Palace, The room deco was tired and it was difficult to open the windows to let in some fresh air The restaurant staff were unwelcoming and nothing like the desk staff The lifts are slow The management need to get involved and improve the standards Make sure the taxi from Malpensa doesn t cost you more than 150 Euros as I was overcharged by an extra 30 Euros , The desk staff were friendly and helpful 
485304,Starhotels Business Palace, Room is hot without air cond during my stay No variety in breakfast Same types of food during my stay In fact the breakfast has been same throughout the years , Location
485305,Starhotels Business Palace, our room had nothing to do with what you could see on the pictures when booking it so watch out exhausted and pretty worn down interior from the 90 ies that surely doesn t deserve 4 stars for a whopping 380 night and we had to wait over an hour in the lobby until the room was ready all in all okay but far away from what we had expected , nice building from the outside close to metro station
485306,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, Beautiful quiet and comfort the room is cleanliness Far away from the city center but metro station is 50 meter distance convenient to go to the city center 
485307,Starhotels Business Palace, Every things is not goof for this hotel brakefast staff rate of room , Every things is not goof for this hotel brakefast staff rate of room 
485308,Starhotels Business Palace, Omlettes should be included in the price boiled eggs were too cold out of the fridge bathtub was too slippery they should put bath mats They should have free parking for visitors Or only 5 euros per day but NOT 20 euros , Helpful friendly staff clean comfortable beds silent rooms good breakfast free wifi good quality shampoo body wash 
485309,Starhotels Business Palace, The location although good to commute in would benefit from a few more restaurants and bars, Although the hotel was out of the city centre it was really easy to jump on the metro and get there in about 15 minutes 
485310,Starhotels Business Palace, Money was taken on my credit card from hotel that I wasn t aware of Staff at reception didn t speak enough English to understand what I was saying Money still not back in my account 3 days after we have left , Beautiful hotel Immaculate Staff fantastic with all the children as part of Milan camp Room lovely and spacious and very clean and to a high standard
485311,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, Very comfortable bed Slept soundly Room immaculately clean and in good order as was the rest of the public areas Breakfast was lovely not too much or too little 
485312,Starhotels Business Palace, The eggs were a bit runny and the bacon too soft for my taste but I certainly didn t leave hungry There is a bit of circling the block and one way streets involved with parking A GPS is the way to go in a new city anyway though , The front desk staff was very helpful and most spoke several languages including English The room and bed were very comfortable as well as quiet The lobby had plenty of room to gather with our travel companions The breakfast was nice with a fair spread of fruits breads some cold cuts hot food yogurt and coffee Having parking was great for driving and metro access was VERY convenient 
485313,Starhotels Business Palace, Price value not present Hotel premises are clearly outdated and worn out while price for one night suggests the opposite Location is in a poorly maintained neighborhood litter everywhere Super narrow parking entrance be careful with cars bigger than VW Golf , Nothing to like really 
485314,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, Everything was perfect Room was very clean and warm Good breakfast comfortable beds convenient parking lot friendly staff metro station in 200 metres 
485315,Starhotels Business Palace, Access for guests arriving by car is poor as is access to parking area All catering is outsourced including room service so non hotel staff all through hotel Manners of staff from Playfood caterering needs to be improved Hotel needs more staff and better trained porters I don t understand how it SN be 4stars Rooms are very basic,No Positive
485316,Starhotels Business Palace, Had to look almost 15mins to find the breakfast room downstairs didn t see any signs and stumbled into various closed sessions , Good location to reach the City center within minutes via subway station just outside the hotel Rooms are clean but could use some touchups here and there
485317,Starhotels Business Palace, Location is terrifying in the morning there were a lot of cars with broken windows in the putside parking since people there probably coming from the close club did not find anything else to do than stealing all the stuff they saw in the vehicles in the hotel they know about the situation of course since I really don t think it was an isolated case but still they let you pay 20 additional euro to park inside disgusting Luckily my car was kot among them but still they broke my wiper just for fun I wouldn t come back there for this reason , Staff was nice the hotel is clean comfortable and breakfast was amazing
485318,Starhotels Business Palace, hot water for making tea only tepid Juices not drinkable Plates cold for dinner No steak knives Fruit salad desert nearly all apple waiter service poor charged 10 service charge on top of bill only available menu in the lifts , Very comfortable bed Quiet room
485319,Starhotels Business Palace, Bathroom was not perfectly clean I saw spots of mold but not much, A good place to stay near the subway station Free parking on the street or 20e night at a garage It was quiet at night and breakfast was great
485320,Starhotels Business Palace, We only stayed for one night , We booked a simple room for one night and we received a free upgrade to a suite The room was awesome everything was clean quiet warm and cosy The bed was so comfortable first time we slept so well The breakfast was delicious The staff kind and helpful The metro station is just a few steps away Don t think twice it s the best choice 
485321,Starhotels Business Palace, Everything it was abysmal terrible staff awful hotel awful room poor location took 10 minutes for the water to warm up in the shower and then dribbled out of the shower head , Nothing probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed in it was that bad we left a night early even though we had paid for two nights 
485322,Starhotels Business Palace, The photo represented 1 room in the whole hotel that had been refurbished the rest of the hotel was tired and dated The bar closed early and the 1 member of night staff would not allow access to the secure parking area Breakfast was poor for a 4 star hotel charging additional for eggs , The photo of the room 
485323,Starhotels Business Palace, old style interior a bit unstylish shower was to weak and old , location is close to the office i liked that the room was quiet and warm
485324,Starhotels Business Palace, The drainage of tub did not work properly and it was fixed on the 4th day Every day with the same breakfast No free bottle of drink water was available in the room , We booked the hotel with a very good promotion price and it was worth 40 promotion The location was very close to metro station The room was clean 
485325,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, The breakfast was excellent The room was huge and the bed fantastic Everything was perfect Further more the metro station on the corner made very easy to reach the center and any other destination 
485326,Starhotels Business Palace, Not much to do in the area around hotel , Hotel is very close to metro station Comfort room Nice breakfast Hotel is not spectacular but pretty decent 10 min from Duomo by metro 
485327,Starhotels Business Palace, Decor is a bit outdated and some minor renovation could bring some freshness to the ambience The breakfast while ok is pretty standard everything feels grocery material the croissants the juices the hams and cheeses look like they were bought from the local supermarket and lacks any hand made touch Variety is also not strong but still fine for a good start of the day Rooms are a bit noisy because of the air ventilation but nothing critical Position is not the most charming in the city there is nothing in the surroundings you can reach by walking The very close underground however will connect you to the centre fast and easy , The Starhotels Business Palace does well its job It s a very decent hotel in a slightly decentralized area of Milan It s very well connected to the city centre via the underground 15 minutes to Duomo door to door which is really good Staff is extremely friendly and helpful from reception to breakfast room from bar personnel to room cleaning which is very appreciated I ve even asked for a late check out which was nicely granted Room was spacious and clean had while not particularly charming it had everything needed for a good stay It s a business hotel as the name of the hotel also suggests which means you are not going to find an intimate or romantic atmosphere but given the fair price I paid 90 euro night for a superior room it can be a good choice if you are in leisure time visiting the city 
485328,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, We could not stay for breakfast because our plane was leaving really early in thw morning but the staff was so nice they gave us a breakfast box for our travels 
485329,Starhotels Business Palace, Although it seems luxurious it is a bit old Bathrooms would need a renovation For example in bathroom one can see a bit of mould in the shower Not to mention that while we were in room someone from the staff entered to see it without knocking she just unlocked The rooms differ from photos but ok , very comfortable bed nice breakfrast very close to metro
485330,Starhotels Business Palace, It is written with small letters that there is a city tax which is 5 per person per day which is too much for Milan and for the area where the hotel is situated The service on the reception was very slow there is always a quees , The bed was good 
485331,Starhotels Business Palace, Please Italy smile more I know its common there but for other countries it s important D , Great industrial style modern 200 metro 4 stations to Duomo 5 10 Minutes Safe area 
485332,Starhotels Business Palace, , Awesome Everything was perfect Very comfortable large and clean room varied breakfast it s very close to to metro station direct line to the center helpful staff excellent price 
485333,Starhotels Business Palace, amazing place nothing to write, We liked it all The beds are comfortable not made from two seperate beds but real queen size beds comfortable rooms quite big good place amazing breakfast have no complaints And the staff is very helpful and nice 
485334,Starhotels Business Palace, The room doors are very old you need to lock them and unlock everytime Because otherwise people may enter your room Breakfast could be better, Nice spacious room Very clean Nice staff
485335,Starhotels Business Palace, Rooms need renovations Twin beds are narrow Floor carpets are clean but aged looking The night shift manager told me that he gave us a renewed room but it wasn t The renewed room you see in the photos is a mirage and I think that there s only one existing only for photo shootings , Close to highway you can reach both airports easily if you re traveling with a rental car Porto di Mare M3 station is only 30 meters distance
485336,Starhotels Business Palace, American buffet breakfast consisted only of cold buttery scrambled eggs cold veggies cold mini frankfurt sausages boiled eggs and soft watery bacon Definitely not an American breakfast I also cut my lip on a broken glass while having breakfast There was no information provided in regards to the facilities available They didn t charge my card when they were meant to whilst I was in the UK Instead they wanted payment at end of stay This meant I got hit with a bad exchange rate and I got charged an exchange free by my card provider The hotel needs a renovation The furniture is old and the outside is falling apart with the greenery not being maintained The location is also in the middle of nowhere and there are no shops around , Soft big bed Clean room and linen Pastries in breakfast were nice Has direct metro access in to Milan central 10 Mins although worth noting that the day we wanted to travel into Milan the whole transport network was on strike The staff are also quite pleasant they all greet you as you walk by The tv was great You get to watch sky movies 
485337,Starhotels Business Palace, I would almost call it a scam the pictures are not reflecting the actual rooms From the pictures you expect a brand new modern boutique style accommodation but you get 20 to 25 year old rooms , Friendly staff good breakfast
485338,Starhotels Business Palace, The whole stay was nice but at the end we were misled by frontdesk stuff who recommended taxi to the airport over the bus and guaranteed the taxi will be no more than 15 EUR Eventually taxi was almost twice more I would expect such a place to have standarised fare to the airport especially if they claim they have their friendly taxi station nearby, Spacious and comfortable rooms quite reach breakfast
485339,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, Great hotel due to facilities and strategic location not really in the centre but 20 meters away from Porto di Mare metro station which leads you to Duomo in less than 10 minutes and to Central Station in approx 15 Breakfast was super restaurant as well Room spatious and comfy There s also a fitness center small but fair enough In the end very good value for money

485341,Starhotels Business Palace, I had to haul my stash after check in all by myself don t know if this is normal in Italy or just an arrogance of the receptionist we refused suite for additional price he offered us The shower is not detachable The shower cabin was leaking water whenever you use it it gets very wet all over the bathroom , Next to metro station any part of the city just 10 15 minutes away Quiet part of the city you can get a good nights sleep Quite good breakfast Even a standard room was spacious clean comfortable and nice looking

485356,Starhotels Business Palace, Staff could perhaps be more warm But this was barely an issue They use gigantic key holder and only give one for each room so it s hard to split up and come back to the hotel in different time , Breakfast was good Location near the metro like very near Room was spacious

485366,Starhotels Business Palace, I just need to warn everyone that although it says they have a hotel transfer and although we contacted the property regarding this a week before we came to stay there is no such thing It is actually an overpriced taxi that cost three times as much as the room Unfortunately we had to get to the airport early and we were an hour from the airport in the middle of nowhere by the time we got here and we could not get a refund for the room and find a new hotel at that late stage so we had no choice but to be gouged by this absolute scam It really left a sour taste in our mouths It was an awful unjustifiably expensive end to our trip , Very clean comfortable beds

485372,Starhotels Business Palace, However it takes more than 10 metro stations to go there The worst thing is there is nothing around not even a proper restaurant for a meal , The room is spacious and comfortable and just a min walk from the metro station The breakfast is excellent Worth for the price 
485373,Starhotels Business Palace, The price is high for what you get We were with 50 discount but eventhough the standard room cost us 70 without breakfast The room is totally standard and outdated The floor is with a carpet and wasnt really clean , Close to linate airport Taxi cost me 30 Good service behind the reception Spacious room Clean sheets and towels Coffee and tea in the room Comfortable bed

485421,Starhotels Business Palace, We were very happy no complaints Our satisfaction may also be due to the fact that we had a promotion on Booking dot com and paid only 35 per person per night for a double the buffet included Easter 2016 Do not use the minibar or the hotel bar Prices are sky high Just put your own drinks in the fridge , Comfy bed in an enjoyable room Very adequate bathroom Super breakfast buffet Couldn t start to inventorize what s for grabs Friendly and helpful staff Good location around the corner from the Porta di Mare metro so you can get around Milano by public transport easily Count max 20 straight to Piazza del Duomo M3 line

485428,Starhotels Business Palace, I ve stayed in this hotel for a number of visits now and was concerned that the range and quality of the breakfast had definitely gone down Corn Flakes rice krispies and coco pops for cereals is quite pathetic for a 4 hotel I was tempted to take a small roll one morning and could hardly cut it it was so tough As for the scrambled egg I ve honestly never tasted worse Poor breakfast, The hotel is always warm and comfortable The staff are welcoming and efficient It is reasonably quiet and in a generally quiet area of the city There are a few non touristy restaurants within walking distance with excellent value for money cuisine The tube station is also very close by

485435,Starhotels Business Palace, the personal from reception The blonde girl is owful unpropriate attitude bad English unfriendly, The superior room it is ok if YOU are lucky to receive the room from the photos otherwise they tried to full me with a standard old room like a girl from the Great Br wrote in a review The breakfast is ok you have a variety of juice fruits croissants etc 
485436,Starhotels Business Palace, Big hotel so got lost the first time trying to find the room The shower is not properly enclosed and so water gets everywhere Breakfast could have been better esp the eggs The juices served tasted too artificial , Most things in the room were great Staff friendly Very close to Metro but woudl hav been to have some signs when getting out of Metro

485441,Starhotels Business Palace,No Negative, very nice hotel with good value for money easy access nice beds and rooms metro station 10 meter away perfect nice breakfast included in price just go 
485442,Starhotels Business Palace, Staff speaks very bad english Upon arrival they suggested to bump us to superior rooms for additional fee which will include VIP treatment Whole VIP treatment was bathrobe that maid brought us Aditionaly they charged us twice for the tax minibar etc With excuse that funds are just reserved from credit card but eventualy I left with 95euros more missing from my account and I have to deal with the bank , Good location metro station very near Good rooms
485443,Starhotels Business Palace, The room was very old fashioned even though we had a superior bedroom more like we live in the 90 s The area where the hotel is is very dirty and looks like a Ghetto The staff lied and said that the parking on the other side of the hotel isn t for free BUT IT IS on the main road Instead they suggested us to use their own parking which is 15 per day We played pool in the hotel and the table was very old and so damaged that it didn t make sense to play at all we tried like 3 4 times The restaurant was not really nice to have lunch or dinner in There were only a few dishes plus they were incredibly expensive I wouldn t recommend it to anyone All in all I am quite disappointed by the hotel We won t visit the business palace again because it s not worth the money , Big room quite nice staff the room was very clean and tidy every morning after we left The selection of the food at breakfast was very nice 
485444,Starhotels Business Palace, The furnitures in the room are a little bit old They aren t as shown in the photos , The bed was very comfortable The breakfast was also good The metro station is almost outside the hotel 
485445,Starhotels Business Palace, We had booked a triple room While the room was large and able to accommodate the extra bed it was obvious that this was a temporary arrangement of an extra bed in a double room rather than a permanent triple room It was adequate for a one night stay but would not have been satisfactory for longer than that , The staff were very friendly and welcoming and provided good information about transport to major attractions The hotel is bright and clean but just the same as other hotels of the same level nothing about the decor or facilities really stands out as exceptional The room was large as was the bathroom and the bed was very large and comfortable Whilst the hotel is close to a metro stop it is a long way from the centre of Milan we had a 30 minute transfer by bus from Malpensa to Central train station and then another 20 25 minute taxi drive to the hotel It was 15 20 min by Metro to Il Duomo 
485446,Starhotels Business Palace, Due to so called data base failure provided room wasn t the one that I booked And it was not easy to correct the room arrangement Parking was not available due to so cold maintenance So I must had used private parking where it was 500m apart from the hotel , Close to the metro station
485447,Starhotels Business Palace, Nothing too bad Wi fi not functioning very well Had to ask for towels shampoo and stuff to be completed one or two times Generally negligible , Close to metro station but not so close to the center Smiling helpful staff Good breakfast in fairly relaxed timing Comfortable bed nice clean spacious rooms Peaceful and quiet surroundings Basic shopping facilities nearby 
485448,Starhotels Business Palace, The room was a smoking room didn t like that they say it was not but strong cigarette smell also found a few dirty spots in the room didn t like that , Breakfast and service was good
485449,Starhotels Business Palace, The rooms where different then the pictures on the site Hard beds Next morning i couldn t move my back Staff at breakfast are grumpy and not friendly Breakfast was terrible The area where the hotel is located is really bad The crime rate is high Not a 4 star worth , The staff at the frontdesk are friendly and kind The waiter at the bar very nice 
485450,Starhotels Business Palace, Nothing too bad Wi fi not functioning very well Had to ask for towels shampoo and stuff to be completed one or two times Generally negligible , Close to metro station but not so close to the center Smiling helpful staff Good breakfast in fairly relaxed timing Comfortable bed nice clean spacious rooms Peaceful and quiet surroundings Basic shopping facilities nearby 
485451,Starhotels Business Palace, 1 The hotel in general and the facilities are pretty old and partialy damaged 2 It was quite cold in the room 3 The heating system was extremely noisely It was impossible to sleep while it was working 4 The staff was unhelpful , 1 Location is close to metro station 2 Breakfast is very good for Europe
485452,Starhotels Business Palace, We were disappointed with our triple room which was an executive double with an extra added bed all three bed positioned next to each other The extra bed is smaller as size comparing to the other two Missing supplies for the third person were quickly brought after we discussed with reception as the room was prepared for two though the bed added Fans were noisy and we turned them of at night so it was somehow cold The biggest drawback is that after reserving by debit card and paying with the same card as advised by reception to cancel the preauthorisation the value for two rooms has been withdrawn and at the same time blocked in my account being necessary to wait for 30 days until reservation transaction expiration date , Very close to the metro about 1 min walk breakfast is varied most of the staff are very polite hotel is very clean for a triple room ask for a free internet voucher as only 2 devices per room have Wi Fi access 
485453,Starhotels Business Palace, I was traveling with my Mum We arrived to the hotel at 10 30 before our room was ready check in from 2pm We asked receptionist if we can leave our luggages go to the city and then come back for check in Very helpful lady said that there is no problem they will keep our luggages in cloakroom staff even make a note with ours names and tied the note on our bags to make sure that is all safe When we came back to the hotel we get our room quickly and got information that our luggages are already in the room Yes there was luggages but not ours More than 30min staff was looking for our bags No one knows what happen with it We where in big stress because we had my and my Mums laptops in this bags In the end one of people working in the hotel say sorry to us and offered a dinner for me and my Mum at the hotel restaurant to compensate all troubles we had It wasn t a good experience , Good location 15min from the airport by cab and 3min to underground station clean and big room 
485454,Starhotels Business Palace, Parking was not free because Of Th area W did not feel safe When parking out in Th street because W did not know if they would row Th car, W liked Th hospitaity cleanliness Breakfast rooms were Comfortable and soft clean towers Price was resonance 
485455,Starhotels Business Palace, surprised after spending 07 nights two double rooms we were ask to pay early check out fee we checked out at 6 am Breakfast only red meet or chicken based dishes were available would have preferred some sea food options well now most of us prefer fish to red meet due to health reasons specialty filleted sea bass or Modha would have been super , overall a good Hotel very clean and friendly staff 
485456,Starhotels Business Palace, Checking out was hectic There was express check out available but it wasn t clear how to use it Do you simply drop your key into the box Better information on how to use express check out would have been helpful , The bar tender in the main lobby was really nice He made me a little snack tray because dinner was several hours away and I was passing the time until then

485459,Starhotels Business Palace, Worst parking ever seen in a hotel It was miracle we got out without damage And pretty expensive too The hotel in general and the facilities are pretty old and partialy damaged It urgently needs refurbishment All in all its not a bad choice but far more expensive than it should Maybe half the price would be fair , Clean Mostly friendly personal Near subway
