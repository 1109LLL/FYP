81837,Relais Du Louvre, I personally would have liked more cream and coffee packets for drinking in the room Two regular and two decaf per day is probably sufficient for most travelers but I live on coffee especially when it tastes this good , Great location Staff was always friendly and helpful Room was very clean and comfortable with great working AC Plenty of hot water in the shower Mini fridge came stocked but also had a bit of extra room for our own food choices The instant coffee in the room was surprisingly tasty not bitter like the instant I get in USA hotels The receptionist got us a taxi to the airport with little notice Their driver arrived early and it was significantly cheaper than the one we got at the airport upon arrival Overall we had a very pleasant stay 
81838,Relais Du Louvre, The room was fairly small but not untypical for Paris However despite this the bed was large and comfortable , Great location close to the Louvre and the Latin quarter Room was comfortable and clean Staff very friendly 
81839,Relais Du Louvre,No Negative, Great location even better service friendliness and customer service The room was very nice very clean a true boutique Highly recommendable 
81840,Relais Du Louvre, The size of the room If you have a suitcase each there is no room to lay them down to get into them however when we were moved to the suite on the 5th floor there was plenty of room and made the rest of our stay very comfortable , The hotel was extremely clean and well presented the staff were excellent my only dissapontment was the size of the room from the pictures on the web they look a lot roomier however after 3 days we were able to be moved to a lovely suite on the 5th floor which was perfect we had a lovely view of the Louvre and the church next door which was excellent This suite also had a coffee machine A very big thank you to all the staff 
81841,Relais Du Louvre, What I didn t like is that we only had two nights to stay there , What a quaint and unique property located in view of the Louvre Staff was wonderful in helping us plan and make the most of our short time in Paris 
81842,Relais Du Louvre, Rooms were small but it did not put us off overall impression was very good staff very helpful and friendly , Cosy romantic little hotel excellent location Would chose it again if we were to visit Paris in the future 
81843,Relais Du Louvre,No Negative, Amazing location literally across the street from the Louvre a block from the Seine 15 minute walk to Notre Dame Great facility Best staff imaginable 
81844,Relais Du Louvre, Room was claustrophobic a cramped sleeping quarter 40 cm on the left of the bed 70 cm at the foot My husband and I had to make sure not to move at the same time in the room then a sort of corridor with a sofa and Bathroom WC View on a concrete wall In fact the whole hotel was too small too cramped too dark One could call it a bed and breakfast without a breakfast room Corridor to stuffy and hot lift miniscule Not 186 euros worth I am afraid , Location is very good The room was silent at night 
81845,Relais Du Louvre, everything photos displayed was no where seen in that property no documents to be signed handed over at check in charged twice despite paying at booking com staff especially the gentleman if he really is was the most rudest person one can expect in hospitality business will never recommend this to anyone suggesting to sleep on road than going to this hotel, Nothing
81846,Relais Du Louvre,No Negative, Room 51 was big sized to have us and our 8 and 11 year kids and our small dog Across the street from Louvre perfect location Perfect little breakfast delivered to room before heading out to sight see 
81847,Relais Du Louvre, I was accomodated in a small room on the ground flow The shower was too small for a normal adult person , The location and the room small but very nice decorated 
81848,Relais Du Louvre, Nothing comes to mind , Fantastic in room breakfasts Great wifi comfy beds good satellite tv great location nice bathroom Helpful and pleasant staff It s all good 
81849,Relais Du Louvre, Nothing bad to report , The staff were lovely and very helpful The breakfasts were perfect Rooms were tastefully decorated and very clean I really recommend this delightful hotel 
81850,Relais Du Louvre, Larger hotels can offer more facilities and space but due to the location and age of our hotel I couldn t ask for more , The staff were fantastic and so helpful in helping us navigate Paris for our first visit The hotel itself was charming in a wonderful location We would definitely stay in this hotel again and will recommend it to others The room was not modern in decoration but this added to the charm of the hotel I wouldn t change anything We were in the attic top floor space and it felt like a little apartment up there 
81851,Relais Du Louvre, No toothpaste and tooth brush available No slipper Room is too small, The room is small You will have a trouble if you have a large luggage because the lift allows two persons only 
81852,Relais Du Louvre,No Negative, The location right beside the Louvre was so convenient to everything Plus the room was quaint with lots of character The staff was very helpful with recommendations and directions We will be staying there again when we go back to Paris 
81853,Relais Du Louvre, I heard foot step noise when somebody going up the stairs though it was seldom corridor was narrow and short and our room was right behind the reception which one staff was sitting for 24H , cleanliness separate toilet three single bed mini bar and free coffee tea set Our room was in ground floor and had a cozy and private courtyard with table and chair We couldn t sit there during our one night stay due to rainy day but that make us refreshing just by looking and opening hotel car parking was very near one minute walking louvre museum was around 5minutes walking to the main gate 
81854,Relais Du Louvre, Soundproofing should be removed from the description what with the rumbling Metro underneath and hearing the chat in the next room and courtyard the description was misleading , Good price for an excellent central location Clear email confirmation direct from the hotel soon after booking on this site was reassuring 
81855,Relais Du Louvre, Nothing , This was beyond wonderful There is no need to search any longer for the best Paris Hotel Beyond the fantastic location which is right near pont du neuf set on a quiet street off an alley way that was safe 1 2 a block to the metro across from the Louvre and many restaurants within feet of you what makes the hotel literally the very best we have stayed at through all our Europe traveling from London to Paris to Rome is the staff Frederique and the rest of the staff were all so caring patient sweet and above all knowledgable Anything we needed from a taxi restaurant laundry exceptional and always strong wifi food drinks help and anything else especially being new to the area and traveling with kids from ages 6 thru 15 they provided Each day 24 hours someone was there at the desk in case you needed anything at all or had any questions We are so grateful to them all for making our stay so comfortable The breakfast served delivered daily to your room was plentiful delicious very reasonable for the amount of food they provided and exceptionally delicious Actually it was the best chocolat croissants and coffee we had the entire trip The room was the adjoining two rooms for a large family of 5 or more It was a great size two bathrooms all you needed in the room including TV a mini bar safe that only you have the key too and the most comfortable beds We had 4 beds for 5 people Each Kid had their own area and we had our own area as well Yes one shower was slightly small but the other made up for it so no one had an issue They had a lift if needed The wifi was always working and always strong as was the air conditioning The atmosphere was perfect for all ages What else can I say about how amazingly great the hotel location and staff were Basically we will never stay anywhere else when visiting Paris This will be it We thank them all and miss them already 
81856,Relais Du Louvre,No Negative, Location was excellent for central Paris The hotel decor was charmingly French Makes a very nice change from the mainstream hotel chains It was a delight to stay there Will be happy to stay there again the next time I visit Paris Staff were friendly and helpful 
81857,Relais Du Louvre, Nothing, The staff was fantastic What a difference that makes as well especially in a small hotel They arranged for me to have my hair cut the recommendation was great Their restaurant reccomendations were great They were happy and not too busy to chat and very friendly I had 2 separate night stays in different rooms both were clean neat and comfortable I was also able to store my luggage in between my 2 stays enabling me to pack one smaller bag What an enormous kindness and convenience The rooms offer small conveniences like wine snacks and coffee which are a delight There is even a small refrigerator I did not use room service The proximity to popular sites is great you can walk across Pont Neuf onto the Ile de la Cit and the metros are very near Also near the RER making transfer from the airport a breeze

81860,Relais Du Louvre,No Negative, The service from the staff was excellent the best part of the stay Although breakfast was served starting 7am we managed to get ours at 6 20 to accommodate our schedule The staff was also very helpful in offering to make any arrangements we needed 
81861,Relais Du Louvre, Small room but it really didn t bother me because I slept there only Had a great view and TV Can t complain much , EVERYTHING location staff I thought the hotel had great character and I enjoyed it 
81862,Relais Du Louvre,No Negative, Small boutique hotel with a fabulous staff and superb location Just across the street from the Louvre Hotel guests can purchase their Louvre tickets at the hotel front desk to avoid standing in long lines at the Museum entrance Loved everything about this classic European hotel Within close walking distance of train station restaurants coffee shopping and the river 
81863,Relais Du Louvre, The rooms were very small , The main plus is the location near the Louvre and Notre Dame There are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby but despite this the hotel is in a quiet location
81864,Relais Du Louvre, The showers are tight for space and breakfast is only available served in your room This is not a criticism simply an observation as it was clear in advance that this was the case , High quality no nonsense accommodation in a great location at a sensible price

81869,Relais Du Louvre, The room was tiny and gloomy and bore no resemblance to the website There was a construction site at the end of the street not mentioned on the website and we were kept awake by trucks in the early hours of the morning We d booked for two nights but left after one having had such a poor night s sleep This was a business trip and I couldn t afford another sleepless night The hotel manager was unsympathetic and rude insisting that I pay for the second night even though we didn t stay and had to find and pay for another room for the night ,No Positive
81870,Relais Du Louvre, maybe to pricey the breakfast does not really worth the money but at least it s room service , very good location charming atmosphere convenient for single traveler the room is extremely small just enough for one person but don t forget you ll be in the very center and this is a traditional old building so the size is understandable
