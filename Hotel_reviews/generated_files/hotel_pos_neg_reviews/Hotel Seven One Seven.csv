421548,Hotel Seven One Seven, WE could have had more teabags we requested more which staff always bought only to be removed by the room cleaning staff again each day, Staff were quirky interesting and very good Decor and design innovative and beautiful
421549,Hotel Seven One Seven, No complaints at all , The hotel itself is fantastic the rooms large and comfortable the location very convenient However the best thing about it is the staff I don t think you ll find such helpful friendly and engaging staff anywhere else

421551,Hotel Seven One Seven, no problem for me but maybe a problem for elderly guests as there is no elevator and the steps are very narrow, Gorgeous boutique small hotel beautifully decorated spacious bedroom living room quiet and very convenient location overlooking a canal and importantly extremely helpful staff 
421552,Hotel Seven One Seven, we were with another couple and they had a suite we had a normal room we found it really weird to pay the same price for such different rooms also the heating next to the bed made us a bit dry in the morning, perfectly located hotel for museum and antiques amazing team the whole thing is almost perfect
421553,Hotel Seven One Seven, Staff unfriendly It must be a management guideline because it applies to everyone Act like museum guards caretakers of the property rather than as service staff Behave as if they are afraid guests would steal silver spoons follow you around in public areas etc Creates strange atmosphere Weird door policy guests are not allowed to take keys must ring and stand on the street for sometimes a minute before door is opened no remote opening It is not a hotel rather a B B , Property is fantastic Very beautiful tasteful an insipration for everyone who loves antiques beautiful interiors and design 
421554,Hotel Seven One Seven, Not a problem for us but you d better be able to climb narrow steps , The building is beautiful the rooms are spacious and the location is great The staff was very attentive and helpful 
421555,Hotel Seven One Seven, This may be booking com s issue more than the hotel however when I input our family and location for the search the price that appeared for this hotel was only for 2 people and even though our child would have been free at most other places this hotel charged an additional 75 EUR per night Therefore the original comparisons were incorrect When I tried to cancel our reservation based on this it was non refundable and no exception was made The AC is very loud and does not cool down the room very well The staff opened our windows for us the first day without putting in a mosquito net and we received over a dozen mosquito bites that night , Great location Stylish hotel and rooms nice breakfast
