485956,Best Western Madison Hotel, Bed was a bit firm for my liking and the room was fairly small both very minor comments , Location was ideal for my work and close to the central station area
485957,Best Western Madison Hotel, Breakfasts are really bad small and boring selection Very small microroom, Good localization close to central station and metro At the same time the area is silent and safe especially if you compare it to surroundings of Termini in Rome Complimentary water in the room Very efficient airco i even had to turn it off from time as i was freezing
485958,Best Western Madison Hotel, Staff Unfriendly and not very helpful The front desk staff hung up on me 6 times when I was trying to call for help I was so upset because the guy simply kept hanging up , The location of the hotel is very convenient to the train station that can get you to all parts of Italy The room was very clean 
485959,Best Western Madison Hotel, The bathrooms should be renovated, Staff the hotel is an old property so doesn t have a lot of things which is expected in new hotels these days however the staff is so lovely that it just makes up for it anytime
485960,Best Western Madison Hotel, Power went off in room both nights No help from desk Geared towards business traveler Need to use metro bus tram or taxi to get to tourist sites Advertised Happy Hour needs a lot of work Snacks were skimpy bar tender waited to be asked no other customers for drinks , Location by train station transportation 
485961,Best Western Madison Hotel, I don t think anything could have been better , We were greeted warmly upon arrival and given a wonderful big room It not only met all our needs but exceeded our expectations The room was efficient and well designed very comfortable The hotel provided us with a nice baby cot all made up and also gave us baby toiletries The hotel is very close to Milan Central Station and there are plenty of shops and restaurants around It is manageable to walk to the Duomo and other sites as well Another mention to the wonderful staff Everyone was So friendly helpful and accommodating We had a great stay wish we could have been there longer 
485962,Best Western Madison Hotel, I have no complaints at all , The staff were very welcoming and helpful I was surprised at how large the room was and particularly the walk in closet I even wondered if they had given us a last minute upgrade Generally I look for relatively low cost hotels that have decent reviews and a good location so I m not rating this against a high end hotel experience But for a traveler who wasn t expecting luxury this made me feel a little bit pampered on the last two days of the trip 
485963,Best Western Madison Hotel, Although breakfast for 6 EUR was ok fruit served was not from this period of the year That is certainly a point for improvement Bed in the room was close to the room s door There is no bar in the hotel , Small but very confortable room with all that is necessary airco mini bar free bottles of water and a modern bathroom There was a magazine in the room explaining what to see and what to do in Milan very useful Train and metro station are just 10 min walking from the hotel and the neighbourhood is quite safe 
485964,Best Western Madison Hotel, I didn t like the fact that I was told that I did not Best Western Credits since I had booked through booking com The breakfast was pretty good by Italian standards but the scrambled eggs definitely were not of a good standard , the location was excellent since I was arriving via train and others would be taking me by car to other locatoins 
485965,Best Western Madison Hotel, Wifi was slow , Excellent breakfast and service spacious bedroom Once located from the Central station it s an easy walk Our first time at the train station saw us confused with direction so we ended up further from the Madison Hotel Overall a cool interior after the heat of Milan at 30 degrees and a well appointed comfortable clean room A good 50 minute large taxi drive to Malpensa airport No change from 100 Euros 
485966,Best Western Madison Hotel, From the outside the hotel is not very nice to see but its compensated by a church around the corner , Nice breakfast Not only italian patisserie but also a buffet with a lot of varied foods We were with three persons and our room was very large comfortable and good for three persons 
485967,Best Western Madison Hotel, Air conditioning was high , Close to Milan Centrale station Friendly warm conversation at front desk Excellent breakfast value Spacious clean and comfortable room 
485968,Best Western Madison Hotel, The breakfast is very reasonable and convenient but not very exciting But this is Italy and breakfast isn t such an important meal , The hotel is very close to the railway station where buses from all airports finish The GPS from your site led us on a tour of the area for about 40 minutes but it really is 5 minutes from the station The staff are very pleasant and speak good English 
485969,Best Western Madison Hotel, Rooms Location Staff Everything was bad , Horrible place Very bad staff The worst hotel I visited so far I dont recommend to anybody Rooms very small size of toilet location very far from city center Old and ugly Staff very unhelpful In one word horrible experiance Choose any otger but not this one 
485970,Best Western Madison Hotel, Dinner in half meal plan quite salty while dinner got smoking smell from outside a little , Staff very friendly Can walk from train station easily service very good Breakfast in normal standard 
485971,Best Western Madison Hotel, Icy cold scramble eggs on buffet Rude staff member at hotel desk , So disappointed with this hotel The first time checking in the staff older man was overall rude and talked down to me and my friend I tried to ignore this so it did not spoil my holiday The next day he was still very rude to us Later that night we came back from our tour and saw another staff member at the desk and felt safe to ask him a question about the wifi connection His name is Stefano and he was courteous and answered all our questions in a professional manner The breakfast had ICY COLD scramble eggs in the buffet When another guest pointed it out to a staff member he open the bottom cabinet and flip some switches supposed to warm up the eggs in its silver pan Pros The coffee and croissant was fresh the property is nicely decorated comfy bed and pillows 
485972,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is perfectly located Our room was spacious bright an comfortable nicer than on photos with wonderful view on the church The breakfast was good value for money The complimentary refreshment early in the morning on the day we ve left was very nice gesture Pizza from neighboring restaurant Friends was delicious 
485973,Best Western Madison Hotel, When we arrived to check in there was a misunderstanding about whether we had made full payment including breakfast Actually we had already paid everything ie breakfast hotel tax and tourist tax but the check in staff said that I had paid only for the room and nothing else Fortunately I had a credit card statement from my bank to dispute this Also luckily on the day we checked out another front desk staff Klaudios was on duty and he confirmed that I had paid for everything in advance Actually I don t think it was fair for hotel to charge us the tourist tax in advance , The front desk staff were quite helpful
485974,Best Western Madison Hotel, The hotel no longer has the mini bars stocked They only offer a bottle of water no ither drinks or snacks in the romm s mini bars , Everything about the hotel is excellent It is just a 2 minute walk from Stazione Milano Centrale 
485975,Best Western Madison Hotel, Our original room had great accessibility a seamless walk in shower however we awoke the first night to an invasion of little ants The hotel staff was very accommodating and moved us to another room that was lovely and ant free The tub shower in the new room was trickier to navigate but worked fine , We ate at the hotel since neighborhood restaurants were few Breakfast at the hotel was excellent lots of delicious choices Dinner varied from fair to excellent Marco s service was excellent The hotel is just 2 blocks from the Central train station Using a 2 day metro ticket we were able to get anywhere we wanted to fairly easily We packed a lot of sightseeing into our days knowing that dinner would be available at the hotel when we got back The staff were mostly exceptional We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel in the future 
485976,Best Western Madison Hotel, in the last night of our stay one of the room s toilet has a bad smell which we need to close the door all the time, quiet room not far away from milan train station by walking few nice restaurant nearby within 10 minutes walk decent breakfast
485977,Best Western Madison Hotel, The rooms are small here which is my only criticism , I booked a single at a good rate and was given a double bed in a smallish room It was spotlessly clean and the bathroom was big and comfortable 
485978,Best Western Madison Hotel, Check in staff were lovely but when we checked out the person who checked us out wasn t as friendly , Loved the bathroom Nice clean room Good location We only stayed for the night as a quick stop before going to Venice The elevator had broken down just before we arrived but staff were sincerely apologetic for the issue which we didn t mind about 
485979,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, Hotel is close to central station Super clean and cosy Staff are very helpful and polite they even suggested a very good restaurant Il Tavolino which is close to the hotel 
485980,Best Western Madison Hotel, The building isolation is very poor and we could hear everything next door Unluckily we had some very noisy neighbours we could hear them talk all night , The location is excellent near the train station metro trams buses The room and sheets were clean as well as the bathroom although there was a funny smell in the bathroom on the second day of our stay The breakfast was very good for only 6 euro per person from scrambled eggs to croissants fruit tarts we enjoyed it every morning although after a few days you might get bored with it 
485981,Best Western Madison Hotel, My bedroom window was jammed and had shutters halfway down that couldn t be opened or pulled up The room lacked natural sunlight coming in to the room and noisy vents in the back , All staff were friendly and helpful Room was clean 
485982,Best Western Madison Hotel, Safe was spoilt Heater in the toilet wasn t working well Breakfast had quite a bad selection Staff was not attentive to helping with luggage Me and my old aged mum had to struggle with our luggage while the staff just stood and watched No assistance was rendered Very upsetting Couldn t communicate well in English and as a result couldn t handle our simple queries , Toilets were big and spacious although the room size was compromised 
485983,Best Western Madison Hotel, I dont like being overcharged for hotels in Milan during the design week event It s a problem With all hotels in Milan one day the world will rise up and take cold revenge on the hoteliers of Milan , Great place and well run 
485984,Best Western Madison Hotel, Could the hotel through their websites tell the customer which exit is the shortest way to the hotel For first timer in Milan Central Station it will be very helpful if they know that , Very convenient location even when you have a heavy luggage like mine The trains buses and trams are only a short walk from the hotel and it is easy to walk Staffs are very helpful 
485985,Best Western Madison Hotel, The pull out bed for the third person was not comfortable and had a spring that poked the back A pad for the bed would have been great but we didn t ask about one so don t know if they re available For people that just like to shower the half glass allowed water to leak underneath and out onto the floor but there were plenty of linens to mop it up , The actual bed itself was very comfortable the room had automatic blinds that darkened the room the room was a nice size and very clean The hotel was easy to find from the train station and we felt safe walking back to it after dark There is a closer metro stop too that was easy to get to The staff was friendly and welcoming 
485986,Best Western Madison Hotel, The hotel is just next to a small road a bit noisy , The location is really good just 5 min from the central station the staff are all very helpful and proactive to give me information A restaurant just in the corner name Friends is excellent the food here is very localized and a lot of variety reasonable price 
485987,Best Western Madison Hotel, The price could have been a little more affordable The size of the single occupancy room was too little The stand on which one keeps their travel bag was very small and could have been a little bigger Please replenish tea coffee making everyday , Excellent staff members at the reception including the hotel manager went out of the way to help me with everything They even helped to get an appointment with the hairdresser nearby The hotel was crisp clean and looked newly refurbished from the inside 
485988,Best Western Madison Hotel, It would be more convenient to the breakfast included in the price, The hotel was recently renovated Surrounded by the quiet streets in which parking zone 
485989,Best Western Madison Hotel, First night had wine in restaurant Chose cheapest bottle was brought a different one as my choice wasn t available I assumed the substitute would be same price it was 25 euros when I cam to settle up on departure Food was fine but couldn t use restaurant again due to a private function , Very convenient location friendly staff Was moved to a different room after first night as aircon very noisy Staff helpful ordering taxis and supplying details of tram routes and where to get tickets Good choice of food at breakfast
485990,Best Western Madison Hotel, nothing , Was up early at about 6 15 to catch our Uber for a tour to the Alps and breakfast was not ready The recep staff no idea his name knew we had no breakfast but took the initiative to get some goodies packed for us to eat in the car now that is exceptional service and kudos to the staff that took care of us 
485991,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, I stayed only for a night and had only breakfast Breakfast is very good I loved the orange juice The stuff is kind and helpful The hotel is only 100 metres from the central train station 
485992,Best Western Madison Hotel, The beds were uncomfortable as if you could feel the springs We didn t get our bedding request double rather than twin Getting on the wifi was a complicated procedure And the staff didn t seem to know any restaurants in the area , The bathroom was new and very clean Shower pressure was amazing 
485993,Best Western Madison Hotel, Room was too hot Beds were on castors with a tendancy to roll on laminated floors , Great location to use as a base comfortable rooms and excellent staff 
485994,Best Western Madison Hotel, Reception staff could have been friendlier , Room is spacious and comes with additional small dining resting area We were provided a room even though we reached much earlier than the check in time Appreciate that we were given a room to rest after the long flight 
485995,Best Western Madison Hotel, The front desk staff were kind of fussy The rooms are cramped The average for Europe and Italy Having a bathrobe and slippers would have been good given the room rate , The location is good Close to Centrale The neighborhood is good The hotel and room were very clean The amenities in the toilet were good 
485996,Best Western Madison Hotel, Nothing, The hotel near two train stations and can easily access the tram stop just 2 minute walk The room not too big the facilities provided is on the best western standard 
485997,Best Western Madison Hotel, No acces for wheel chairs or trolley bags we had to carry them by hands noisy water supply system when somebody was taking a bath in next rooms I used to wake up The additional bed is NOT comfortable , Excellent location very close to the central station from which it was very easy to reach both city center and Duomo and the airport quiet street nice helpful staff good clean room fair breakfast Good price quality 
485998,Best Western Madison Hotel, Beds and pillows very firm Rooms recently renovated but bathrooms a little old , 5 min to train station so great for access to rail and also to city via the metro Insides looked much better than street facade and staff helpful
485999,Best Western Madison Hotel, No vegetarian food available in breakfast , Very close to milano centrale station Person at reception in afternoon is very helpful really very cool guy 
486000,Best Western Madison Hotel, I had a half board reservation and breakfast and dinner was included While checking out receptionist lady made me pay extra 6 Euros for the breakfast and she said it is a mistake but she couldn t undo it As I had to rush for my flight I could t care less and I paid for it Another thing is that their lightning in the room is too dim and it is not good for business travelers who wants to work in the room in the evening like me , Our reservation was half board and I enjoyed the dinner so much It was very delicious and they had very good quality menu I highly recommend staying half board in this hotel Also I want to thank Marco who served our dinner in a very kindly manner and he was so kind to treat us with cappucinos 
486001,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, First impression was the smiling and flexible staff all of the members we met were really nice The location is excellent However you need to use the metro to get to the downtown but it s not a big deal only like 10 min The room was comfy we slept like babies Will come back 
486002,Best Western Madison Hotel, Restaurant staff and evening meal option very poor Avoid half board option unless its very very cheap 4 50 night , Superior single rooms very good Breakfast also good reception staff very helpful 3rd time at this hotel for Milan EICMA Motorcycle show and will use again 
486003,Best Western Madison Hotel, i didn t like the size of my room on the picture for superior room look bigger then standard one but on real i had very small room wich i wasn t happy about Breakfast for 6 euro maybe worth it but i can suggest to go outside on the left to Friends restaurant which offers quality and quantity for little more money it you don t stay at hotel at all like me and only sleep there is fine Bed are little hard for me cz I m not big girl , i like the stuff they were friendly Location is good because very close to trainstation 
486004,Best Western Madison Hotel, We had a room on the ground floor there was some noise from the street and from the other rooms Breakfast was rich for 6pp but service could have been better plenty of plates were empty after 9am , Convenient location close to the main railway station Very clean and spacious room with very good blinds Comfortable bed 
486005,Best Western Madison Hotel, Not give to much tea in my room for everyday but we re stay 6 night, Nearest central station easy for traveling another city in italia from milan city
486006,Best Western Madison Hotel, I had booked half board but it turned out there was no restaurant chef on duty and the basic meal provided by a member of staff was very poor I should have rejected the meal and gone elsewhere Looks like there is no evening restaurant trade in which case they should not accept half board bookings To my surprise I was asked to pay for the coca cola I had in the restaurant First time I have booked half board for an overnight stay will not do that again Also couldn t control the aircon in my room , Location excellent for Central Station
486007,Best Western Madison Hotel, Restaurant wasn t open except for breakfast , The location is close to the train metro The bed was comfortable the shower good The room was clean and comfortable Breakfast was good for 6 
486008,Best Western Madison Hotel, Nothing to dislike , An excellent location for the train station The rooms were clean comfortable and well presented we stayed twice during our holiday The staff were helpful and friendly There is a lovely church right across the road to enjoy We found it very easy to catch the bus to Malpensa Airport from just next to the station Would definately recommend this hotel 
486009,Best Western Madison Hotel, Just couldn t work out how to switch lights off Disappointed to find Euro 10 local tax added to bill this should have been included in the booking price, Staff very pleasant and helpful and good location close to Centrale station but still very quiet
486010,Best Western Madison Hotel, Emailed staff about airport shuttle twice never got any reply there is a great regular bus that takes you from the airport into the city so we had no problem but one would thing a 4 star hotel would reply to your email a bit noisy airconditing for a 4 star hotel Breakfast could have been included in the room rate but this was not a big issue cigarette smoke in the lobby but I guess its Italy and they do smoke a lot overall it was a great short stay , Great location lovely staff clean room and good breakfast 
486011,Best Western Madison Hotel, The fact that was too cold in the room The air condioning didn t work on heat mode That was unpleasant And breakfast wasnt the best, The room was cleand everyday Towels and sheets changed daily Spacious rooms Excelent location near the railway and metro Excelent restaurant near by
486012,Best Western Madison Hotel, Worst experience in my life I had friend visiting me when he reach hotel the old man in reception refused to let him in strange even not allowing him to get in toilet After log discussion he allow him for 90 minutes second day i wanted to leave hotel but good guy in reception convince us by good words that it is mistake and will not happen again Second night my friend came again while third mans in reception call me in room asking my friend to leave hotel or pay 30 euro I feel that I am been blackmailed and mishandled I will not come to this hotel whose employees in daytime are good while in night shift s employees are impolite, room clean
486013,Best Western Madison Hotel, Early morning check out and rush to catch train But the service counter is poor and take a long time even we just simple check out Disappointted, Near to main train station City centre 
486014,Best Western Madison Hotel, Noisy next to Central Train Station No restaurants to eat in the evening You need to take metro back into centre Hotel restaurant very dismal fine for breakfast but you wouldn t want to eat there in the evening, Very close to station and metro 
486015,Best Western Madison Hotel, Nothing Only stayed one night and didn t use any other facilities other than the room , We wanted to be close to termini and this was ideal Room was clean spacious and comfortable Service was excellent 
486016,Best Western Madison Hotel, Beware of booking a room at this hotel our experience was that we where charged double because of an error in booking the room when using Booking com The hotel charged us for 2 rooms despite our attempts to explain only 1 room was required At time of check in we had been advised by check in staff that we would only be charged for the 1 room and the problem of the double booking was resolved only on check out to be charged for 2 rooms The booking manager Gianfranco refused to accept that we only used the one room and insisted the mistake of a 2 room booking was solely ours and we would be charged fully for a room we did not use because the booking was a non refundable cancellation booking Interestingly despite being charged for 2 rooms we where never given a key to the second room After a disagreeable check out we later received an email from the hotel after we had left saying they would issue a voucher for the room paid but not used which can be used in a future stay at the hotel This appears to be disingenuous as we where told by email a voucher would be sent within 48 hours it has now been more than 3 days and we are yet to see this redeemable voucher Interestingly this hotel charged my debit card on arrival which is most unusual In addition to this we found that the breakfast was disorganised and the staff clearly disinterested in serving their guest , Located close by Milano Centrale train station 
486017,Best Western Madison Hotel, In a single room it s a little small but not bad but the bed was really not so comfy especially with the one thin pillow , The staff was very nice and th location was perfect right near the central station
486018,Best Western Madison Hotel, One of our group was robbed on the way there StAff couldn t care less Vague point in the direction of police Rooms very small Located in an iffy area ,No Positive
486019,Best Western Madison Hotel, Hotel did not offer any of the expected amenities such as availability of ice no coffee maker in room no snack or soda machines and most of all NO SELF Laundry options These items were available through Room Service only and of course that means you more than pay for what you get The laundry service is priced BY EACH ITEM I can t remember the exact price but one change of clothes for 2 people would be close to 30 euros I have stayed in very nice hotels in London and had an entire bag of laundry done by more than them for about 20 euros , The room was of adequate size and the beds were very comfortable The room was also very quiet and this hotel is located very close to the train station which was a priority to us Our room was quiet and restful and staff was friendly Wifi was free and always worked well We did not eat at the hotel 
486020,Best Western Madison Hotel, The room could not get cold enough It was hot , Clean comfortable great location Near to good restaurants and convenience store and Milano centrale Helpful staff
486021,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, The staff were wonderful and were very helpful with anything i required Clean and comfortable rooms with air conditioning Near the central station Great hotel 
486022,Best Western Madison Hotel, A choice of breakfast dishes was a little poor We were bitten quite badly by mosquitos over night in the room eventhough we have never open the window probably they live in the ventilation system , Hotel room was clean and the staff was very helpful Location is good too just 5 minutes walk to the central station 
486023,Best Western Madison Hotel, No complains, A good value for money The room was perfect and everything was taken care off Air conditioning control was very good and WiFI was also good Excellent location 
486024,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, Like every Best Western rooms were spacious comfortable Hotel is just next to central station which is great if you need to take an early train but otherwise not the nicest neighborhood of Milan to stay in Quality is ok but quite costly more than 100 for 1 night without breakfast We stayed here for our last night in Milan and this was the most expensive stay of our entire Italy trip and quality of the other hotels was comparable The service was however impeccable 
486025,Best Western Madison Hotel, The district lil bit scary at the night so many homeless people, The stuff are amazing thier so nice And very helpful and polite I loved the lady her name roberta
486026,Best Western Madison Hotel, The location and staff and room, very good location walking distance to railway station and subway but very quiet just in front of a church Very helpful and nice staff they got a girl who can speak Chinese amazing The breakfast place is little bit small and food is ok for me
486027,Best Western Madison Hotel, As with any hotel be aware not to leave anything unattended as lobby and restaurant is accessible to passers by , Nice little hotel close to Centrale Station not town centre easy to get direct train or bus to the airport easy access to Metro to get to town and sights Helpful staff 
486028,Best Western Madison Hotel, Stink in the room Stink in the bathroom especially after rain Mold around the window Stink of the towels some specific chemical smell of laundry service 4 star hotel but you should cancel 1 star because 4 star hotel should be definitelly better , Breakfast average Not bad but for such a room price should be definitelly better Internet OK
486029,Best Western Madison Hotel, The pillows and the Breakfast , Extremely clean Great location My only complains are the pillows They are very hard Also the breakfast is not worth it Have it somewhere else Other than that I think it is a good value for the price I would stay again if they change the pillows Thanks 
486030,Best Western Madison Hotel, The bed was not comfortable and above all needed an extra pillow which was not provided in the wardrobe in the room I found one of the staff members tge older man working at the reception desk when I arrived rood The insolation between the rooms was not great as I could hear the work that was going on next door , The location and convenience It is one of the better 4 star hotels I stayed in in Milan The view was lovely and I appreciated the fact that the hotel was in a quiet location despite being right beside the central station 
486031,Best Western Madison Hotel, Despite indicating breakfast was included in the room rate the small print said otherwise Management chose to abide by the small print, The room was spacious comfortable and spotless Breakfast was delicious
486032,Best Western Madison Hotel, Nothing really , Breakfast was the best we had in Italy Croissants and breads were outstanding along with the large selection of cereals fruit hot foods Bed very comfy staff extremely helpful especially given our limited Italian 
486033,Best Western Madison Hotel, Too bad we couldn t check in early arrive at like 8 am but it is understandable The area is pretty quiet at night so a lady shouldn t walk alone during the period Toilet seat is round and so small it might look good from fashion view point but it is not comfortable especially if your are fat, Location is pretty good just a little walk from Milano Centrale Staff very helpful Room is clean all the stuff we need is there
486034,Best Western Madison Hotel, Unless using Milano Centrale we were travelling from there early so we stayed near by there isn t much else around and will have to get the metro to the centre Not many bars Restaurants near by , Nice hotel friendly staff and good sized rooms Location was good only if travelling from Milano Centrale
486035,Best Western Madison Hotel, The way to the hotel You d better take the pass next to Hilton to get the hotel The shortest cut is just not pleasant to pass Do not ruin the first impression about the hotel choose a different road , Hotel is fine Very nice people working there You feel welcomed Spacious room in comparison with average in Italy 
486036,Best Western Madison Hotel, No bar area as such only restaurant bed not too comfortable but ok for 1 night, Breakfast was good and staff very friendly and helpful We were on holiday but more a business hotel 
486037,Best Western Madison Hotel, They asked service charge when we requested for ice Few choices for breakfast menu , Locaton is excellent The staff was very helpful in printing our vouchers attending to our needs 
486038,Best Western Madison Hotel, Safe was not working and was never fixed despite asking 3x to be done They just said sorry Not great when having to carry all your money and passports around with you in a big city We re not offered an alternative room or safe arrangements Not the sort of treatment you expect from a 4 star hotel , The location was great and the room very modern and spotlessly clean 
486039,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is currently being renovated and it seems that we got one of the fresh rooms Nice location just around the corner from the Train Station pleasant staff decent size of the room Very clean

486042,Best Western Madison Hotel, Pillows were too flat and needed to place small supplied cushion under them for bulk and comfort , Comprehensive breakfast included in room price Room spacious modern and spotlessly clean Fridge minibar and tea coffee making facilities in room Very close to central station but in a quiet quarter of the city Close to good restaurants 
486043,Best Western Madison Hotel, We missed the front door It looks like another big window , I like the location of the suite right next to the reception area but still quite private Perfect place for family The front desk is very friendly 
486044,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, You never know what you are going to get with a Best Western but we were pleasantly surprised with this hotel It is only 5 minutes walk from the main train station It dosn t look like much from the outside but inside it was very nice The reception staff were exceptionally warm and friendly They kept giving my young daughters sweets when we left my youngest gave one of them a hug which was very touching The room was very large and well equipped The breakfast was also excellent I thought it was very reasonably priced for the centre of Milan We would recommend staying here if you are visiting Milan

486050,Best Western Madison Hotel, Breakfast was an average experience Not told we could have a coffee from the coffee machine which was much better than from the flask Ran out of key items eg brown bread , Reception staff very helpful Comfy beds
486051,Best Western Madison Hotel, Not the fault of the hotel but I would have liked it to have been in a busier area with more to do around the hotel Being close to the station was perfect though and I walked to the centre and Duomo 30 min and took the metro back , The staff were always helpful the room was modern and clean I loved the breakfast A big cheese platter and bowl of ricotta was included beautiful Close to the station 
486052,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, Clean room excellent facilities perfect breakfast and kindly staff It is about 5 minutes walking from Milano centrale and 5minutes to sandrio metro station It was a wonderful experience to live in 
486053,Best Western Madison Hotel, Room was small but enough for me , Perfect location near Central Station literally 5 minutes walk but on a quiet street quite new inside room equipment and bathroom facilities are fine

486055,Best Western Madison Hotel,No Negative, A perfect hotel for an overnight stay in Milan Very close to the railway station but the place isn t noisy Good breakfast very helpful English speaking staff 
486056,Best Western Madison Hotel, Breakfast was good but with limited options, Very convenient location Right next to central station We were given a suite on the ground floor which was surprisingly big and comfy The windows had electric shutters that made it even better We even had an exercise bike available in the room We had arrived late after midnight and since we were only staying for one night we asked for late checkout and they were more than happy to assist us with our request Value for money especially in Milan Would stay here again 
486057,Best Western Madison Hotel, Slight street noise but it is a city , Perfect location if you are staying in Milan very briefly to make a connection using train or the Malpensa shuttle

486064,Best Western Madison Hotel, Fri night was noisy next door neighbours loud Television on both sides of our room where loud a volume level could be set on the TV s by management so as not to annoy other residents, Great base to explore Milan and just 6 euro on the train to Lake Como 1 hour travelling time Bus tour good value for money we did the 2 day ticket did the 3 seperate tours included in the price and picked the best places we needed to see the next day for free on the bus the added bonus blue route stopped at Centrale station leaving a 3min walk to hotel Great find for us was the Restaurant in the Centrale Station Russo Pomedoro 2 Lobster with Tagiattele 16 euro bottle of white wine 14 Euro
486065,Best Western Madison Hotel, Even if hotel was full as mentioned he could have proposed spraying bed instead of sending her away , Evening staff impolite to my daughter When she went to reception to complain about bed bugs in her bed
