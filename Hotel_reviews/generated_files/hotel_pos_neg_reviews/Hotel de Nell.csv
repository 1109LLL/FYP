234491,Hotel de Nell, Room looking out onto brick wall Bathroom with no room, Small room looking out onto brick wall Bathroom very tiny very depressing room Have stayed in lots of hotels and would not rate this as a 5 star hotel
234492,Hotel de Nell, Nothing, Ideally situated walking distant from Eurostar Reception facilities and service excellent Concierge great facilities clean and executive taxi to boot Will definitely return soon 
234493,Hotel de Nell, extra charge for coffee tabs in the room no complimentary water should be included in a price of 360 , Staff extremely friendly Rooms are VERY nice Japanese Bathtub in the Room Walking distance to a lot of beautiful places Quiet
234494,Hotel de Nell, Nothing we have a great stay highly recommend , Very comfortable beds larger than normal room size for Paris very appealing and stylish interiors fresh clean sleek and modern look Nice wooden floors instead of wall to wall carpet Japanese bath in larger room sizes Large bathroom with walk in rain shower Good room amenities sizeable closet full length mirror Neighborhood is quiet no typical Paris noises Numerous Velib bike rental stations nearby Hotel staff all very friendly and helpful Breakfast was included fresh juices homemade breads Many more delicious options at extra cost Extremely friendly doorman who organized taxis and car parking 
234495,Hotel de Nell,No Negative, We appreciated the excellent design and modern decor of the hotel and the room and the pillow menu added to the comfort The location is excellent being close to the Follies Berger in the 9th Arrondissement and the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly Yes we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel de Nell and highly recommend it 
234496,Hotel de Nell, Nothing really loved the hotel and the staff , We had an issue with the first room we were in but the staff gave us a new room the second night and didn t charge us for the first night The staff couldn t have been more accommodating and the rooms were clean spacious and new 
234497,Hotel de Nell,No Negative, The staff were so friendly and approachable I was given a lovely welcome by Remy and his colleague and got upgraded to a room with a Japanese bath I used the spa whilst I was there and had a relaxing massage and also ate at the restaurant which serves wonderful food 
234498,Hotel de Nell, Only minor complaint would be that the toilet and shower sink area were in two different parts of the room and I found the shower temperature regulation a bit confusing the first time also the water temperature did fluctuate slightly but overall still a good shower experience , The room was nicely decorated a bit bigger than average for Paris still very small but space very well organised I used the free wifi which was reliable There were also some premium options available but I was good with the basic wifi Location is excellent as there are many nice bars and bistrots nearby it is a very nice neighbourhood and just a short walk from gare du nord there is also a direct bus but I didn t take it 
234499,Hotel de Nell, Insufficient drawers for 5 7 stay The Japanese tub was a big space waster the bathroom without it would have been terrific and in any case Japanese tubs are made of Hinoki wood not a hard cold marble like material , room was bright and sunny windows on two sides Room was nicely designed and of sufficient size
234500,Hotel de Nell, Only complaint is the bath tub The plumbing in Paris is not the same as the US so you need patience with the hot water The tub is extremely large and marble So takes a long time to fill But otherwise this hotel is amazing It didn t really matter because the shower is separate and on different plumbing so no issues , The best thing about the hotel is the staff Very helpful and friendly The manager helped me book a day trip to the champagne region after my online bookings were cancelled twice He set up a more private experience that cost half the price The rooms are extremely comfortable and clean Tons of little extra touches The restaurant is great and lively You need a reservation for dinner because popular for guests and locals alike Breakfast is delicious Nothing feels too cramped like typical Paris hotel The lounge is great to meet for a drink or just to sit 
234501,Hotel de Nell, Don t order an egg for breakfast They will charge you 8 eight Euro for a boiled egg , Excellent hotel in a great location Very kind and helpful staff 
234502,Hotel de Nell, The bathtub was nice but the shower room running bit strange sometime as the temperature didn t stay constant , Got a free upgrade for two nights The staff was super welcoming and nice The room was simple yet beautiful the bed was very comfortable as well Love the location quiet but still convenient 
234503,Hotel de Nell, Small rooms for five star hotel, They have good staff the concierge Denny was so nice and helpful In general they re all very friendly And our experience was overall good 
234504,Hotel de Nell, Charged extra for cheese and ham and eggs for breakfast 4 for an egg , Super service Friendly staff and they were most helpful Great location nice restaurant and great interior design Clean 
234505,Hotel de Nell, Would have loved to stay longer , Location away from noise and touristy areas but easy to walk to Le Marais and Les Halle The restaurant was fabulous The staff were amazing helpful and very kind and professional Thank you Xavier and all staff 
234506,Hotel de Nell,No Negative, Loved everything from start to finish All staff friendly helpful The hotel style is chic and tasteful Location is within walking distance of the louvre and other hot spots Japanese bath is fantastic This is my second time staying here and I think it deserves 10 10

234512,Hotel de Nell, Unable to get tea and coffee without asking for room service for milk or hot water at a price No in room movie facility Given a USB with films on it then noticed the bill 60 Euros queried and reduced to 10 Breakfast typically French with little choice without paying for a whole cooked option at 29 Euros , Modern and fresh decor and layout Staff well informed cheery and helpful Good dining and lounge area Lots to see within walkable distance and good Metro 5 mins away
