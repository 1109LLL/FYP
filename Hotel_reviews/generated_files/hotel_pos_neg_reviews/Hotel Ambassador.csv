353286,Hotel Ambassador, Well my room 506 was at 4 floor is not available with the elevator we have to take the stairs is a bit problem if you have baby , They prepared food for my baby Very clean hotel Location is great 
353287,Hotel Ambassador, All is fine but tiny details like small bathroom in my room or lack of a coffee maker take away from the overall experience , Perfectly located but this hotel used to see better times 
353288,Hotel Ambassador, No coffee or tea nor a kettle in the rooms No turn down service These basics I expect from a 5 star establishment , Generously sized rooms Excellent location Typical Viennese decor which has a lot of charm 
353289,Hotel Ambassador, Wi fi could use work That is it , When we walked into the room we thought at first there must have been a mistake it was far nicer and more spacious than the photos suggested Nicely decorated in period style Biedermeier furniture and etc Great huge bathroom with comfy tub for two and two sinks Bed was comfy and many amenities included robes slippers excellent soaps rare at a hotel and we are picky Lovely seating area for having your breakfast and paper delivered Well insulated from all sounds even busy street Whole hotel well maintained Excellent common lounge space in centre of hotel with rooms ringed around above it reminiscent of the Grand Budapest Hotel for fans from regal but slightly shabby seating chandeliers etc And staff was just as eager to please as in the film On that the staff were superb in every location front desk door bar restaurant Special thanks to Mr Simon Milan and the bartender who even in busy hours always had time to enquire on your day 
353290,Hotel Ambassador, Room bedding wasn t great the mattress needs to be replaced , Great location it s basically in the heart of Vienna The breakfast area is really nice Staffs are helpful and speaks good English Overall a great place to stay
353291,Hotel Ambassador, Smooking area lounch should be vantilated better n the bathroom shampoo and stuff are very poor and not good quality, Staff was great both in hoesekeeping and reception Breakfast was very good you could find everything
353292,Hotel Ambassador, Smoking allowed in hotel lounge bar area No tea or coffee facilities in room or late night food provisions ie after 2230 Cost of breakfast 25 Euros good but very expensive , Beds large comfortable Spacious rooms with good Light high ceilinged room with windows which open fully Friendly helpful staff 
353293,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, The location is absolutely perfect on the main shopping boulevard Few minutes from most attractions Pay attention to the room you get we were a group of seven in three different rooms One didn t have good wifi reception the second room was on the fifth floor while the elevator only get to the fourth floor and than you have to take the stairs we asked to change this room and they immediately agree and moved us to the second floor The third room was a business room and was perfect Very spacious and clean I read many comments here about smoke odor everywhere but we had non of it 
353294,Hotel Ambassador, The whole hotel stinks of smoke since people can smoke in the main bar area which affect all level since the hotel is an open built and the rooms hallway surounds the main large bar and relaxation loppy This is a really bad drawback and it lets the hotel down Its discusting and not the right these days The recepetion area its very dated This could be such a great hotel if it was modernised on a few matters , Great Dinning arear with beautyful Terrassa over looking the square to dine outside and have breakfast Rooms are spacious and in an older vienese style 
353295,Hotel Ambassador, We were placed on the 5th floor and the lift only went to the 4th floor We were only advised of this by the receptionist when we were getting into the lift up to our room There was in excess of 20 steps and no porter offered to either carry up our luggage or bring down our luggage on check out If you are given a room on the 5th floor refuse it and request a room on a different floor On check out we were not even asked did we have a good stay or thanked for staying in the hotel In addition the fifth floor always had dirty trays in the corridor every night and every morning , Location was good
353296,Hotel Ambassador, I was the first one to check in that day and was given the worse room In fact when I had asked for a room change though they had rooms but pretended as if they were fully sold out and denied shifting me Then I had checked on bookings com which had also showed me rooms avail and on saying this to the receptionist she then changed her statement saying they are fully booked and they do have a few rooms but are not allowed to shift the guest Surprised to hear 5star property has such rules cause I have stayed in many other prop but haven t heard from any My suggestion please stay in Do Co way better prop than this , frankly speaking nothing 
353297,Hotel Ambassador, The hotel was severly hindered by its policy to allow smoking Not just within certain rooms but within the bar area This meant the whole hotel smelt of stale cigerettes from the point of stepping into the hotel And despite our room being non smoking early morning and evening we could still smell the smoke in our room With most of Europe having a no smoking policy I feel that this was not necessary And would prevent me from booking again , Beautiful hotel wonderful location
353298,Hotel Ambassador, There is no Airport Shuttle You list this on your website as a feature , Excellent situation Room absolutely first class with superb attention to cleanliness Restaurant very good and staff very helpful We would certainly return to this hotel for our next visit to Vienna 
353299,Hotel Ambassador, The girl at the reseption was probably in a bad mood this week , we liked the location and size of the room and the spacious bathroom Everything is at walking distance 
353300,Hotel Ambassador, Overheated but this seems to be pretty common in Vienna Smokers again all but unavoidable in Vienna , Being able to look out over Vienna from the little balcony outside our suite All the better because the weather in Vienna was nice This is the only hotel in Vienna my wife will stay at We ve been coming here every year or two for 12 years now 
353301,Hotel Ambassador, Worst experience ever in a 5 star hotel There is no one helping with the luggage at the reception desk they are not when you need , Next to city center
353302,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, The comfort the cleanliness in fact everything about the hotel However if complimentary tea coffee breakfast were included it would have been a nice gesture on their part Thanks 
353303,Hotel Ambassador, Personal on Reception not friendly rooms was cleaned not as 5 Hotel Found used packet with snake near Minibar locker During Check out we almost was charged for Minibar we didn t use Rooms arrangement during some of stay days was late afternoon Luggage was not delivered to the rooms, very friendly and professional restaurant stuff all our requests were done immediately 
353304,Hotel Ambassador, Ban on connecting devices to the TVs Never seen in other hotels Wanted to connect Apple TV and HDMI to show YouTube clips of Viennese culture to my grandchildren Understaffed Concierge porter and reception both overworked at peak times , Location Large clean well maintained rooms Good in room breakfast service 
353305,Hotel Ambassador, I had booked an expensive apartment suite This place has been completely dirty Levels of dust on door frames within shelfs behind the TVs on the bed headboard and I could go on In addition dried toothpaste left overs from previous guests in shelves on the wardrobe and behind the sofa Unacceptable When I then wanted to speak to the manager despite announcing it in the evening before nobody was available or reachable due to apparent no mobile number to contact him her As an experienced traveler I can recommend anybody to avoid this place ,No Positive
353306,Hotel Ambassador, I dont like the smill of the sigarite in the hotel The reciption is not picking up the phone when i call for a help There is no tea cup at the room no electricity adaptors available at the hotel no lobby WI FI is very very slow and not stable, I like the way you manage the rooms and the efforts of housekeepers
353307,Hotel Ambassador, Very old style not renovated Beds are not confortable, Old fashion hotel style in the very central Vienna Smily staff Upgrade in big junior suite Free wifi
353308,Hotel Ambassador, Nothing we couldn t fault it , Excellent Location Close to all major attractions Beautiful spacious rooms adorned with antique furniture Staff friendly and helpful Would stay again without hesitation 
353309,Hotel Ambassador, The big lobby lies in a kind of center court in the middle of the hotel that is open to the top floor Almost all the visitors are smoking so the whole hotel smells to cigarettes smoke There is no lobby for non smokers,No Positive
353310,Hotel Ambassador, The breakfast at 25 euros was expensive Cheaper alternatives close by When I arrived I asked for an iron and ironing board They wouldn t supply one said they had problems with other guests using it Hotel advertises alarm clock in room No alarm clock Hotel advertises shuttle bus No shuttle bus available Smoking is allowed in open lounge area The smoke permeates up through the whole hotel The furniture in the room is starting to look a bit shabby for a five star hotel , As it was the off season we were upgrade to a suite Very good 
353311,Hotel Ambassador, They should ban smoking in the Bar It was right next to the Restaurant even though I was in a no smoking room the minute you stepped out of the room the air was full of smoke smell The smell pervaded every part of the hotel It is a disgusting habit with obvious clear health risks it s astounding that anyone should smoke or that places still allow people to smoke in their establishments anymore , The location was excellent The room was spacious well kitted out 
353312,Hotel Ambassador, Nothing actually Great staff clean and comfortable Just that they can do with one queen bed if and not two , If retail was about location then this place is all about location location and location Brilliant place and almost the heart of Wein Go and just don t forget to take your pursue and camera 
353313,Hotel Ambassador, Not having self ironing service and universal adaptor for electronic, Very clean and quite location amazing every thing near by even supermarket very nice staff
353314,Hotel Ambassador, Staff were not helpful or proactive They did not help us with our local sightseeing plans We found the front office and hotel operator very reluctant and unwilling to help Poor room service menu Overall very mediocre for the amount they charge for rooms,No Positive
353315,Hotel Ambassador, Reception personell need to be sharper and more customer friendly not all of them were service minded, Clean room comfortable god breakfast very good location
353316,Hotel Ambassador, Desk staff could be more friendly and attentive, Very nice hotel in old style in good sense clean and comfortable great location in the heart of Vienna
353317,Hotel Ambassador, Room service answer is late Put more choice from restaurant in the room service And put free drinking water daily in the room, Room quality The quite in the room
353318,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, So I travel to Vienna every month in the past year and from all the 5 hotels I ve stayed in this is the one I chose to come back to Definitely because of the location and the classic style design
353319,Hotel Ambassador, The actual hotel felt like something from a stephen king novel so old and creepy , The entrance and elevators are very elegant and beautiful The staff were very nice The location is absolutely unbeatable 
353320,Hotel Ambassador, We are guests of Hotel Ambassador for years and we know which level we expect when we are coming in this hotel This time we found only on booking com one apartment very expensive but we book it expecting something very special Instead of that we got An attic very difficult to access via corridors and lifts without ventilation It was 30 degrees in it An attic looking like hostel very poor refurbish everything very cheap not on the level of your hotel An attic with very low ceiling An attic with cupboard in the kitchen An attic with two beds even not fixed together so they got separated during the night We made a claim immediately in the Hotel and we asked to change the room but all rooms were booked , Hotel sam po sebi je krasan i dobro smje ten ali na a smje tajna jedinica je bila u asna 
353321,Hotel Ambassador, Staff not attentive and lazy at times badly managed No real lobby and very Spartan for a 5 star property No elevator to the top level rooms , Nice classic rooms 
353322,Hotel Ambassador, See the comment about the shower , Staff was very friendly and helpful We did not have breakfast at the hotel 25 per person is quite expensive However there is a lovely Konditorei just outside the hotel serving delicious breakfast The location was perfect We stayed there almost two weeks with no complaints except the shower could not keep the temperature constant 
353323,Hotel Ambassador, A little expensive but still enjoyed our stay and felt we got our money s worth, Excellent location friendly and helpful staff large and spacious apartment on top floor Excellent breakfast 
353324,Hotel Ambassador, The staff were the most unfriendly unresponsive group of people at any hotel ever The service was terrible and their attitude to guests was terrible , The lication
353325,Hotel Ambassador, Staff can up their game Made service didn t come one day and told the management staff Came back later and still wasn t clean since their records incorrectly indicated it wasn t clean without verifying Then the made came and confirmed but then left our room unlocked and walked away Asked for extra pillows and got one Waited for five minutes for two desk attendees to help with siteseeing information when we were trying to check out to catch a plane The smoke is really an issue if you don t smoke The lounge is in the middle of the hotel and that is the smoking section so the whole hotel smells smokey , Location is fantastic All the furnishings were classic and matching the hotel architecture Room was very spacious and dual balconies were wonderful in the Michael Douglas room There are opportunities for improvement but the value was great so I would consider staying there again 
353326,Hotel Ambassador, Bathroom bit outdated Ironing cloths is expensive if you are stuck you need to call them and a staff member will collect your stuff to iron them and bring them back to you , Location Responsiveness of staff
353327,Hotel Ambassador, There is no gym , This is a classic Viennese style hotel with modern amenities It s location is excellent and they have friendly and helpful staff 
353328,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, The hotel has an excellent location in the city centre where all the action is there Surrounded with very good bunch of restaurants Furthermore the rooms were very big and has a nice old style furniture I loved it
353329,Hotel Ambassador, I DON T LIKE THE WAY STAFF ACT RECEPTION DO NOT GIVE CLIENT INFORMATION REGARDING FACILITIES YOU NEED TO ASK WHAT FACILITIES AVAILABLE IN THE HOTEL RECEPTION STAFF LOOKS LIKE GOVERNMENT RECEPTION I do believe this action is not caused by staff themselves as it is a problem of management Bellboys are so kind nice and helpfull , to be objective person I cannot give a good idea about what i like or dislike However i know Vienna very very well and this hotel is one of the best in terms of location 
353330,Hotel Ambassador, Nothing Excellent , In the center between St Stephan palace and Stadtoper also between Figlmuller and Cafe Sacher great location always alive Quite high ceiling 
353331,Hotel Ambassador, I was surprised that people could smoke inside the hotel on the 1st floor in front of the restaurant I do not think it is now appropriate to have people smoking in closed public areas A pity that the lift did not get directly to the room on the first floor and that you had to go up some stairs Not very convenient when you are carrying heavy bags , The room was big and very comfortable I was able to work in good conditions thanks to the internet connection and other facilities 
353332,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, This is the Vienna hotel with the best location for me I liked the size of the rooms really spacious Why I cannot name this the best hotel maybe it is just our room 504 was in such place near the roof that the vibration and humming of ventilation can drive you mad
353333,Hotel Ambassador, Smoking allowed in bar area smoke spread to room Price of breakfast Room service finished at 22 30 Expensive for what it offered Large lounge area in room but very small bedroom , Excellent location
353334,Hotel Ambassador, We were not reminded that a front door toward main street is quite a shortcut to our rooms from attractions as we arrived late at the back door for cars , Historic Hotel as descibed great for people seeking for vintage hotels Waiters and receptionist on the front desk are decorous and helpful Also I d like to mention its favorable location and unique austrian comb honey in breakfast With less than 10mins walk to opera house metro and hofburg it has to be one of the best choices to stay in Vienna 
353335,Hotel Ambassador, Smell of smoke in the hallway should allocate smoking rooms to separate floors, Staff helpful efficient and friendly Great location and large rooms Comfortable beds quiet Would stay here again can recommend 
353336,Hotel Ambassador, Two beds together is not the same than king bed it should be a must when you pay 160 per nite Lobby smell smoke as it is allowed in lobby bar The didnt replace amenitties for shower They use Stars symbol in the brandname as a commercial trick it is a 4 star hotel not five or six Not change bed clothing for 3 nites It is very old fasiohned, Our room 301 had great views to main commercial street Big Big room Price was at the average in 4star hotel in the area but need a renewal Quiet place 
353337,Hotel Ambassador, Dated decor Suite was cramped No key card door locks single conventional key which must be left at reception Would not suit 2 people with slightly different schedules No frills ,No Positive
353338,Hotel Ambassador, The sheets of the bed wasn t clean And bathroom need renovation , We really enjoyed the location of the hotel The croissant and bread was tasty And staff very helpful specially Jennifer 
353339,Hotel Ambassador, Beds are too hard front desk staff do not seem to communicate between shifts we thought we had things arranged with one only to be told by the next shift that there were no arrangements or tickets at our departure time only to find out after the event that arrangements were made so we missed our event , Location was great 
353340,Hotel Ambassador, Too much smoke in the hotel and in the rooms because of the bar on the first floor where people are allowed to smoke I do not think it should be allowed,No Positive
353341,Hotel Ambassador, For the price of business room a lot of things missing like arrangement of the room cup of tea tea spoon facilities to prepare tea coffee inside the room etc A cleaning room was done so late with the room left for more that 3 hours and not as I expected for the price paid ,No Positive
353342,Hotel Ambassador, The room was quite different from the details that appeared in the description in your site furnitures overall look location within the hotel , Location cleanliness and staff
353343,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, This hotel is fantastic the rooms are huge and luxurious the staff are polite friendly and very helpful The breakfast was really good Being right in the centre the hotel s location is perfect for shopping the opera mozart museum and most of the other attractions This was my first trip to Vienna and I stayed 3 nights which wasn t really long enough to do all that the city has to offer so I am planning a return trip in the spring I will definitely be staying at the Ambassador again 
353344,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, Beautiful room professional polite and friendly staff excellent breakfast perfect location We are staying in this hotel for the last 6 years no intention to change it
353345,Hotel Ambassador, A bit smell of cigarettes in the corridors Might be overpriced but perhaps due to x mass time, Location interiors design of the room and its size We got a room of higher category without additional payments 
353346,Hotel Ambassador, The room was as near to presidential to I have ever stayed in so very impressed However there were two very minor niggles First the double bed was made up as two singles joined together so there was an annoying gap Second because the room could be joined to the next room noise did propagate through so could hear snoring and conversations from next door , Location was great for everything we wanted to see Staff were very friendly and helpful Beautiful clean and well appointed room 
353347,Hotel Ambassador, Reception desk consierge have not yet learned that they need to treat all clients alike Cleanness is a major Isuse Saturday 14 11 after repeated inquiries on my part they finally managed to perform the daily room cleaning at 14 30 The internet kept disconnecting for no apparent reason All the above and perhaps others that l may omitted justify the reduced numbers of guest at the hotel ,No Positive
353348,Hotel Ambassador, very very unfriendly and impatiently woman staff at reception The air conditioner dose not work well feel cold at night the worst experience during this trip The price is too high for such service WONT recommend this hotel to anyone too bad, nothing
353349,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, Location is great Ideal for City Break I always felt safe A lot of tourist sites within close proximity which maximises your time on a short visit Largely alleviates the need for taxis etc unless of course you have more time want to broaden your sightseeing radius 
353350,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, The central location and friendliness of the staff were outstanding We even received an upgrade to business suite at no extra charge The view from our room was amazing We will definitely be back for a return stay at the Ambassador 
353351,Hotel Ambassador, The toiletries provided were sparse and not very good quality Also the bath towels were not great and there were no extra pillows or blankets to be found in the room No iron either maybe this is normal for Vienna Also we were gone all day back by 3 30 4pm and no one had cleaned the room so we had to ask them to do it in the eve when we went out again , The location is excellent and the staff is knowledgable Beds are comfortable and the hotel is quiet despite being on the main shopping street 
353352,Hotel Ambassador, From the moment I arrived I felt like the reception staff really didn t care about us Some of them were unhelpful and not very friendly but everyone else at the restaurant and room service were nice Both rooms we had were damp and one of them had a ridiculously tiny bathroom The hotel does have a lot of character however it could do with a good refurbishment The worst part is when the hotel booked us a city tour and we spent 40 minutes outside the hotel waiting for the bus to arrive Turned out that the reception didn t event call the company to check if they were coming to collect us We had to come in every 5 minutes and ask them to follow up The hotel is really beautiful and the location is amazing but I doubt that we will come back again , The location is very central breakfast was good and the hotel does have a lot of character and history 
353353,Hotel Ambassador, Street side rooms are a little noisy Would appreciate a turkish channel on tv Not impressed by entrance and lobby , Excellent location Very nice building 
353354,Hotel Ambassador, Normally this hotel delivers but this time my experience was marred by no response from room service or bar to order food eventually went down to bar where it was not overly busy and placed my order although delivered in reasonable time did not feel like room service as I has not planned on leaving room Secondly as is often my custom I check out before eating breakfast and inform staff upon checkout that I will be eating breakfast after I finished breakfast I was presented with the check and passed my credit card to pay for it after nearly ten minutes the waiter returned asking for cash as his machine wasn t working he then asked for my card so he could take it down to reception on another floor and charge it there I refused stating that I would take care of it myself when finished I then went to reception and tried to pay but they didn t know what to do at which time I informed them I was going to pack and would take care of it on way out 15 mins later I returned ready to leave and they refused to take my payment stating that the waiter needed to come to the desk with my flight departure time rapidly approaching I told them I needed to leave in 1 minute after another 5 mins it was finally taken care of this left a very bad experience in my mouth lesson for mgmt if your staff are absent for whatever reason don t make excuses and don t inconvenience the customer because of your mistakes , Location and breakfast
353355,Hotel Ambassador, I booked airport pickup in a dance but there was no one waiting for me I paid for a taxi and yet when I checked out the pickup from airport was added to my bill The rooms are not soundproofed which was anouing The TV channels were very limited, Excellent location in the stephenplatz Attentive sit seeing all around it Excellent breakfast options 
353356,Hotel Ambassador, Air conditioning machine noisy , Comfortable hotel in good location and easy access to the Gellert Spa Staff were excellent as was the breakfast which was included Excellent restaurant cafe and bistro bar Situated well for easy to access public transport 
353357,Hotel Ambassador, However it fails to reach 5 star status in almost every other key area Our air conditioning reported to housekeeping within 30 minutes of arrival was still broken 4 days later The restaurant is barely adequate we took dinner once and the charge of Euro 25 per person for a buffet breakfast is laughable when equally good if not better is available at half the price within 5 minutes walk The staff try to be helpful but often provided us inaccurate information The noise from downtown party people at the weekend went on all night and was highly intrusive even on the third floor , The key benefit of this hotel is its location Right at the heart of the old city it is within easy walking distance of most if not all key points of interest and decent restaurants
353358,Hotel Ambassador, Air conditioning was a little noisy , Comfortable and large clean rooms Junior suite has a sitting area with sliding doors to close off bedroom Excellent proximity to all Vienna attractions as well as subway stop Lots of closet and drawer space including safe Mini bar and bathrobes supplied Bed very comfortable 
353359,Hotel Ambassador, Unfortunately I didn t like the toilet it s hard to flush The airco is a bit noisy but for the rest I love everything , Everything I got upgraded to a very nice specious room with street view
353360,Hotel Ambassador, Really poor Wi Fi service , Beautiful room great location really nice amenities and first class products I loved this hotel and will definitely stay again 
353361,Hotel Ambassador, It s not 5 star as advertised Staff rude No tea coffee in the room Most hotel was staffed by senior school kids on summer jobs Though they were nice of the lot No manager available on night weekend shifts Staff at desk seems to be frustrated with management too Stayed here for 7 nights and all days breakfast was same stuff everyday One day we asked for packed breakfast as we needed to leave the hotel early in the morning to go to Salzberg Told reception staff twice we don t want any meat in our breakfast but still they packed bacon No manager available to complain Overly priced for service it offers , Location if you want to see city and have only 2 days to do so 
353362,Hotel Ambassador, This is our second stay at hotel Ambassador and to the opposite of the first visit this stay was a horror We booked the same type of top floor apartment we stayed in last time and paid the same price for what was supposed to be a 44 square meter luxurious apartment with two floors and two big terraces but were shocked to be shown to a tiny room sitting area which could never be more than 30 meters with no balconies or even a view and had all sloped ceilings and walls that we banged our heads on whenever we moved When we complained to the receptionist she answered us with a stony face that I cant do anything to help you and will not refund you as your booking is non refundable When I asked to talk to the manager and explained that this is not what we paid full price for as it has nothing that is shown in the websites pictures she answered coldly that yes the description of the room on booking com is a little misleading Even when we asked them for simple things like cups or pans we were never even answered To cut it short our holiday was ruined by an utter disgrace of a room and the poker faced deceptive staff , Nothing at all 
353363,Hotel Ambassador, This is our 2nd visit to this hotel and the opposite to the first time this stay was extremely disappoionting When we arrived we were shown to a top floor apartment which is shown in the pictures to have two floors with luxurious amenities and supposedly has two big balconies and written to be 44 sqare meters but were shocked to see a tiny room sitting area which could never be more than 30 square meters with sloped low roofs that we banged our heads around however we moved and no balconies or even a veiw to look out from The kitchenette had nothing but 2 cups and 2 glasses and when we asked for anything to use or to change the room we were faced with stoney faced employees that said we cant do anything to help you and we cant refund you because your booking is non refundable even if we paid a high price for what we saw in the pictures but didnt find in reality even when we talked with the manager she said maybe the description of the appartment on booking com is a little misleading To put it in one sentence our holiday was ruined by a disgrace of a so called appartment and the unhelpful poker faced staff , Nothing at all
353364,Hotel Ambassador, Wi Fi erratic and was only available in certain parts of the room , Location could not be more perfect just right in between Karlplatz and Stephanplatz Close to most sights transportation and on the main promenade for convenient shopping cafes restaurants hotel is beautifully appointed with superb ambience Got a real feeling like living in high society Vienna
353365,Hotel Ambassador,No Negative, Location is great You are in the middle of everything and yet the rooms are sound proof so you don t hear noises We were in the 5th floor and had a balcony Very nice The hotel is expensive but then again it is a 5 star hotel it was worth it The staff were very friendly and helpful 
353366,Hotel Ambassador, Nothing apart from a somewhat weak wifi , The room was large the bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning was a welcome relief from the heat wave that hit Vienna during our stay Excellent breakfast buffet style Great staff 
353367,Hotel Ambassador, None in particular, Everything one can ask for
