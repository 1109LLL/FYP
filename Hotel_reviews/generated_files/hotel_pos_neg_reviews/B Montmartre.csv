221578,B Montmartre, We liked everything about this hotel The rooms were a little on the dark side More lighting Otherwise perfect, I spent four nights here with my sister daughter and a friend The hotel staff were super friendly and were always available The hotel was lovely We had a privilege room It had everything we needed Tea tray coffee maker bathrobes and slippers iron and ironing board A lovely bathroom with a great shower The room was spotless the bed super comfy There is a lovely tropical courtyard garden A real little haven to return to after a hectic day in the city It was my birthday during our stay and the hotel staff presented me with a cake and champagne at breakfast A lovely gesture The hotel was a three minute walk to the metro station at Place de Clichy There s lots of restaurants nearby so plenty to choose from We would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again I could go on and on but best see for yourselves This is a great little hotel with the best staff ever Look no further You won t be disappointed
221579,B Montmartre, Bar shuttiing at 10 00 no bath though shower was exellent design functionality , Food Breakfast exellent room for 3 a little small but comfortable Nice bar louge breakfast room outdoor space

221581,B Montmartre, Bed was a quite squeaky No music channel on TV that I could find , Hotel looks lovely with very attentive and friendly staff Room wasn t the biggest but facilities and comfort made up for it Bed was EVER SO comfortable and the bathroom was lovely Choice on TV was limited but we weren t in enough to worry Location was brilliant for the Metro with some lovely walkable restaurants and bars as well as visits to Moulin Rouge and Monmartre We had breakfast one morning and it was great Overall we ll DEFINITELY be using again if ever in the area Highly recommended 
221582,B Montmartre, On arrival room had a faulty toilet which was noisy I was told there were no spare rooms then suddenly there was a spare room and I was moved I had partially unpacked and was downstairs in the bar having a drink I was about to go out to dinner and the front desk told me they had moved my room again so there were spare rooms And they moved my belongings without asking me taking things from the wardrobe bathroom etc It was outrageous The manager was not in but dealt well with my complaint the next day I was moved to a much nicer room for the 3rd night and offered a bottle of wine , Complaint was handled well
