473542,Andreola Central Hotel, We asked for an iron board multiple times and never got it , Breakfast was excellent We had issues with the air conditioning in our room and we got the suite which was large and comfortable 
473543,Andreola Central Hotel, nothing really to complain about, Very close to the Milan train station just a 2 min walk and also close to the metro There is also a small store which sells the necessities you would need The breakfast was good enough and a tram station is also just around the corner 
473544,Andreola Central Hotel, Maybe written directions to get there from train station We found train station staff unhelpful , Very friendly helpful staff best breakfast we ve had on our travels real chinaware and cutlery as well room was superb When we showed photos of our room to our granddaughters they said it looked like a palace 
473545,Andreola Central Hotel, Although we chose the hotel for its location the area around the station is really not very nice and we would not have liked to walk through it at night with our children There are lots of young men hanging around outside and there was some police action when we were walking back from the underground station after visiting the Duomo , The hotel is very conveniently located near Milan s Central train station which was the primary reason we chose it The hotel initially seems a little tired and dated but the staff were helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable Showers in particular were excellent Breakfast was included in our room rate and was very good 
473546,Andreola Central Hotel, There were restaurants around the nearby station but nothing much else in the neighborhood to recommend it The English film channel was rarely in English Breakfast staff were very reluctant to refill the buffet dishes and more intent on preparing for the next day They also turned the lights off and removed the food at 10 30 sharp , Good size room Reception staff were friendly and helpful Anna in the bar was a bonus great snacks at happy hour The hotel is situated near the station and tram 
473547,Andreola Central Hotel, Unfortunately the person serving in the bar put the invoice from other drinking guests at my room so when I payed the bill for my room and what I had in the bar the evening before it also included what my neighbor had ordered to his table When I payed attention to this fact the chief of the hotel started to blame me for I had noticed this and complained after I already had payed the bill Before I left the hotel he promised reluctantly to see to it that the difference should be payed back at my account Today one week after this happened I still have payed the bill also for the neighbor some tables away from my table that night So instead of apologize and correct the mistake of the barman he blamed me for having noticed this to late So unusually and astonishingly bad Bj rn Andersson, Nice classic hotel near the central station The rooms were nice and clean and nice 
473548,Andreola Central Hotel, Nothing all perfect, It was our third trip to Milan and the best hotel by far We were allowed to check in early which was wonderful after a long train trip to get there 
473549,Andreola Central Hotel, Open patio but Unable to see any view with high wall around it only other rooftops , Close proximity to train station at reasonable price one unexpected night stop on milan Convenient shop next door for food items Nice Italian decor
473550,Andreola Central Hotel, There was no snack menu available they only food the restaurant offered was expensive and heavy food We had to request clean towels on two occasions as nobody had replaced the old ones the following day The location was around 2 miles from the main square so taxis were needed daily , The appearance of the hotel was lovely and rooms were comfortable 
473551,Andreola Central Hotel, Air condition did not work leaked water all night wall paper was pealing off and the room smelled of mold Ceiling stained with water marks , For the location there was very little noise Bed was comfortable 
473552,Andreola Central Hotel, Property and it s staff did not response to any of my email ls to modify my reservation date Worse customer service ever, Nothing The property and Booking did not accommodate my request to change my reservation date 
473553,Andreola Central Hotel, Blanket so so , 24 hours registration 12 00 check out For me it is important because i arrive at 1 30 night And mostly all Italian hotel check out at 11 00 Good breakfast Big room Super location 
473554,Andreola Central Hotel, The male reception staff were not welcoming or helpful , The room cleaning staff were very pleasant and friendly The breakfast staff were also very helpful and friendly 
473555,Andreola Central Hotel, I paid for this room through booking com but then as we were leaving hotel in a hurry they said we hadn t paid for the room and I paid again with my credit card Now i m unable to find how to report this through booking com Hard to find customer service with booking com when you need it So I wouldn t necessarily recommend booking com or this hotel , Comfy beds Small bedroom but spacious bathroom Windows w o a view other than inside a courtyard with garden Which was pleasant Hot at night as cooler didn t work very well 
473556,Andreola Central Hotel, No kettle Air vent runs continuously regards of aircon being on or off and got intrusive Opening a window would have meant having street noise Location is convenient for trains but not much else The social situation in the area is unnerving and safety at night appears an issue , Very quiet Windows are soundproof walls are thick passage has thick carpet and even the doors close softly I didn t hear a sound the whole time except very faint traffic Breakfast is wonderful in a lovely big room Large bathroom Hotel has a very Italian ambience 
473557,Andreola Central Hotel, We where only given 1 towel to use between 2 guests and the Aircon did not work which was uncomfortable as it was a very warm weekend, It was close to the train station so after a long journey it was a perfect choice The rooms where spacious 
473558,Andreola Central Hotel, Nothing, Superb location Great balcony with afternoon sunshine till getting ready to go out Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby with good links across the city
473559,Andreola Central Hotel, Not quite comfortable in the roads around the hotel, good variety of fresh breakfast foods including fresh fruit easy walking distance to train and metro
473560,Andreola Central Hotel, Bed was very hard aircondition didn t work telly in the wrong place should be on the wall not in a unit where the open door obstructs the screen Outdated decor overall the hotel was good just minor points room was clean and the staff plesent Need to get rid of all the plastic flowers very tacky , Near to the station friendly staff clean 
473561,Andreola Central Hotel, We asked for quiet room but newertheless received noisy With balcony with flowerpots full of cigarette buts Hotel has a central air conditioning system they start use it from first of May only No matter if weather is hot or cold 1st of May Therefore if you feel yourself stuffy in the room personel could give you brilloant advice to open windows and enjoy with street life tramms cars , location friendly staff clean
473562,Andreola Central Hotel, Room quite small but it s normal for hotel room in big city, The location is great 3 minutes walk from the central train station Easy to walk even with big luggages and a 3 years old baby Big bathroom Good breakfast 
473563,Andreola Central Hotel, Asked for drinks in the hotel in the evening and although there were reception they said they had a big function on and had no one to serve drinks Rather disappointing as we were celebrating our fiftieth wedding anniversary Would say though that we hadn t had this problem before , Stayed here previously Ideal to stay a night or two when coming from airport Very convenient because it is near the railway station for onward journeys 
473564,Andreola Central Hotel, The air conditioning would appear to only work later in the year , Very good situation for Milan Central Station and shuttle buses to airports Welcoming and very helpful staff We would happily stay here again 
473565,Andreola Central Hotel,No Negative, The comfy bed it is a very short distance from the Central Railway Station The walk into the centre is easy especially if you window shop on the way and or stop for lunch
473566,Andreola Central Hotel, Nothing , Breakfast was excellent and plentiful From coffee tea various juices salty combination omelets ham cheese fresh croissants of various types a variety of fruit cereals cookies Everything was excellent and delicious As for accommodation we were in a superior room which was beautiful Spacious clean warm with carpeting on the floor a spacious bathroom and a comfortable bed The staff is very friendly The hotel is situated in an ideal location Only 2 3 minutes from the central station from which you later all available We are satisfied staying in the hotel Praiseworthy 
473567,Andreola Central Hotel, Room too hot even if we set the thermostat to a fresher temperature moquette everywhere and too expensive even if it was the fashion week Not a real 4 stars for the price we paid , Good location close the Stazione Centrale nice staff 
473568,Andreola Central Hotel, There was nothing to dislike, Location central close to station but heard no noise and the staff were so helpful and dinner in the resturant was delicious
473569,Andreola Central Hotel, Bed could definitely have been comfier And the windows weren t double glazed so the room got a little bit cold and noise pollution travelled into the room , Room was lovely and the staff were exceptional Very amazing and compitent staff at the 24 hour check in desk Beautiful bathroom and nicely furnished 
473570,Andreola Central Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was well placed staff were friendly and helpful the rooms comfortable and the breakfast offered a large variety and was of a good quality This was very good value for money 
473571,Andreola Central Hotel, Needs of renovation E g wall sockets are loose in the wall , Location Few steps away from Central Station Spacious comfortable double room with king size bed and luxury bathroom 
473572,Andreola Central Hotel, Hairs in bed were the sheets ever changed and in the bathroom Floor carpet really dirty Shower lower than my head I am 178 cm Single traveller and got two twin little beds , Location
473573,Andreola Central Hotel,No Negative, Everything was good about this hotel Highly recommend and will return Less than 500mtrs from Milano Centralie Buses trams and cabs all convenient 
473574,Andreola Central Hotel, Very minor but on both stays we discovered that we did not have towels toiletries etc for two people and had to call the front desk Not sure why , Beautiful room they upgraded us to a suite on the top floor which was very lovely We had stayed here two weeks earlier on arrival to Italy through Milan and our room had been less expensive I guess because it was a Friday and this is primarily a business traveler hotel It was a nice surprise to get more space since we were paying more The breakfast buffet is excellent juice fresh fruit cereal yogurt fresh pastries eggs etc and they bring you whatever hot beverage you request Hotel is very close to the train station literally two blocks away which is why we stayed here The hotel arranged for us to have a car service to the airport but there is also transportation at the train station to the airport If we were to fly in and out of Italy via Milan again we would definitely use this hotel on arrival and before departure 
473575,Andreola Central Hotel, Our initial greeting from reception was not friendly The beds were not overly comfortable The heating was controlled by reception and made the hotel room uncomfortable due to the heating being set for winter temperatures even though it was unseasonably warm , Most Staff were very friendly and helpful The food was good for breakfast and the ladies were very friendly The location was great due to easy access to the station 
473576,Andreola Central Hotel, The hotel screwed up the booking through this website for two rooms which meant my colleague had to go to a nearby hotel The hotel said they had only one room free Not sure how that can happen , Elegant hotel with old Italian style close to the central station Comfortable enough but the mix up with the booking tainted the stay 
473577,Andreola Central Hotel, Size of the elevator Although the hotel has 2 elevators for guest , Location Its a 2 minute walk from Milan Centrale The lobby has still its classic beauty in reminiscent of its grandeur era The staff are all excellent Speaks very good English and are quick to respond to any of our requests Luigi Daniel are the best Gives excellent suggestions to every inquiry Rooms are spacious with bay windows Marble toilet is an added charm 
473578,Andreola Central Hotel, Small room no balcony quite basic breakfast not at all what they advertise in photos and adverts quite expensive for what you get , Location is fab Right next to Central station Old fashioned but nicely decorated big bathroom
473579,Andreola Central Hotel, Pleased with everything , Immediately upgraded to the highest room available in the gorgeous hotel without asking Helpful staff 5 minute walk from Central Station but 1 hour from the 2 Airports taxi 100 euro coach 8 euro takes 1 hour delicious breakfast Restaurant in hotel expensive food is quality with a view
473580,Andreola Central Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful staff enjoyed the ambience of flower filled lounge and bar rooms had everything you need Stayed twice once at beginning of journey and on our way home Easy to walk from Centrale station turn left out of station and a very short level walk and you re there They allowed us to leave our bags after check out and helped with advice on city Just a lovely place 
473581,Andreola Central Hotel, Room and bathroom were a bit old watermarks on wall paper and will require a bit of cosmetic touches Matrasses also not perfect but ok for one night, Excellent location just few steps from Railways Station from the side of Piazza Luigi di Savoia where the busses from Bergamo and Linate stop Delicious apple pie for breakfast and good cappuccinos
473582,Andreola Central Hotel, Would hardly call it as a 4 star hotel The mirror in the bathroom is not smooth Very bad hair dryer And the shower head leaks all the time , Close to the railway station 
473583,Andreola Central Hotel,No Negative, Such friendly helpful and efficient staff Comfortable beds with view of a gorgeous courtyard Super central location right around the corner from Milano Centrale and the bustle of Milan Great breakfast Would recommend the stay especially if you need to get moving via train or bus to somewhere else in Italy 
473584,Andreola Central Hotel, Pillows, Excellent location Staff was great especially bartender who got a bag of ice for my sprained toe Great room and bathroom FINALLY GIT air con that worked 
473585,Andreola Central Hotel, We were forced to stay in this hotel as other ones where overbooked on those particular dates Overall the hotel is ok if you re a businessman with a laptop and a suit However if your are a traveler and adventurer in your soul then you should go for other options There is nothing bad in this hotel however ir feels so Best Western or Intercontinental it s boring It s also a bit worn out There is almost nothing Italian there , The place is good if you have to do with Milano Centrale There are good eateries around a number of grocery stores The hotel is very very classic good for ones not so good to others 
473586,Andreola Central Hotel, A larger room would have been nice but for a two night stay quite adequate, Great olde world hotel within five minutes walk from Milano Centrale 6th floor restaurant that we had discovered on a previous trip while staying elsewhere is still of a very high standard under the long serving maitre de 
473587,Andreola Central Hotel, This is not a 4 star hotel We have stayed here multiple times over the years and always loved it But now they had no computer for me to use to access internet and print boarding passes The air conditioning in our room did not work and no one could fix it The TV lacked any channels with English sub titles as we were told there would be at least 2 channels To make matters worse the person they sent to fix it couldn t even operate the remote control We spent our entire time there unable to watch TV while sweating The neighbor is now run down and dangerous , The restaurant is one of the best in Europe 
473588,Andreola Central Hotel, The neighborhood had been better in an earlier time It is safe during the day but quite iffy after sundown If you want to be downtown this is not your hotel but as I said transportation is very easy and very cheap , We came by train to Milan and it was a very short walk from the train station to the hotel A definite plus The rooms are slightly bigger than the European standard and with all the amenities that travelers expect The decor and ambience here was a stunner Very old school and very well done The staff was for the most part very helpful We got some incorrect info one night but it was corrected the next day Marble decorations massive doors and a bathroom shower that for Europe was a pleasant surprise The restaurant on the 6th floor is must and is very good as well The neighborhood at night does not not need another statistic We tried walking out for dinner the first night and quickly changed our minds Stay at home at night with good food excellent service and very good prices Transportation to the town center is easy and cheap with the train station a 5 minute walk and the tram station less than a minute away 
473589,Andreola Central Hotel,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly spoke very good English and were very very helpful Made the stay much more enjoyable knowing that the staff were able to answer most of our questions 
473590,Andreola Central Hotel, Not all rooms have a safety box that is large enough for a Mac to fit in I stayed twice in this hotel and one of the rooms had a very small safety box there is no safety box at the reception either Rooms are quite outdated breakfast lacks in variety I would not rate it as a 4 star hotel , Location is good right near the central station Free wi fi 
473591,Andreola Central Hotel, The hotel was not as smart as it appeared online and decor furnishings in the public rooms looked rather tired Multiple vases displays of artificial flowers did not enhance the lobby and lounge Even though I had asked when booking for a gluten free breakfast for the coeliac in my group this was not provided , The hotel room was very smart the wooden furniture and door was decorated with an inlay We liked the crisp bedding comfortable bed multiple lights and nice bathroom with a good shower I also enjoyed the delicious chocolate croissants at breakfast The hotel was very convenient for the metro Otherwise it took us about half an hour to walk to the Duomo 
473592,Andreola Central Hotel, The man at the reception desk when we arrived on Sunday night was extremely rude tried to charge us more for the room and then gave us a room where the A C did not work When we complained he promised to fix the A C but left his shift without doing it The nice woman who replace him gave us a new room Still I am sure there are other hotels in the area where all the reception staff is polite Go there , Location close to train station good for early train but not for a long stay as neighborhood is deserted at night
473593,Andreola Central Hotel, The staff at the reception Very unfriendly No smile didn t want to give two room keys for two adults When i requested he was like giving an attitude and without saying anything ran the second card through the machine and gave it to me without even giving an eye contact It was a look like why do you really need two cards if you are a couple Well Mr if you need to insert your room key in the slot in your room for the light to work and if one person stays in the room and the other has to go out for whatever reason they have each one needs a key one for keeping the light on in the room and the second one for the second person to enter back in the room without bothering the other person And why do you not like a guest requesting two keys Is that asking for a lot , Breakfast

473599,Andreola Central Hotel, Couldn t turn air conditioning off very noisy and didn t cool room properly in one of our rooms Faded grandeur a little tired in some areas Slow service at front desk and surprisingly the only members of staff who greeted us during our short stay were the porter at the front door and the cleaner , Close to train station Beds comfortable Mostly clean Choice at breakfast 
473600,Andreola Central Hotel, The breakfast was poor for a 4 star hotel stale croissants the cold items were not refrigerated so the yoghurts cheese were warm Too much sweet stuff on offer but not much proper food Fresh fruit saved the day Staff were polite but could have been friendlier , Super location near the metro stop We were given a free upgrade to a superior room able to park our motorbike on the pavement right outside Lovely big room bathroom old fashioned style but well cared for Comfy bed for Italy Great value for money It is very near to a superb restaurant Noblesse Oblige 
473601,Andreola Central Hotel, It smelled two days on the floor which was not very nice The breakfast was ok but not comparable to breakfast buffets in 4 star hotels in France Austria or Germany , Friendly staff good room size two beds as wished 
473602,Andreola Central Hotel, Only one spare pillow some cleanliness issues tops of dado rails and tiles in bathroom would have improved score to excellent , Staff very helpful and accommodating printed tickets and important email information for us with no charge Agreed for us to keep the room until 3pm with no extra charge Looked after baggage till time to leave free of charge Fresh fruit at breakfast good selection of food at breakfast Air con good bathroom was great lots of hot water and lovely towels Great location 
473603,Andreola Central Hotel,No Negative, Andreola is definitely the best place to stay around Centrale it s retro and traditional good breakfasts and very clean rooms The staff is a bit cold but it s been like that since 2011 when I stayed there for the first time so you can get used to it The view on good old via Scarlatti is charming It was my third stay and I still strongly recommend it 
473604,Andreola Central Hotel,No Negative, The location is perfect just a few minutes from Milano centrale train metro and bus Many restaurants within easy walking distance covering all kind of budgets The room was comfortable and spotless nice breakfast Staff friendly and helpful We had very pleasant stay will definitely stay there again

473610,Andreola Central Hotel, The bar area was suppose to be open at 5 00 for light snacks We did get service but only snack was a ham and chees sandwich on white bread Also had to leave before breakfast was available , The location to the train station was excellent 
473611,Andreola Central Hotel,No Negative, From the moment we arrived we were made to feel valued and cared for From the valet car service to the fact that we were upgraded to the most beautiful penthouse suite because it was my birthday The bed was sublime the breakfast was excellent and every single member of staff that we came into contact with was attentive and friendly nothing was too much trouble We left feeling rested revitalised and refreshed In a nutshell I would say that the comfort of this hotel is incredible but what really makes it exemplary is its exquisite care and attention to the client Auguri to the management and all the staff We hope to return very soon

473616,Andreola Central Hotel, The room was a little small despite being describe as a deluxe suite I think that the hotel can do with a little refurbishment but nothing majorly wrong Great to spend a short amount of time in A bit too far to walk to Duomo but one can always catch the train , Great location if you are aiming to travel to and from central station For instance upon returning from our trip to Venice the hotel was just opposite the station which was incredibly handy Situated in a quiet location which meant no noise disturbance Clean Breakfast staff were incredibly helpful and polite an argument to be made for employing more staff aged 50 and upwards Good places to dine around the hotel
