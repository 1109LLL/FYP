28142,Amp re, If you need a taxi there is a taxi stand by the Place Pereire 2 mn away it is quicker than the hotel ordering a taxi for you , Immaculate very comfortable nice quiet location pleasant staff lovely breakfast 
28143,Amp re,No Negative, Helpful and friendly staff close to Metro and RER stations The location is easily accessible from the Peripherique Nice room very clean and silent 
28144,Amp re,No Negative, The staff were really nice and friendly They gave us adaptors to borrow after we had forgotten ours They kindly kept our luggages during check out until later on in the day when we were ready to leave The breakfast was really lovely Our room was a good size and bathroom was modern and very clean 
28145,Amp re, Had booked room mainly because it was reasonably close to our office and promised soundproof rooms Despite closed windows traffic noise was constant making it difficult to sleep Useless night porter was unable to order me a taxi in the morning so I ended up having to search for one in the road Room was decent but small with no space for my morning yoga No gym no real restaurant no facilities Over 300 euros per night without breakfast was extortionate Never again , comfortable bed and functioning air conditioning essential as my stay coincided with a heatwave 
28146,Amp re, I asked the reception staff to order me a taxi to the Gare Nu Nord train station but when the car arrived it wasn t a taxi but a app based car such as Uber but local If I wanted that type of transport I would ve ordered it myself But since it s there I got on nevertheless The hotel rep said the trip would cost 19 euro and when we arrived the driver showed me his phone and I was shocked to see the number was 49 euro with a remark 44 minutes waiting time Of course this is a scam because I didn t make him wait for anything but since he can t speak a single English all he did was point to the bill on his phone So I paid him That s pretty much the tiny dent to the otherwise perfect stay , Excellent location just a short walk to the metro station cafes 
28147,Amp re, Maybe the wifi that disconnected from time to time , The staff was welcoming and professional They have been really helpful when needed and polite The rooms were perfectly cleaned and the beds are comfortable The shift leader has been the perfect role model for a receptionist as myself 
28148,Amp re, The breakfast was ok could have been a little more fresh , The area was very nice with some great restaurants and the metro was conveniently located just a block away It was a short metro ride to a bunch of sights and attractions The view from our balcony was great and had nice bathrobes and great linens 
28149,Amp re, Although the bathroom was very nice looking it was very poorly designed No counter space no towel bars No place to put anything As an interior designer I can say there was lots of room for improvement , Great location Very friendly staff very accommodating Beds were very comfortable 
28150,Amp re, We didn t try the breakfast as we thought the price was expensive but it may have been very good , The bed was extremely large and comfortable and the room was lovely and cool All the toiletries were l occitane and were replaced every day The room was clean and quiet The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and their English was great 
28151,Amp re, Hotel could of a had a restaurant I know they link up with the one around the corner but when we asked for room service that restaurant had run out of what we wanted , Bar area was very nice Location was decent as very close to the rer and metro station 
28152,Amp re, Breakfast is good but lack variety , Room cleanness is very good We ve stay for 5 nights and are arranged in the high floor with facing the quiet side Its price is relatively friendly in Paris The room space is quite enough for us with two open large luggage and still available space for walking in the room This hotel will be still our candidate in Paris next time 
28153,Amp re, One could always hope for more space in the room I think the large built in table consoles in rooms take up a lot of space Rooms would be more spacious without those , Nice residential neighbourhood quiet but close to main attractions Easy to move metro stop close by Nice and quiet if your windows are on the garden side Rooms are of reasonable size for Paris where hotel rooms are tiny Aircon worked fine in hot weather Breakfast pretty good Fresh juices nice pastries 
28154,Amp re, was sold a room looking on the eiffel tower but you could barely spot the very tip of it I wouldn t have cared much either way but why did they advertise it if it wasn t true , very friendly staff nice room great price it was a deal overall good experience
28155,Amp re, The information I received from the reception about reaching the hotel by metro was not up to date One of the metro lines was closed for some time and I should be given an alternative plan which I eventually figured out myself after looking at the metro map , Comfortable room sound proof walking distance to sights safe area next to metro station
28156,Amp re, Nothing, The Ampere is situated far enough out of the bustling City hub in the 17Arr but close enough to access everything by the Metro RER Bus or Cab It is very handy to good quality restaurants bistros and cafes The hotel has two wings and a central quite garden courtyard 
28157,Amp re,No Negative, It was close to several places to eat dinner and some pastry shops for breakfast Only a 20 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe The Metro was only 2 minutes walk and also the RER was available in the Metro station with bus stops on the circle It is very easy to use the public transportation It was also easy to walk to the Champs Elysees to go shopping 
28158,Amp re, Am at a loss to understand how the room we paid for could be descibed as a junior suite It had a comfortable bed with separate bath shower toilet facilities but only had one small chair and small table in the bedroom no separate sitting area unless that was the balcony which might have been fine if weather had been better Very nice coffee machine in room but twice we had to ask for coffee pods just to get one each per day , Good location and comfortable room
28159,Amp re, Communication problem with a staff person Taxi to airport Another fixed the problem in an efficient manner Gentleman at desk was a gem do not recall his name , Good location and comfortable room Good value through booking com including breakfast for 2 Staff was very friendly and helpful Good transportation options nearby 
28160,Amp re, There had to be one big bed but there were two single beds next to each other A bit disappointed , The room was clean and pleasant Nice bathroom Close to the metro station 
28161,Amp re, It is a little far from the airport but once you do it once and know how to navigate the metro its not as bad , Hotel was nice and quiet and staff was very helpful Its in a mixed neighbourhood so several mornings I walked to local bakeries or shops and they were much better priced and tasting than the touristy spots 
28162,Amp re, Obviously the internet connection Some of the stuff members were insisting that it was the device s problem although we had 2 devices but rather we found the internet connection greatly unstable and needs some improvements , the Hotel stuff were very friendly and helpful the hotel room and other common areas were very clean and matching our expectation the main advantage was the location of the hotel and its proximity to the metro station which is a 2 min walk distance we also liked the surrounding area as it is very vital lots of cafes and bakeries near by all in all it was a good choice 
28163,Amp re, Wifi didnt work all the time they tried to solve problem with some mobile ruter but didnt help annoying ventilation in room very very bad view to many doors in room that lead to nothing we asked for upper room get 1st floor maybe because we are yonug so we can slip in poor room , Location
28164,Amp re, The wifi did not work for the most part Either the signal was poor or there were too many devices online and we could not get an IP address , Breakfast was excellent with gluten free options We felt welcomed and were not rushed in any way Very relaxing stay 
28165,Amp re, No free bottled water Many hotels now do this Price in mini bar ridiculous Hair dryer only in bathroom Most hotels supply separate dryer wi fi poor , Quick check in 
28166,Amp re, the first day we arrived we had coffee tea milk powdered and sugar we drank the coffee used sugar and milk before going out for the evening when we got back to hotel that night we asked for more coffee sugar and milk We got everything but the milk stayed for three nights and never did get anymore milk that is the only thing i can complain about really Every thing else was spot on Thank you Wonderful stay ,No Positive
28167,Amp re, Stained rug Small bathroom No facecloth Too many unwanted drinks in fridge and no room for personal waterbottles The price with booking com made it a fair quality price vaue Full price for the room would have been way too excessive No breakfast or at a very high cost 19 90 , The bed wascomfy The shower was enjoyable The window and blinds were very easy to access The staff was friendly 
28168,Amp re, I liked everything about Ampere can t wait to go back and visit, The cleanliness of the rooms and also the front desk staff who was always there to help
28169,Amp re, Room a bit cramped ok this is Paris , Very good value for money Helpful staff Very clean room Proximity to Paris centre about 25 min by tube or RER stations at 5 min walking from hotel 
28170,Amp re, Front desk service was incompetent Left an item behind which the staff found but when I went to collect it they couldn t find it It took two visits and half a day wasted until they eventually tracked down the item , Good soundproofing even though it was on a main street 
28171,Amp re,No Negative, I booked a junior suite and while it wasn t huge it was absolutely lovely and had a small terrace and an unexpected view of the Eiffel Tower It was close to the metro and was only a 15Euro taxi ride from Gare du Nord inc a tip 
28172,Amp re,No Negative, The room was outstanding Location was very near metro and bus stop It was easy to find the hotel and the staff were polite and very professional I would definitely recommend this hotel 
28173,Amp re,No Negative, The staff were amazing Antony the barman was great fun and very friendly The front of house staff were also very helpful and friendly The room was great and the bed was super comfy I recommend getting breakfast while here it was perfect The metro and train station are just down the road and if you feel up for a walk the main attractions are only about a 40 min walk But most of the time we used the train and it only took around 10 mins Thanks for a great stay 
28174,Amp re,No Negative, Comfortable quiet room with free wifi Toiletries are very nice There is an Elevator and parking lot The Location is nice next to a Metro stop but it is not central 
28175,Amp re, It took us more than half an hour waiting for room to be prepared despite us arrived at 14 30 and official check in time is 14 00 We only got the room at 15 10 It was quite disappointing after tiring journey we had to wait this long in the lobby Wifi connection in the room was very bad it got disconnected every half an hour , Good location near to metro
28176,Amp re, They did not replenish the breakfast buffet for the last 45 minutes of the breakfast period and startet to close it down 15 minutes before breakfast was ended Be at breakfast at least 1 hour 9 AM before they close if you want the full spread , The hotel is very nicely redone and everything was clean and tidy We got upgraded to an exec room but my impression is that all rooms are very comfortable Traffic can be a little noisy sp go for a garden yard facing room if you are noise sensitive 
28177,Amp re, In the bedroom there was a perfume bottle sticks I ve been obliged to put it in the corridor and to open the window for a while , It s a great hotel well located kind staff comfy bed all is very clean I ve been very satisfied 
28178,Amp re, The rooms are very warm February so we had the window open all night We didn t mind the constant noise of the AC outside but maybe it s a problem for others , Nice comfy hotel quiet 
28179,Amp re, , near metro good attentive staff classic room on the smaller size but still acceptable hotel rates on expensive side if not booked on offer breakfast at 19euros is on the expensive side lots of cafes near 
28180,Amp re,No Negative, Absolute value for money A real pleasure to stay Unfortunately I arrive very late and only for 1 night but would love to stay longer at this hotel Excellent parking facility too Metro at 100m only 
28181,Amp re, the rooms we a bit too small for my liking for the money i was paying and there was not a lot of storage for suit cases , the staff were very friendly and very helpfully the location was just perfect very close to the metro and some great cafes
28182,Amp re, No restaurant in hotel which meant no room service Everything else was perfect , Staff very friendly and helpful Beds are very comfy Toiletries in bathrooms were really nice 
28183,Amp re, Was not aware that there was a city tax to pay per person at the end of the stay when you check out , Small room but clean and comfortable Good location as there is public transport nearby and many restaurants to choose from Staff were friendly and helpful 
28184,Amp re, Gin and tonic eye wateringly expensive , L Occitaine toiletries in bathroom that were replenished daily Very comfortable bed Helpful receptionist Great location near a metro station Centre of Paris easily reached 
28185,Amp re, I liked everything It would have been nice if the hotel served evening meals I will definitely return to the Hotel Ampere in the future , The hotel is very light and very welcoming Staff were very helpful in all respects The room was extremely clean and comfortable The Bar service was friendly and set in a relaxing area Breakfast was available in a very pleasant dining area with a very good range of choices Reception staff answered all questions helpfully and fully Nothing was too much trouble for them It s a good location and near the metro 
28186,Amp re, We stayed at the 7th floor and the wifi connection there was pretty bad The location is central but if I would have booked a hotel again in Paris I would have chosen something closer towards Louvre , The room was modern and fresh The beds were comfortable and the staff was super friendly and helpful We didn t have breakfast there but we were recommended to go to a Brasserie which was right next to the metro The food there was really nice 
28187,Amp re, It can be quite a long way from some areas, our check in was a pleasure and the front office staff were excellent Our bedroom was a god size and comfortable The hotel is in a nice quite area a 100 metres from Pereire Metro The room was a good size and good value for money it is the third time we have stayed here 
28188,Amp re, The hotel is in a very quiet location in the 17th district which is really nice at the end of a hectic day in Paris Alas from 15 july to end of august the RER A and C are closed and then the distance to the center and left bank becomes long by metro , We spent 4 days in an executive room which was spacious modern nicely furnished with an excellent double bed enough wardrobe place an excellent bathroom with bath AND shower seperatily a seperate WC perfect and very silent airco big flatscreen TV Breakfast was very good possibility to sit outside when weather allows it as we had Our room wasn t ready in time at our arrival 17h but this was arranged in 15 min while we enjoyed a free glass of champagne in the garden next to the bar Personnel is very kind Very close 2 min walk to metro Very quiet location silenced rooms Restaurant Le grand Bistro at 50m from hotel serves an excellent menu I can recommend hotel and restaurant to all 
28189,Amp re, My family and I are from the state no ice bucket nor ice machine felt awkward , My family and I love the area we are already thinking about staying there again The staff is very friendly and pleasant 
28190,Amp re,No Negative, Hotel is located near to the metro station with good connections to key tourist attractions Hotel provided tasty breakfast fresh and good quality products We could easily find nice restaurants in the near vicinity 
28191,Amp re, Good buffet breakfast but nearly 20 , All round an excellent hotel metro and RER stations very close by lots of bars and restaurants nearby Well appointed spacious room Free hidden safe Very helpful staff
28192,Amp re, Breakfast could provide a little more variety It was good but there s always a little more that can be offered , Front desk extremely helpful Offered umbrellas recommendations for restaurants maps excellent Would definitely book here again Nice neighborhood hotel without neighborhood feel 
28193,Amp re, The rooms are incredibly small however we were never in it Would have loved more space and a shower curtain to not get the floor soaking yet , The location was great and in a cute part of town We rented Velib bikes during our stay and there were many stations near the hotel Tones of markets and cafes around 
28194,Amp re, Tried ordering room service twice Once was too early in the day one was too late at night Kind of frustrating , Nice spacious rooms with comfortable beds Comparable to a Hilton or Marriott in the states Less than 500 feet to the Pereire metro station Bathrobes L Occitane toilettries Nice bar 
28195,Amp re, What is there not to like , Ampere is a very comfortable clean and well run hotel Staff is friendly and always eager to help It s location is very near a metro station and also has lots of wonderful eating places of different kinds The 17th is also a nice quiet area with lots of lovely buildings and not very touristy which is great 
28196,Amp re, Only one power socket worked in the room but reception helped out with a multi point adaptor , The amenities and room were excellent I loved the little details such as three sets of toiletries for the three guests so many hotels are thrifty with that The location is convenient and the breakfast was great 
28197,Amp re, One lift stopped working Our room card couldn t access the parking we had to ask for a separate card , Excellent policy around dogs Allowed us to park the car before we even checked in Friendly helpful staff on front desk 
28198,Amp re, The suite was little small , The staff were helpful we have a problem with the flight and we delay one day to arrive to Paris so I contact with hotel throw booking and they changed the dates They give us a room to pray after checkout The internet was super good Location is good it s near metro station 
28199,Amp re, Although I booked a double bedded room my bed was in fact two single beds pushed together perhaps a mattress topper covering the two mattresses would have added an element of comfort , The professional attitude of the staff the quality of the breakfast the location elegant and comfortable room 
28200,Amp re, Only thing that i didnt like is there was no toilet in the bathroom it was in an another place next to the bathroom , Cleaning of the room and the comfy of the bad were very good 
28201,Amp re, A bit difficult to control the air conditioning as the thermostat wasn t marked with the temperature but 1 2 3 etc That doesn t tell you what the baseline is so it is difficult to know at what level to set it , Good location near the metro and restaurants but not too touristy
28202,Amp re, It was a small thing really we had a nice coffee machine in the room but it used a special cartridge of coffee grounds to make the espresso They only supplied a few of the cartridges even when we asked on a couple of occasions for more they did not supply them , The location was excellent access to metro around the corner and several very good local restaurants nearby Overall staff very helpful and rooms well appointed We stayed in a junior suite which was at the back of the hotel so quiet and spacious 
28203,Amp re, Bath is small and wifi dropped out a lot but nothing major, Location is PERFECT Staff are very very friendly and even help plan your trip and give maps showing where to go and how to get there
