223999,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Our room was close to the lift we could hear some noise the room didn t have a very good view but we didn t spend that much time at the hotel so this wasn t an issue and the temperature of the room sometimes was excessively hot , Good location comfortable room recommended for families A lot of coffees and restaurants nearby good access to the metro station and buses Nice staff 
224000,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Well when we checked in the receptionist tried to upgrade us with an additional fee but we didn t agree and we found ourselves on the top floor the room was at furthest corner Maybe it I wasn t related the early situation but we felt a little bit unlucky it wasn t a big deal at all , Location location location It is very central and a bonus is the park in front of the hotel The view is very nice You can walk covent garden soho even piccadily by walk easily Rooms are comfortable and clean but there is no minibar or safe box

224004,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, We were given one of the garden rooms on the ground floor at check in Your staff member who helped us highly recommended it However in the future we will avoid such rooms as it is very dark has a small window and we could not open the curtains as being on the ground floor with the lights on everyone passing by outside would be able to look into our room , Didn t get to taste the croissants but the bed was comfortable and location superb 
224005,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Small dark room with window looking on to a wall The rooms vary considerably in size and outlook , Location on Lincolns Inn and walking distance to Covent Garden Also like the outside space which is rare for a London hotel Lovely to sit and have a coffee breakfast overlooking the square Quiet green and very little traffic

224015,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, My stay was over , The staff and coffee Your staff is what makes this place Make sure you treat them well They make all the difference from me coming back over and over again 
224016,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Booking com didn t inform the hotel that there would be 2 adults and a child staying They accommodated us but it was a bit disappointing from Booking com , Third time we ve stayed here Fabulous hotel 
224017,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The staff was not very polite except at check in Whenever I said Good morning or good evening while entering the hotel the reception staff didn t reply Also on one occasion when I asked for more details about checking out the person at the desk seemed bothered and wasn t very helpful This really surprised me and the overall impression was that they don t want guests except when cashing in , Great location rooms have a desk very convenient if you are on a business trip

224029,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields,No Negative, Asked for room on ground floor due to joint problems but on arrival manager upgraded us to a bigger room next to the lift on the 5th floor which had easier facilities for me to use
224030,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, When we arrived at the hotel one receptionist to busy and the other just talked that quick like he wanted to get rid of us, The location was very good as was bed
224031,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, There is no hotel bar where you can retreat to finish your evening after being out in London to see a show or meal The only bar is in the basement attached to a Chinese restaurant This is the only downside for an otherwise excellent hotel , Location is fantastic for London west end but also quiet 
224032,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, I didn t like that I did not get full compliment of towels every day missing face towels most days and my coffee was replaced with decaf instead of normal preventing me from enjoying coffee on a couple of days, I like the pro active customer service at checkin and the location was excellent

224038,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The room we were given was a courtyard view the view didn t bother us we were out till late and checked out the next morning so we wouldnt have spent time admiring the view even if it was stunning however the room was so noisy i did not sleep much There is a constant loud noise like the sound of air conditioning running in the courtyard all night long The room window did shut with some persuasion but the double glazing does not stop the sound If you are bothered by noise make sure you ask for a room that does not look into the courtyard , The location is excellent for the west end Holborn underground is just minutes away The hotel is clean and modern and our room a queen room was spacious and well equipped We did not use the restauraunt but it did look a nice place to eat There is a snack vending machine on the lower floor with beer gin in it which is nice

224043,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Double bed though very comfortable was too narrow for this quality of hotel , Excellent mini suite type room very well equipped modern spotless excellent quiet location and good value for money
224044,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields,No Negative, The 24 hour coffee and cookie station and the fact that they encourage you to help yourself to takeaway hot drinks and bottles of water even after you ve checked out Service was fantastic Perfect hotel for coming back to after the theatre Safe clean friendly and professional 12 o clock check out was useful too and we borrowed a hotel umbrella for our morning walk

224070,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The self service checkin system didnt work for me and then I found the member of staff patronising I got a sense that this member of staff was a bit harassed Having only 1 member of staff working at the front desk appeared to cause problems around the service that was required Checking out was much more pleasant , Bed was very comfortable the location was perfect for my needs

224076,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Breakfast Quite a confusing way of separating the breakfast and the cost for each segment It could have been much better for the guests as well as the Hotel personnel if a buffet type is available with all products and a single cost as in most hotels Reception the old traditional reception style is making us feel more comfortable when it comes to a hotel , The location was great as well as the hotel facilities Room space for the room we had was good but please note this was not the standard room which we knew that it is relatively small

224091,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, We arrived just before midday so enquired whether it was possible to check in early which it was but only with a hefty 40 surcharge the receptionist did not tell us of this amount just put it through my credit card , Ideally situated for Covent Garden and close to Central Line underground Our room was somewhere toward the back of the hotel and very quiet The hotel faces Lincolns Inn Fields a delightful green space surrounded by a road which is all but traffic free Staff were friendly and helpful Room was a reasonable size with a table and comfortable seating a sort of mini sofa around the table Excellent bathroom with spacious shower A bonus is the comfortable guests lounge just off the foyer with a modern wall mounted fireplace ample seating and complimentary tea coffee and biscuits 
224092,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, I like a coffee as soon as I wake but not enough in the room and no spoons to stir your drinks minor compared to what you can get in the lobby but I don t want to go down at 5am to get a coffee , Free coffee in the lounge area with free snacks through the day I e Fruit in the morning mixed nuts peanuts lollies or seeds in the afternoon and nachos and olives in the evening with soft drinks 
224093,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The only negative was when I came to blow dry my hair I had to stand as there was no chair to sit on also as Iam a hairdresser my hairdryer is powerful and as I was standing drying my hair the dust that flew off the top of the wardrobe was unbelievable it covered all our clothes on the bed so I don t think it had been dusted for a very long time so maybe the housekeeping needs to be addressed , The hotel was ideal for our short stay would book again ideally situated for Covent garden a very pleasant hotel

224097,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, There was a coffee bean in front of the microwave throughout our stay It must have been there when the previous guest occupied the room It always bothered me but I was out all day so there was just no time to talk to the staff about it Honestly i just presumed hoped that it would be removed when the room would be cleaned But since that didn t happen I think the room was dirtier than it looked , They have an unlimited supply of coffee for their guests fro proper coffee machines which is amazing They kept our bag for us for a charge of 2 50 for 3 days after departure This was helpful as we were going for a trip to Scotland and carrying and extra suitcase would be strenuous Although the receptionist had first told us that it was okay to keep the suitcase but at check out the other receptionist refused to keep it On requesting the manager we could keep suitcase in the hotel at the extra charge So there is poor communication between the staff 
224098,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Breakfast isn t included but considering the hotel s location and standard of quality of decor this is not entirely unreasonable And you can book breakfast as an add on for a reasonable fee, Location Layout decor staff facilities in the room
224099,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Glass bathroom door not at all soundproof which gave little privacy while in the bathroom The hotel was very difficult to find and didn t come up on the driver s GPS which involved us driving round and round in circles before having to get out and walk there as the road to it was closed which probably caused the GPS problem , The room was pleasant and the staff were helpful The shower was fantastic I liked the back entrance opening on to Kingsway It was only a very short walk to the Tube station

224169,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, We had some issues with checking in as we were not recognized in the system and the hotel was fully booked In the end a solution was found fortunately , Very central location perfect to visit various sites and very close to the underground Decent room with sufficient amount of space and reasonable price for London standards 
224170,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, We got up late yet were not put under pressure to check out , Arrived early hours of morning yet front desk guy could not have been more helpful and accommodating We had coffee free and drinks and relaxed after a stressful journey 
224171,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, decor and furniture a little dated rooms very hot, Water stations on each floor Easy access to tea and coffee Efficient and friendly check in and check out Easy to rent room for business meeting
224172,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Nothing that matters , Incredibly helpful staff particularly having arrived from Australia after a 26 hour trip and booking in earlier than check in time We were given the option of an interim room to rest and shower this really made all the difference to our outlook for the rest of the stay Also the staff didn t know this but one of my children is epileptic episodes often triggered by tiredness sleep deprivation so being offered a room to eat within was a real luxury 
224173,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The hotel is very comfy and in a convenient location Just a nit picking thing the towels have an acidic smell which is common in other hotels , The hotel has a drink machine in the corridor and provides water bottles next to it 
224174,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The room is facing the lift lobby a bit noisy when other guests talk while waiting for the lift The triple room is spacious but the window is very small and facing the back staircase So the room does not have much natural light not mentioning the view , The location is great It takes about five minutes to reach the tube station The outdoor seats provide a leisured ambiance for leisured gathering The tea and coffee provided downstairs are also good 
224175,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The room was more of a 3 stars standard rather than 4 pricy one as it appears in the web beds were not comfatable cheap very soft and small matrasses The bathroom was very minimum , location was excellent and so is the Lobby with a great coffeee machine soft drinks and fruits free of charge 
224176,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, It was expensive but it was central London , Loved the hotel snack bar in reception latte anytime we wanted it along with time appropriate snacks what a lovely touch 
224177,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The bed was a bit too soft for my liking Woke up a bit sore in the morning , Brilliant place very short walk to Covent Garden and facing a quiet park 
224178,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The staff weren t the friendliest but they were efficient , The location was fantastic It was close to a tube station and there were plenty of cafes restaurants and bars close by The room was well set up and comfortable 
224179,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, No restaurant was open for room service I wasn t told when booking or on check in that the restaurant wasn t open due to not being busy enough I paid for a superior queen room upgrade and was only given a standard double bed which was a very cheap rock hard mattress If I wasn t completely shattered and working in the building next door then I wouldn t have stayed there and travelled home to the other side of London , Clean
224180,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, We thought the breakfast pricing was a bit confusing and a bit of a rip off, The Room was very nice everything you could want from a room and the hotel was in a good location
224181,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, We stayed in room 221 and the window opens to a wall thus no natural light can ever enter the room It is always night we luckily only had to stay there for 2 nights and were most of the time out thus were not bothered to ask for a change But in any case hotels of this class and charging these money should not even offer such rooms, Good location nice bed clean
224182,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Nothing at all, Excellent location The metro nearby 200 meters only and resturant shops are nearby also Very speed wifi Comfortable and clean bed Over all excellent
224183,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, First room allocated smelled of smoke Room changed with no fuss Would prefer a bath Very male business decor A bit disappointing in terms of eecor, Attentive staff Cooled water with bottles
224184,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Didn t like leaving so soon , Very helpful and friendly staff Arrived early to leave bags and go out sightseeing but was very surprised to be shown to our room although it was only 9am not 3pm as stipulated what a treat Will stay here again for certain 
224185,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Hotel restaurant food choices were limited but still tasty A little pricey , Very close to a tube stop Holborn Queen superior room was huge Lots of space to unload luggage and relax Staff allowed us to checkin early AND checkout late at 2PM instead of 12PM In room coffee was provided and restocked everyday First time getting to hotel was interesting because all the streets around the park are actually Lincoln Inn Fields road rather than just one of them We walked around the whole park on accident before we found the hotel oops 
224186,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, I cannot fault the hotel , The staff were so friendly and even though I arrived at noon 3pm check in they managed to make my room available by 1 30 There is a pop up restaurant which has just opened in the basement and the owner was kind enough to let me have a drink whilst I was waiting for my room even though they weren t officially open The room was fantastic huge bed sofa bed large TV spotless bathroom fridge and food prep area The location is very quiet despite being a stone s throw from busy main roads Close to the British Museum 
224187,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Nothing to complain about , Great location near the most interesting part of London The staff is friendly e ready to help The building is nicely renovated 
224188,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Nothing , Location was perfect very close to covent garden holborn tube station basically everywhere There was a park in front of the hotel which makes the view perfect Room was good not too small for london s standarts It was clean and comfortable We didn t take breakfast that s why no comment for that 
224189,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, No mini bar in the room but that s a very minor detail, The hotel is well appointed and in a great location for the London sights The double glazing is quite effective in keeping out the traffic noise but saying that if your on the front of the hotel this isn t an issue the hotel is a 3 minute walk from the central line and a 12 minute walk from Covent garden The restaurant looks good if a little expensive but there are lots of places close by to suit most pockets 
224190,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Not clear about dining in options Room a bit dark very little natural light, Location Nice touches I e yoga mats delivered free to room if requested iPads available for use etc
224191,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Personal preference but bed was a bit small for two very soft mattress with a dip in the middle Breakfast available 10 95 for continental buffet a bit more for cooked but when the bill was presented 12 5 had been added for a service charge even though there had been no staff interaction except to say good morning and a space was then left to add an additional tip I m not averse to tipping but thought that was a bit ridiculous Plenty of other options nearby , Attractive hotel in a really good location Close to underground and 10 mins walk to Covent Garden Hotel spotlessly clean Good bathroom Nice open seating area out in front 
224192,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, I am sure coffee could be better Possibly better fresher beans and effort to flush the coffee machine twice a day will make all the difference in the coffee, Special reference to Ishor and Angelo who received us We had a bit of a proble in getting the first night rooms They handled the situation very well 
224193,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The staff were very unhelpful room was too warm and the hotel extremely loud with people shouting at all hours of the morning , cleanliness of the room

224200,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, No hairdryer in the bathroom and no plug at all made curling my hair awkward , Great location close to Holborn tube station many theaters restaurants and Covent Garden Our room was huge by London standards and spotlessly clean Very quiet even though it was close to so many things

224205,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, No bath which I hadn t expected and no shower hat either so had to go unwashed as no time to spare to dry my hair between finishing work and going out again A shower hat was supplied by next morning thankfully Then after checking out I was challenged by a separate member of staff for having had breakfast I hadn t and said so I had been nowhere near the breakfast room so I don t know why she said this The woman didn t say more but did not apologise for what amounted to a loudly public and entirely unjustified allegation of bilking and this episode left a very unpleasant impression of what was otherwise a nice hotel We were heading for Fleet River Bakery where we had an excellent breakfast , Smart and comfortable 
224206,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields,No Negative, The location was amazing so close to everything but in a quiet London square Staff were really helpful and the free wifi in all areas was a welcome change Would definitely stay here again

224228,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Breakfast was a little disappointing continental breakfast area was cleared away before my partner has time to select all that he wanted to eat He was given some extra cheese although it was curled and dried around the edges I had the cooked breakfast which was just ok but not hot or worth the extra cost , Great stay and very comfortable clean rooms would stay again and definitely recommend to friends Rooms were cosy and fab toiletries provided chilled water machine outside the bedroom was a nice touch A great place to stay if going to the theatre all within walking distance

224231,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The bar area is a continuation of the dining room , The best thing about this hotel is its location opposite a small park but within strolling distance of Covent Garden and Leicester Square and other central London attractions 
224232,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, When entering the hotel and getting the information we needed we tried to use the elevator but had to be told by another guest how to use it aswell as guessing what floor we were on as this information was not told to us There was no where with a plug and a mirror in the same place to do my hair and make up Our room was opposite the lifts which were in use all night they could clearly be heard from the room along with any passers by with trolleys from employees or just passing guests throughout the night The sheets felt and sounded like crunching paper the pillows and bed were rock solid the bed was to high up for myself and I am a young healthy female so I couldn t imagine what it would be like for people shorter then myself or not as athletic so along with the noise we did not get a much sleep I could not get from the bed to anywhere without having to fully climb over the bed as it was to close to the wall to walk round At 9am employee tried to get into our room which my partner was at the time using the shower so I had to shut the door to stop them coming in I was NOT impressed as we had to be out the room at 12 so what ever they needed could of just waited The room did not seem private at all To add to this the bathroom door was next to the top part of the bed which I felt was not the most hygienic place as you could step 2 paces and there was the toilet seat It should of been opposite the bed or just a little further away When we booked the room it stated an iron would be in the room but it wasn t The pictures that were on the room when booking were obviously much bigger rooms Free WiFi Where There was nothing around the hotel or in the room about it so we did not want to ask If you can help it don t stay in room 311 , The staff were friendly on arrival The hotel looked pleasent from outside and throughout the front entrance The hotel was secure as you had to use your room keys to use the lift

224258,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, shower curtain was a bit terrible looked extremely cheap and after using the shower water was all over the floor Quilt was very heavy But the biggest disappointment was the fact that air conditioning was very loud and even when set on lowest level it was blowing very hard and I couldn t turn it off cos I would turn off heating as well and winter in London is not warm at all , it s set very close to underground station some bars restaurants and shops Staff was very nice my request for room on upper floor was fulfilled All in all we were happy

224262,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The receptionist although helpful and service minded did tend to look at his mobile phone a bit to often when standing in the reception area I can understand the need to check it every once in a while when alone at work but being more subtle discreet about it would be nice as it does send a signal of not being present and available , Location and ameneties

224686,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, There could be better sound proofing as we heard people talking in the corridor when we were in bed but it wasn t excessive There was not enough milk provided in the room , The location was fabulous The bed was very comfy The free coffee biscuits and fruit was very good Touch screen check in and out was good The terrace was lovely The staff were all lovely 
224687,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The hotel bar was poorly signed and difficult to find Located at the rear of the hotel at basement level when the sun terrace where you would want to have drinks is right at the front of the hotel , Very comfortable bed Good facilities in the room 
224688,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The bathroom door is a sliding glass door which is not great for privacy Also our room did not have a safe We had a room to the back facing a wall offering no view at all and only indirect access to daylight This wasnt t a problem for our short stay as we were mostly outisde and they did offer us a chance to try to change rooms later , Great location and very functional setting with free water bottles and coffee cookies at the lobby

224690,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, The staff could have communicated a little better concerning a couple of perks there were water bottles and fresh water to fill them with on each floor There was complimentary coffee and tea in a small area behind the reception counter that was not really noticeable but we were not told about it until our last day there , We really liked the location of the hotel We were close to the Holborn Tube station and there were numerous restaurants in the area We walked to the British Museum Our room was very comfortable and attractive We did not eat at the restaurant downstairs but we had no trouble finding breakfast places nearby 
224691,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Nothing , The staff were lovely the hotel room and bed were so comfy The location was superb and meant we could walk everywhere within 20 mins which on a sunny weekend was fabulous I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again in an instant

224693,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Price of the room could be a little cheaper maybe but in all had such a great time i don t really have anything to complain about , Was very surprised I was allowed in my room when I arrived at just after 10am that s got to be the earliest check in I ve ever had Great for dropping off heavy luggage so I didn t have to drag them round London ideal for an over night stay and really nice to have seating outside especially in such lovely weather Good walking distance to shops Covent garden and theatres Good little touch to have bottles ready to fill with water on tap instead of sitting in the rooms 
224694,Club Quarters Hotel Lincoln s Inn Fields, Nothing really had a great weekend Nothing not to like Oh sorry my Son ordered food on his return to his room he had burger and chips and put it on my bill Not your fault except he said he couldn t pay as the rooms were on my card Hey Ho that s life , It was our wedding anniversary and we had an upgrade room a bottle of wine and basket of goodies accompanied by a card lovely touch It was very private the staff were available but never in your face tea and coffee making facilities to help yourself a good extra and water on tap outside rooms perfect Didn t have breakfast but will do next time Lincolns in field is a lovely area aim for the seven star pub the cat with the ruff around its neck And we were lucky enough to catch the naked cyclists parade Went to the theatre had a ball
