40419,Le Grey Hotel, Bedroom was slightly small but very comfortable and clean, Staff were very helpful friendly courteous Hotel in nice quiet area but close to Montmetre Free coffee and croissant available in afternoon and evenings
40420,Le Grey Hotel,No Negative, The hotel style was modern tasty decorated and clean Amenities in room well thought to modern living Bathroom was wonderful with tub and window to the sky Staff was kind and doing best to fill wishes The room was space with the nicest view of Paris roofs Short distance to Montmartre with the vibrant cafe life We will for sure stay here next time in Paris 
40421,Le Grey Hotel, The breakfast buffet could be richer for the value and a lot more so most of the food goes round particularly at weekend when most people usually have a late start, The rooms are modern and clean the wifi is excellent
40422,Le Grey Hotel, Would of liked sky TV for sport, Nice clean well decorated rooms Excellent choice at breakfast Very friendly staff who couldn t do enough for you Hotel was in a great location making it easy to get around the city and see and do everything we wanted 12pm check out was good 
40423,Le Grey Hotel, The thermostat did not seem to be working properly as I could not cool the room down and ended up having to open the french doors which allowed cigarette smoke from neighbors to enter the room , Staff was exceptionally helpful My room 11 was very quiet and extremely clean 
40424,Le Grey Hotel, Everything was more than satisfying, Nicely decorated Great staff friendly and efficient Nice buffet breakfast Location is good quiet neighborhood close to two metro stations Liege and Clichy Not far from Europa station 
40425,Le Grey Hotel, Nothing I did not like, The location of the hotel is fantastic In the centre of Paris and yet so quiet The hotel and the room have a cozy feel and the balcony is just excellent 
40426,Le Grey Hotel, An alarm went off in the middle of the night inside my room It was both terrifying and annoying I don t think I m likely to stay there again ,No Positive
40427,Le Grey Hotel, wi fi connection and speed were very poor I had to use my own roaming data The room i got was very small and packed up just barely fit in our two suitcases, Room was very clean and tidy sound proof is alright Staff were very professional Free coffee and tea in the mini bar Excellent location safe environment 
40428,Le Grey Hotel,No Negative, Great quiet hotel central location Clean well maintained and above all staff were attentive and helpful I needed to stay till lunchtime till my meeting and they found me a space to work and made sure I had coffee quiet and comfort 
40429,Le Grey Hotel, Could not connect to wifi due to too many users My deluxe double room was much smaller than shown in the booking photos but was comfortable, Easy transport good location good value for money staff were attentive
40430,Le Grey Hotel, Be careful the airport shuttle is not at the hotel You have to walk to Opera to get it Only one bag of tea or herbal tea for two was a little disappointed , Staff very friendly close to St Lazare station and metro and nice restaurants around
40431,Le Grey Hotel, the boiling water jug had a loose lid and it poured all over my hand causing a quite uncomfortable burn as I had to drop the cup The rooms were hot and stuffy, Beds were comfy and the price was very good The staff were amazing
40432,Le Grey Hotel, It was futher away from the main attractions like the eiffel tower etc , I liked the atmosphere of the hotel from arrival until checkout it was a very comfortable experience The breakfast was filling and tasty Staff were accomodating and helpful when any requests were made I would definitely recommend this hotel 
40433,Le Grey Hotel,No Negative, Very nicely renovated hotel in trendy colors comfortable lobby excellent staff in a very quiet satreet and in walking distance to major Paris attractions 
40434,Le Grey Hotel, Location was not great The hotel was much smaller than I thought and the room was tiny but it s Paris after all Overall all it was ok We only stayed one night ,No Positive
40435,Le Grey Hotel, The Delux room isn t too big I guess that s true for most Paris hotels the desk wasn t really big enough to properly work on , The room is very nice and clean comfortable bed and the shower is amazing 
40436,Le Grey Hotel, Nothing i didn t like, The staff made us feel welcome and special and they upgraded us to a room with a large terrace and decorated the bed with rose petals as it was our wedding night They recommended a restaurant that was still open when we arrived late Nothing was too much trouble Breakfast was very good 
40437,Le Grey Hotel, Just a suggestion The rooms could do with an iron and ironing board perhaps I requested both and they were promptly delivered Guests should be aware of the general taxes that apply in ALL hotels in Paris and not be shocked However Le Grey breaks down your bill for you on an invoice you get at checkin , The location is perfect especially for a short stay Unpretentiously boutique small and very comfortable and clean The staff are all amazingly friendly and accommodating The rooms are very well thought out given their sizes There are 2 train stations close by a supermarket and several local eateries Great hotel I will be back 
40438,Le Grey Hotel, WiFi connection wasn t ok, Nice location Small rooms but it seems common in Paris Great price value combination In general everything was good except WiFi 
40439,Le Grey Hotel,No Negative, The bed in the executive room was super comfy and the staff were lovely They gave us their hoest opinion when we asked them a question Great Metro links too
40440,Le Grey Hotel, A far way out of the city good links to train and metro but you need public transport to go anywhere , Location to two metro stops on line 13 ideal for travel into major spots Staff lovely bakery right on the corner really nice Value for money good if you book ahead on booking com Not quite 4 if you are being picky but some nice touches like free tea and pastry down stairs in the afternoon We loved it be careful of down town Moulin Rouge can get a bit seedy

40442,Le Grey Hotel, On my last morning checked out at 6am paid the staff member an English gentleman approx 1000 for my stay asked for a cup of coffee before I caught a taxi to the station only to be told I would have to pay for it It was a coffee pod machine He obviously has never heard of customer service ,No Positive
