444657,Arthotel ANA Prime, my room was just above the garden where guests could smoke so I couldn t really keep my windows open, the hotel is just in the middle of gay area walking distance to a metro station 3 5 mins walking distance to the centre 20 mins good value for that money rich breakfast nice fancy interiors 
444658,Arthotel ANA Prime, The location of the hotel is not bad since it has various good restaurants close to it but if you want to walk to Vienne centre is it quit far Although there is subway station one block away , Clean and comfortable room Friendly staff A really nice self service expreso coffee machine available 24 7 at the lobby 
444659,Arthotel ANA Prime, No real suggestions as the hotel adequately covered all of my needs , Perfectly good value for money great location with plenty of good restaurants nearby but only two stops away from the city centre Good breakfast to suit all tastes 
444660,Arthotel ANA Prime, I expected a little more in regard to the condition of the room furniture and bedding towels and linens A very slight refresh of those would bring this hotel to excellence Despite the above I definitely recommend it , Very good and professional service and lovely personnel Excellent coffee The room was very spacious and clean Cheapest mini bar I have ever seen 
444661,Arthotel ANA Prime, Room temperature was hard to set with the air con controller it didint seem very accurate , Nice and cozy hotel Coffee machine and nice quiet inner ward was great 
444662,Arthotel ANA Prime, Breakfast could have been a little better , The bed was very comfortable and the staff was very nice and helpful The room was a good size too Only about 2 blocks from the U Bahn 
444663,Arthotel ANA Prime, Worst hotel in the world dont go, I am there twice for month I did a reservation i did a mistake i did two reservations Booking was agree to cancel the hotel not for me this hotel is dead 
444664,Arthotel ANA Prime, I m not sure if this hotel deserves 4stars The name of the hotel was different on the building than on booking com I booked 2 days before arriving It was confusing and made it hard to find The mattress with springs was incredibly bad not comfy at all As the matter of fact it was painful to lay on it I could hardly sleep a few hours And one of the springs were even higher than the rest A 4star hotels should never provide a mattress like this The breakfast was poor I expected much better The place for the breakfast is small maybe that is why the choice was limited I didn t like this hotel I m not coming back , I liked that they offered a 24h parking option with a discount in a garage not in the building The hotel seemed to be nicely renovated They gave us a special parking ticket for the time of checking in The location was good it is about 1km from Mariahilferstrasse on foot 
444665,Arthotel ANA Prime, Availability of ice was not convenient I had to go down to the front desk with a glass to get enough ice for a drink in my room , The breakfast provided in the lobby each morning was outstanding It was also very convenient to have the coffee machine available 24 hrs each day 
444666,Arthotel ANA Prime, The hotel is 4 stars and for such money other hotels offer a sauna here it is not The room with the windows in the patio seems to be better but in fact if the some company is resting there it becomes noisy and all the smoke rises in the windows , I spent 8 nights at the hotel so liked almost everything Excellent location close to metro and easy to reach all sights For those who like hiking you can easily get to the two train stations and the shopping Mariahilfer Stra e The staff at the hotel is wonderful friendly executive with a great sense of humor Regarding hotel fiches a good coffee machine in the lobby Enjoy m lange and other varieties all 24 hours a day and relax in the courtyard The hotel has 3 4 bicycles in excellent condition I strongly advise you to take it it s free and for any amount of time Good and quite rich breakfast even for a week and I a bit tired of monotony For a business single trip my double room was acceptable although the single room seems to be a little cramped 
444667,Arthotel ANA Prime, I only spent a night and I did not pick up anything that I disliked Perhaps making the breakfast more diverse a bit would be a thing to focus on , Extremely helpful and polite staff Among the best I ve seen in the city 
444668,Arthotel ANA Prime, Would have liked to be a little closer to the centre of town About a 15 min walk but ok to do by metro Tickets cost 2 20 each , Coffee available in foyer 24 7 Helpful staff Street was quiet at night Close to the metro 
444669,Arthotel ANA Prime, Nothing , The hotel is about a 5 min walk from the subway Very clean rooms quite modern in style Excellent breakfast as well Some very fine restaurants within walking distance The parking we were given there is about three blocks down from the hotel which you open with a remote that is given to you by the front desk person Very convenient Overall an excellent hotel 
444670,Arthotel ANA Prime, All good, Pleasant and helpful staff Beds comfortable and air conditioning appreciated during the hot weather Lemon water in reception and free coffee tea 24 hours greatly appreciated Rooms quiet No Road noise or noise from other guests Would recommend to anyone 
444671,Arthotel ANA Prime,No Negative, Great hotel with super friendly personnel and good coffee available 24 7 It s nearby the Naschmarkt and all siteseeing buildings are only a 20 minute walk away I especially liked the atmosphere and the beautiful terrace in the middle 
444672,Arthotel ANA Prime, The quality of the breakfast could be improved In addition there is not enough room in the breakfast area for all guests I had to wait both days to be seated The room was quite but very dark facing the small courtyard and with the emergeny stairs in front , The hotel is well located next to the metro station The hotel is clean and the room comfortable Hotel personnel was very helpful 
444673,Arthotel ANA Prime, Private parking is not really private It is standard public parking located about 1km from hotel about 10 min walk In my room 1st floor there was a smell of all breakfast dishes in the morning ,No Positive

444675,Arthotel ANA Prime,No Negative, clean tidy good location front office staff very helpful the gentleman with 9 languages dinner recommendations great close to metro Naschmarkt breakfast great eggs homemade fast service endless choices of coffee plus filter coffee cookies offered as well 
444676,Arthotel ANA Prime, The air from A C had an improper odour Impossible to use It was 30 degree outside and 27 in the room 5 minutes from metro station In 10 15 minutes you will reach Zoo and Schonbrun by metro , Nearby walking distance you will find Naschmarket Margaretenhof the house where Schubert was born the Acquarium etc Free excellent caffe all day long a beautiful silent interior court and good beds A lot of cosy restaurants in the vicinity 
444677,Arthotel ANA Prime, The beds in our room were really uncomfortable surprisingly for a 4 hotel It is impossible to avoid spilling lots of water on the floor in the bathroom as there are no doors in the shower cabin Cleaners never wiped those puddles on the floor and never replenished paper tissues in the bathroom , The property has very nice breakfast and a lovely cosy terrace 
444678,Arthotel ANA Prime, I am a single in a double bed but I am given a singleduvet Surely it doesn t cost more to wash either I am used to a double bed , The reception staff were helpful and friendly 
444679,Arthotel ANA Prime, The private parking is not really close The first day and night the air conditioning was not working and it was really hot in the room The next day it was fixed Else was ok , Everything was more or less fine 
444680,Arthotel ANA Prime, relatively ho temperature in the room when you wnat to open the window a bit criody street surprisingly parking in the garage 5min walk distance but this is general problem in Viena , very good location close to metro and market there is a lot of restaurants by food distance Good breakfast not so many spacees but we did not have a problem to sit every morning 
444681,Arthotel ANA Prime, Parking was located like at 10 min from the hotel, Coffee machine is open 24 7 and free of charge Nice breakfast and rooms were very good size and comfortable
444682,Arthotel ANA Prime, Nothing , There are some nice restaurtants to visit around the hotel We stayed there for 3D2N with 2 boys 10 13 year old and We were tired after long time walking in the town then we tried to find the restaurants near the hotel Waldviertlerhof is a nice traditonal local restaurant with 2min walk from the hotel Motto is a fashionable restaurant where is fully booked by local people in front of the hotel Besides there are other choinces like cafes etc The rooms are nothing to complain We really relaxed there after our fatigue with going around the town Staffs are friendly and kind Coffee in breakfast is nice 
444683,Arthotel ANA Prime, During breakfast time there was a situation that we could not find place to sit it is usually crouded between 09 00 and 10 00 so we had to wait with children bigger place for breakfast needed, Room was very clean We have been on the ground floor and we had direct access to the small terrase whiuch was very conveniant for us being with childern we could let them outside All hotell stuff includined cleaning laidies were very kind 
444684,Arthotel ANA Prime, The location is not quite convenient because you have to walk from the U bahn around 300 meters But the u station is direct through Wien Mitte which is a big station , They have complimentary coffee all day The breakfast is fine Service is good for boutique hotel 
444685,Arthotel ANA Prime,No Negative, Location was really good for getting into city centre and tourist sites Five mins walk from Underground station Hotel breakfast was included in our accommodation and there was a good choice for all tastes Staff were friendly and helpful 
444686,Arthotel ANA Prime, the toilet roll in the bathroom could have been located in a better place had to squash myself between that and the sink very uncomfortable bruised elbow on few occasions, we were given room 112 on the first floor which was huge and had its own decking and seating area 
444687,Arthotel ANA Prime, The shower is in the same space of the bathroom than the toilets Once you took a shower the floor is covered with soap and water It might be modern and covenient to clean but you have to walk in water to use the toilets then Breakfast is ok but I saw much better in simpliest hotels guest houses Moreover the beakfast room is just the space at the entrance next to reception Not easy to move between the tables and quite noisy , Free tea and coffee 24 hours by the reception 
444688,Arthotel ANA Prime, Can t think of anything I didn t like met my needs in every way , The hotel was perfect for our stay in Vienna A short train ride from the city center and priced just right The breakfast was delicious nice coffee machine The rooms were spacious and comfortable and the staff was very helpful Would come back in a heart beat
444689,Arthotel ANA Prime, Paid for breakfast for four mornings but had to miss two times due to lack of seats and tables One stage about 10 people were waiting I do not recommend this hotel if you don t have enough time in the morning , Nice room and friendly staff
444690,Arthotel ANA Prime, Average breakfast more hot options would have been nice Inconsistent room cleaning service had to call reception one day to exchange used towels for new ones because room was not done , Quiet location Public transportation within 5 min Truly queen size not 2 twins pushed together comfortable bed Spacious modern bathroom
444691,Arthotel ANA Prime, we arrived and we did not have the room we booked so they placed us in a horrible little room someone entered my room at 7 30Am to this moment no one replied to me or gave me an excusse What a lack of professionalism why would 2 people from the staff enter my room unannounced if I was clearly inside the room who does that and what if i was not awake since i was unable to sleep in that horrible room what would happen what would have happend if i did not caught them sneaking into my room The room was located on the 4th floor and I could smell the breakfast it was horrible How is it possible that you can smell the breakfast at the4th floor The room was noisy the walls were dirty we felt like omg like we were crashing in someone s couch as a favor But we actually paid for a service we did not received They gave us what they may call superior room on the 2nd floor what is was probably the room we should get and guess what the shower did not work and we reach out to them an no one came to help us saturday night and i had to experience this kind of lack of care and service this property completely failed to provide BTW and the heat temperature was broken In order to breathe we needed to open the window how awful is this The amount of stress and annoyance given was beyond anything They promissed to give us a complementary proseco never got anything Staff was basically hopeless Absolutely no one has give us any compensation or anything at all We exchanged rooms 3 x This is unacceptable and btw this is not even close to a 4 hotel Also they have room service as a described facility and guess what They do not have this lady of the front desk told me straight and also told me she could not do anything to assist us that this is what we get well let me tell you I utterly regret it it was the WORST experience one can have Also the breakfast is basically the same every day , well located

444704,Arthotel ANA Prime, room was incredibly warm Breakfast was low quality even though choices were good Location not close to public transport , Good and fast wifi we had the option of adding a bed nice bathroom
444705,Arthotel ANA Prime,No Negative, I simply loved my stay here Everything went beyond my expectations The room was very clean and tidy and the bed was great The location is perfect I never used the subway to move around I really enjoy walking though The hotel is 5 minutes away from the biggest food market of Vienna Naschmarkt Finally they provide FREE coffee cappuccinos milk hot chocolate or whatever hot drink you like I would really recommend this place if you plan to stay in Vienna Next time I visit Vienna I ll definitely stay there 
444706,Arthotel ANA Prime, the carpets in the room were dirsty there are some design mistakes like the door of the room and the bathroom and also the shower cabin etc the curtains were quite dirty, Nice neighborhood very close to Naschmarket and also within walking distance to Karlsplatz Free tea coffee the whole day You can make any type of coffee and there s a good selection of tea Breakfast was average but filling The bedsheets were clean and the bed was comfortable also the towels 
444707,Arthotel ANA Prime, No divider for the shower sink and toilet bowl When u take a shower the water doesnt go down immediately resulting in the build up of water inside the toilet , Free coffee tea and hot choco anytime of the day Near the metro They have left luggage option as we checked out in the morning and our flight is still in the evening Very spacious room Modern building 
444708,Arthotel ANA Prime, The breakfast area is too small so every morning we had to wait until a table would free up Parking garage is 3 streets away Noisy AC, Comfortable and clean good location nice staff
444709,Arthotel ANA Prime, Late checkout was not taken into account by staff in spite of being Booking com genius member The breakfast lounge was so tiny that we had to wait long queues every morning, The room was very quiet Bed and pillows were comfortable

444711,Arthotel ANA Prime, The bed is not so comfortable and the additional bed for the third person should be much better, coffee and tea machine is always awailable and free Room is clean and very nice
444712,Arthotel ANA Prime, Quite expensive location but somehow a cosy place , The beds were truly very comfortable Together with the quiet surrounding a place where you can gain peaceful sleep in the center of a wonderful city Well designed and elegant rooms 
444713,Arthotel ANA Prime, No tea or coffee making facilities in the room although you can go down to the bar and get some Very crowded at breakfast time not enough tables , Very clean and modern 
444714,Arthotel ANA Prime, Breakfastroom is too small sink in the bathroom smelled TV didn t work, Free coffee in the reception hall during the whole day close to subway station nice and helpful staff
444715,Arthotel ANA Prime, I believe that this is not a 4 stars hotel or not the room we ve received The bathroom had worn finishes or swollen water the ventilation was broken Without sound isulation both inside and outside More near the windows it feels very cold from outside I had to put some pillos on windows to keep warm Very very few tv channels I think maximum 12 The breakfast was terrible cheap preparation no taste rotten fruits nothing gourmet Parking you don t have even the posibility to find at least one free parking space in front of the hotel when you arrive We are not able to take your lugages in a normal way You have to carry on them from where you succes to park your car And you can park for free only for 15 min but this only in the case that you ask and you receive from the reception a paper wich allows you it After those 15 min you have to pay every 2 hours and this means that you have to come back at your car every 2 hours starting 7 00 18 00 PM Every 2 hours some guys from the City Hall comes and gives fines So the best way is to keep your car in the paid garages I ll not recommend , Only the location 15 min walk to the city center or 5 min to metro station But the location is not everything

444721,Arthotel ANA Prime, To add one more door in the shower so the water couldn t get abroad But its not so critical Also I would like to have a bigger towerls and a possibility to have a hotel shampoo without sls , Coffe machine on the reception the hot chocolate is perfect and the acess is unlimitted 
444722,Arthotel ANA Prime, The breakfast was not topped up And it was cold My husband couldn t get a bigger duvet or extra covers He is tall and the duvet provided was tiny , The staff were helpful 
444723,Arthotel ANA Prime, The breakfast was poor value for money and certainly not of the quality last time I stayed there One day there was no orange juice left and the breakfast staff just shrugged her shoulders I had to complain to the the manager on the front desk who then provided me with a small jug of Oj which he was probably keeping for himself , The room was clean and spacious with good wifi signal The hotel was conveniently located close to a metro station in a quieter part of town 
444724,Arthotel ANA Prime, The bathroom sink countertop was made out of a laminated pressed board material that falls apart when it get s wet Looks nasty needs to be replaced , Location staff interior design
444725,Arthotel ANA Prime, Room decor was a bit to the cheap side Water staines on the carpet from a bathroom leak Bathroom shower cubical design not great Water spashes everywhere , Liked the size of the room Staff were friendly too Location was convenient 
444726,Arthotel ANA Prime, Nothing, We had a terrible experience in the nearby hotel Papageno where we were refused of stay even though we had a reservation made 2 months in advance The staff of La Prima Fashion Hotel Vienna was very friendly We had a free upgrade to a better room The hotel was very clean conveniently located near metro station which is 2 stops away from Vienna center quiet Great breakfast 
444727,Arthotel ANA Prime, Could you put electric hot water pots in the room Water on the floor from the showers remains a challenge , Rooms though on the small side are very nice We had a very quiet private room on the courtyard side Hotel is close to the Pilgramgasse Metro station for getting around easily We found the staff extremely helpful Breakfast is good 
444728,Arthotel ANA Prime, When pre paying with cash at the reception desk I was asked for a 50 Eur guarantee returned at check out My room was located at the roof level with external access via a passing way only a pvc glass door with curtain between sleeping room and exterior A persistent bad smell in the bathroom of my room for the whole 3 nights stay signaled to reception but not really solved , Good location Good breakfast 
444729,Arthotel ANA Prime, Since the drainage is poor I could not use the shower I was surprised to hear drainage sound from the next room Capacity of private garage is very poor max 2 cars Public garage is 10 minutes on foot , Nothing special

444736,Arthotel ANA Prime, Parking situation wasnt really comfortable but in a centre of Vienna it was probably the best they could do , Breakfast was tasty and whole hotel included personal was pretty good I would recomand it 
444737,Arthotel ANA Prime, I didn t like that there was no sticker on the juice and milk containers to indicate content I didn t also like that I had to call for milk the two times I had breakfast there It is either the present milk containers are replaced with bigger ones or the staff in charge should be more vigilant in the future, The friendly staff The cleanliness and proximity to public transportation Breakfast was good too 
444738,Arthotel ANA Prime, We were given a small single bedroom for two people that had one set of everything pillows etc It was just for one night and we were too tired to complain, Clean room Nice breakfast 
444739,Arthotel ANA Prime, As previously said by other guests the shower doesn t have a door or curtain which makes the bathroom a mess but the fact that they clean daily makes it bearable And I find the price of the breakfast too high considering the price paid for the room breakfast included would be nice , We really liked the hotel and everything was great during our stay The location is very good the rooms were nice and comfortable and the staff very kind and helpful We would definitely book the same hotel if coming back to Vienna 
444740,Arthotel ANA Prime, I was only in Vienna for two whole days and since I slept in on both days I did not have much time to find much wrong Oh I would have liked to have a coffee pot and some coffee in the room , The desk attendant I wish I would have had her write down her name but it may have been Aneeka was amazing in her cheerfulness and willingness to help I was not in a great mood when I arrived at the hotel since Air France had lost my luggage I was delayed from waiting in lines at the airport to fill out the necessary paperwork fro lost luggage As I checked in I inquired about any place to eat nearby since it was already getting late and she recommended an nearby Italian restaurant and gave me a coupon for a free dessert The dinner was great next day she happily informed me that my luggage had arrived from it s unplanned vacation sadly she was not there when I checked out but this hotel would do well to keep her on staff In fact I suggest that they give her a pay raise 
444741,Arthotel ANA Prime, 4 star hotel does not have restaurant to serve breakfast They serve it at lobby Very small tight place dirty tables 4 apples from days ago only one single banana 5 single grapes Waited 20 min for hot water to have r Tea no air ventilation in the bathroom Very small bedroom Food smelly corridors during cooking They ask your credit as a guarantee for room and mini bar No trust to the customer I would not stay there again , Comy bed location
444742,Arthotel ANA Prime, The hallways seemed to be a little too dark at times to feel safe but the hotel was very safe , The staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful especially with dining and site seeing recommendations I was in Vienna mostly for holiday but some business so the highly reliable and fast wifi system was excellent The morning breakfast was more than sufficient to start each day well

444749,Arthotel ANA Prime, Breakfast could be better There s plenty but the quality in general and of desserts and breads specifically could be higher it s Vienna after all The coffee at breakfast was terrible Linens Bed covers were a bit small even by European standards and the towels are a bit three starry , Staff was efficient and kind rooms very clean location is excellent U4 Pilgramgasse is three minutes nice restaurants nearby Margareten and Naschmarkt are right there and it is reasonably priced Quiet and restful The little interior Hof is a nice place for a break
444750,Arthotel ANA Prime, For a 4 hotel we would have expected not to have to pay for ALL extras in the room a complimentary bottle of water would have been appreciated , Located very close to Naschmarkt 2 minutes from Pilgrimgasse U Bahn so easy access to other areas Staff were incredibly accommodating and enabled us to check in to our room 90mins early without question

444758,Arthotel ANA Prime, I don t understand how it can be a 4 star hotel given the lack of facilities No pool No gym The air conditioning was faulty I couldn t sleep because it becoming very hot inside the room After complaining to the receptionist they send a handy man a day later He too says it s very hot Thinks it s a faulty switch or something but says he can t do anything and switches off the system At least it won t be hot he says and leaves Couldn t sleep well in all the days I stayed there , Great Location Breakfast good value if booked in advance 
444759,Arthotel ANA Prime, The hotel is a bit far 30 min walk to the city centre but there is a metro station 5 min away , The room and bathroom are quite modern Beds are very comfortable Breakfast was good but I would ve like to see more fresh fruit 
444760,Arthotel ANA Prime, Although the breakfast was good and varied I wouldn t bother if I stayed here again you would need a huge appetite first thing in the morning to get your money s worth , Bed was really firm and comfortable even though facing the road outside it was really quiet with the windows closed 
444761,Arthotel ANA Prime, Would appreciate if there are tea coffee making facilities in the room, Breakfast was excellent and staff very friendly Comfortable room and always clean Very quiet and could rest after a long day at the Congress 
444762,Arthotel ANA Prime,No Negative, Employees were very helpful and all of them spoke English The room decor is modern and very spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable Our room was over looking the street but you cannot hear any noises Hotel was very well located to those who want to take the underground or travel by bus but we opted to walk since we had nice weather and it s only around 20 min walk to the center Would recommend to anyone who is visiting Vienna 
444763,Arthotel ANA Prime, Limited variety of breakfast It was like a bed and breakfast rather than a hotel No facilities at all No tea making in rooms, No tea facilities in room Very limited variety of breakfast
444764,Arthotel ANA Prime, Price only includes room Everything else is extra including coffee and tea Even no kettle inside the room and cup of tea is 2 EUR Room is not really big just ok , Good location very clean and modern nice staff 
444765,Arthotel ANA Prime, Price only includes room Everything else is extra including coffee and tea Even no kettle inside the room and cup of tea is 2 EUR Room is not really big just ok , Good location very clean and modern nice staff 
444766,Arthotel ANA Prime, A little bit far from center but easier to get to Metro The breakfast hasn t many possibilities, It s a very well designed space with a clean room The bath room is very good Wifi works OK and without many stops comparing to other hotels 
444767,Arthotel ANA Prime, Couldn t check in early even though requested before arrival, Great location for the U bahn Pilgramgasse a few minutes walk away Great location overall Rooms were very clean Curtains are thick enough to block out daylight Windows kept the noise out so we slept brilliantly
444768,Arthotel ANA Prime,No Negative, We are definitely coming back Hotel was lovely great value for the money the location is very very close to the centre We are complitely satisfied with our stay We definitely recommend it 
444769,Arthotel ANA Prime, The bedroom was well ordered but smelly smoke although it was a no smoking room Breakfast is possible until 11 a m but if you arrive at 10 55 you will not receive even a coffee , Location very close to Venceslao square and the quality of breakfast 
444770,Arthotel ANA Prime, the hotel was full and was not easy to get breakfast electric kettle was missing in the room, staff was very helpfull location is very close to public service tram metro 
444771,Arthotel ANA Prime, No coffee tea kettle in the room I had to go downstairs to get a coffee tea at reception late in the evening , Helpful and friendly staff bright and very clean rooms very modern and located a short bus ride from centre of town and other attractions
444772,Arthotel ANA Prime, Some facilities like a kettle would be very convenient , Spacious warm and clean room Next to metro station very close to city center Friendly neighboorhood 
444773,Arthotel ANA Prime, The hotel cannot be classified as a 4 star hotel in my opinion Breakfast is served in the hotel entry way and the space is rather crammed the food was not bad but little varied When we entered the room they gave us it was quite a surprise when we realised the room was already occupied since there was luggage in it I find this unacceptable The rooms is too small and simple for the hotel s 4 classification , Close to the city center 
444774,Arthotel ANA Prime, Non professional staff asking for re pay for fully paid room reffering to a far and non 24 7 parking no room service technical problem with room electricity , Location value for money Interiour design 
444775,Arthotel ANA Prime, Cramped breakfast area The hotel is equipped and feels like a tiny 3 star Nothing 4 star about this place Reception staff has not yet learned how to smile Its a service business you re in for pete s sake Staff is also minimal Issue with room that had to be fixed Hardly any water pressure in shower No free water in room No kettle to heat water for coffee or tea Thin and small towels , Nice breakfast and waiter in breakfast area
444776,Arthotel ANA Prime, Room size is quite small Doors need better sound insulation as conversations in the corridors are very audible Bar cafe area could have more welcoming decor , Staff were friendly and efficient Bathroom was very modern with an excellent large shower stall Good bed linen and pillows Lots of bars and restaurants nearby
444777,Arthotel ANA Prime, Room was a little on the small side and the towels could have been newer and fluffier , Location was good handy for the underground and the Naschmarkt which is brilliant for food and drink was within easy walking distance Breakfast was good and plenty of it 
444778,Arthotel ANA Prime,No Negative, everything was really ok maybe I would have liked to have a slightly warmer room but it is absolutely fine my stay was short but very comfortable
444779,Arthotel ANA Prime,No Negative, 5 minutes from the U Bahn this was on a very quiet street next to several cafes and shops Good sized room very comfortable beds and a decent breakfast Will look to re book of I go back to the city 
444780,Arthotel ANA Prime, Furniture in bedroom was a bit too minimalist i e not many drawers or cupboards if you are staying longer than a couple of days I m not a fan of wet rooms in the bathroom , Good location Decent breakfasts Wifi OK in room 
444781,Arthotel ANA Prime, The rooms are very small Breakfast is served in the hotel entrance, Clean rooms perfect and free wifi Close to metro station in quiet areas Just 8 10 min walk from actual centre
444782,Arthotel ANA Prime, Air conditioner wasn t working well, Close to metro station Clean comfortable The room with special bathroom and balcony was great with no extra payment 
444783,Arthotel ANA Prime, The bathroom smelt terrible because of the savarage the parking lot was far from the hotel 15 euros per night about 10 minutes of walking by feet it is terrible if you have luggage and if you park the car in front of the hotel the police blocks it immediatly you only have 15 mins when checking in and if you run out of them you may pay a bi amend Also the breakfast was not fresh I believe that the croissants weren t changed every morning but when eaten by the guests also there was no meat except some cheap crenwurst and a little salami we went to breakfast atabout 9 in the morning so we didnt catch any we havent seen any bacon and the water wasnt good for being consumed it seemed like it was from the sink because of the chlorine smell The rooms had dirty walls and two holes There wasnt any painting on the walls not even on the hall of the hotel We took photos but we cant post them here it was like sanatory ironically the name is La Prima Fashion The bathroom smell cant be expressed in words but after taking a bath in a 4 stars hotel from Budapest we were trying to avoid the bathroom The staff was ok but cold with us like we were talking to robots All in all we have to say that the price service raport was totally not ok , We didnt like anything in particular 
444784,Arthotel ANA Prime, Couldn t get the air conditioning temperature right compared to other hotels The hairdryer in the bathroom didn t work Delivered the iron to the wrong room but blamed us for giving them the wrong number which wasn t correct Room was on the side or a very busy noisy road in the morning , Good location Nice spacious room Lovely terrace to eat breakfast in the morning
444785,Arthotel ANA Prime, I have nothing to say here Everything was great the staff was helpful but could be more friendly Smiles are always welcome , Great location lots of restaurants and shops in this area plenty of tasty asian food around 20 30 mins walk or 2 tram stops to the main square or to the Belvedere residence Spacious and clean room good for couples with small children who needs some space equipped with a minibar coffee machine and everything needed for comfortable stay A C was a relief because it was 34C outside Very good free WiFi decent breakfast We were travelling by car there s no private parking in the hotel but you can park the car on the street and buy parking tickets at the reception but pay attention to the signs there are some lots reserved for police and disabled people By the way the parking is free of charge on the weekend Generally I would recommend this hotel for all travellers 
444786,Arthotel ANA Prime, I don t have anything to complain about , The location of the hotel is ok you can get to Karlsplatz in a 20 min walk Also there are a lot of shops and restaurants in the area The hotel personnel is very kind and helpful Breakfast was ok with a decent variety of food The room was very nice and clean The bathroom was also very good with clean sanitary objects and towels TV also works fine and internet is decent 
444787,Arthotel ANA Prime, Breakfast was not 4 level but good House keeping should be ready by 13 00 Check that all bulbs in room are in order as some were not working , Good location just two stops away from centre Very good a c as it was very hot at the time in Vienna Nice and modern hotel with very helpful staff at reception Excellent wifi 
444788,Arthotel ANA Prime, None, Traveled with family excellent value for money friendly staff a c works great excellent breakfast Will definitely choose again for short term stay 
444789,Arthotel ANA Prime, The walls in our room were dirty and scribbled with a pen and something was tipped behind the table One of the bulbs was burnt out From the begening the staff seemed to be not so proffesional We had an opportunity to hear about everything related with serving breakfast but when I asked if the breakfast is included the receptionist finally decided to read my reservation so she could discover that our reservation didn t include any breakfast When we later informed that the walls in our room were dirty they said only that we wouldn t have to pay for this damage and that everything was fine it was quite funny but pathetic at the same time Moreover we declared the early check out we had to catch the train During the check out when we had already left our hotel cards back and asked for the permission to go the receptionist told us with the angry voice that we didn t pay the city tax so we had to stay there Coudn t they really charge me during the check in or even ealier because it was the advance paid booking , Only bed 
444790,Arthotel ANA Prime, The shower was not very clean Some of the reception staff were not very helpful , Location is within a short subway ride from the city center where most of the tourist attraction are located Good breakfast Room is good size 
444791,Arthotel ANA Prime, The computer at the reception is too slow in case someone doesn t want to use the free WiFi the bathroom was very modern but rather smelly of humidity the installation of a shower curtain as well as of a practical way to open the ceiling window are highly recommended , They gave us a quiet room as we requested sumptuous breakfast very polite and helpful staff modern and comfortable room great location away from the city centre madness but close to metro while bus stop right in front of the hotel supermarket bakeries close by air conditioning
