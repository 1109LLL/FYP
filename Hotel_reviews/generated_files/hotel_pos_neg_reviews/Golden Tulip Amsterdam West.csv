379680,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was no fridge to put food in there was a small vending machine in the room but it wasn t working unfortunately , Food options were good mixture of hot and cold Location is good easy enough to get to central Quiet neighbourhood Staff were good friendly Room was good too view was okay There s a computer check in which can be tricky to use but staff were there to help out 
379681,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Restaurant in the hotel could be better other than that great hotel , Great place Just a quick taxi ride to the main city Awesome hotel with helpful staff Very clean and free wifi A C Only bad part was the restaurant in the hotel very poor service and pretty gross food
379682,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Lights in the room weren t in the right place to read at night Staff weren t noticeable , Quiet bedroom really well soundproofed Proximity to public transport tram 12 stop right in front of hotel Free and easy to access wifi 
379683,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The check in and check out is all automated which decreases the contact with the staff Even though there was a mini bar no beverages were available , Good price for money considering the hotel prices in Amsterdam walking distance from the Amsterdam Sloterdijk train station comfortable bedroom
379684,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The extra charges for staying past 12 pm on check out Not considering I had a 1 year old with us and we checked in on 22nd July which was around 8pm Staff was not helpful, The location of the tram stop
379685,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel staff were very unwelcoming upon arrival No one informed us that the hotel did not accept cash so when we went to pay with euros we got declined by the hotel staff and they wasnt appologetic in the slightest ,No Positive
379686,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Long way from the city centre As taxis are very expensive we took the number 22 bus from the square outside the Amsterdam Central train station Beds were hard with outdated innerspring mattresses There was a dispenser fridge in our room that you were not able to open use to store fresh milk for tea or cold water , That it was only 1 tram stop from Sloterdijk train station to be able to catch the train to Schiphol airport Staff were very pleasant helpful 
379687,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Hassle free Check in and Check out procedure Hotel staff was helpful Rooms were clean Close to Amsterdam Stoderdijk station and right opposite to Molenwerf Amsterdam Tram stop Takes approx 20 min to Amsterdam Central by Tram 
379688,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel DID not have a bar working as stated in the booking on this site the mini bar was not stocked with anything and the shower door we had was on last hinge and broke, friendly staff
379689,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, although right by the tram this was not the best way to and from the airport, Bike rentals available at the hotel Right on the tram line to get to museum district and historic center Across from a nice park
379690,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only thing that We did not like about our room was the way the curtains hung as they left a large gap down the window which in turn left an awful lot of light in so we were unable to sleep propably , The hotel was just what we wanted Next to the trams so this enabled us to access the centre together with returning back to the railway station for our connection to the airport
379691,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No alcohol served here although there are bars and pubs nearby We ate at the restaurant and had a wonderful server but the food was not very good and pretty expensive Breakfast was good but at 17 50 each is overpriced We had to move rooms twice because of a heavy smell of natural gas or butane on that side of the building The staff moved us quickly each time and all staff was kind and professional about moving us Small drawbacks and we would still stay again , The best reason to stay here is that we drove our car in had an easy place to park in a protected garage and could take the tram which stops directly in front of the hotel into center of Amsterdam within 10 15 minutes 
379692,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Cleaning Staff disturbed me 2 times a day while I still was in the room and I even selected Do not disturb , nice location clean rooms good facilities They tidied up my room even though I left the room at like 4pm which I was very happy about 
379693,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Coffee machine in good working order and a bit quieter room, Location was good We have used tram to travel to city centre We found room a bit noisy as our room was situated on ground floor by main street and pedestrian crossing Staff was very friendly and helpful We were disappointed that our coffee machine was not working 
379694,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel isn t honest on its website You are led to believe they serve alcohol but in fact they lost their licence in 2015 And instead of being honest when we asked why they don t serve any they lied to our face Told us the fridge in our room wasn t working so we was unable to have a beer from the fridge Although it s a non alcoholic beer anyways The bed is uncomfortable and solid as a rock and the pillows is awful I wouldn t class it as a pillow in fact maybe half a pillow I wouldn t stay here again I feel as if I was shafted with the money I spend for just 4 nights , There wasn t much I did like Only thing that was decent was the night guard He always asked if we had a nice day and was very friendly and chatty towards us 
379695,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The hotel and the service were lovely The hotel however was a long way out of town It was costly by taxi The transit was great if you are comfortable with new adventures There were not a lot of places to eat nearby The hotel has some food service but does not serve alcohol There is a park right near that hotel that is wonderful to walk in We really loved it 
379696,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Self checkin confusing was double charged for breakfast Ground floor room very noisy Very limited choice for kids menu in the restaurant, Spacious quadruple room with 4 twin beds Convenient public transport to the centre Parking at the location Great buffet at breakfast Wide selection
379697,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I find its parking a little bit expensive 15 euro per day , Tram station for line 12 is just a few steps away Easy to reach the center Room and WC are clean tidy Check in and out really easy with computers Approachful staff 
379698,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Needs a gym Breakfast should be better value Check in was terrible we had to wait over 45 mins it was quiet with only one other person checking in as it s all self service and the machines weren t working If you are going to replace people with machines make sure they work and if not don t leave people waiting so long to figure it out , Overall the hotel is comfortable lacking a gym fitness suite which is surprising for a hotel of this standard Breakfast had a good selection but overpriced 
379699,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel s furniture is a bit dated It s a very large place with lots of tourists, Really liked the bike rental from the hotel it was easy to go to the Central Station about a 15min ride through a park 
379700,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I am putting this in the section don t like but that s not to say that I didn t like the location but that you should be aware this is not downtown It does sit on a tram line literally across the street so access to Amsterdam was fast and easy Also because it was away from downtown a little bit it was quiet when you came home , The staff was very friendly and helpful The rooms were nice and clean Bikes were available so we could ride around Amsterdam Easy access to a couple of great restaurants a short walk away 
379701,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Male walking into our room on our first morning after knocking and not waiting for a response Appalling and after complaining to the hotel all they have done is apologise Not acceptable Will not be staying again Also the breakfast was 17 50 euros each which we declined Ive paid less than that everywhere in the world we have stayed at ,No Positive
379702,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, My only small gripe is that I ordered two double rooms and got two rooms with twin beds pushed together and single duvets , The tram stop is directly outside the hotel giving easy access to the centre some great and very reasonable priced eateries within a short walking distance The reception staff were extremely helpful and welcoming Underground car park was excellent and very reasonably priced at 15 euros per day 
379703,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room cleaning was approssimative out bed smelled distinctly of cigarette although we were in a no smoking room bathroom average clean and dust was accumulating Reading light on the bed side were very very poor we have to ask for additional lamps ,No Positive
379704,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Hotel doesnt serve alcohol The bedding was not changed on my bed make up stains on pillow cases Vending machine is REALLY expensive 2 50 for a small bottle of water, The staff were really friendly and the tram was situated right outside the hotel Easy to get to from airport Room does look like the online pictures Nice standard of rooms They provide toiletries shampoo shower gel etc so you dont have to worry about taking them through customs this is handy if you have a flight with hand luggage only Nice coffee machine in room 
379705,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Outside view of hotel does it no justice Very little in the immediate area around the hotel Paying 18 for a bicycle rental should be much cheaper or complimentary , Absolutely can t beat location to the Tram stop that gives you access to anywhere Clean and Posh hotel 
379706,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We were promised a room at early check in however when we got there we were not granted this We were kept waiting for at least an hour until a room came up Early check in should be available , The bathroom was nice as was the bedroom overall The hotel was clean and tidy all around Staff were helpful and made sure we weren t waiting around too long to check into a room 
379707,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The coffee in the machine , I liked the fact that our room looked exactly like it did on the picture Very low level of noise Extremely comfortable bed 
379708,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, That when I booked it said I would pay at the property then I got another email to pay the full price and if I didn t pay it would cancel my trip, The room was lovely and nice bathroom
379709,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Booked a double bed however we ended up with 2 single beds pushed together , It was close to the town centre and the tram was outside the hotel Easy access 
379710,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I was planning to pay cash but when I reached there they said they only accept credit cards , The manual check in and check out Lovely neighborhood less than a minute walk for the tram 
379711,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, I liked the fact is was easy to get to and wasn t far from amsterdam centraal Literally 10 mins by tram and train sprinter Rooms were clean and modern The shower was gorgeous I wish i could take it with me 
379712,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The WiFi was mostly not working and when it was it was not stable Given that I was there for business this impacted me negatively Also the Nespresso machine did not work all the time The mini bar never worked The room service always got something wrong on both times that I ordered dinner in my room , The breakfast was quite good and the people taking care of making the omelettes extra friedly They could also give me gluten free bread since I am intolerant to wheat
379713,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Checking in was self service so not personal , The hotel is great but you need some knowledge of how to get there easily use tram or taxi initially and then speak to reception for advice as they are so helpful 
379714,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The stuff was helpful friendly and always smiling especially one girl from the front desk unfortunately I forgot her name she has blond hair that was extremely helpful and did everything to make us feel better after an unpleasant situation with one of her colleague The breakfast was rich and amazingly tasty totally worth the money Rooms are very big and clean beds are super comfy Location is a bit far from the center but it didn t bother us It s quite easy to get there 
379715,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The hotel is located far from city center in very quiet area 10 mins walk and you are in the big station to get any kind of transportation outside of Amsterdam 
379716,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Guests can t be invited for a coffee or breakfast Even when paid other people can t access the hotel I had to cancel s business breakfast duecto that non sense reason There is no alcohol served at the bar restaurant Probably the hotel should be recommended as Only for muslims , Location near the office where I had to go for work
379717,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Bit out of town but easy to travel in and out by tram as stop right outside hotel Clean modern rooms brilliant showers Would rather of had standard pillows on bed rather than square ones Reception staff very friendly and helpful Wish we d had time to use restaurants and more local bars and cafes 
379718,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, You had to pay for every little thing, The room was great and roomy The pillows were flat but that s a european thing There was no fridge in the room just a vending machine which didn t work
379719,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The rooms are really dark and quiet dated could do with brighter colours in the room The bed sheets where hard however the bathroom was nice I personally wouldnt stay again, The bathroom
379720,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing , We liked staying just outside the city tram service right outside the hotel was excellent Trams ran every 10 minutes We walked to hotel from train station took less than 10 minutes Staff very helpful welcoming Breakfast excellent 
379721,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, bed not comfy at all and pillows were more like cusions and very uncomfortable not central at all and room much smaller than i expected for the price i payed i wouldn t go back to that hotel , liked the decor of the hotel but apart from that it lacked in comfort and space in the rooms which is where you spend all of your time so it didn t do it for me 
379722,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A kettle in the room will be better , I like everything in the room The computer provided at the ground floor helps a lot The tram stop is just a few steps from the hotel My child love the room so much 
379723,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Electronic check in system was rather tiresome, Well kept clean pleasant interiors free Wi Fi friendly and helpful staff Good public transport a tram stop in front of the hotel makes it easy to get to the central part of the city some 10 15 minutes drive Good value for money higher quality and cheaper than comparable hotels in more central location of Amsterdam 
379724,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No mirror at the dressing table and beds quite close to the dressing table so not much room for maneouvre , The receptionist on arrival gave excellent service recommended the 24 hour tram pass provided all maps and spoke perfect English
379725,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Lack of coffee No double bed had to push both beds together and it was meant to be a double bed room Lack of English translation on the TV Didn t get enough clean towels when the room was cleaned , The staff were excellent and very friendly with my coffee needs Room was amazing Room was cleaned every day and was done well I can not complain about my stay at the Golden Tulip Defiantly coming back soon 
379726,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, no alcohol policy is a little disappointment , Very comfortable bed Clean and nice Safe and quiet area Easy access to the public transport We enjoyed our stay 
379727,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, no complaints, outside didn t look much but inside it was beautiful with good attentive staff automated check in seemed unnecessary as everybody seemed to need help but it was efficiently dealt with excellent breakfast parking looked secure and felt safe little walk to train station but pleasant area and surprisingly quiet as near major road links Excellent well done 
379728,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Only one full length mirror in the room which was placed in the darkest part of the room with no light No fridge in room , Everything was great Lovely staff Easy check in and out system 
379729,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We could not get wifi hook up in our room only downstairs in the lobby or in the breakfast area , The breakfast buffet offered was exceptional A tram stop into the city is immediately outside the hotel 
379730,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, When I asked for a double sheet to put on the bed so that the two single beds wouldn t move a man knocked on the door and just handed me the sheet and walked away I shouldn t have had to put the sheet on the bed myself Other than that everything else was great , The room was clean and really nice The bed was so comfy And the shower was brillaint The people at the reception where very friendly and helpful Really nice hotel Would defiantly stay there again 
379731,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No liquor license for alcohol was a problem as many of us wanted to have a goodbye drink with alcohol We did go to a location nearby to do that , Front desk staff was very helpful We had paid for 13 tickets to the and Frank has for her family and lost all correspondence and receipts for the tickets Front office staff volunteered to help us contact and Frankie s and get tickets emailed Huge help to us 
379732,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, All good just 10 min by bus to inner city of Amsterdam , Staff at reception was great Beds very comfi and room nice and spacious Great shower Close to main train station bus stops opposite hotel Very convenient 
379733,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Great staff very helpful Great location with access to tram right outside the hotel door Spacious room We booked a triple but were upgraded to a quadruple on arrival 
379734,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It was a little far from the city center You will feel it more when you are on veeds , It is 20 minutes by train from the city center The rokm service and cleanness is perfect It has a very nice nesperso machine in the room Good bathroom with body lotion and etc A good safe box and also a great view Very close to the tram station 15m 
379735,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, For being a 4 star hotel it wasn t anything special The bed sheets were rough and the king size bed had full sized coverings so hubby and I were pulling for covers back and forth all night Glad we only stay one night ,No Positive
379736,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No alcohol on sale This didn t really spoil it for me but I didn t read the small print until after I booked It s so unusual and I think you need to ponder if this will spoil your fun , The room was modern clean and well serviced and secure The breakfast was generous with lots of choice so very good value 
379737,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The room was bright thanks to Big windows The bathroom was big clean and comfortable Everything makes you at ease The position is a bit far from the centre but the tram stop is exactly in front of the hotel and there are many kind of options for the tram tickets The place is really worth the effort 
379738,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Carpets in the room It was clean and new but I do not like carpets , The staff is so kind and the check in and check out process too easy Also the fact that there is a tram station just in front of the hotel 
379739,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was no fridge in the room but a sort of mini drinks dispencer which I assume would add the items to your hotel bill if you used it , Accommodation close to the centre of Amsterdam is really expensive and this is an option that is affordable in comparison and has easy connection to the city centre The tram stop is in front of the hotel Self check in and check out 24hr 48hr tram tickets can be bought from the dispencer in the hotel lobby Nespresso coffee machine in the room with 4x pods but no milk just creamer Good sized bathroom 
379740,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, This is a dry venue which was not made obvious when booking A serious flaw in the booking process It should be writ large when a hotel goes so heavily against the norm , Quality of room shower a c 
379741,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, After checking by email before we traveled we were told we would be able to check in early and drop our bags After arriving at the hotel and having to speak to 4 different members of staff we were told this was not allowed The reception staff were very rude The showers were cold all weekend we were told that the hotel boiler couldn t cope at peak times The hotel didn t serve any alcohol They had a new digital check in system that didn t work , The hotel was clean and modern and a good distance from the sprinter train The tram stop into Amsterdam was right outside the door 
379742,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No breakfast included in our stay Having little clear information on how the tram network works and how to get to certain attractions via tram , It was quiet and relaxing 
379743,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was only one tram line outside the hotel so most of the times a connection with another tram line was needed , Very comfortable room The breakfast was amazing although at the very high price of 17 5 euros 
379744,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Not a pretty area but that didn t matter we weren t after a boutique hotel , Hotel was clean efficient functional and easy to get to Would definitely recommend it 
379745,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel had no hot water for 2 days the first day I reported the problem and waiting 3 hours for them to resolve he problem which never got resolved I then had to have a cold shower as I was lossing my holiday time the following morning the same problem not hot water again the people on the desk were not help full at all everyone I spoke to gave me a different answer to there problem I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Amsterdam you would get better service else we re don t waste ur time or money on this hotel Rude staff and no hot water , Worst trip I ve ever had to Amsterdam I ve stayed in over 20 hotels in the city and never had such a bad time as when I stayed here 
379746,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We had waited about half an hour in a que to get checked in The room we booked with a double bed and two single beds but they gave us two single beds pushed together with single bed duvet and cushions put into pillow cases The bathroom was not clean toilet seat and shower had water marks on it also no bath , That the tram stop was just outside the hotel
379747,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel was very bad internet a couple of days did not work at all It was reported that there were technical lining It is very strange that in the hotel lobby in the restaurant there is no alcohol not even beer or wine On foot the center is far away This must be understood when ordering this hotel There is nowhere to go for a walk but actually in Amsterdam there is a place to take a walk , Very good hotel Stopped in this network more than once and never regretted it Large rooms everything you need is there Nearby there are always a taxi Responsive staff 
379748,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Doesn t apply We loved everything , Everything was perfect Too bad we didn t make plans to stay longer We look forward to visit your lovely and hospitable country again to see all the beautiful things we were not able to see and will sure stay at your hotel 
379749,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing , The bed was very comfortable Modern spacious clean bathroom with good toiletries Quiet room Good to have a coffee maker in the room Although the breakfast was extra there was a very good choice 
379750,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It s a non alcohol hotel so you have to bring your own wine beer etc , The breakfast is amazing and the location is perfect There is a tram stop right in front of the hotel and it s only an 8 minute walk to the Amsterdam Sloterdijk station My room was clean and the service was excellent 
379751,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, The best thing about this hotel is the staff very kind very communicative very friendly always smile and ready to help and give you direction in the city The receptionists were great as well as the breakfast team The location is great as it is outside centre but tram ride away the tram is right outside the property I really liked the hotel and the kids loved it 
379752,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Couldn t fault it , Great facilities hairdryer iron board U K Plug point and USB ports to charge phone Room and bathroom were spacious and immaculate Room was cleaned and coffee tea restocked everyday Hotel was quiet and staff very helpful Would definitely stay again highly recommend 
379753,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No wifi while I was there for some reason and no drinks licence so no wine with dinner Definitely not a European feel Middle Eastern influence No explanation given This would put me off recommending it , Clean quiet comfortable and pleasant friendly staff
379754,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing we are very happy with everything , It s really comfortable bed and a good size of room between bed and bathroom The breakfast are excellent and plenty of options All the staffs are friendly and helpful Very good transports to Amsterdam 
379755,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Restarant prices too high, It an excellent hotel Staff provides a good customer service it is very clean updated quiet comfortable and modern facilities The location is excelent with a tram stop right outside the hotel with excellent conection to the city center 
379756,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Both my boyfriend and I thought that the breakfast prices was a bit ridiculous the food in the hotel overall was quite expensive and is not all that great at all We ate out almost every day although there were not many restaurants around either unless you travelled into the centre which is not always ideal I did not like how the hotel doesn t accept cash and in our case they did not accept our Debit cards either as they only accept Credit cards The facilities in the room were very mediocre The hairdryer was not powerful and when we attempted to iron our clothes the Iron was leaking lots of water and the ironing board was broken We did however notify the front desk and they supplied a new one , Very friendly and accommodating staff They were extremely chatty helpful and very welcoming to us We arrived earlier than the check in time but to our great surprise the room was ready for us which made two tired travellers very happy The hotel is ideally located right beside the tram stop which was excellent to access the city and the airport It is also right beside a beautiful large park where you can cycle walk in and the hotel rents out bikes I would highly recommend renting the bikes and cycling in the park it was one of our holiday favourites Also liked the Nespresso machine in the bedroom The room itself was nice really liked the shower and bathroom The TV has English Channels which is always an advantage Non drug policy and no smoking in the rooms is a big plus considering it is in Amsterdam Rooms are sound proof and there was no noise in the hallways or from any other rooms Lidl is also only around the corner 
379757,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, We stayed here for 1 night before joining a river cruise ship The hotel was fine a bit out of the way if you were staying for a few days having said that the tram stopped right outside The breakfast at 17 euros each seemed a little pricey so we didn t have that so can t comment on it 
379758,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Some alcohol in the bar Other than that it was really nice although we didnt use the restaurant, Great hotel nice facilities the staff were all really friendly The only thing that let the hotel down was the bar that sold no alcohol Easy to get to Dam We want to go back to Amsterdam and would not hesitate to book this hotel 
379759,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel is outdated Bed was not properly put back to place after sheet change First entering the room it smelled as if not opened for quite a while, Right next to Tram Station and 1 stop from Railway Station
379760,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The internet was down our entire time there It was very stressful as we couldn t plan or check on reservations or anything , The room for four was exactly what we needed for four adults traveling together The restaurant staff were friendly and the food was good No alcohol is a bit annoying though 
379761,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Wi Fi signal was not available for two days and nights due to issues with their internet provider but everything else ok, On the main tramline into Amsterdam and the room was nice clean and comfortable Staff were very helpful breakfast was very good and plentiful although quite pricey it would suit a big breakfast eater 
379762,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was no wifi for our 2 night stay which was a disappointment as we had brought an ipad to watch movies in the evenings It also meant we couldn t check online for where to find the best of anything We used our Amsterdam book instead although this wasn t ideal as it was old There is no restaurant or shops near the hotel so we had to take 2 trams into the main city to eat although the hotel does offer dinner I am told that they used to offer a dinner buffet but this was not the case when we stayed at the end of May 2017 After the first night the room was cleaned but the coffee and tea was not replenished We ordered room service entrec te beef which was delicious and cheese pizzas which were not that great didnt seem fresh , We were a group of one adult and two teenagers We followed the directions on the website from the airport to the hotel catching a train which was so easy We were going to catch a tram for one stop but decided to walk the 8 mins straight road to the hotel and this was fun and meant we got to see Amsterdam straight from the station The room we had was a triple which was large and the shower room was modern clean and with plenty of towels and toiletries The staff could have been a bit more helpful as I had to ask for a map and details of how to use the trams and buses After prompting they were accommodating Great selection at the buffet breakfast which had something for everyone and an egg station where you could choose what you wanted to be made fresh 
379763,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, the down sides are only the tram switching and a little fair out should u choose to be in the centre past midnight till early hours not the hotels fault it is where it is x, Was given a larger room for stay longer Room and hotel great have stayed before and would again
379764,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Hotel Parking is a bit overpriced you d think paying alt that money for a room you d get free parking , Very Update Hotel room great shower tram is only a Skip away Overall good Hotel definitely go again 
379765,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel bar doesn t serve alcohol which I found very strange, There was lots of lovely art on the walls in the lobby It s only a 10 minute walk from the train station where you can get a train to Amsterdam Centraal which takes only a couple of minutes and trains run all night
379766,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, More options for dining at the hotel would have been a nice bonus , Great location Tram station directly in front of hotel making it convenient to get anywhere from there Minutes to all locations by tram yet far enough away to be quiet Our room was extremely comfortable and well furnished Very clean Loved the bathroom amenities especially the heated floor We would have been lost without the help of the super friendly front desk 
379767,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No alcohol available travel time to centrum 30 minutes 2 trams , Hotel is in a nice relaxing area excellent shower free high speed Internet access tram stop directly at the front of door 
379768,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The price of breakfast was overly priced The hotel was quite far out didn t matter to me and my partner as we enjoyed travelling around the city but might to others There wasn t a mini fridge which also didn t matter to us but may to others , We arrived early before check in and aloud to keep our bags in a safe secure room We also had a late flight back and were aloud to do the same after we had checked out All of the staff were nice and friendly especially Aleksandra We were upgraded to a king sized bedroom free of charge due to there being one available very roomy with the most comfortable bed Had everything we needed Tram stop was right outside the hotel which meant we could travel one stop left to the train station which goes to the airport or two trams right into the city centre Absolutely brilliant hotel serving delicious food Would definitely go back and reccomdent to anyone 
379769,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, It s easily to get to the hotel in public transportation The personnel of the hotel is very friendly they answered all the questions I have to go to the different places Is a nice hotel 
379770,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I requested a balcony but then advised they did not have any which was false advertisement , Most of the staff were very nice mostly just the night staff and the staff while we were checking out room Was fabulous very comfy 
379771,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Lack of convenience stotes in the locality No Alcohol being served in the Restaurant The dinner Restaurant male staff is Rude , Very Good Connectivity on Tram Route Molenwerf tram station is bang outside the Hotel A Nice Big size family room for 3 4 in a family Very nice Breakfast spread Staff is warm Helpful Allowed us with early check in 
379772,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Location is great Hop on the tram number 12 just outside the hotel which takes you in to Amsterdam Good sized Room Reception Staff very helpful especially Aleksandra 
379773,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, see above, we spent only one night and it was OK the restaurant had a lot of diners but only 3 stuff members on king day so we wound up waiting for 50 minutes for chips and pizza the kids 8 6 were getting very impairment so we decided that enough is enough we asked the waiter to bring the food to our room when its ready one more thing the water current in the bath was terrible other then that the stay was fitting and comfortable
379774,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The pillows and the towels, My adult daughter myself an 2 friends stayed in a quad room and it was excellent The room was large to accommodate 4 single beds The bathroom and shower were very modern and very appreciated The only negative was the quality of the towels The staff went out of their way to help any way that could Location for exploring Amsterdam is perfect and also quiet I highly recommend the Golden Tulip
379775,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Excellent facilities great value buffet breakfast superb customer care No complaints about this hotel whatsoever Right by a tram line with easy access to anywhere Double rooms are not overly spacious but everything you need is there and the daily clean is great Would recommend and would return 
379776,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Can t think of anything I didn t like , Although this hotel is outside the center the tram stops right out in front and it is easy to get to the center of Amsterdam Being outside the center it is quiet and has a park across the street The buffet breakfast is very extensive and worth paying extra for book in advance for the 20 discount The room was large we did not pay extra for a comfort room bathroom was huge with a heated tile floor lots of counter space and a large shower Very clean an modern The front desk people were so helpful If you have questions especially about travelling on the tram they are very helpful Wait until there isn t a long line to check in or out and they take as much time as you want 
379777,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Wish breakfast was inclusive and they had more vegetarian options on the dinner menu , Met expectations Thumbs up for Room was quiet spacious Bathroom with heated floor Metro stop just outside the hotel
379778,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The lighting in the room was very poor and we needed to ask the reception desk for a lamp Apparently is it a common complaint Also toiletries were not replenished each day so we needed to ask for more at the reception desk, I liked the location as it was near a tram and train station
379779,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Excellent value for money Tram stops right outside the hotel and staff willing to guide you on which trams to catch Travelling as a single parent with two kids was a breeze You can also buy travel cards at the hotel reception Great food served at restaurant but we found the breakfast to be expensive and not worth the option 
379780,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Great service and polite staff Everyone spoke English and did their best to help us with questions cabs and transportation Breakfast had options for all tastes 
379781,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I like everything about the hotel I would of liked to have another mirror in the room aside from the bathroom , Very clean hotel with great customer service
379782,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It stated when i was booking that the accommodation took cash However THEY DONT which meant i d changed far too much money , The room was spacious and the staff were always available to help All the little extra s were a bonus and we loved having our own coffee machine 
379783,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Pls provide slippers No restaurant at night time, Breakfast Room Hospitality Coffee tea in the room with coffee maker Head of receptionists so professional and caring
379784,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Beds were hard and uncomfortable location wasn t the best as its next a main road and was quite noisy so didn t get much sleep It also required taxis to get into town as its a 40 minute walk to Amsterdam city centre although a tram does stop right outside the hotel my partner and I try to avoid public transport One HUGE downside was that due to a recent change in local licensing laws they could not serve any alcohol in the bar or the restaurant , The staff were happy and helpful 
379785,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Interior of room is a bit dated but comfortable Bit of a mismatch as the Bathroom looked remodeled and modern Missed the coffee refill in the room at room make up and we missed it the next morning Internet in our room was super slow but it was very quick in the computer room downstairs just inconvenient that we needed to take our laptop downstairs , Breakfast was amazing Also I was very happy the room had a large tub Front desk staff was always super friendly and pleasant Convenient location to the tram Overall a clean and well kept hotel 
379786,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing to report, So nice to be outside of the hustle and bustle of the city Super easy to take tram right outside the hotel great service at the front desk They helped us with directions and anything else we needed Rooms were very comfortable and clean Would recommend

379788,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Due to the fact that we came at 14 00 as the hotel policy has a late check in and we obnly had pounds the staff asked us to go in amsterdam centre sunday at 16 00 to change the money in euros after I told the manager i can leave 300 deposit in cash along with my documents and after we get some sleep I would have come with euros we had no sleep and we really needed the room asap and the staff found a solution that cost me another 100 despite the fact we were super tired We had a business meeting on monday and we went to Eindover The sleep that we got was not enough , Hotel was clean and tidy 
379789,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Excellent hotel Staff were very helpful throughout booking process and answered all my queries by email very quickly Rooms were lovely and big and absolutely spotless Would definitely book to go back if staying in Amsterdam Easy to get the tram and a lovely quiet location 
379790,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room service neglected to change a clearly dirty bed after coffee had spilt on it and this had to be requested the tea and coffee in the room were also not restocked for the second day and had to be requested from reception upon return from a long day , The coffee facilities in the room are excellent and the price of the bar food was reasonable and the food delicious 
379791,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I had a price from booking com but paid around an additional 50 euros per room so an additional 150 for our part Also missed a bad for a nightcap No alcohol policy, The room was a good size the bathroom excellent Very quiet T night

379795,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Poor tea coffee facilities in room Only sachets of powdered milk so I had to go to the bar everyday to ask for a jug of normal milk My English breakfast tea bags were never replenished so I had to go to reception every day to get more, Lovely breakfast Lovely shower in room Comfortable beds The tram stop was right outside the hotel so very easy to get to Amsterdam city centre in 15 minutes Also only 1 tram stop to the train station which takes you to the airport in 12 minutes 
379796,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The restaurant has been closed for 7 months but there was no sign stating this We choose to stay their again because of the restaurant due to the fact that we have a small child Makes it easier The room was a bit small for the price , The location was good due to the public transport and they have parking on site Its just enough away from the heart of AMS to avoid the crowds but not so far that you spend hours on the train Its not to busy and easy to get in and out of now 
379797,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, During my stay it was very crowded with all Chinese guests Also there are very limited restaurant near the Hotel , Room was quite big and comfortable Wifi was very fast and easy to approach Specially they have own parking place in very good price which I liked most from this hotel Furthermore the breakfast was excellent and public transportation is quite easy to approach too 
379798,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, At booking com the room was announced as having a fridge or minibar inside I even changed my hotel from another one nearest to downtown do Golden Tulip because this item but for my dissapointment the rooms had only a mini vendor machine inside to buy sodas beer and water That was really a small frustration on my trip , Excellent staff Excellent shower and a good room
379799,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The bar doesn t serve alcohol non alcoholic beers and wine only Didn t bother me but just to let others know , Helpful staff very clean and comfortable rooms Really Easy to reach Amsterdam Central and airport by public transport 
379800,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only thing was our room was a bit warmer not great air conditioning than I would have liked However this is quite typical of European hotels The hotel staff was very helpful in attempting to fix the room temperature This was a very minor issue Would certainly not keep us from staying again , Great staff Very convenient to city center from the hotel We also took the tram to the train station which took us right into the airport Would definetly stay at the hotel again 
379801,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Breakfast was nice but i found bad service for dinner and not enough tables for everyone so if you wanted to eat in you couldn t cause the restaurant was full probably only 10 tables and no restaurants in walking distance to the hotel I also found the restaurant bar staff not friendly, Breakfast and reception staff
379802,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There wasn t any kettle in the room, They baked fresh gluten free bread for me The single room was spacious like a standard double room The beds were too comfortable 
379803,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The bathroom lighting was poor for seeing in mirror to shave or make up Shower floor extremely slippery with out grab bar , The rooms were attractive clean well appointed The front desk staff were especially friendly helpful with anything we asked about They made suggestions for using public transportation which locations would be more interesting to us and where to get terrific apple pie 
379804,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There is no refrigerator in a room only a vending machine with cold drinks Another questionable thing alcohol free bar , Very good location 10 steps from tram stop that leads to the center Good breakfast friendly staff excellent smoking area with pillows and blankets Capsule coffee machine in a room with renewable capsules each day TV supports USB so you can watch own foto videos 
379805,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Brown and dull dull location a significant distance from centre No popping back to change or wash etc Pricey and no refrigerator in the room Noisy at night from traffic on busy road outside the window Misleading photos It added nothing good to the trip , Friendly staff Good sized bathroom Very pleasant park to walk through to centre Public transport is very good in Amsterdam 
379806,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No liquor license what a drag My single room 540 was not as comfy as the larger rooms with a double or 2 twin beds This room also next to exit door to stairwell that was heavily used so you can hear it closing, Stayed here several times in the past most recently in November 2016 Tram 12 stops outside hotel 1 stop from Sloterdijk train station so main train access is easy 2 trams needed to get to center of Amsterdam and thats fine 14 breakfast buffet is very good A couple of restaurants are across the street and a few nice bars 1 or 2 tram stops away 
379807,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Walkable to Centraal Station but a bit far to do each day We should have taken the tram in more often to save our earnest walking for the sights , Beautiful spacious and comfortable room modern shower Helpful staff easily booked day trips for us All staff spoke English well A short walk to Stoldyjk sp station Tram right outside the front door A couple of great restaurants an easy walk from here Very lovely park nearby 
379808,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The lighting in the bathroom and room itself was dim Very difficult to apply makeup or read , Didn t eat at the restaurant but did have the breakfast buffet It was excellent Hotel room was spacious and looked just like the pictures Bed was very comfortable Hotel staff was very nice and helpful Hotel was about 30 feet from the tram stop so convenient The hotel room was very quiet I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I travel back to Amsterdam 
379809,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Our arrival was a day late due to mechanical problems with the airplane at the outset of the trip I immediately notified the GoldenTulip There was no way there were going to forfeit getting that night s payment I knew there would be a cancellation penalty in normal circumstances but I had proof that it was the airline s fault not ours Talked to the manager and there was no way they were going to excuse the unused night s fee ,No Positive
379810,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Apart from the hotel not serving alcohol everything was perfect , Location nice and quiet but easily accessible to airport and the city centre can even take a walk through the park The bed was very comfortable and the shower was the best ever 
379811,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, Our room was enormous compared with all the other hotels we had stayed in There was a kettle ironing board and we had control over the room temperature Although it didn t matter to us every item of food and there was everything your heart could desire for breakfast was labelled for allergies Today that is very important The tram stop is literally right at the front door Staff were so obliging even though they were extremely busy This hotel was simply wonderful 
379812,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It would ve been better if they had sold alcohol behind the bar , The quiet location the cleanliness the style of the hotel the staff and the bed 
379813,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was a bit of a wait at check in due to many customers arriving at once but staff were pleasant throughout , The public transport links are excellent the stop for tram 12 is directly outside the hotel and by transferring to the number 13 or 14 tram we reached the stop for Anne Frank house in about 20 minutes Friendly helpful staff Clean comfortable rooms and easy parking 
379814,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Check in and check out is slow reception staff is either not adequate or the system they are using is too slow May be separate concierge will also help speed up things, for the purpose i was there the location was great nice clean comfortable environment 
379815,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The Golden Tulip supplied 2 disposable wash cloths for their guest in each room At first I thought it to be a sanitary option to the cloth ones Unfortunately I soon found out that it wasn t I booked two rooms at 139 00 for three nights and one night 199 00 for a total package of 1277 55 paid in full at check in The second day the towels were replaced but not the disposable wash cloths I called down to the desk and asked to have wash cloths replaced The receptionist informed me that they are not replaceable I told her that I was not informed of the disposable wash cloth policy Then there was an awkward pause and she asked if their was something else I hung up went in the hall and asked the cleaning staff for two wash cloths for myself and my husband Why would they expect a guest to reuse disposable wash cloths I don t get it In addition almost all the furniture in the room was damaged Even the coffe cup saucer was chipped The spring mattress was hard and flat What upscale hotels still uses old spring mattresses , The hotel location is great The tram is right across from the hotel The hotel facility is modern and stylish 
379816,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel restaurant was just ok for dinner We decided to go to Casa a Michael across the road instead and it was much better at less cost The menu was limited and didn t explain dishes fully A wine bar type of alternative with a wider range of more affordable food would suit families better So many guests are staying in the hotel that really you should have a buzzing atmospheric restaurant in the evenings and you don t It s quiet empty quite cold and without charm The staff are very nice and they are a great asset to the hotel , Delicious variety of breads at breakfast Comfortable rooms Excellent transport links Extremely helpful staff 
379817,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Can t think of anything, Really comfy beds Toiletries were fab Even provided slippers razor and shave cream shoe horn shoe shine sewing kit as well as the usual soap shower gel shampoo and conditioner Ooh and a nail file Shower was out of this world beds extremely comfortable Coffee machine was great with free re fills from reception Very helpful staff and fab check out time of 12 noon with the facility to check out later at a fee of 10 per hour We cannot praise this hotel enough Only sad we can t return sooner Also the no 12 Tram line right outside the hotel and the Sloterdijk train tram station just 10 mins walk or one tram stop away

379819,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The minibar was not a fridge but like a vending machine which was not working at all The location a little out of the city but the nearness of the tram recompensate for that , The staff was exceptional friendly and helpful The restaurant was good and not too expensive The tram stop in front of the hotel and the train was not far away There were restaurants and shops nearby The coffee and tea facilities in the room was adequate and refills available at reception 
379820,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, Hotel was first class large property for Amsterdam breakfast buffet unbelievable value for 14 Room very impressive Quick convenient tram ride to old Amsterdam 
379821,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, we should have complained upon arrival but didnt But the room temperature was quite cold due do a very noisy A C hence turned off , the service the easy access to the highway while being close to the city center 15 min by tram the breakfast possibility of extending check out had to pay though 
379822,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I wasn t sure if my air conditioning was working or on wasn t too fussed just opened the window , My room was very clean and the carpet in my room made me super happy Couldn t go wrong with custard pastries for breakfast either 
379823,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Toiletries were not replaced as they were used and the room was not always cleaned on a daily basis The hotel is not close to other shops drugstores grocery stores other types of shops or restaurants Need to take a tram or taxi or a car to get to them If taking a car parking becomes a problem as it is not always close to these shops or restaurants As it gets later in the evening the trams come less and less frequently Chairs in the room are not comfortable and the lighting is very poor , Excellent breakfast buffet Tram stop in front of hotel that can take one downtown or to the train station Amsterdam Sloterdijk Very friendly and helpful staff Easy to get to with a car and good garage underground 
379824,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Very POOR customer service on reception desk Very poor keycard for 4 nights I have to go 2 times to reception to reactive A lot of dust in room , Good location for car travelers Good room size and bathroom size Good air conditioning
379825,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room was nice but way to small We had more room on our cruise and these rooms are small Bed was very comfortable Location was in a nice area but had to walk to far to do anything dinner entertainment etc , Staff was friendly and helpful Breakfast was great
379826,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A bar would be nice bartenders sarcastic remark when reply to a question of why only non alcoholic beer available was not appreciated either Having worked in a five star hotel for a number of years I never once spoke to a guest like that When a guest asks a genuine answer I think a genuine response should be provided Other front of house staff were wonderful ,No Positive
379827,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Wifi would not connect in our room, Clean room comfy beds good location with easy access to the city centre with a tram stop outside that also gives easy access to the airport We bought a 72hour train and tram pass which was significantly cheaper than getting a taxi ride to the hotel so would definitely recommend public transport Hotel breakfast was good and the staff were very friendly and accommodating 
379828,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No alcohol in the bar and a bottle of complementary water in the rooms would have been good , The whole experience at this hotel was extremely good and would recommend it Breakfast was amazing 
379829,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Food very expensive food not good bar does not serve alcohol restaurant does not serve rice, Nice room helpful staff good value lots of choice for breakfast
379830,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The Hotel isn t licenced so can t serve alcoholic dirks so no wine and beer in the bar You have to go outside to a Bar about 1KM away for a drink The trams takes you there ,No Positive
379831,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, If there is anything I have to say not very satisfied was the dust found covered on the hairdrier , Very good location The tram 12 was just ouside the hotel and it was very easy to go to the Sloterdijk train station and the museum sqaure as well as the Albert market from where the Amsterdam CS was just in 5 min by train Pefect breakfast to enjoy The staff were very friendly and helpful Large bathroom confort bed and clean Comparatively cost effective in Amsterdam in this tourist season Would be my choice for the next stay if go to Amsterdam again 
379832,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, I like the comfort facilities location with easy access to the public transport and very good connection to the city center Staff very helpful and very kind Great place to stay 
379833,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A lot of dust in the room Bed linel was not changed even one time throughout whole of our stay 5 nights Expensive breakfast at the hotel , The hotel are very close to tram station Hotel staff are very friendly 
379834,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Not the property mainly the fact I had cash to pay hotel but they said card only but I didn t get this on my booking or email from the hotel , The rooms were clean and beds were comfy staff were very helpful and always welcoming 
379835,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There were hardly any amenities nearby but It can be an advantage if you wish a quiet neighbourhood , My husband and I travelled first time to Amsterdam Read the reviews before we booked this hotel for 8 nights Quite true to its reviews Alcohol free hotel We stayed on the 3rd floor It had a lift The room was large and overlooked a quiet street The bed and pillows were clean and comfortable Toilet was cleaned everyday and towels changed when needed Staff was quite helpful The tram was right in front of the hotel and one stop from Amsterdam Sloterdijk station Could also walk there Takes about 10 mins 
379836,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I wish the hotel was closer to the action The hotel is alcohol free and there really isn t a close restaurant , This was the best hotel of the 3 we stayed in Europe It s really far from the action but public transportation is right outside the front door We had a giant room and the in room coffee was excellent Very luxurious 
379837,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Personalen kunde b ttre p sin charm lite mer Kanske inte det b sta bem tandet vid ankomst men dem var v ldigt hj lpsamma n r man beh vde tips p saker att g ra hur kollektivtrafiken funkade och ber ttade vart man skulle g om man beh vde handla Sen hade dem inget alkoholtillst nd vilket f rst rde det lite man ville kanske ta ett glas i baren Ist llet fick man g till aff ren bredvid f r att handla vin och sen sitta p rummet Och hur kan man ta 17 euro person dag f r frukost Alldeles f r dyrt , S ngarna var sk na dock var kuddarna j tte stora Fr scha rum Kollektivtrafiken var precis utanf r plus att man kunde k pa kort till det i lobbyn Bra frukost 
379838,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, For unknown reasons to me at least Apparently some sort of local law the bar only serves 0 alcohol beer Odd in a city that you can find so many bars and home to Heineken and Amstel , Do yourself a favor and get the breakfast Unbelievable fantastic delicious You will eat so well that you can certainly skip lunch Really really really worth it Also staff was really friendly and helpful with tourists Walking distance to a neighborhood Italian restaurant if you are hungry late at night or if you want to try something local 
379839,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The woman preparing pancakes was rushed by her supervisor In result she was forced to put a doughy not thoroughly cooked pancake on my plate She seemed to know but apparently had to listen when her boss motioned for her to give out the pancakes She gave me a guilty apologetic look as she told me it may not be done I would have rather waited a little longer for a proper pancake Perhaps they should consider putting two cooks on to make pancakes if it is such a popular item , Lovely room short walk from the tram Staff was wonderful warm welcoming and helpful Comfortable bed warm bathroom floors good wifi reception Very short walk from a main train and across from the tram Tram cards even on sale in the lobby vendor Vast selection of at breakfast Wait staff also wonderful Freshly squeezed Orange Juice was wonderful 
379840,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Breakfast was a bit pricey for what they has to offer , Very clean and professional looking Great standard of accommodation and more than enough facilities to keep for and healthy 
379841,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only thing that I didn t like was that they didn t serve any alcohol at their bar restaurant After a long days walk in the city it would ve been nice to enjoy a nice cold beer at the hotel away from the busy and crowded city , Great location The tram is just right in front of the hotel which takes you directly into the city The Staff was very friendly and helpful The breakfast was really great they had a lot of variety 
379842,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I don t think that anything was wrong with this hotel it was really great value for money Would definitely stay here again , great service and friendly staff the room was very comfortable and the bed was big and comfortable It was a very short tram ride from the city centre 
379843,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Coffee making machine unsuitable for any tea making due to small capacity to heat any quantity to suitable temperature An electric kettle would be preferable Unable to block out all light from end of curtains Unable to turn heat off completely at night , Shower good size bicycle hire provision excellent and convenient tram stop just outside no night time rowdiness good room size 
379844,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, room is too dark no lights above the mirror in the bathroom no full size mirror in the room small mirror was cracked the window shells were very dusty the second day at 3 30 pm the room was still not cleaned when it was eventually cleaned it was not done properly no bathrobe, Great location very easy to get from the airport from the train station 1 tram stop or just 5 min walk tram stop in front of the hotel 15 min by tram almost everywhere Friendly staff at the reception Nice breakfast
379845,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing bad to say Everything was perfect As two 19 year olds on our one year anniversary things really couldn t have been better , Staff are super helpful and having a tram stop right outside the hotel was so useful No alcohol served onsite was a bonus as there wasn t any drunk people late at night making lots of noise The drinks they did serve were lush 
379846,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, free parking for customers as its 15 a day, Tram just out side door 15 min s into town excellent but expensive hotel restaurant but NO alcohol rule
379847,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location needs took half an hour from the train station to here The room was not very big , The staff was really helpful and the room was good for four people 
379848,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The towels in the bathroom could have been a little bigger for showering and the window in the room we had wasn t able to open , The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and the hotel being that close to the tram was very convenient 
379849,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was smoke smell in the room My 6 year old son showed me next day that there is a plastic cover on the ceiling The guest who stayed there before had covered the smoke detector with a plastic cover and smoked inside the room I don t blame the hotel for that but what i didn t really like was the attitude of some staff who threw the cover on my carpet that too not even in the dust bin after I informed about the plastic cover on ceiling When I informed this calling reception the staff was very cool about it and they said that housekeeping will clean it when they clean the room , Accessibility to the places and spacious rooms friendly reception staffs who guided us to go to the places with a smile on their face
379850,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, On arrival nothing I requested was given I picked the double bed but got two singles I gave details to use the vending mini bar didn t work nor was it fixed over the 3 night stay Staff not helpful and food over priced it was further away that expected and nothing in the area , room overall modern and nice beds made daily and cleaned okay for the money but the little things let it down 
379851,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It is a little out of centre which we knew and if you don t mind the walk then fine , The hotel room was very modern large in size and bed really comfy 
379852,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Booked a large double room Was given a small room with 2 single beds For 135 a night Was upgraded to large room after moan New room was dirty Carpets were severely stained hairs in the bathroom food in the corners Glasses had lipstick on spoons were tea stained Ordered food from room service half the meal missing Just awful Nowhere near the standards we had the first time we stayed , Stayed here last year felt it was good value for money large room etc Stayed here at the weekend my god the standards have slipped 
379853,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Check out time could have been longer and the cost of extras was expensive , Staff were welcoming and friendly hotel was well presented and clean good location
379854,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Shower very hot and found some difficulty in controlling water temperature, Hotel well situated for city centre but without the difficulties Staff very helpful especially the lady at reception to dining room and also the front house staff 
379855,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The lady at reception that checked us in was exceptional great humour and great English Hotel is beautifully clean and well laid out Our room was spacious spotless well equipped and beautifully decorated Bathroom was also amazing especially the shower Location is great only ten to fifteen minutes to city centre Would highly recommend and will be back The hotel is non smoking and serves no alcohol which didn t bother us in the slightest it was nice to be in an alcohol free area for once Taxis always available outside the door 
379856,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location Pillows Bar Price of breakfast , It was a nice hotel however it is too far from the center and was constantly waiting around for trams The hotel also didn t sell beer as they have recently lost there license The hotel itself is nice but next time we go we will pay the extra couple of quid to go further into town 
379857,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The hotel was a bit far from the center but the tram stop was outside the hotel The rooms were clean but we asked for double bed and we had 2 singleones put together instead The breakfast worth the money as if you go to have breakfast somewhere else you will pay aproxim the same amount They had a smoking area wich is a plus but alla the drinks where non alcoholic We had couple of times issue with our keys as we couldnt open the door but the reseption was 24 7 Overall we enjoyed our stay 
379858,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Beds were twins bit awkward for the partner an I but small complaint really And no alcohol served at the hotel but really who goes to Amsterdam to stay in the hotel , Can t stress enough how nice the staff were Aldi right across the road which is actually surprisingly very handy Hotel was beautiful and again staff just made it such a lovely trip 2 short tram rides to dam square 12 or 13 to Willem de zwigjerlam then hop off and at the same stop get the 14 to city only takes about 15 mins in total trams are every couple of mins it sounds like a lot be its actually really handy just get the 48hour pass and its grand Check out Rembrandt square bit cheaper and some great pubs n restaurants there 
379859,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Everything about this hotel is excellent firstly the location it s only a short walk from train station and the tram stop is directly outside the entrance which provides excellent transport network into anywhere you want to go in Amsterdam The staff all speak excellent English and couldn t help you any better if they tried The rooms are luxurious and large and would recommend to anyone 
379860,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, only non alcoholic drinks in the restaurant menu, excellent location delicious food in the restaurant carpaccio was excellent clean room modern bathroom heated floor in the bathroom stuff is friendly
379861,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, nothing everything was nice to me , Everything perfect Very nice staff all facilities are very new and comfortable Its located in front of tram station 
379862,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, The location of the hotel was quite nice The bus station is very close The tram passes right in front of you The hotel staff were friendly and helpful The bathroom in the room was one of the most beautiful bathrooms I ve ever seen When we first entered the room there was a problem in the shower and immediately changed our room I will definitely stay at this hotel if I come back to amaterdam again 
379863,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The first lift didn t work the whole time we were there and the second lift kept playing up so sometimes has to wait ages Such a good price for a luxury hotel just wish it was slightly closer to the centre , The hotel is really modern really comfortable beds and bedding a gorgeous bathroom with an amazing shower I like the electronic pad outside the room so you can tell the maids when you would like your beds made and clean towels 
379864,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, On the second day of our stay the coffee machine didn t work so we were unable to have a drink and room service only left us one towel which was disappointing The hairdryer provided was very sub standard and if you have shoulder length or longer hair I would recommend taking your own hairdryer or allowing extra time to dry your hair There was only one lift working throughout our stay Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Amsterdam, The room was lovely clean and very spacious The bed was very comfortable and so were the pillows It was quite far out of town but easily accessible via tram and bus service The staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the area and where to go 
379865,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, been an alcohol free hotel was not great to be honest it would have been nice to come back to njoy a nice drink in the bar nd to be able to socialise with other travellers nd the staff so that would put me off from booking again but would be the only reason , loved the location nd that the tram was literally right outside the hotel hotel was fab rms lovely well decorated nd really comfy
379866,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Alcohol free hotel which was not made clear at time of booking and only stated when room was already booked Booking should make this clear prior to booking , Breakfast good but expensive unless booked in advance Great rooms and really friendly staff 
379867,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I didn t like that we was on a main road And that we had to be checked out by 12 in the afternoon when our flight coming home was at 5 30pm, The staff was very welcoming and nice Also the bedrooms was very clean and tidy They beds were very very comfortable The staff also helped us with the trams and guided us to another part of the city I have never traveled too 
379868,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location is okay but it required a little bit of traveling on trams and taxis which became a little expensive , The bed was lovely always had a good nights sleep Staff were always friendly and polite 
379869,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, This hotel sold no alcohol in the bar We weren t told this prior to booking or on check in In fact we were informed that the bar was open till 12 at night The barman informed us there was in fact no alcohol served Was disappointed with this as you couldn t sit and relax with a glass of wine with your food or before bed Its 2 tram stops into the city centre I d say if your walking at least half an hour walk , Clean friendly staff tram stop directly outside front door and train station 5min walk or one stop on the tram 
379870,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel is very dirty the hotel does not serve any alcohol at all even though there is a menu and for 2 women who have gone to Amsterdam to see the museums etc what we wanted if an evening was a nice bottle of wine , The breakfast was good
379871,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No alcohol served in the bar but did not impact our holiday as the hotel is so accessible via public transport , Great hotel Very accessible Excellent value for money 
379872,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No alcohol served in the bar Which was a shame because it was a very nice space it would have been nice to have a nightcap Overall a great place to stay if you don t mind tram ride into the centre ,No Positive
379873,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Their non alcoholic policy came as a surprise This made us not want to eat at the restaurant as we were on holiday and wanted to enjoy drinks with our food And also we could not enjoy even a glass of wine in our room whilst getting ready This made us not spend a lot of time at the hotel which is a shame because it was beautiful ,No Positive
379874,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room cleaning system could be more efficient i e towels replacing shower gel etc Rooms could do with some modernising in the near future , Helpful staff really good breakfast Tram stop directly outside the hotel about 20 minutes into dam square Beds were comfy shower was a nice touch as well 
379875,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I can honestly say I really enjoyed my stay and will go back and recommend to friends and family , Tram stop right outside a few stops and your in town 
379876,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No alcohol licence makes the bar a bit redundant , Friendly staff really good breakfast buffet on site parking very reasonable Easy to reach by car 
379877,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only thing I thought that could be improved is having the carpets professionally cleaned and actually setting up the coffee machine as I couldn t figure out how to work it and the cleaners didn t know either, The photos do not do the hotel justice The hotel looks way better in real life I loved the bathroom the shower is wide and clean and very modern too The shower head is powerful and the water temperature is great The beds are comfortable you have a good selection of Tv channels including an urban music channel There s a coffee shop close by and the tram stop outside to get to central The staff were cool I enjoyed it 
379878,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Only downside was that they didn t serve alcohol , The staff were so professional and the food was to a very high standard It s very easy to get to the centre as the team stops are just right outside the door The hotel is beautiful inside and out Stayed on the 5th floor and the view was amazing I will definitely be back 
379879,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Rooms great size Really nice and good for relaxing after a long day in the city Travel pass is a must we got a 3 day pass and it allowed us to get the train trams metro and bus around the city The public transport is so easy to navigate and the hotel staff we more than helpful with directions I was slightly apprehensive about how far out of the city the hotel was before we arrived however it turned out to be closer than expected and we were happy to be staying a little out of the way for some peace On our final day we asked at reception to print our boarding passes They were really helpful and directed us to a computer room with printer to use free of charge in a lovely lounge We opted out of breakfast but will try this next time we stay as it looked great We are already planning on booking a return trip Don t be put off by any negative reviews this is a great hotel 
379880,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Bit far from centre but the trams were good you got 2 trams from hotel the number 12 then the number 13 roughly 15mins quicker than a taxi , Thought the rooms were very good good comfort and movement in the rooms was great bathroom very good nice walk in shower etc 
379881,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Air conditioning didn t work so had to have window open all night but awoken every morning at 7am by ambulance sirens Air conditioning unit made loud noises all through the night which woke us up DO NOT GO TO THE CHINESE RESTAURANT ACROSS THE ROAD the attitude of the staff made us feel like we had just thrown their kid in the canal , Good location so away from the hustle of Centraal Great bathroom facilities 
379882,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Honestly nothing very happy with my stay, So impressed with this hotel Such a good price ideal location so easy to get round on the trams Staff where so lovely and helpful Rooms are gorgeous and beds very comfortable 
379883,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Lack of choice and value meal wise though hotel is happy for you to order in to eat in room , The tram being nearby rooms were quiet and clean Friendly staff 
379884,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel I loved the nespresso machine in the room I also loved how the tram from central station stopped right in front of the hotel every few minutes The staff was very friendly kind and spoke fantastic english Aleksandra helped us for most of our stay and she was just wonderful I highly recommend staying here We will be staying here again when we come back 
379885,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The curtain had fallen off the last hook and i had to hook it on the window despite leaving it like the this the cleaners didn t fix it Didn t bother me at all though , Excellent breakfast and the rooms are clean modern and perfect for a short break 
379886,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Property advertised as central but bit outside centre however tram at the door very handy for anywhere that said would stay here again, Loved the property rooms beds very comfortable staff very friendly
379887,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Breakfast was nearly 20 euros each which i thought was a bit over the top for an average buffet breakfast Was a bit miffed to find the hotel did not sell alcohol not sure what the reason was for this , Rooms stylish and comfortable Coffee machine in room was a bonus Hotel spacious and modern
379888,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room service food was average although the buffet breakfast was good , Although the location is not central it is well connected by trams which makes travel easy The room was spacious and the amenities were 5 
379889,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Breakfast is too expensive at the hotel , The location is very good only 10 minutes away from Sloterdijk station and just a few meters away from Tram station Also a supermarket is just round the corner and the park is a great place to enjoy the fresh air 
379890,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Checked in at 3pm but our room wasn t ready , Room was great Even though hotel was quite far out from the centre With an Amsterdam travel pass and the tram stop right outside the hotel it really wasn t a problem 
379891,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel currently has no licence to serve alcohol as I believe they forgot to renew I think you should make that very clear on your booking systems or remove it until they have regained their licence When I asked the barman if there was somewhere that we could get a beer locally he mentioned the local Chinese restaurant and said they may let you sit at a table and have a drink without ordering food I wasn t sure if he was being sarcastic or unhelpful or didn t know if there were other local options On day two I took a walk around and found a great bar 5 minutes from the hotel and they told me there were many others around and also good options in local Westerpark Very unsatisfactory and not very helpful on the part of the hotel I definitely wouldn t book it again , Hotel room was comfortable clean and quiet
379892,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room clean except cupboards had layers of dust so obviously not cleaned on a regular basis Pillows not the comfiest 2 separate trams to get to the centre , Lovely room for price we paid Very surprised at how nice considering low cost 
379893,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The lack of alcohol Could have done with more options for coffee and some proper milk for having tea as there was only creamer available You can ask for these though to be fair , The rooms were fantastic size and the rainfall shower head was amazing Beds were the most comfortable I ve ever slept in at a hotel and although we were facing the busy highway there was no noise whatsoever which was amazing Great having a posh coffee machine The location was a bit far out but once we d got the hang of the tram lines it was easy to reach very easy to get back to the airport too Staff were extremely helpful and helped us with trams etc
379894,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Overall a great hotel A couple of minor criticisms The breakfast is slightly overpriced but that being said it has a wide variety of choice and tastes great We noticed that someone had crudely drawn a massive penis in biro in the elevator we found this highly amusing but the old lady who joined us in the elevator wasn t too impressed I think More attention to the elevator cleanliness as there was also litter on the floor and grubby mirrors , Clean and comfortable Room serviced daily to a high standard Not too far from city centre 
379895,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, elevator lift very slow seriously they need to improve their lift, Receptionist can speak my language close to tram stop have good coffee maker full toiletries
379896,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Upon arrival one of the staff members named Susanne was very very rude I had made payment for the property before I arrived and she said that I didn t even when I showed her 2 forms of evidence my bnk statement showing her proof that the money had been tAken from golden tulip and a confirmation image from the hotel itself to say that my payment has been successful and she still said I didn t pay very rude and needs more training on how to deal with customers in the end the manager said that I did pay because the two forms of evidence that I provided was suffice , I loved the way the rooms looked as had to get an upgrade because the initial room that they put us in was not wht we requested or paid for
379897,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel required to pay for the stay a few days before the booking time through its online payment system Otherwise the booking will be cancelled , The room is clean spacious and functional It has the espresso machine to serve free coffee in the morning Bath room is also clean sleek and modern The floor is heated The tram is at the door step of the hotel Hotel is also close the park 
379898,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No mini fridges for our Meds They did offer to keep it in their restaurant fridge Ended up using a tray of ice they provided from the bar, Good location with tram stop right outside door Helpful staff
379899,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Booked 4 rooms all verry nice But one room had a small leak on the wall , I loved the shower and the rooms were clean and spacious Only ate breakfast here but it was very nice and had a verity to choose from Lovely dining area 
379900,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only thing I can think of is that there s a minibar in the room and we were told they don t work My advice would be to remove them from the rooms then or fix them , Staff were friendly Hotel was very clean and comfortable beds Nice bathroom and tram stop located straight outside hotel 
379901,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Could of given some travel guides and English information to help us round or even bus routes to help, Very nice and clean room friendly staff and comfortable stay 
379902,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The room was very small compared to what we had when we visited the first time the curtain rail also was too small for the window so had to prop the curtain back with the bin provided in the room It was also full of cobwebs ,No Positive
379903,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location few of the staff are rudes and unprofessional, The decoration and the interior and few facilities were great but very very far from the center of amsterdam and just tram number 12 reach this hotel its very complicated to reach it easily
379904,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel was situated on the outskirts of Amsterdam with noting around you Amsterdam was 2 tram rides away the bar only serves non Alcholic drinks which is not my idea of a hotel especially when there wasnt any pubs or restaurants around you, The hotel was lovely and clean very spacious the staff were polite and a tram outside the hotel was very handy
379905,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The heating didn t seem to kick in very quickly on a night time coming in from 0 temperatures The blankets could have been thicker, Lovely spacious room right next to tram and not far from city centre but not too close either
379906,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The lift Only one working We had to wait ages and then stopped at every floor even though nobody was waiting for it, Comfortable rooms Fantastic bathroom Friendly helpful staff
379907,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The room is too small and wasn t cleaned there was hair in the bathroom and when I asked for water they told me to use the water from the tap first time I encounter this in a hotel And considering the cost I could ve found better for the same price, The staff is quite helpful and nice the room had a nice view
379908,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The shower gel wasn t replaced at all We had to go down 3 times to ask for some Alcohol in the bar would ve been great too , Beautiful room tram station right outside was very handy 
379909,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No milk with tea No fridge No drinking water, TV had British channels very clean tea coffee in room excellent Bathroom was lovely and shower was great
379910,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Asked for early check in and got accepted but no rooms once arrived at 11am , Tram line right outside hotel 15 20 mins from Amsterdam Central Lovely hotel and very friendly helpful staff
379911,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The bed although a great size wasnt in my opinion very comfortable, Staff were friendly and hotel was clean however personally I found the bed really uncomfortable
379912,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Everything the staff were all helpful answered any question helped with information on tourist trips really felt at home and the rooms had everything we needed the breakfasts were both fulfilling and delicious overall would definitely recommend staying here
379913,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I have sent a message one month before arriving requesting a double bed in the room instead of two singles but it didn t happen A little disappointed that they couldn t change on the check in either ,No Positive
379914,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing , The staff were absolutely unbelievable So so friendly and helpful Our room wasn t ready when we first arrived and when we were told to come back it still wasn t ready because the receptionist wanted us to have a bigger room due to the length of time we stayed so we got free refreshments while we waited 
379915,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was a problem with the windows Loads of water was getting in the window sill was covered in puddles of water we informed the reception which offered us to move rooms or they could clean it up we choose to stay where we were and we would be out all day so if they could clean it it would be great By the time we got back to the hotel it wasn t done again the next day we just asked for some extra towels to be put in the room for us to clean it up ourselves but again this was not done The water was dripping onto the floor We were told this was a problem in a lot of the rooms as a 4star hotel we did not expect a leaky window Really let the atmosphere of the hotel down , Tram stopped right outside the hotel One of the barbstaff tall with curly black hair we never caught his name but he was very very friendly We enjoyed going to the restaurant when he was there 
379916,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, terrible wifi service too slow cleaning staff didn t clean room but only made the bed without changing dirty sheet or taking rubbish , good position in front of tram station kind and friendly staff spacious and beautiful room
379917,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Just the heating system, The room was perfect not too big cosy only thing was it was very hard to get the temperature right with the heating System Was either too hot or too cold but it was a lovely place with great staff
379918,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Distance to centrum too far Two tram rides stop at midnight and then trying to find the right nightbus back wasn t the easiest task , Friendly and helpful staff Nice rooms and great breakfast
379919,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There isn t a lot to do in the area so you will have to get trams or metro in and out , The staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to help us 
379920,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Mini bars didn t work in the room no alcohol served at the property even though alcohol was on display and room staff didn t clean rooms properly, The rooms
379921,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No alchoholic drinks available Breakfast too expensive with restricted choice Maids did not replenish tea coffee and bathroom items , Friendly helpful staff Modern hotel with good facilities Good tram and rail connections into city
379922,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The price of parking the car due to the excessive parking fee we weren t able to indulge in the breakfast , The bathroom floor was heated and it was good size unlike most European bathrooms 
379923,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Window was broke offered us a different room but would not have had double bed Nesprsso machine was funny worked one min and not the next, The bathroom facilities were lovely to great
379924,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The staff were friendly and the rooms a good size and very clean The location was perfect with a tram running directly outside allowing us to make the most of our break Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again 
379925,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Paying upfront is not something I like doing and made me quite nervous The dinner we had in the restaurant in the hotel one night was overpriced for nothing more than a meat patty and a bun but other than that great hotel , The staff were so friendly no matter what you needed The location was ideal with a tram stop just outside getting to either the airport or the centre of town couldn t have been any easier Luxury at a small price And the rooms were so big and spacious 
379926,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Too expensive breakfast At 14 per person you should better take a great breakfast anywhere else but in the hotel , Convenient tram station just outside
379927,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, My only issue and it is a small one if not a bit ridiculous is the sliding door at the entrance could open and close a little faster I m really only nitpicking as I can t fault the quality of my stay at The Golden Tulip , The staff were fabulous All small requests and queries were dealt with in the most polite and efficient manner With such great service all the little luxuries are a bonus
379928,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room was on the chilly side turned heating up to 26 degrees but didn t seem to make any difference , Staff very friendly and helpful Hotel only about 10 mins from city centre via tram which stops literally right outside the hotel Lovely comfortable rooms and excellent facilities Will definitely come back 
379929,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The staff were a bit rude and when we asked for a bucket of ice for drink in the room they told us to come down to the bar even though I said I was just out of the shower and also did not give us a bottle opener , The hotel looked nice and bed was comfy Not too far a walk into town 
379930,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Money went missing from the safe no spa facilities no high street nearby breakfast was very steep and some receptionists were more welcome than others, Nice big room good links into the city and not far from the airport
379931,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The staff were very helpful our flight was cancelled last minute after we had stayed for 5 days we weren t able to get a flight home for another 5 days The reception staff were very sympathetic and helpful in being able to put us up for another 4 nights 
379932,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The bar did not sell alcohol , It was outside the Tram stop Staff were very nice Rooms were spacious and clean Had lunch one day and that was very good did not have the breakfast 
379933,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The staff were extremely rude on reception both our groups were booked in for late checkout we were woken up at 9 10am only to be told so what it wasnt the chambermaids by a lady on reception My room wasn t ready when I arrived so I had to wait for almost two hours even though I d paid week or so beforehand The other members of our group paid as we arrived and their room was available immediately No apology was given by management and we were shrugged off Although the gentleman serving breakfast the chambermaids were very friendly apologetic explaining that they d not been told about the alterations to our stay , The food was great 
379934,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, The room was really spacious and the bed was comfortable I was a little worried about the distance from the hotel to the center but it is quite easy to get there The tram stop is just infront of the hotel 
379935,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Would have liken to be able to have a few alcohol drinks at the bar , We really really loved this hotel Photos do not do it any justice Room was amazing and OMG the bed So comfy we didn t even go out the first night LOL bathroom fab we took pics to get our own done exactly the same Everything was great Good amazing Staff seriously couldn t have been any nicer or helpful Pity tough that it is a non alcohol hotel We loved it so much we didn t wanna leave would have loven to be able to enjoy a few drinks at the bar tough Over all amazing 
379936,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Parking was expensive, Facilities were excellent staff very helpful Location was just what I wanted just far enough from the centre to be away from hussle and bustle
379937,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Quite a trek from the city centre as we had to catch 2 trams in order to get there or an uber which was 15 , Very nice city hotel tram stop right outside which was a bonus
379938,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Bed was very comfort best thing about this hotel was the shower it was amazing Good value for money tram 12 right outside the hotel also it didn t take us long to get from the airport to the hotel just a 5 minute train ride and then a minute or so on the tram 
379939,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room was a tiny bit small could of had a bit more space but all in all I got what I paid for and it was cosy , I loved the comfyness of the bed and the cleanliness of my room felt like I was just at home Staff were lovely too 
379940,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel was easy to access however did not try the food in the hotel , The easy access to trams outside the hotel made for an easy trip The beds were comfy and staff were pleasent 
379941,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Breakfast was peng tram and train stop right at front of hotel which take your strait to the city centre and the airport so transport was very easy bike rental cheap and effective 
379942,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful room was perfect bed very comfortable and a lovely shower Small bit out from the centre but the tram is directly outside the hotel which was great and a taxi was only 15 to dam centre if you were stuck great value for money hope to stay again
379943,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The staff The receptionist where ever so rude not helpful at all First problem we had was waking up to a horrible stench coming from the bathroom there was a drain problem so we had to be moved to another room Was easily sorted so thought everything would be okay for the remainder of the trip Well I was wrong my whole outfit from the first day had been left in the bathroom of the room they had originally gave us I was completely shocked to get to reception and the lack of care and help was unbelievable They wasn t bothered in the slightest and I almost felt like I was being a problem by complaining Apparently my clothes were nowhere to be seen and had grown legs and walked off by themselves So we left the hotel with none of the missing belongings no apologies no reply or response from the manager Absolutely appalling customer service completely ruined our experience here Oh and this was our second stay and now our last at the golden tulip because we loved the style of the hotel and the food was amazing What a shame to be completely let down by the staff , The food was amazing Just a shame the staff aren t as nice as the food
379944,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The wifi didn t work in the evenings Poor wifi is a problem especially for overseas travelers Was not as clean as it should be No alcahol on the premises , The staff was friendly It has a good location Quiet Rooms are good 
379945,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Expensive breakfast, Large room with a great view and a comfortable bed bathroom was also very spacious Even though it was quite far out of the Amsterdam centre there was a tram stop right outside which made it quick and easy to get into town The coffee machine in the room was also a good addition 
379946,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Lighting in the room could be better especially given the placement of the full length mirror , The shower was great Lots of pressure you ll forget yourself in there And unless you are a coffee snob you ll find the room selection decent Plus if you are new to the city and would be relying on public transportation having a tram stop in front of the hotel is super helpful 
379947,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Woken by cleaning staff twice in the morning despite having do not disturb light on , Room was nice heated bathroom floor was lovely bed was comfortable 
379948,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No minibar the room could be more cleaner surface of table and bedside tables , Helpful staff good breakfast big room with comfortable beds spacious bathroom
379949,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Bathroom spotlight above the toilet was very dusty and dirty accumulating many months of dust Free wifi but it didn t work the first night we stayed and although generally fast was very sluggish at peak hours The bar sells NO alcohol although you can get a limited selection of drinks in the room mini bar , Fantastic range of breakfast items breakfast not included in standard cost but worth the extra book in advance for a 3 euro discount Rooms were spacious and quite luxurious Very hospitable staff You can walk to the centre of Amsterdam in about 30 mins or take the tram from outside the hotel number 12 to the museum area and walk to other areas from here 
379950,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location is a little far out from the centre where all the attractions are and it does feel a little isolated There is a tram stop right outside the hotel and the public transport network is extensive and very efficient so it wasn t a problem for us Just beware that there are no little shops to pop out to if you need a drink or a snack , Staff were all amazing and very friendly and helpful We had some issues with the heating in our room and when the lady from reception couldn t fix it herself she called out an engineer who fixed it within an hour She then told us we could have a complimentary breakfast the next morning for our troubles When we visited the restaurant for dinner one evening and the menu looked a little fancy for our kids the gentleman told us we could order the pizza from the room service menu and eat it in the restaurant They really do go out of their way to ensure you are happy and comfortable The hotel itself is beautiful and spotlessly clean I would definitely stay there again 
379951,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The quality of cleaning , Location is great for those who travel across Netherlands as the railway station is nearby It is pretty far from the Amsterdam center if walking but tram station is in front of the hotel Overall it s nice place to stay quite friendly 
379952,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The underground parking should be cheaper , Staff was lovely friendly and very helpful Rooms are very comfy And with location you have a very peaceful nights sleep 
379953,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The shower was a bit broken the wi fi wasn t working properly , Heating in the bathroom everytime you press clean up someone comes to tidy up your bed and top up the coffee and teas box The tram stop is just in front of the hotel And the food is good 
379954,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We didn t try out their breakfast 17 5 euro per person seemed too much Our shower gel finished on day 3 but they didn t refill it The toilet got blocked but it was quickly attended to , Warm clean and spacious room The hotel is one step away from tram line No 2 Our room had a coffe maker a hair drier and different beauty products toothbrush soap shaver slippers e t c Bare in mind that they don t allow smoking animals or alcohol in their rooms 
379955,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The dust all over the place the cleanliness of the room was crums every where including in the bed burn markes where people was smoking the coffie machine was broken and the bathroom stunk of smoke very strong sent where people have been smoking in there, The bed the smoking area vending machines shower
379956,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, All staff were very helpful polite and well presented rooms were very nice practical and very good value for money Transport was easily accessible with a tram stop and taxis directly outside the hotel 
379957,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Not an ideal location as it was 2 trams into the city centre which isn t ideal if you re out late at night Although having the sign on the door to say we needed the room clean we were still left without clean bedding and towels , Staff were excellent No noise as was in a quite location If you are there to not go out during the nighttime this is the one for u 
379958,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Very prestige hotel welcoming and polite staff members The location is good as you only need a to take 2 trams to Amsterdam Central making it very easy to get there Tram stop is across the road from the hotel No issues at all I d definitely recommend and come back to here I came with a group of my friends for my birthday and we all had an amazing time here in Amsterdam Also on train and tram from Schipol airport it isn t very far 
379959,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, GAsked for per minute rate for phone call to Prague CZ as my mobile died Employee unable to confirm minute rate however the staff member stated that the cost per minute to prague would not be expensive I made a seven minute call extortionate charge of over 12 Euros a call within the euro EU zone When i stated i was told it would not be expensive i was told 12 euros for a 7 minute call was not expensive a shrug of the shoulders from the staff member Staff member got defensive saying now youare blaming me I stated firstly you cannot give me a confirmed rate secondly you told me it would not be expensive Staff still unable to confirm the minute rate charged this charge is not documented anywhere on the premises Strangly it is the hotel i paid this 12 euros A con Not happy will raise dispute with credit card provider on my return to the united kingdom , After the ridiculous charges for a 7minute phone call give this a low rating 
379960,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, How could I complain about this place , Extensive breakfast COMFY felt like a king tram stop right outside parking lot is great everything was perfect 
379961,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The additional cost for breakfast was quite high about 16 pp so we did not have breakfast at the hotel Furthermore the location of the hotel is quite far off the city centre However there is a tram line No 12 directly next to the hotel which goes to Museumsplein with the famous Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum etc From there it s just a few minutes walking or cycling to the city centre All in all except for the pricy breakfast we had nothing to complain , The staff was very welcoming and the rooms were quite elegant for the price really nice interior and bathroom Everything was very clean too 
379962,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location was poor We knew it was a train stop out of town but problem was there was absolutely nothing else in the vicinity This wouldn t have been so bad if the hotel had facilities but we weren t advised until we checked it that they didn t even have a bar licence so sold no alcoholic beverages at all and there was nowhere local to buy them Despite the location details stating it was only 0 6miles from the central station this is a bit misleading because despite this proximity it takes a good 30mins to get into town by whichever mode of transport tram or train once you take the stops changes walks and waits between trains into account We arrived around 1 00pm to be told our 2 rooms weren t ready but would hopefully be ready for us by 2pm This was reasonable enough given our early arrival time Given the distance into town and back we opted to wait in the bar area without a drink but had to re apporach reception at 3pm when they hadn t come back to us They advised us one room was now ready but the second hadn t been started on yet and wouldn t be ready until after 4pm We opted to all change in the one available room 6 of us so we could head into town for the New Years Eve celebrations The only other gripe was at point of booking we were given the option to choose bed configuration This gave rise to the expectation they could meet this but they couldn t The request for a quad room our 4 teenage children was met but the double bed request for my husband and I was not We had twin beds Given the two rooms had cost us just over 1 000 Euros for one night all in all it was a bit disappointing , The staff were lovely we couldn t fault them The ladies on reception were warm welcoming friendly and helpful The hotel itself was well appointed with pleasant smart furnishings and was immaculate throughout The bedrooms were good sizes beautiful en suites and reasonably comfy beds Although our room was freezing and we couldn t seem to get it warmed up with the air con system 
379963,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The mattress on the bed was a little hard and coule have been softer and there was no alcohol in the bar apart from that it was great , Room service food was beyond amazingz hardly felt the need to go out an eat all the staff were wonderful and it was an all round excellent experience 
379964,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The one and only thing which wasn t a big deal what so ever anyway was the bar not selling alcohol , Having the tram stop and taxi rank directly outside was really useful The underfloor heating in the bathroom was amazing The bed was super comfy It was nice being in a quiet area of Amsterdam while still being a short distance from the Centre 
379965,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Breakfast I ordered omelette and I was waiting for it until today the lady gave me an attitude when I went to ask if she forgot us she told me the kitchen is closed and she thought she brought our omelettes that was very unpleasant and we paid for that breakfast , Right in front of tram stop and very nice view from the rooms Reception staff were awesome

379969,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Mini bar in the room wasn t functional and the hotel only had non alcoholic drinks because they lost their license in October 2016 Still worth staying here but BYOB , Breakfast is one of the best we ve had in Europe Interior design is very modern and comfortable

380002,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No pool and the bar hadn t got an alcohol license, Location was handy 15 mins taxi from the city centre and 15 mins the other way to the airport Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable on local tourist attractions restaurants etc Price was a little raw considering breakfast wasn t included but it forced us to see more of the city and we found some deadly little cafes and coffee shops as a result so it was grand 
380003,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The room was always very clean but the sheets were never made up Would ve appreciated that , Everything was really very good The location is ideal the tram stops in front of the hotel you are in the city center in about 15 2o minutes There s also a taxi station right outside Anne Frank House was 15 Euros from the Hotel Safe underground garage for 15 Euro day which is pretty nice The staff very friendly helpful the room very clean updated very comfortable bed very quiet always had a great night s sleep We didn t have breakfast

380005,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It s very far from the center It took me around 30 45 minutes to get to the center or Vondelpark one way only Plus there s nothing open around the place for miles especially after dark and Trams stop around midnight if I m not mistaken , Staff was great always helpful and always seemed to enjoy their work which is not something I expect from hotel staff but they re great Hotel facilities and food were excellent as well 
380006,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Quite a distance from the main centre but easily accessible by tram Also it was a shame they had a no alcohol policy as it would have been nice to have a drink in the bar before going out , Really nice hotel comfortable rooms etc and friendly staff Huge choice for breakfast but a bit pricey 
380007,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Friendly welcoming staff nice comfy bed and great shower Fantastic location for travelling to and from city centre as tram line stops directly outside 
380008,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No mirrors in bedroom only one in bathroom Would be better to have a bathroom with a separate toilet in quadruple rooms, Very good sized quadruple room with comfortable beds
380009,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The Go Sober for October is apparently a farce the locals told us the hotel has lost its alcohol license due to a few unsavoury incidents Breakfast was poor Room service an a absolute joke finished at 10pm Did not see one person eating in the restuaraunt no atmosphere at all , Most of the staff were friendly and very helpful The tram stop outside was a bonus 
380010,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, This hotel doesn t sell alcoholic beverages Should mention that when describing this hotel Everything else was wonderful , Breakfast was the bomb Amazing buffet
380011,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No fridge in the room , very good connected with airport and city center The hotel is quite new and well equiped Very good internet and rooms are quiet

380013,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The room was lovely and clean when we arrived but afterwards daily cleaning was very poor we have stayed 6 nights at the hotel and not even once the carpet was hoovered not saying about changing the sheets The policy sais they will change it every 3 days but our one wasn t changed until 4th day because I have made complaint I have to ask twice for the hand soap which wasn t still replaced The staff wasn t very polite only one lady showed warmness , Decor of the room was fabulous and the bed was comfy 
380014,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, Perfect rooms and hotel Definitely recommend to stay at golden tulip Amsterdam west hotel Friendly staff Great atmosphere Tram is just across the street and it s a 10 min easy bike ride from the city center Great in room coffee machine 
380015,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Although the trams were easy to use it was a little further from Dam Square then I would have liked The breakfast was very pricey so we went elsewhere , Beautiful hotel staff were so friendly helpful the room was beautiful and we would definitely stay again

380017,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, This property was without a liquor license during our stay but we were advised in advance so it wasn t a problem for us , Everyone was great The front desk employees were very friendly and helpful 
380018,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The bed had stains on but I was too tired to complain as the staff seemed to take ages for everything even though they were friendly , Staff were very friendly good location 
380019,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We made a booking months before going away When I hadn t received a confirmation email I rang to see if we had definatly confirmed a room I was told I hadn t so I made a quick booking online When I arrived they informed me that I had made 2 bookings for 6 people when infact I wanted 1 booking for 3 of us I was made to pay for the most expensive room which was 500 euros when originally my first booking was only 400 euros I was told there was nothing I could do about it and it was my fault Poor service poor attitude ,No Positive
380020,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location is 6 kms away from Amsterdam central tough well linked through tram and train but next time will prefer something nearby central only , Rooms were clean and staff was well behaved and trained 
380021,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, N A, Everytything was clean very spacious including the bathroom Lounge area and restaurant were excellent Staff were very friendly and helpful Amazing experience will definitely book again no doubt 8min walk to station which takes you to centraal and airport and so many other destinations
380022,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I ordered the food was cold and the steak was raw when I asked for it to be very well done Hotel is advertised as 15 minute tram journey to city centre when it was actually 2 trams to city centre, The room was modern and clean
380023,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I noticed in the bar and restaurant that the chairs when move make a screeching noise A suggestion would be to put felt pads on the bottom of each chair leg I admit no small task for whoever was to do it , I travel a lot in my job and stay in many hotels but was amazed at the wide variety of choice at breakfast offered during our stay 
380024,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It s a no smoking hotel which is great but there were cigarette butts and trash right outside our window which can be opened left by the previous occupants So sadly people smoke in the rooms , Great breakfast buffet Friendly staff Quiet Convenient to tram
380025,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location is a bit out from city even with tram right outside hotel No alcohol being served was a big dissapointment , Really nice clean hotel comfortable and quiet 
380026,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Located out of city centre Requires change in tram lines Cleaning a bit sloppy , Large comfortable rooms by european standards Bathroom spacious as well Not far from airport Tram line right outside hotel 
380027,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Could not read in bed due to weak light This needs sorting Husband wanted basin plug to close but I suspect this is intentional to prevent overflows and flooding , We loved the coffee machine and the large room Afraid we didn t sample restaurant or hotel breakfast We came for two nights specifically to visit the Van Gogh Museum I thought the Golden Tulip 4 Star was a lucky find and good value Discovered excellent food and wine at the nearby Italian restaurant Amsterdam is all so clean and tidy no litter everyone so helpful and friendly everything so sensible 
380028,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The beds were not good pillows were terrible and sheets with wear hole unacceptable Room requires some refurbishment , The were very friendly and helpful Breakfast menu was excellent Location is very good with tram stop outside front door Good size room 
380029,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The mattress was a little hard for some but not uncomfortable, Breakfast was amazing staff helpful and able to hold our bags even after check out Beds were comfy we slept well Thank you
380030,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location well actually it is not that far away from city center but if you had a crazy night in the city just like us and missed the last tram back to the front door of the Hotel you will have to take a bus and walk about 10mins on a silent and a little creepy street back to hotel No it s not the big problem it s still a nice stay with the hotel , The breakfast worth the money and the bed is really comfort Oh the staffs are really nice 
380031,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Mini bar in the room did not work There was no fridge There was on the day it rained a lot of noise from the rain water pipe which passed through the inner corner of the room I assume this is why we had ear plugs supplied by the hotel , Very clean Very good buffet breakfast Tram stop outside the hotel entrance The tram trip into Amsterdam centre was relatively short 
380032,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, My mums purse with money went missing from her room and no compassion or help was offered It spoilt out trip , Everything Most staff except deputy manager It was clean modern with a great location for the tram 
380033,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The carpets didnt match the room bit picky but thats the only thing i didnt like about the stay, The food was out of this world And the staff were so polite room service was on point
380034,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Away from city centre Poor light in room, Hotel outside city centre in western part of city But tram station across the road line 12 Staff helpful Room good size clean and clean very nice bathroom with shower no bath tub Room too dark No fridge but small vending machine Near bye supermarket Lidel There is no place to have breakfast near the hotel in case you do not wAnt to pay17 50 euros per person per day for open buffet breakfast Very efficient Tram system in Amsterdam
380035,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The wifi connection was great 90 percent of the time, Love the staff how clean the hotel looked food was gorgeous If I m ever back I will be staying in the golden tulip again
380036,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, room service was really bad the first day housekeeping came at 8 00 and the other day the came at 18 00 i was at the room so i asked them to come back in an hour but they didnt come back for cleaning on the other side i asked for fork and knife in my room and they said that they will charge me for that , the location is great you can have access to city center easily by tram 12 and 14 
380037,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, While the offerings at the breakfast buffet were extensive I found the sausage bacon scrambled eggs and pancakes to be cold I really dislike cold food that is supposed to be very warm or hot, Clean quiet friendly staff close to tram bus station Easy access to Amsterdam s city center using the tram stop in front of hotel
380038,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I wanted to book breakfast on the Tuesday Wednesday they advised i had to book it for all three days I pointed out i would be leaving early on the last day before breakfast They said i had to pay for breakfast on the 3 days or not have it at all ,No Positive
380039,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was only one thing I didn t like and that was one of the days we put the clean up sign on and was gone for more than 5 hours and they still hadn t got around to our room , Enjoyed the buffet breakfast beds were very comfy pleasant staff Amazing shower 
380040,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, missing a refrigerator for milk for the coffee, Everything was perfect The room was very big and comfortable and very clean The staff was very kind and helpfull one evening I had dinner and it was very good the hotel is not in the center so it is not expensive but the service and facilities were in a very high quality and in 15 20 min you can get to the center the hotel is ratet 4 stars but I would give it 5 
380041,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Check in was slow prices didn t seem to match the booking even taking account of tax Trying to get a refund was deliberately made difficult after 24 hours there was still no one who could process the agreed refund and I had to leave without Very disappointed , Excellent buffet dinner Nice clean room 
380042,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No fridge in room only small vending machine Maid service should be faster Breakfast a bit pricey, Location large nice room king size bed big shower coffee maker in room Tram right in front Bar Restaurant in house separate restaurant for breakfast and dinner buffet
380043,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, We stayed for three nights at the Tulip and enjoyed it very much The Hotel is on the edge of the city and has a tram stop outside no 12 and take takes about 40 mins to the central station The Tulip has its own private underground car park with a lift into the hotel 
380044,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Very modern and well located hotel Even if it s not in the city center there s a tram station right out of the door of the hotel that takes you to all the places you need to go All the facilities are excellent the bathroom has a lot of space and is very comfy 
380045,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Perfect location for us 1 tram stop from outside the entrance to the train station and then 1 train stop to central station The room was lovely comfy double bed and a nice sized bathroom All the staff were really friendly We will be staying there again 
380046,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Reception was very friendly and helpful offering to book us one early free of charge in the morning even though check in was at 2pm also very helpful providing us a map and tram info which helped us get around 
380047,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Everything was perfect for us however a couple friends staying with us got a super small sized room for the same rate So would recommend calling ahead of time to ensure getting a better larger room , Everything was absolutely perfect They gave us a corner room which had a lovely view with tons of sunshine The hotel s location was perfect too with a tram line just across the street giving us access everywhere around the city The room was exceptionally clean and very modern they also had a free Nespresso machine with coffee tea It was the perfect stay that made our trip to Amsterdam so great we look forward to visiting again soon 
380048,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, every thing was okay, i got very large room very comfortable they have perfect breakfast fresh orange machine was my paradise the location is just beside tram station
380049,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was a strange smell in the corridor going to my room although i couldn t smell it in my room itself , The buffet in the restaurant is incredible and great value for money The breakfast buffet was also superb Wifi worked well and it was pretty quick getting into the city 
380050,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Shower drain was blocked and not fixed at all There was only one bin in the bathroom Location is not the best as out of city centre , Staff were friendly 
380051,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, They have mini vending machine inside room which was out of function due to some software problem Alternatively they suggested to come down to bar for ice or beverages by which am so addict to So I had to go down most of my stay But I won t consider it as bad matter as they gave ice for free there were no fridge or mini bar included in room description Some how they made it up for this matter by offering the ice beverage from ground floor bar , Hotel is fine bit away from city center were all activities shopping is But tram stop is just out side the hotel Staff are very supportive friendly It s a quiet hotel by general despite fully occupied Which was perfect for me 
380052,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Buffet breakfast finishing at 10 30am However food started to run out from 10am croissants for example and were not replaced We were down for breakfast 45 minutes before it finished but needed to be earlier really It was a shame they didnt replace the food as it ran out before 10am 
380053,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, everything about this hotel was a positive experience the staff were really helpful and friendly I got a spacious corner bedroom which was very comfy and the tram stop was right outside the front entrance with easy access to city centre and airport even a lidl store close by well worth a stay in this hotel 
380054,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location not the hotel s fault of course but you have to take 1 or 2 trams to anywhere you want to go , Great room bed extremely comfortable fantastic breakfast All the toiletry available in the bathroom Nespresso machine Very clean Friendly and helpful staff 
380055,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We were given Room 2 on the ground floor as a family room for 4 sharing This was cramp and claustrophobic not suitable as a family room There were no windows and you can been seen from the outside if the curtains were not drawn The photos did not accurately represent what was in that room There were no bedside lights no floor lamps and the headboards were different I requested a double bed and two single beds but got 4 single beds The bathroom was fine except there were hardly any space for you to put your toiletries down One of the bathroom ceiling light was blown Quite a lot of dust on the glass shelves above the coffee machine Poor wifi connection, Staff agreed to move us to a different room the following day after I express my dissatisfaction on the night of check in The second room accurately represent the photos and facilities Quite happy to say that it was what we initially expected from the second room Staff was helpful with transport direction and by providing maps Option to store your luggage after check out free of charge 
380056,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Bar evening meals could be better pillows could be larger Breakfast price could be cheaper , Location great as we wanted to travel to other parts of Holland Rooms are large very clean Staff were excellent Italian restaurant over from the hotel is fantastic 
380057,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No milk in rooms, Beautiful rooms Nespresso machine Amazing shower Staff always happy to help Right next to tram line Very close to train station which takes you straight to airport
380058,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, 1 The bedroom lighting is relatively dim for reading 2 The restaurant staff should be encouraged to smile a bit more, 1 The cleanliness of the hotel 2 The staff willingness to help 3 The location of the tram station which is immediately outside the hotel
380059,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It s a little bit far from Amsterdam city centre but with the tram is not a big issue the station is in front of the hotel , The room was very comfy and clean The staff is super friendly I loved the Nespresso machine in the room with free refills
380060,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Bedroom on first floor above restaurant scrapping of chairs late at night 11pm plus and then very early 6am as I assume area being arranged and cleaned caused disruption Thought that for the price of the room breakfast should have been included and another 17 euros per person per day was pricey , Very easy to get to from airport and tram station right outside hotel Safe and quiet location away from hustle and bustle of city life but easy to each when wanted 
380061,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Staff tries to make you pay more than your reservation and they are unable to give any kind of advice We arrived early and asked if the room was ready They say no but there is a more expensive room if we want We say no thank you we would have come again later They magically found a ready room at our price Also heard two girls that had made their breakfast reservation at a price and the hotel made them pay more , clean quiet
380062,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Maybe a more selective range of food different menus during the week But the food was excellent, Hotel is in an excellent location The staff friendly and helpful The room was clean and tidy with with good facilities Will definately recommend the hotel to others Very happy with our stay 
380063,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, SeAting in bar area torn and tatty, Spacious comfortable room with very comfortable bed and pillows Great rainfall shower Plenty of toiletries Checkout twelve o clock and facilities to stay in hotel later Luggage storage and good parking garage Tram stop outside hotel into city Buffet breAkfast and excellent value for money buffet dinner with live cooking
380064,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I didn t like the fact that no drinks were available during dinner we had to pay even for a glass of water however we totally opted for draught beer , Breakfast and dinner were perfect Just a tip book breakfast in advance for 20 lower price The room was big with a view to the pool May be far from city center but tram 12 passes by the hotel 1 min walk and in less than 20 mins you can be found to the Museum District or if you change with tram 14 you can go directly to Dam Square 
380065,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The cleanliness of our room was very poor if you wanted 2star then I guess that would have been fine , The receptionist couldn t be any more pleasant she was fab very welcoming as for bar staff and the cleanliness of the room I was motified as is paid extra for for the room 601 the net net curtains has food up the carpet had huge food patches on the bedding had I wouldn t like to say what is was on as we was only staying for 3days due to it was a birthday celebration I didn t have the time to express my disappointment inn the room it had a big impact on our stay sadly
380066,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, We liked the rooms because the bed was comfy and there was a coffeemschine One time we had dinner in the hotel and we fell in love with the buffet sushi 
380067,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location was A bit out of the centre but easily accessible from tram so can t really complain, Breakfast buffet was great as was the shower facilities
380068,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Checked in 10am waited for 4 hrs to get room Then gave wrong room with someone already in 4pm didn t clean up room yet Requested wake up call but nothing done, Great location Very convenience for tram Just across street
380069,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Expensive breakfast as we did not get the 20 discount that I thought we had booked in advance online Trams easy to city centre Very dated all 70 s brown and mirrors Decent helpful staff 
380070,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, We stayed with small children teenager and elderly parents and we all enjoyed our stay Great location very easy to jump on to tram and get into city centre Staff were always helpful We had 3 different room types and they were all large modern and very clean Has a great lounge area we used to meet in or to hang out and play cards in Beds are super comfortable 
380071,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Only one corkscrew per hotel The only things they provided us with was stuff few people need shower caps ironing boards indvidual shampoo times 4 etc This was a bad choice for us based on good reviews from others I hope some will heed our advice , The shower 
380072,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We thought breakfast was included in the price but wasn t so had to pay extra for that, Great size room and shower area Great breakfast selection Great staff Fabulous location
380073,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, None , Not exactly the perfect location but having a stop of No 12 tram right in front of the hotel gate makes it super convenient Friendly staff helpful and patient Unbelievable breakfast buffet Satisfactory 
380074,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The mini bar was deleted from service throughout the hotel and therefore since the machines were not available a small fridge should have replaced them A self service drinks machine should also be installed alongside the existing snacks machine in the lobby Not everyone wants to buy a coke from the bar , Very good value for money buffet breakfast deal and an excellent self service with the most choices I have seen anywhere To add to all of this a very attentive waiting staff The 12 Tram to downtown one way and to the train station to the airport the other way is a huge plus When reception found out that we had come all the way from New Zealand a free upgrade to one of the huge corner double rooms was a very nice touch A very quiet modern and clean hotel Highly recommended 
380075,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The room was incredible Location was close to the center about a 15 minute drive The front desk staff were so helpful The restaurant was really good with many options and really good food They rented us bikes and we rode around the park which was right around the hotel Just a lovely trip overall 
380076,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The staff with the notable exception of Anna who worked in the bar and was lovely and another member of the catering staff whose name I don t know The reception desk staff were generally polite enough when they were actually dealing with you but they managed to make you feel invisible while you were waiting you never knew whether or not they had seen you and they often continued to talk among themselves one even continued to arrange piles of envelopes as we stood waiting at the desk The bed sheets weren t changed as often as was indicated in the hotel literature clean sheets were simply left piled on a bedroom chair and in the end we had to leave a note asking that they be changed Also the room could have been better dusted especially the window sill and the bathroom , The hotel was comfortable and good value for money Although not in the centre of Amsterdam it was well served by a tram route right outside the door which also provided easy access to from airport via local train station For both reasons we would stay there again 
380077,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, That the room was ICE COLD no one could turn off the air co and really no one staff wise cared , Rooms were very clean and large Breakfast was amazing Lovely older staff members who were helpful 
380078,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Ease of distance from solderdijk station and tram stops right outside hotel Hotel just fantastic one of the best we have stayed at will definitely be back
380079,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Front desk usually crowded could have used a concierge , Breakfast buffet was great easy to get into the city on the tram line which is directly outside 
380080,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Staff at check in a bit unhelpful as we had booked two double rooms but said none were available and tried to get us to have twins after a bit of a stand off two double surprisingly became available , Rooms very comfortable facilities really good
380081,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I had to get bed sheets changed as they were stained Room was very small for the money I paid location is two tram rides away from the square Fridge in the room is only for show The hot water was so hot ud get blisters and no way to turn temperature down , The internet was good
380082,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Didn t like that we couldn t open our window so our room was very stuffy even with air conditioning unit on, Breakfast was lovely Had something for everyone Staff went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome
380083,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The rooms were not properly checked One of the beds in the room had a missing leg causing the bed to tip over when rested onto the wrong corner The bathroom were also not properly cleaned as foundation powder could be found on the basin counter , Located very near the train station making travel between the airport and Amsterdam city center very convenient Staff were extremely friendly 
380084,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location is very unconventient It took 2 trams to get to the center And there nothing to do by the hotel The staff didn t try to help us in anyway , The room was nice and clean The beds very comfortable
380085,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I wish early check in was offered I know that if the hotel is fully booked it would be impossible But I don t believe it is an option My plane arrived at 7 am and I was exhausted after a 14 hour flight A bunch of Aussies also arrived at the same time different plane even longer flight At least the hotel kept our luggage for us I couldn t master the light rail system and spent 20 euros just getting back to the hotel via taxi , Very quiet clean comfortable room Liked the breakfast 
380086,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing , First of all this has been one of the best hotels we have stayed at great location and transport links to get into town Approx 10 euros by taxi uber Hotel is very modern and pretty much has anything you could think of Rooms are very big with excellent room service Staff are very friendly and are ready to help with any questions you have Would definitely stay here again 
380087,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Its a bit far from the city center about 25min on the tram which does leave directly opposite hotel , Staff were very good helpful buffet breakfast was huge with a awesome variety of food Hotel surroundings were very quiet 
380088,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Just inform tourists a little better about what to do for one day in Amsterdam I travelled with my 80 year old Mum and we ended up in Dam Square which was not a good location for an elderly person , The food the comfort room the taxi drivers so helpful the tram drivers so helpful German speaking television for my Mum the 12 pm discharge room was ready for us well before 2 pm coffee mashine did not work someone showed us immediately etc
380089,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Everything about this hotel is fantastic from checking in the room facilities location food Would strongly recommend this for a slightly out of town location only 15 minutes on the tram but good location for the station so you can get around more of The Netherlands e g Haarlem is only 10 minutes away by train 
380090,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Far from centre Had to take two lines on the tram However stop was right outside hotel door , Very comfortable room Reasonable price Tram right outside of front door to take you to city centre Quiet location 
380091,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location is not very convenient for traveler without car But anyway there is a tram 12 you can take in front of the hotel It may not be direct to your destination , The room is nice and big The coffee machine in room can make really good coffee Staff are friendly and helpful 
380092,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Just a little out of the way But getting to downtown Amsterdam was easy enough considering there is a tram station immediately outside the front door of the hotel , Everything about this hotel was great The bed was comfortable the room was spacious the staff were friendly and provided timely assistance and the restaurant buffet was outstanding Best buffet I have had anywhere 
380093,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, In a 4 star hotel and by price 109 EUR per double room per night I expect little bit more for example free parking this was for 15 EUR per car , Clean quiet room large bathroom
380094,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location is quite far 20 30 min from the centre though there is a tram stop immediately in front of the hotel Not so easy to come back to late at night without uber or taxi Stained duvet covers , Large bright and airy room big clean bathroom with great shower and warm floor 
380095,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing , The location was maybe not the most suitable for those who like to be close to the crowd and night life in the center but for us was this the perfect choice The location itself was in a quite part of the city with green and a tram stop in almost direct neighborhood 
380096,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Wifi was weak, Hotel and room facilities excellent staff very friendly and helpful location little way out however tram stop 12 immediately outside hotel was excellent to get around
380097,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The whole hotel was lovely well decorated and inviting Rooms were cleaned daily including fresh towels Complementory toiletries in the room and the bed was extremely comfortable Our room was available before check in time and staff were very friendly and helpful explaining which trams to use along with providing maps We found the location absolutely fine given we spent the majority of our time in the centre probably 15 minutes travel time in total via trams Computers were available to use for free so we could print our boarding passes off Did not have breakfast or use the restaurant but I can imagine it would be lovely given the standards of the rest of the hotel Will 100 be returning 
380098,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The beds were two singles pushed together with two single duvets so could not sleep next to my partner The tv was certainly not satellite and only had about 5 English channels Mini bar was not working, Nice and clean and decor was very plush Much better than the holiday in express I stayed in last time I was there Would stay again 
380099,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Beds were two singles pushed together not a double Sheets were dirty when we first arrived but I mentioned it to staff and they were changed and it was fine then , Staff were very pleasant Nice hotel Good location in relation to tram stops just outside Amsterdam has great transport system so it worked out fine You wouldn t really walk it though from Centraal 
380100,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, bed are too firm square pillow is horrible all my friends are having neck pain on next morning staff couldn t do anything about it as its their standard no option of pillows or beds as its their standard , location is ok if you take uber 
380101,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, all bed are too firm square pillow either too high or not enough filling combining wont give you a good sleep had 2 bad night sleep with pain in my neck on next morning , Breakfast is good
380102,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location not the best if you want to go out to eat nothing much close by as far as we could tell , Comfortable spacious room Very luxurious bathroom loved the shower Staff friendly and helpful Easy to get into the city Tram stop right on the doorstep Room service pizzas good value and tasty 
380103,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The breakfast was very expensive especially if you did not book prior to the stay , The quality of the room and the bathroom was great and very modern 
380104,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, We had an Nespresso machine in the room with complimentary coffee capsules and 180 window view The room and bathroom were spatious and quiet The hotel is periferal to the city Centrum and main attraction but just take tram 12 literally at the door of the hotel and be in the city centre in less than 20 min 
380105,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No English breakfast T bags was disappointing and water not provided in bottles at all wasn t sure if we could drink tap water or not , Beds were very comfy Room was great for family of four with teenager also and plenty of space for us all 
380106,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There s no water exit in the bathroom the floor just flooded When we store our luggage after our check out the staff told us to move faster as she has many other things to do that s so unfriendly ,No Positive
380107,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Ran out of umbrellas for guest use , The staff on the reception were extremely nice and went out of their way to assist our every need The rooms were a good size and very clean 5mins by train to Central Station or jump on the tram 12 literally outside of the hotel to the museum quarter 
380108,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Great location Easy access to the highway 25 meters from the tram and an easy ride into Amsterdam Beautiful room Secure on site parking for a reasonable fee 
380109,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Bed comfy rooms huge good staff very helpful bar could be a little cheaper as it is quite away from city centre but all in all will be staying here again next time I m in Amsterdam
380110,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The reception staff may learn to smile occasionally We had issues on room allocation and on breakfast which we had to resolve ourselves with no assistance from the poor reception staff, The hotel was roomy clean and good value for money The chamber maids and general staff were very good 
380111,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Was far away from the center Sure you can check the map in advance but was worse as I have expected In the information about the hotel they forgot to tell that parking costs extra money 30 euro for 2days and they are not responsible for the cars Amsterdam is an expensive place so difficult to find a good deal But if you want to see the city it is not an option , Hotel is very clean Rooms are the same like in photos 
380112,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Our bed had a broken leg at the headboard so you kept sliding toward your head all night In fairness we never called the desk as it was late when we got checked in and we knew the hotel was full However I cannot imagine how housekeeping could have changed the sheets and not noticed Only other complaint was we were told there was a full breakfast including omelettes pancakes and bacon starting at 0630 We had to leave early for our train so this was ideal Unfortunately the Chef clearly had other plans The bacon that was put out was almost raw and when asked about pancakes he snapped back it is too early this was at 07 00 , Front Desk staff and bar staff were very helpful and extremely polite Room was spotless and a decent size for a quadruple Although away from downtown core they have excellent access to public transit and you are downtown in less than 10 minutes stress free 
380113,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Staff not the most attentive Bed linen was stained and not replaced for a few days toiletries not always replenished No fridge in room only vending machine, Large comfortable room for long stay 13 nights Perfect location for work
380114,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, When the hotel got more busy the staff in the restaurant seemed overwhelmed The food at the breakfast buffet was not being replenished as needed and plates weren t being picked up , Hotel has a good location with easy access to both airport and tourist area The team stops right in front of the hotel The rooms are clean and suprisingly large The room with 2 double beds they were queen size beds was easily able to accommodate our family of 4 2 adults and 2 kids 7 and 10 Very clean facilities Value for money was good during the week but the price increased drastically for the weekend Breakfast was very good 
380115,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, well the surroundings of the hotel are very ugly there is nothing to it but I believe this is not the hotel s fault, good breakfast and dinner buffet rooms very comfortable and clean very convenient to get to and from airport 
380116,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location staff and lack of consideration, This location is 40 minutes away from the city center by tram Yes the tram stops in front of the hotel but for visiting various places we had to make change and it took us a good hour to reach our destination The front desk was not friendly at all when we checked in and since there were 3 people staying in one room and there was only one set of towel we called and asked for more towels we were told to go and get it ourselves I made this booking well in advance and were given first floor rooms facing the taxi and tram station right above the bar Needless to say the noise did not make us happy
380117,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location was a bit out of the way we had to get a tram to the centre Bar service can be a bit slow at times Also a bit expensive but no more so that the other hotels in what is an expensive city , Very good comfortable and spotless rooms and hotel Probably the best bed I have ever slept in Friendly and helpful staff couldn t do enough to help Bonus marks for superfast WiFi Can t recommend enough 
380118,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Lack of facilities I e gym work out area Something other than a vending machine if you wanted something slightly healthier Fruit, Hotel was clean and staff friendly Transportation in and out of city centre very good
380119,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, i did not find anything wrong except I would rather have bottled water in the room than tea and coffee machine , Busy popular hotel but relaxed and quiet for a good night s sleep Hotel is not central but 2 mins on the tram and you are there the tram stop is straight outside the hotel Food excellent especially breakfast 
380120,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It s quite a walk to Amsterdam centre but there s a tram that stops in front of the hotel 7 50e for a 24hr ticket Some of the staff were busy and so appeared quite dismissive and reluctant to help , The staff were more then happy to help and the room was everything you d expect from a 4 star 
380121,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Wanted to get something and was informed that the Room Service is available from 9 00 AM onwards Very strange , Everything was perfect Location Just at the tram station Check in check out Reasonably fast Amenities All the essentials are available Room Very clean sufficient space and furniture Iron is a bonus Breakfast Both taste and choice of menu are perfect JUST DELICIOUS How to reach is well prepared with multiple options 
380122,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Rooms where amazing cosy and comfy with plenty of space and finished to a high standard especially the bathroom the hotel staff where nice and helpful and the location was great as the tram stop was just outside the hotel 
380123,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The mini bar machines in the rooms they are vending machines and no fridges The drinks are not cold and are out of date Tip dont get cold drinks sodas from the bar or machines 2 50 for a 200ml bottle Go down to the car park use the vending machine for the same price get a 500ml bottle Also the resturant is only a bjffett style for 29 50 felt the place was a little expensive but nice if you want something special , This hotel is a nice hotel comfortable and easy access to the city centre via the tram outside by a day ticket from the tram ticket guy take tram 12 for about 5 stops change to tram 13 and bingo your at central station 
380124,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I couldn t find any fault, Room was very nice clean Staff were really helpful friendly Didn t use the restaurant this time but probably would in the future The tram stop was right outside I would definately stay here again 
380125,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Chicken sausage processed meat and Processed ham and chicken on the cold meat section Storage cupboard in the room are way too high to reach , Location and cleanliness of the hotel 
380126,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Our room was at the end of the hotel very quite but had a step as soon as you got in the room just in front of the bathroom which could have been a bit dangerous in the dark if you got up to go the toilet and forgot about it sure all rooms are not like this but it did not spoil our stay would recommend this hotel, The buffet breakfast and buffet evening meal was incredible value for money 
380127,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The breakfast was expensive although the range of food was very good You would have to eat a lot to get value for money Apart from this I couldn t fault the hotel and its staff although in terms of value for money I feel there is room for improvement , I enjoyed the free upgrade to comfort room The bedroom was very comfortable and together with a firm mattress made for a good nights sleep The room was clean and finished to a very high standard The bathroom was immaculate and contained a lovely walk in shower The staff were very friendly and helpful and I would stay again on account of its location and its transport links 
380128,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A little far from the center of city Mattresses not that comfortable and the bottom sheets did not stay tucked in especially if you pulled out the top covers so your feet wouldn t be mashed down , Using the room key to turn on the electric and then save electricity was fabulous Also first time I have ever seen doorbells at a hotel but really cool 
380129,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, N A, Really enjoyed the buffet breakfast as well as transport links into central amsterdam There was a couple of supermarkets not too far from the hotel as well
380130,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Staff could smile more and be friendlier, Bed was comfortable and facilities were modern We had a large window with a great view The tram was right outside the hotel so made travelling very easy We would stay here again 
380131,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Curtains don t close properly lot of light comes into the room, Very close to the train station just a 5min walk nice location next to a park and easy to reach the city center
380132,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Wifi didn t work some of the time Room was very small No other restaurant options nearby other than the one in the hotel , Great coffee machine in the room and nice buffet dinner at the hotel restaurant Quiet Location had its advantages for our purposes in that it was close to the Sloderdijk train station but out of the hustle and bustle of being near the Amsterdam central station We spent our 2 days in Netherlands going to some other towns Haarlem and Delft west of Amsterdam so the location worked fine for that And it was still a quick 19 min direct trip between Sloderdijk station to the airport 
380133,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Sheets only changed every other day, Tram directly outside hotel makes it very easy to get to dam Nice option allows you to see more of Amsterdam than being in central Rooms are lovely and come with coffee machines 
380134,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Advertised free parking nearby the hotel but turned out there isn t such an option and had to pay for parking at the hotel , Excellent breakfast the rooms are nice and cozy the tram stop is right by the hotel easy access to the city center and museums 
380135,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The lack of mirrors when sharing a room amongst three people Terrible lighting The room was so dark you couldn t get ready very easily , Lovely size room and really comfortable Bathrooms spacious and clean 
380136,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Limited food options especially for Kids , We are family of 2 adult and 2 young kids hence we took family room Room was really spacious comfortable and clean Staff was very friendly and Tram station is just in front of hotel and it takes 20 mins to reach center with one change Also park in front of hotel was amazing You get best of both world Close to nature and easy commute to city center for numerous activities 
380137,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We had an interesting experience with a staff member in the bar who outright asked us for a tip He later claimed it was because many people think it s included on the bill but either way we felt it rather rude to ask , Great amenities at the hotel on site buffet restaurant bar etc and right outside is the stop for the number 12 tram which is 20 30 mins into town centre
380138,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No drinking water available in the room Only drinks from the fridge , Room Breakfast Staff Earplugs offered for better sleep in the room were a precious item not for the hotel but for the future flight 
380139,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location is quite far from Amsterdam central The price is quite high , The bathroom is great and the front desk staffs are very friendly and helpful 
380140,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Would have liked just a simple breakfast option rather than a 15 euro buffet , Staff was excellent Helped us rent bikes and chart a route Helped us select museum passes for the family 
380141,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Staff was very accommodating Nice room with lots of amenities 8 min walk 5 min train ride from Amsterdam Central Station which saves 200 night 
380142,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Little exspensive, The room was nice and the location was fantastic so easy to find and convinient however the hotel was a little on the exspensive side
380143,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, all first of all the location is FAR AWAY from the center 2 buses for arriving in downtown with 20 minutes of waiting in between therefore you need one hour to get to down town or back to the hotel therefore often we had to use taxi especially in the evening Regarding the staff only one boy with glasses was nice and useful he suggested me to buy the bus card ALL the other Ladies were awful unpleasant gross and completely useless pillows were HUGE and we couldn t sleep properly I had to sleep without any pillow because of course at the reception said there were no other type the phone between rooms was not working and they never fix it we were traveling with my old father and I had to go up and down several times every day in order to share info or going out in at the same time we asked to change room in order to be at the same floor and of course it was not possible even if we offer to pay the difference The breakfast in general the quality is not too bad but the cleaning is VERY BAD They put fruits on different shelf the first morning one apple fell into the yogurt bowl and the guy put is hand without any gloves inside the yogurt bowl in order to remove the apple I couldn t believe to my eyes few minutes before he was removing dirty dishes from the tables a Russian lady with long hair were touching bread with her hair I told it to the guy and nothing happen , NONE
380144,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Car park paid separately , Very modern hotel Easy access to the centre Wide food selection for breakfast Everything fresh and delicious Underground car park 
380145,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It would be nice if breakfast was included or at least cheaper , Really nice and comfortable rooms good location a few blocks away from the train station and just in front of a tram stop makes it very comfortable to get to the city center Great service and attention 
380146,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The room itself was a bit small Little space to move around the bed Not really a workspace area , Clean room nice spacious bathroom comfortable beds Friendly staff good breakfast 
380147,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Needed Minibar at room Hotel Kitchen closes at 10 00pm and there is not chance to have anything to eat except though the BAR very limited selection until morning, Very Calm Location Comfortable beds Coffee machine in room 
380148,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We had a 2 room reservation One of the rooms was very small and requested for that room to be changed The staff went out of their way not to accomodate us on a different room First they claimed not to have a room available then that they did but had to wait hours to be changed but we had to leave the room immediately Finally they wanted to charge 15 euros because the coffe machine had been used Manager Janine Zooties stated that she did not care about me complaining because all complaints went to her She refused to give me her last name and said that it was a very difficult name I would not recommend this hotel I do travel a lot and would not return to this hotel ,No Positive
380149,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, In general i was very happy with my stay The only thing that i may complain about is the weak internet connection in the rooms However the hotel offers a beautiful spacious hall for the guests to use public computers and facilities So i can not say internet was a drop out criteria , Newly updated comfortable rooms very friendly staff beautiful buffet breakfast easy with public transportation 
380150,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A bit far from the city center in an industrial district without places to visit in this price breakfast should be included , Big room comfortable bed huge and clean bathroom tram stop right outside the hotel 
380151,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Just wish it was located closer to city center Wish they had a shuttle from airport, Tram stop outside the hotel door Picture of room exactly like advertised
380152,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Check in could have been a bit faster, enjoyed the convenience of taking the tram right outside the front of the hotel The room was spacious very clean 
380153,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We went for a buffet dinner and there wasn t much of a selection left and the staff were taking the labels away so we didn t know what some of the dishes were I have gluten intolerance So very disappointed , The reception staff were amazing Very helpful and knowledgeable 
380154,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No complimentary water Expected this as a basic as it is available in almost all other similar hotels Would be nice to have more options for A la Carte dinner , Great location very easy to take a tram or metro as it is well connected Spacious clean room Very friendly staff 
380155,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Outside the hotel is the tram stop the main tram train station is 10 mins away by tram The room was very clean great bed opt for the food offers good quality food this hotel is a good standard and we would stay again
380156,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We didn t book to stay longer, Can t fault this place at all myself and my partner stayed here last week 6 9th the staff were all lovely and friendly and the hotel is amazing Molenwerf where the hotel is situated is a lovely place and there s a tram stop opposite the hotel so getting around and into the centre is easy sloterdijk station is just a short walk around the corner aswell We will definitely be returning 
380157,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, It was very good clean and it have a great location just in front of a Tram Stop We really enjoy our stay here and it would be lovely to come back sometime The staff was very kind the food Dinner and Breakfast was AMAZING Thank you Golden Tulip for a gorgeous stay in Amsterdam 
380158,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only negative thing I could say is that I think the bar closes too early And one morning we left the hotel at half 11 and a room close to ours had left their room service plates outside the room and when we returned at 9 30 they were still there, The staff were so friendly The free wifi is a bonus also and the wifi was really fast 
380159,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, During the check in the receptionist saw that I was with my girlfriend She didn t have the perception and or consideration to ask if we preffered a double bedroom or even offer a bigger bedroom if I paid more She just gave me the keys and smiled professionaly When I arrived at my room I was very disappointed because She put us in a room with two single beds Very strange for a 4 stars hotel not asking the guest what is best for him I tried to ask if it was possible to change the room but the receptionists were rude and said that today they couldn t do anything only tomorrow I felt that they didn t care about my complain and didn t want to solve my problem In order to not screwing my special holiday with my girlfriend it was brazilian valentine s day June 12th I decided to stay in the room and create no problem The wifi connection was horrible The signal was very low and the support was not helpful For an alleged 4 stars hotel it is a shame not to provide a stable and fast wifi connection to all guests Airports who has thousands of people everyday do it smoothly and efficiently Capital expenditures must be directed to IT infrastructure in order to solve this I was mad because I couldn t contact my familly neither watch my favorite videos channels on YouTube tv channels were not enough The towels were dirty they had a strong smell grotty We had to dry ourselves with the face towel I was affraid to call the receptionist and be charged by asking a new towel No open frigobar was available No microwave was available It is not nice to be obliged to eat in the hotel restaurant as a 4 stars hotel you should at least dispose a common place for people to heat their meals How do people with special diets do How mothers can heat their baby food The beverage machine available was broke I couldn t even buy a bottle of water , The bed was very comfortable The shower was good also 
380160,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Too far from centre Had to take two trams as the local tram didn t go near the centre Only 15 18 euros for a taxi so we chose that , Lovely hotel great staff food was amazing and prices were reasonable 
380161,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, 1 During check in got the feeling that they wanted to get us off of their desk asap 2 The hotel is far away from the city centre will take a day to get your head around the tram system 3 The reception staff was not friendly 4 Asked for a universal plug via phone I was asked to come to reception only to be told that there are no plugs available 4 Asked for an ice bucket got a few pieces of ice in a plastic bag , The room was clean Bed was comfortable
380162,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Charging extra for breakfast if you do not book and pay at check in time is not too friendly if you are staying at this hotel , This hotel was in a great location Only 10 mins to the city and a tram was just outside the door We found our way from the airport to the hotel by train and tram quite easily Its friendly and has a good breakfast on offer however make sure to take up the offer of booking for a breakfast when checking in as the price goes up slightly if you go in for breakfast the next day 
380163,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I cannot think of anything , Very nice and convenient to center of the city Great walking trail to Hop on Hop Off bus and canal rides Rooms clean and nicely appoonted Breakfast very good 
380164,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I liked everything , Very easy to get to from the airport the tram stops right outside the hotel and then one tram change will take you right into the centre of Amsterdam Nice bar and restaurant would definately use this hotel again 
380165,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The room was like a closet much too small window only in a corner so was very dark The dinner hostess ruined the impression of the staff others were quite nice and helpful she was condescending and unfriendly , Bathroom restaurant bar area reception 
380166,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The shower was a bit too hot and we couldn t work out how to turn it to a cooler setting , The very helpful staff made our day when we needed help tracking down or luggage from the airline 
380167,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Because of the buffet I found the menu options were very limited and I didn t want to pay for the buffet so it was less than ideal , If I liked buffets this place would be amazing So much good food but I don t eat that much so it wasn t great for me If I had a big appetite or was traveling with teenagers then I would definitely recommend this place 
380168,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The Tram stops right outside the hotel so very convenient to get into city centre and also to train station for airport without city center prices It is a very quiet location The room was very spacious reception very friendly and helpful and amenities great Would definitely stay here again 
380169,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Staff friendly and welcoming Room very spacious and clean Every little detail thought of even down to the toiletries in the bathroom Slippers provided Hotel a 10 min walk to the station where Dam central is about a 12 min ride or the tram stops directly outside the hotel Not a lot to do in the area but it is quiet and very central to Amsterdam Den Haag and Rotterdam 
380170,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The member of staff who checked me in didn t really know what he was doing He was obviously new which isn t a problem but it felt like he hadn t received any training either on the technical side of things nor in respect of how to engage with a customer , One of the best hotel breakfasts I ve had in a while in terms of variety choice and quality Very comfortable bed and pillows Most of the staff were excellent 
380171,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Service doesn t match the one of a 4 star hotel Bathropes are 25 EUR day which is ridiculous Food delivery wasn t allowed to deliver to the room I had to come downstairs I understand the security reasons but in that case they should have someone following the delivery guy to the room instead of insisting on the guest coming to the reception , Great location nice rooms 
380172,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The tram stops right in front of the hotel which makes it very convenient even if located away from the city center The Breakfast is superb with an array of choices 
380173,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Very cosy staff where extremely friendly Out of the whole trip we had the best customer service from the hotel If we was to return we would defiantly stay here again 
380174,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I was dissapointed by missing shower gel and shampoo in the room but this hotel is considered as 4 starts , I like hotel staff food and location 15 minutes from the center of the city by tram In future planning to stay in this hotel every my visit 
380175,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The staff were helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean and spacious there was a hairdryer iron and ironing board in the rooms which was a bonus 
380176,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, our in room fridge vending machine didn t work but that didn t bother us , right across the road from a tram stop comfortable rooms and beds great shower great value coffee espresso in the room the panel to indicate do not disturb door bell clean was impressive we were on the first floor 
380177,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel s location was awful Contrary to advertised the hotel is not close at all to the city centre and you have to take two trams and at least 35 minutes to get there There is no urban life around the hotel no shops no pharmacies no caf s no grocery stores no bakeries no nothing The hotel s breakfast is too crowded and well below the level one would expect from a presumed 4 star hotel simply tasteless food straight from the supermarket box To finalize the hotel was way too expensive for what it offers Better go for an airport hotel and take the train everyday to the city ,No Positive
380178,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, air conditioning is noisy cleaning not very up to standard, the nespresso coffee machine in room made good coffee the young receptionist was very helpful
380179,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Items for the tea coffee were in short supply most days , We had a triple room good size comfortable beds tea coffee facilities which was a bonus All in all a very nice hotel and breakfast choice was excellent 
380180,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The restaurant we had lunch at we were suppose to catch a taxi at 3 00 n we were there at 1 20 n by 2 45 still can t get even one of the food we order so needed to cancel cause need to catch a pkane suggestion if in a hurry font eat there ,No Positive
380181,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The hotel itself is a bit outside of the main city centre but very accessible with the tram lines located just outside the hotel The staff particularly at reception were extremely friendly and very helpful The free Wifi was quite good and the rooms were a decent size for European standards 
380182,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Very small room The ceiling low The windows dirty and weren t cleaned for very long time Old furniture The soap was only liquid soap and very hard to use The door didn t get locked when we get out and the didn t fix it , The breakfast was very good 
380183,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Air conditioning in my room was so noisy then I must switch off for the night Which is not awesome when you can t open windows and is 25 degrees and sunny outside Also minibar wasn t working so if you need drink 2 am you are unlucky Minibar will tell you no server connection It wasn t fixed for duration of all my stay , Hotel is quite nice It s old but refurbished so it s comfortable Staff is nice and helpful Location is ok ish if you know what I mean If you like long walks and public transport you will be fine Also closeness to Amsterdam Sloterdijk station is quite handy And of course coffee machine does really nice coffee 
380184,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only draw back is that it is a little far out of town requiring you to either swap trams or have a decent walk to Sloterdijk train Station , Good hotel in itself we have been before It s friendly clean comfortable and good food 
380185,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location is too far to walk to the central square However there is a tram right outside that goes straight to Dam Square , The staff was extremely helpful We arrived from the US early in the morning long before check in time The staff worked diligently to get us into a room as soon as one was ready 
380186,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No minibar in room it was empty also room service stops at 10 30pm It could have been a little lafter more like 1am ironing table also collapsed mid ironing , Our room was lovely Great hotel and the location is not too bad either Breakfast has a lot of choice and the staff are all very friendly 
380187,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The website led us to believe that breakfast served was included in the price not separate, The staff were incredibly friendly the rooms are spacious and stylish 
380188,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We thought the room was a bit too hot at night and the water in the shower didn t run away quickly enough so we ended up with a flooded bathroom floor , Evening meal was very nice and great value staff were friendly and helpful would definitely stay here again
380189,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Would have liked if you could have ordered food after 3pm that wasn t just fries or a slice of pizza but that is a very minor thing Location suited us fine as tram stop right outside hotel and we enjoy walking also but may be too far out for some however very handy for airport too , The rooms were very comfortable spacious nicely decorated and exceptionally clean Loved the coffee machine in room Bathrooms very spacious clean with great shower Beds very comfortable too Also handy that you could plug your USB cable directly into wall socket for charging phone and there were UK plugs too so no need to take travel adaptors Friendly and helpful staff Breakfast really good and great value for money lots of choice 
380190,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Availability of late night food I had my room cleaned one day and all they did was make bed and clean bathrooms Empty wine bottles glasses were left and some magazine on floor not lifted up , Reception very helpful Felt safe as solo traveller 
380191,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It would have been nice if they have a wellness area at the hotel where one could enjoy a relaxing massage etc after a long day of sight seeing An indoor pool would also be perfect too Just another tiny recommendation It would really be nice to keep the hotel s reputation if the public toilets be kept clean all the time though this is really hard i guess and the hallways be vacuumed regularly too I guess this is also a bit challenging on the hotel s part for it means hiring more housekeeping staffs , The hotel is located a bit outside of the center which was really nice coz you re outside the noise and hassle of the city We were really surprise that we didn t have a hard time in reaching and looking for the property It was a 10 min ride with the train from the airport to Station Sloterdeijk and from there we walked to the hotel It wasn t really far 5 10 mins walk with our luggage You can also take a tram from the train station which is only a stop away The tram stop Molenwerf is right in front of the hotel We booked a comfort double room which was really very comfortable The room was big and it had the all the necessary little things you might need from sleepers to nail files They had a Nespresso machine in the room and an iron and ironing board too which made our trip extra comfortable We also had breakfast in the hotel everyday and costs 12 per person per day which was really not bad They had a very good spread for breakfast On our first night we had the dinner buffet wich costs 29 50 per person including drinks It might be a bit pricy for some but considering that all drinks are included is not really bad at all We ll definitely stay again in this property on our next trip to Amsterdam and is highly recommended for those who wants to explore the Amsterdam during the day and have some quiet and relaxing time in the evening 
380192,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Night staff were a little less helpful to a couple of our group when they came back late looking for food The other half of the group found takeaway food not far from hotel but staff said nothing local and would have to go back to city Shots not really great and not worth the money Would stick with normal alcohol if a little pricey but it s hotel so expected , Staff more than helpful before we got there and also during our stay Always with a smile on their face very important as the organiser to know the group would be looked after Facilities and free wifi great Easy access to trams into Amsterdam not direct to airport but not a problem for us 
380193,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Some brwakfast options missing like meat and chicken meals Nobody to assist with laggage during chexk in and check out , The rooms are nice cleana and everything works The brakfast was a huge buffet with good variety 
380194,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Though the location is near train station 15 min walk there are very little options to eat out , The rooms were pretty spacious Comfortable and clean 
380195,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Sad that room service ends at 11pm especially since we checked in at 12am after a long train trip however the after hours pizza place they recommend is absolutely tasty , We stayed here for 3 nights and everything about this hotel was amazing staff were friendly cleanliness was to very high standards and it is close to a tram stop and a train station Golden Tulip are a fantastic hotel chain we looked forward to staying at the one near Rome airport after this wonderful experience 
380196,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room was too hot but we opened windows at night Biggest difficulty was that the shower was hard to adjust with the two dials It was too hot most of the time That could be in the USA shower controls are different but it would have been helpful if in the hotel black book directions were printed out , Bed was comfortable room was nice and large with good views and many windows Bathroom lovely 
380197,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel s email a few days prior to our stay advised us to get of the tram at a stop that had been removed and replaced by one even closer to the hotel but with a different name This resulted in some confusion for us and a walk back to the hotel from the next stop on , Clean modern and comfortable hotel Tram stop Line 12 right on the doorstep and also just one tram stop from Sloterdijk train station
380198,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We only stayed for three days at the Golden Tulip and we didn t try the breakfast nor the dinner because we wanted to explore other restaurants and cafes in Amsterdam although I m I m pretty sure they were pretty high standard and good value So the only thing we didn t like was that we couldn t find many other good restaurants in the neighborhood so you will have to head down closer to city center to find some But then there s plenty downtown too So if you want to dine and eat breakfast close by I d recommend eating at the hotel , We were so pleasantly surprised to get a big comfy corner room with lots of windows We actually got the room described in the deal and in the photos Because sometimes the descriptions can be misleading The hotel had great and helpful staff too Location was close to and only walking distance from the train station so it s super easy to catch the train to Faster and cheaper than bus and taxi Hotel was only 15 20 min tram ride away from city center so if you prefer a hotel in a quiet neighborhood I d recommend this one Nearest tram stop is right across the street too 
380199,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location being out of the centre but all of our group were impressed by the quality of the hotel for the money we paid , We stayed for a stag weekend and although quite a way out of the staff were great whilst they served us a few beers as we waited for the tram which stops right outside the hotel 
380200,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The bedroom did not have sufficient lighting to read in bed Also the bathroom doorway had a marble edge that was easy to hit with your foot at night ouch But most shocking was the terrible bar food which was the only place you could eat for lunch While the restaurant food for breakfast and dinner was clearly a 10 the bar food was just the opposite just plain nasty , They offered a fantastic dinner buffet called The Dream It was by far the best dinner buffet we ve had in years with all sorts of fresh seafood meats salads and desserts for a great price It was a dream come true 
380201,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing I did not have breakfast , Nice view from large comfort double room on sixth floor Quiet room Walking distance from train station is acceptable about 10 min Good air conditioning Good WiFi 
380202,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was no in room drinks available at all the machine had broke in all rooms that served cola drinking water beer etc and they didn t bother putting in mini fridges and had no back up plan for this , Excellent loaction wise so easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam via the number 12 then 13 tram 
380203,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Didn t get double bed requested as requests can t be guaranteed staff offered upgrade to double bed in larger room for 10 per night, Location excellent for travelling to Amsterdam
380204,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It s A Bit Far To Walk To Amsterdam centre But If You Go Around The Back of the Hotel It s a Lovly Little Walk Through Westenpark, The Hotel Was Absoloutly Amazing so Clean And Fresh Lovly bathroom Too And good Size Rooms 
380205,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The minibar the workers in the restaurant at the buffet breakfast and dinner the lack of interest in your wishes when you book the room, The comphy bed the receptionists the breackfast the air conditioning the heated floor in the bathroom the Nespresso machine 
380206,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A bit far from the city But the tram station is only 1 2 mins away It takes about 30 minutes to get into town included the waiting time , The staffs are very friendly and willing to help If you don t have any clue about Amsterdam they can help The hotel is clean beds are comfy wifi is great Early check in is possible if the room is available You can also leave the baggage at the hotel after check out My family really had a great time here 
380207,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There is no concierge in the hotel so everyone must wait in a long very slow moving line to ask simple questions some of the staff were rude not willing to give directions tourist information Rude staff The older barman was rude ignored our repeated requests at the bar for our bill i e afternoon snack he just walked away from us when we asked a third time Also one staff member on the front responded to a query about cost of parking nothing is free in this world only the sunrise We asked for an extra bed were given a larger room instead at an additional cost but NO HELP to move rooms We had pack up and bring our luggage to reception before we left on our tour 7 45am That evening we had to collect our bags and find our own way to the room plus the key didn t work so we d another trip to reception and waited in line again , Comfortable beds very clean bathroom shower close to tram lines so relatively easy access to some of the tourist attractions
380208,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I booked a room which stated that i recieved a bathrobe and slippers which i paid the extra money for the room but was told i had to pay for these when we arrived it should state this on the time of booking and on booking com as it is a false statement on which is included in the room , Room was lovely and comfortable food was to die for Over all an excellent hotel 
380209,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Staff service could have been better For example I asked for some extra pillows for the bed as had a bad sleep the first night I was told that they cannot provide spare pillows as the hotel don t have any spares Which I find very hard to believe , Tram stop was right outside the hotel Rooms and hotel was generally very clean and well presented 
380210,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The elevators were often quite busy only two for 7 floors , The evening buffet and breakfast buffet were were a mixture of Continental and Asian cuisine which were excellent Plus a discount if booking dinners before 4 pm The Staff was very efficient and very helpful Our room was clean and facilities were updated Tram stop directly outside the hotel door was so convenient It is a very quiet part of town and close to the airport as well 
380211,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Fantastic hotel very clean quiet yet not far from city Comfy room and staffs were friendly Convenient location with metro and train station within walking distance
380212,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, everything was preety good and we were very happy with our stay , We got early check inn upon request staffs were friendly room was very big and comfortable breakfast spread was very impressive as well 
380213,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A bit too far out Only 1 tram passes so takes a little longer to get to places as a switch to another tram is normally required Some mornings there was a queue for pancakes , Lovely room bathroom with a fabulous shower Lots of choice in the buffet breakfast 
380214,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Our mini bar didn t work for some reason , Staff was very nice and friendly especially receptionists they were very helpful and friendly Room was very nice and clean 
380215,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room abit small but nothing else was wrong excellent room , The staff was excellent The receptionist was a very nice girl very prudent and can speak fluent english 
380216,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The staffs are not efficient its our turn to check in but the girl asked us to wait for a short while and we waited at least 30 mins for her to come back Her colleagues saw us waiting but no one offers help all they said is please wait , Good location Although it s not in the central but it s very easy to get around via Tram 
380217,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Lots of building work going on around the hotel From early morning not great if you have the window open , beautiful hotel friendly staff comfy beds and the bathrooms were lovely so clean 
380218,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Electronic Minibar like vendor machine out of order even though a pre deposit was filed upon check in Room rates inappropriately high hotel far outside, Super nice employees at the reception
380219,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I wouldn t go as far as to say I didn t like it but thought it would be better if there was some light snack type meals served beyond 3pm similar to that served up until 3pm You could buy a slice of pizza fries and a couple of other things but not huge choice and sometimes if travelling with kids it would be handy To be honest though more often than not we would be in the city centre at that time of the day and not use this but others with younger children might The night we were going to the airport it would have been good though , The rooms were very large and clean with nice decor and lovely bathrooms Beds were very comfortable and great to have a nespresso coffee machine in room The buffet breakfast was excellent and good value for money Staff all very friendly and helpful Very good location coming to and from airport and only a couple of tram stops away to the various attractions Would definitely recommend and book this hotel again 
380220,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The staff at the reception could have been more polite towards the guests But I guess they were overworked Most of the front office staff we interacted with were nice except for a middle aged lady present during the day She could be more attentive and less rude , The hotel has good facilities and is very clean Thumbs up for the housekeeping staff The room was cleaned everyday and supplies were replenished It near a tram Station 
380221,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Would have liked simpler breakfast or snack options other than restaurant Didn t love the breakfast, Staff was great Room was spacious Easy access to airport and action Early check in made our stay perfect
380222,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We were asked to talk quieter while we were at the bar by a woman staff member we were a group of 7 people celebrating a birthday Prior to being asked to talk quieter the had been 19 hen party and 8 Irish men on a stag party at the bar They were not told to talk quieter Also our booking was incorrect when we arrived I had modified my booking and received conformation of the amendment from 6 guest to 7 guest Yet when we arrived only 6 guests were booked and we had to wait for them to add an extra bed, Very friendly check in staff bar staff and housekeeping staff Luxury hotel and lovely facilities
380223,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Check in and out was very slow and overall I felt the hotel was very over priced for its location , The beds were comfy and the room clean and quiet The bathrooms were nice and the breakfast very extensive 
380224,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Staff were helpful so long as you didn t ask for too much , Our room was good although when we asked for a double instead of a twin we got a very blunt no Newly renovated hotel so everything was new but certain aspects not 100 finished Breakfast was good 
380225,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No complaints There is road construction in front of the hotel making the noise level a little higher but that was not caused by the hotel , Very good breakfast buffet The No 12 tram was 100 yards from the hotel making all of Amsterdam accessible 
380226,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The breakfast was very pricey at 15 Euros per person per morning We wanted to have breakfast every day but couldn t afford it as it would have cost nearly as much as the room for the 5 nights cost , Very friendly staff big spacious and comfortable rooms 5 mins tram ride from the centre 
380227,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only issue we had was the location It was a little too far away from the centre A lot of money was spent on transport Ended up renting bikes , The hotel was beautiful and the staff were happy to help Nothing was too much trouble 
380228,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, Excellent staff clean facilities extra pillows and tourist information Just a little outside of the main city but within 1 2 miles of everythings Also within 20 minutes or less bike ride to everything If you want to stay in a confortable and quiet place but still enjoy the Amsterdam night life this is the right place 
380229,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location is Amsterdam West which was ok for us about a ten minute train journey to Dam square or Museumplein but might put others off However we enjoyed the journey or the walk into the centre of Amsterdam, The room was extremely clean and very spacious We travelled with 2 children and stayed in the family room The breakfast was amazing you could literally choose from anything The staff on the desk were extremely helpful more than willing to advise us on where to go and how to get there not to mention making our check in and out very easy We could also leave our bags after check out until we were ready to head back to the airport which was very useful 
380230,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Horrible service The people at the front desk are nasty and don t realize that they are supposed to treat you well as a customer They were very uninformed about their own city couldn t help with anything and on top of those things they were very rude , Fantastic facility amazing room
380231,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, My sink was leaking from the bottom l but the staff fixed this quickly for me , Bed was really comfy and I loved the room it was really advanced and modern Lovely stay 
380232,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The stuff is rude like in most places in this country misleading info about trams forgot to make the wake up call Almost miss the flight coffee stains on the carpet sperm stains on the bed duvet from the previous room occupiers i had to clean it with Dettol wipes no room service Had to bring my laundry down to the reception shame , The room was comfortable Spacious but i paid more to get it 
380233,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Staff in the reception was not rude but not polite Room servise only so so Windows in our room awfully dirty, Comfortable pillows the variety of breakfasts
380234,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Checking in was a wee bit slow but that was compensated by the lovely staff The hotel is a bit out of the centre however it was fun getting the trams to and from , Friendly staff lovely clean rooms breakfast was well worth it lots of choice hot cold Beds were really comfortable 
380235,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The room was gorgeous very generous size with all the amenities The double bed was extremely comfy and the hotel had also give us a room with a really good view as requested which was lovely The hotel staff were extremely friendly welcoming and helpful advising us on the best places to eat and drink and also providing us with discounted tram fares and tourist excursions Although the hotel is outside of the city centre it is situation right next to one of the main tram lines that take you into the centre and are easy to navigate to and from The hotel also provided us with directions on how to get to certain places I e Dam Square and what trams to change I would highly recommend staying at this hotel although the restaurant is a little pricey the bar provideds snacks and nibbles which delicious I would and will probably be coming back to the Golden Tulip again 
380236,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was no proper Fridge more of a vending Machine in the room The TV remote control was missing we had to call for another one The bedsheets didnt look clean and one part of it was even ripped The room we were given although spacious was dark and dull with no proper air ventilation , Fast and free Wifi Breakfast was good a good wide variety and juices The room was spacious and cozy User friendly coffe machine The Location of the Hotel is quiet and a bit outside the Zentrum however theres a Tram stop right beside the hotel a 1min walk where one can take the Tram and with one change over reaches the Center in around 20 25 minutes 
380237,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Being out of the centre didn t cause any issues either used the trains or got a taxi Hotel and staff were great would recommend and will stay again Great weekend in Amaterdam
380238,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Great location hotel staff generally pleasant and always helpful housekeeping was the best Really friendly and cool Gave us tips and directions and contributed to us having a lot more fun than expected Buffet dinner was excellent and breakfast was great as well Will definitely stay again 
380239,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The room was quite warm at night Despite trying to work the conditioning The light outside also did not help as the curtain did not draw across fully because of cabinet in way Had a single room otherwise was happy Good staff some had a strange sense of humour But each to their own Breakfast was excellent ,No Positive
380240,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The view from our room wasn t great as there is a lot of construction going on outside the hotel The hotel is very out of the city however a tram stops right outside the hotel so this wasn t really an issue , The room was a fantastic size with extremely comfy beds and a fantastic en suite bathroom Tea and coffee was available in the room and the TV had familiar channels The breakfast and dinner buffet was really good and good value for money 
380241,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing I would stay there again without hesitation, The staff were very friendly and helpful every member had a smile and a greeting I could not praise them enough
380242,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Ab so lutely faultless The staff were so helpful and friendly the rooms were superb and the breakfast outstanding We will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone 
380243,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room a little to hot Customer service at check in not good Bar staff definitely need to train in better customer service both bar tenders were off hand and abrupt , Nice room with modern bathroom Breakfast excellent
380244,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The coffee machine in room was cool but it didn t really make hot coffee It was just luke warm A very minor issue The rest of stay was great , Loved this hotel staff very friendly and a lovely cosy room Perfect distance from airport Hotel is not to far from centre Tram ride away Loved the walk in shower Art work in the hotel was really cool I had a great stay at the Golden Tulip 
380245,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The queues at reception could take a while to go down There were roadworks going on outside the hotel and the view wasnt the best, The shower was really nice and the room was fashionable and comfy The staff were more than happy to help with anything 
380246,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The view out of the window was the roof and faced the other rooms on the opposite side Very disappointing , Although the hotel had a large number of rooms I didn t feel over run with people especially at breakfast time The room was quite you didnt hear any of the other quests not even when in the corridoors which made the stay very relaxing 
380247,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The staff at the hotel were so lovely and we were greeted so kindly on the first day The ladies at the front desk spoke really good english which made sorting out the payments for the rooms much easier She also gave us a map and showed us destinations she thought we may like to visit Our room was on the smaller side but it was decorated so nicely our friends were in rooms just opposite and theres were much larger The shower in the bathroom was amazing and all the facilities were up to a high standard of cleanliness We had our rooms cleaned 4 5 nights and they would look immaculate each time Originally we were going to stay in a hotel with a similar name which was blue the blue water or something like that but after reading the reviews online we changed to this one Would definitely recommend to anyone who is going on their first trip as there is a tram number 12 which stops just a minute walk from the hotel and you only have to change over once onto the 14 at bos den lommerweg in order to get to Dam Square You can also buy tram tickets and other tourist attraction tickets at the front desk but they can sell out so if you can buy your tram tickets at the actual station I would do that instead The buffet there was amazing and they had such a large variety of food from ice cream to sushi Overall our experience there was amazing and I will definitely be coming again on my next trip to Amsterdam 
380248,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, wasn t made clear there was an extra city tax cost per night per room which caused a little trouble in the beginning , Was above expectations given the price walking did stance of the train station which is one stop from central which worked out great 
380249,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Bedside lighting was poor and did not facilitate reading in bed Shower did not drain and water overflowed into rest of bathroom , Welcoming and helpful Reception staff comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast 
380250,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The difficulty getting into the building because of road works, Very clean the staff s were polite and friendly the food was excellent location would be better rated but when we stayed there they had road works in front of hotel building with made it difficult for vehicles to drop off and pick up from the building
380251,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Double bed was two singles pushed together TV wasn t great room was still dusty and had previous guests socks in wardrobe still , Food was really nice bathroom was nice and heated flooring Nice shower Very quiet was good 
380252,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only possible negative I can describe is the location ideally next time I d book a hotel closer to the city centre, Everything about the hotel itself was faultless 
380253,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room was not always clean at its best when asked The restaurant food was not nice at all , The room was extremely comfortable Beds were huge and the size of the room was good for 3 people Wifi was at its strongest point 
380254,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Everything was perfect, Great bed in the deluxe double room Heated floor in bathroom and coffee machine in every room was a nice touch Staff were very friendly Tram stop only 2 minute walk away and a Lidl store only 4 minute walk away 
380255,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The room was lovely the staff were friendly and the tram to the city was a 2 minute walk I would highly recommend this hotel Great value for money as well 
380256,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The breakfast was expensive however there was a great selection for breakfast 30 euros a day for two people is too expensive , The rooms were spacious and the beds were comfy too Very clean rooms and the hotel was clean also 
380257,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I hated that there was a vending machine instead of a fridge in the room i cannot get over the non smoking hotel concept i mean at least a room or 2 for smokers i paid gd money to relax n that includes me smoking a cigarette in my room if i choose and not to get dressed n go down to do so Moreover on top of all of that i was charged for every day I parked my car in the hotel which is ridiculous and redundant where hotels usually provide a Valet parking service let alone a free parking with the room, I really liked the room and the bathroom I also thought the staff were quite nice
380258,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Just a wee bit too far from Amsterdam centre plus ongoing road repairs in the vicinity , Room size decor and comfort was exceptional Food was very nice 
380259,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Wasn t a great choice of bar food , Hotel was spotless Tram stop outside the hotel making it very accessible Staff were polite and really enjoyed our stay We will be back 
380260,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Checkout was 12pm It was 12 10pm and we were gathering out stuff in the room to leave and received a call from reception to remind us we were past our check out time It was a quiet Tuesday morn there didn t feel the need to rush us for 10 minute delay , A little further out than we had thought but right on the tram line and trams are very regular 17 for a taxi from city centre Gorgeous hotel and facilities very clean and comfortable Lovely evening buffet Would definitely stay here again 
380261,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Only thing is not quite right at the time is the roadworks on one side of the hotel however this did not effect us , Location was out of the city centre however on the number 12 tramline which was direct to the the museum quarter The hotel was good our room was quiet and the breakfast was just too much Staff excellent package deal good price Good for train from Schipol airport 10 mins plus 10 minute walk 
380262,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Remote control for the TV was missing not important though Somehow some devices were some kind of noisy not loud but at night they were going on and or off , Not in the center center but reachable easily by train via Sloterdijk or Tram 
380263,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Room was not cleaned properly made a mistake with the payment and were charged twice First room giving to us was wrong and was a complete mess, Location is excellent to access the central station and trumps Staff were friendly and nice Very helpful 
380264,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, taxi ride from central station you would get a perfect score with info on bus metro ride to your from the station put that on your site BIG AND CLEAR , everything
380265,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Care to be taken going out of the hotel on the main road we nearly got run over by the cyclist and mopeds many times No matter how careful we thought we were a cycle would appear from nowhere This is Amsteram as a whole but the road outside the hotel towards the tram is wide and when you think you have crossed the road there is a cycle and moped path at the end , Fabulous smart comfortable and extremely reasonable hotel it was an offer deal with the flight and out of peak season but still a brilliant deal 
380266,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No fridge in the room The staff in early morning was ok but could be more pleasant There are some constructions on the road so if there is snow or showers it can a bit tricky to get there from sloterdjik , The standard of this hotel is fantastic Really worth a five star It is ultra clean the level and quantity of small things like shoe cleaner and so on you can get in the room the nespresso machine in each room is simply great And it is near Sloterdjik station so also good The price is in my humble opinion half what it could be so really cheap 
380267,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There is nothing I didn t like The hotel is further outside the centre than I expected however the trams were regular and cheap so getting around was no problem , The staff were exceptionally good the rooms clean and well appointed The breakfast was marvellous with everything you could think of The staff serving breakfast were polite courteous and nothing was too much trouble 
380268,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, My stay was very unpleasant At 7 am in the morning be woken by works in the hotel which are not presic on the site After 6 hours of road we needed to sleep Furthermore one of the towels in the bathroom was dirty from our arrived in the room what s the use to charge us a tourist tax in this case the it is shameful Of more my husband and I let us have of sleep separately because the room consisted of bed twin while we had reserved a room with double bed We are very dissatisfied with this stay We no reviondrons not any more And if we are French any menbre of the staff is capable of welcoming us in any understanding , Tr s bel hotel moderne et le personnel d accueil souriant et aimable 
380269,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was construction and every morning there was a quite loud sound of drilling It affected my girlfriends and my sleep We were over charged due to council tax which would be fine if we knew so from the beginning , Having our own Nespresso machine was great The room and bathroom was comfortable and very clean The staff very friendly and helpful The small art exhibition was very cool 
380270,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, Hotel was lovely food amazing 29 euros each eat as much as you like if you reserve table before 4pm you get 25 off Staff lovely especially reception staff 
380271,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The weather, Hotel was perfect excellent food choice non expensive bar and very helpful staff The rooms were also very clean and modern with comfortable beds and coffee machine also usb charge points and free wifi 
380272,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We had to get 2 tramps each time To get to central station but it s only 7 euros for a day pass the hotel it s self couldn t be at fault Altough there was work getting done out side that was a pain and wasn t mentioned at time of booking x, The rooms where big and modern The staff was so helpful
380273,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Answer the reception phone a little quicker, Amazing room from the heated bathroom floor powerful shower to the comfy bed worth every cent at a very reasonable price
380274,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing It s a lovely hotel in a quiet location about a 15 min tram ride from the city centre It feels like a very safe area as well , The check in staff were very friendly and helpful we arrived a few hours before official check in but she found us a lovely room and checked us in straight away They provide you with maps and advice on the public transport The shower is amazing and my boyfriend loved the complimentary coffee from the rooms coffee machine and the vending fridge 
380275,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay at the hotel Very close to tram stop and train and metro station Lovely room large and clean Very good coffe and tea in the room I will buy the same coffemacker Nice staff Thank you 
380276,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Creamer for coffee in the room would of preferred milk, Nespresso machine in room nice touch under floor heating in the bathroom was lovely and the breakfast selection was fantastic
380277,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The hotel is easy got to from the airport 10 minute journey Although the hotel is a little out the number 12 tram stop is directly outside the hotel The breakfast is outstanding 
380278,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, 1 Irregular wifi connection really interrupted work commitments whilst on holiday 2 Safe in the room was not working 3 No mini fridge in a 4 property a real inconvenience to manage baby medicines milk baby food etc 4 Having dealt with a trainee staff did not help 5 No mention on Am Ex card to be not accepted 6 Repair works outside the hotel did not help the movements with the baby pram I would have appreciated if I was notified in advance of my travel and or at the time of booking 7 Less staff on the reception areas and the long queues were not served in good time 8 Breakfast was not included after all the payment overheard a customer getting some February deal with breakfast included within the total number of hotel nights stay bill , 1 Some staff were really cool made us feel welcome even when they saw us in the lunge etc 2 The room was cleaned everyday with fresh items replace which we really appreciate 3 The baby cot and the pillow duvet inside were hygienic and clean really appreciate that
380279,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location would be more of a problem if amsterdams public transport system was poor but it s so frequent and easy to use so not really a negative , Fantastic room clean spacious lovely shower modern coffee machine 
380280,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Distance from city centre Tram works outside meant difficulty accessing the entrance Shoddy wooden boards to cross to get into the hotel , Spacious rooms hugh buffet style dinner quiet Friendly staff 
380281,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It is a little far away from the city center but there is a tramway station just near the hotel Also you can find tramway ticket from the hotel reception , There was an iron and iron table in the closet So there were everything you need 
380282,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Only slight downside is that the location is not central it s probably too far to walk if you have bags but not impossible There is a tram stop outside the hotel number 12 takes you to the center in about 5 10 minutes or you can change to 13 14 for different areas around the city We didn t find the distance a problem and we were happy to get the team which runs til 12 30 each night after this there is a night bus every hour from the central station , Stayed here for 2 nights in February The hotel is absolutely amazing inside Our room was exactly as described on the site if anything the pictures didn t do it justice Bathroom very modern and we were impressed with the underfloor heating Nespresso machine in the bedroom and mini bar if desired were a bonus Free wifi throughout the hotel with a strong signal and loads of international TV channels in the rooms The spec of the furnishings in the bedroom and bathroom and throughout the hotel were unbelievably good value for money Staff were extremely helpful on arrival they gave us all the info we needed about trams and transport to and from the center We paid for the breakfast buffet on one of the mornings we stayed 15 00 was a little pricey but you could book online or the night before and get a discount the selection was great everything you might want Endless tea and coffee fresh omelettes or pancakes cooked as you desired as well as help yourself food Would definatley stay again 
380283,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Bed was pretty hard which isn t my personal preference so not a comfy sleep And do not walk to Amsterdam central takes a good 45minutes 1 hour Get the train from station 10 minutes away , The rooms were very modern and had everything needed Staff were very friendly
380284,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, They did tell us prior to arrival but the construction site out the front was a bit off putting but other than that no issues, Buffet breakfast had such a wide choice which was good and the freshly squeezed Orange juice was to die for rooms cleaned to a high standard and all staff a pleasure to talk to and good knowledge Highly recommended this hotel and would stay in it again 
380285,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We ordered room service which took 2 hours because of confusion with the room number but hey everyone makes mistakes 75 euros deposit per day for use of the minibar , We really loved this hotel It is 1 stop away from Amsterdam Centraal on the train 5 minute journey but it didn t bother us it is excellent value for money The rooms were lovely and very modern complete with door bell touch screen 
380286,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Couldn t dislike anything was such a lovely hotel in nice area, Room was so spacious under floor heating in the bathroom was amazing and the bed was so comfy Room service also fabulous 
380287,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We arrived in the bar at 3 45pm and really wanted to order some food after a long day out The lunch menu finished at 3 00pm which I thought was extremely early There was food available at 4 00pm only small food 2 slices of pizza fries etc I approached the bar at 3 55pm to ask about the food that was available The woman behind the bar repeatedly said that there was no food until 4 00pm before walking off I found her extremely rude as I only wanted to ask her about the types of pizza available I also wanted to order some drinks I also thought it was a bit silly to not take our order for the sake of 5 minutes When I went back to the bar to ask about the pizza and order the woman repeatedly kept trying to walk away before I was finished talking I asked her what pizza was available and she said either plain or meat I ordered one of each However when the pizza arrived both were covered in vegetables and not what we ordered despite her saying there was only two types available I found the bar lady extremely rude and unaccommodating especially since there was only two other people in the bar its not as if she was too busy I also found it very strange that food stops at 3 00pm and the only food available is small food at 4 00pm This was annoying as there did not seem to be anywhere close by to get food other than a Chinese which was closed , The room was comfortable very spacious and clean For the most part staff were really friendly On arrival the lady at the desk went out of her way to tell us about the Heineken Experience which was very enjoyable The hotel is close to a tram which drops you into the city center 
380288,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A little far from city centre Have to get two trams in change half way through journey and is approx 20 in a taxi one way But for comfort and value well worth considering staying here, Hotel was lovely and clean selection of food was amazing I have an allergy and they were so accomadating in relation to this Would highly recommend
380289,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It is a way out of town so expect to pay around 18 euros in a taxi from the centre if you aren t able to get a tram , Great staff and comfortable rooms 
380290,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Reserved a standard double or twin didn t get to pick should have an option or let the stayers know they ll get a twin room which most couples won t want , Nice hotel Loved the room service never has that before 
380291,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Staff really went out of there way to help and offer sights markets etc to visit The day we arrived it was my daughters birthday and the staff at the hotel really made her day more special Would def stay here again Rooms and facilities were clean and welcoming 
380292,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Didn t like the fact they were working outside the hotel but everything else was great, I loved the whole facility the staff made you feel at home and it s very modern
380293,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I choose the location for practical reasons but unless for specific purpose I wouldn t recommend it , It is a good hotel with nice ambiance in the rooms and great toilet 
380294,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location is a bit far away You have to take a tram each day so extra money spent on transportation The hotel room could have been cleaner , It was a good thing to have an espresso machine in the room and extra coffee pods The D R E A M restaurant was very good plenty of diversity and good quality food There were enough pillows and clean towels every day 
380295,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A construction project right outside the Hotel made access with large suitcases a bit of a hassle but this is just temporary , Easy access to downtown and all of the action activities and must dos Daily and multi day Tram Passes available at front desk and the Tram Stop is very close 
380296,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, the safe did not work in the morning had to call the reception to open with a key forgot to prepare a breakfast although I asked for it the day before Then the BF package was pretty poor for 15 Euro They gave me a wake up call although I did not ask for it it was a good surprise however the call was late by one hour only my room mate informed me about it when I was on the airport , clean and well equipped room with complementary nespresso
380297,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Buffet was a bit too expensive and was the only option , Staff were really helpful rooms were very stylish and spacious hotel was excellent value for money Would definitely stay again for the same price 
380298,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The staff was not always very friendly which we did not expected it from a 4 stars hotel The hotel is unfortunately far away from the city centre it took about 20 25 min by tram Furthermore you have to change trams and wait sometimes 10 min for them Really annoying when you are there just for a short trip , We were in this hotel over the New Year the superior comfort room is really nice and big The bed was big and very comfortable We were very satisfied also of the dinner buffet many choices and fresh food the money worth Two hours earlier checkin was also not a problem 
380299,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, Couldn t have wish for a better hotel for the money Lovely staff lovely rooms and the location was ideal From the moment we walked on we felt welcome the staff on reception were wonderful We purchased a three day tram bus pass which lasted the whole of our trip Only takes 15 20 minutes on a tramp to get most places Couldn t recommend it enough Thank you 
380300,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Lift was a bit slow and kept going down before up and viceversa but no real complaints apart from that Maid came into room even though we had requested late checkout but quickly rectified , Evening Buffet was excellant Joke on the desk was very helpful and understanding Room was very satisfactory Perfect location for us as we were visiting The Gashouder 
380301,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Because I m a vegan I only ate at the hotel s dining room once The buffet is quite extensive with many many options unless you re a vegan It s also pretty pricey especially if the only thing you can eat from it is the bok choy and broccoli Thankfully Amsterdam is pretty vegan friendly though so I didn t go hungry It would be nice if the hotel would offer more plant based options though , Roel who is awesome accommodated me with an early check in which was very much appreciated after a long flight The hotel itself is lovely the room was spacious and clean The fact that there is an enormous dining room for both buffet breakfast and dinner as well as a bar for lunch and drinks is convenient The hotel is about a 45 minute walk from city center but there are trams running constantly that will take you anywhere you want to go The train station is a 10 minute walk and the airport is also quite close For me another major plus was that there is a vegan restaurant just a 10 minute walk from the hotel Overall a great value and an excellent choice for an extended stay 
380302,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I actually didn t not like anything everything was beautiful, PERFECT for getting from the central station and trams to and from Amsterdam city centre I absolutely loved my stay staff were lovely and helped soo much especially with planning how to get around amsterdam and where to go Hotel room was beautiful TOTALLY RECOMMEND I want to go back and at 140 euros for 2 nights was amazing price for money when you see the hotel staff rooms dinner bar etc 
380303,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I dont think either the breakfast or tea buffets were worth the price, Couldnt really fault the hotel itself or the staff bathroom had under floor heating which felt good and bed was comfy and big
380304,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The distance from the hotel into the centre Also the distance from the hotel to the train station The information makes it sound closer than it really is , The staff were friendly and very helpful The location of our room to the lift was perfect due to my disability 
380305,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I think hotel needs to introduce veggi hot breakfast as I don t eat any kind of meat Pancake was not good at all and it was cold Also 15 Euro was very expensive I felt and also my friends , Hotel location was good apart from the road work We really enjoyed our stay Great facuiliy Staff were great 
380306,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, My aunt had booked a twin double requested a double but couldn t get it A bit out of town but tram was right outside , Staff were amazingly helpful the rooms were great really loved it
380307,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Lighting in bedrooms was quite poor especially for 6 girls getting ready for a night out maybe just one extra light would be perfect, Staff were extremely friendly Especially the lady who gave us advice on nightlife we had the best night thanks to her 
380308,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A member of the cleaning staff found a pair of hand made slippers by the bed and decided they were disposable so threw them out with the rubbish The hotel offered no compensation on check out Obviously not acceptable and hugely disappointing , Very nice hotel Friendly and helpful reception staff 
380309,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Liked everything, location out of the way so nice and quiet pleasant tram ride in to Dam Square Restaurant lovely welcoming variety of food clean 
380310,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The traveling all the time no shops around had to travle to get food an stuf, It was a lovely hotle it was way to far from were we taugh it was but good
380311,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A fair distance from the main sights not a problem for me but expect 30 45 mins each way, At EUR90 a night this was really good value Brand new fit out and large comfortable rooms 
380312,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Hotel was stunning and really nice friendly staff The rooms have a touch of luxury to them with lovely bathrooms and heated floors The location is about 5km out but it s only 2 trams away so it s really easy to get to and a quiet hotel 
380313,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location could be a bit better but I guess the room comfort size and price all make up for it they do , The room was rather spacious clean well kept Everything was nice and ok Price very reasonable Will stay again probably 
380314,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The Hotel is situated in an easily accessible areas pretty close to both the train and metro stations The cleanliness of the hotel was brilliant all the time with fresh looking rooms and excellent facilities Staff were all very friendly and fluent in English they assisted us in every single request and also provided us hints and tips to explore the wonderful city of Amsterdam Breakfast massive delicious wide variety of items and pretty cheap Totally recommended You can actually pay on a daily basis if you pretty to try somewhere else 
380315,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The phone in the room and the mini venting machine did not work My husband went to the front desk to ask about it and was told since we paid the room when we arrived and closed out the bill they d need our credit card on record and they could turn on service to both and it would only take 5 10 minutes Neither were working by the time we left the next morning The location is a bit far from central Amsterdam but public transportation is really good and the tram stop is right across the street Thought the prices they were asking for breakfast and dinner buffets were high so we didn t eat there , Had a triple room for only one night as we laid over in Amsterdam on a return trip from Spain It had plenty of room for us and would be comfortable for longer stays What I liked most about the room was the heated bathroom floors and the shower head Room had a machine to fix coffee or hot water for tea something we didn t have in Spain Great Italian restaurant across the street by the tram stop for half the price as the dinner buffet Hotel is only an 8 10 minute walk to the Sloterijk Train Station 
380316,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, reduce the price on your menu so that you can have more customers dinning in your beautiful dream restaurant, lovely staff clean exceptional view easy access to tram and train 
380317,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Coffee Machine in the room did not work nor did the Mini bar They did however send a maintenance worker to fix the coffee machine promptly which was appreciated 2 single beds pushed together instead of a double and the bed sheets did not fit the beds properly and kept coming off , Beautiful hotel very modern and well decorated Gorgeous big shower but no bath Room cleaned daily on request Regrettably we didn t get the chance to try the buffet breakfast I believe it is very good 
380318,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I requested a double bed and they said it was no problem we got a twin room instead But the beds were so comfy so couldn t complain really , Great clean modern hotel Staff were very helpful and friendly 
380319,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Handy location with easy tram access and rail links friendly courteous staff and excellent room quality Only stayed for one short night but would recommend

380321,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Staff couldn t understand some of my requests questions but I will put this down to language barrier That being said they were friendly helpful and always smiling , Clean hotel friendly staff Room service food was pretty good and an amazing shower Good views on the 5th floor Would recommend to friends and family 
380322,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Cigarettes at the entrance of the hotel, Park next to the hotel for running in the morning Tram station next to the hotel to go the centre Easy to reach by car Underground parking is possible
380323,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, My handheld shower handle did not have enough pressure to use Did not like the pillows with the bedding they felt like couch throw pillows , I liked the size of the rooms and sizes of beds Even though two twins were next to each other it seemed like a king bed and we had four twins or two kings in our rooms The breakfast had a huge selection and was not that good the dinner buffet was way too expensive Did not use the dinner buffet 
380324,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Excellent location near tram and train station and only 5 minutes to Central station by train Comfortable bed clean room large bathroom kind personnel We ll definitely come back 
380325,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing , The hotel was great just a short tram ride and walk from the main attractions of amsterdam The staff we re all really helpful especially Ellen the barmaid It is a very clean and safe to stay in we hope to return in the future 
380326,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Quite a distante from key tour points, Front desk very helpful gave us many hints on the city enjoyed the expresso machine In the room Clean and confortable 
380327,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It does take a fair amount of time to get into the city centre There is not much in the way of restaurants around the hotel i missed the cutoff for room service one evening and was not able to get dinner without travelling back out closer to the city , The staff were friendly While the location is far from the centre it is very close to a tram stop and I did manage to get to and from the airport entirely using public transport 
380328,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Very helpful staff plenty of choices on buffet breakfast If you find there is nothing for you then you are extremely fussy Couldn t fault at all Easy to get round by trams would highly recommend
380329,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The dinner buffet is ridiculously expensive for what is on offer , Room is beautifully decorated Staff so friendly and helpful Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here 
380330,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location is a bit off from the centre , Very friendly and helpul staff Rooms are very spacious Quiet area It is easily accessible by tram it takes around 20 minutes from Museumplein to the hotel with the tram Walking is possible but it takes around an hour 
380331,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, too expensive considering location nearly double the amount of payment required upon check in as safety deposit food in restaurant not good and overpriced room very small considering price also, clean modern nice rooms close to airport and easily accessible
380332,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I came back from a party at 3 am and the main door was locked and there was nobody at the reception so I had to wait for 5 minutes for some guy to find help, Receptionist was very helpful Close to station and tram stop Complimentary tea coffee The most comfortable mattress I ve ever slept on Very good pillows Modern interior
380333,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, On arrival there was sick all over the entrance The hotel is basically in the middle of a building site Has nothing around it not even a shop and is too far out of the city centre Has absolutely nothing for children Rooms have a nasty smell Staff are very rude but changed there attitude once complaining too head office was mentioned Would avoid as this hotel has nothing to offer at all We moved hotels after the 1st night, nothing
380334,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, There was a lot of construction going on around the hotel making some of the routes to the hotel from the car inaccessible but no biggy , Great staff all spoke English wifi was free and worked well Located right next to the tram stop and you can buy a 24 hr pass for 7 50 at the front desk of the hotel 
380335,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The street construction outside was unfortunate , Very comfortable bed and room was spacious It was beautifully designed and pleasant It was very well located to the tram stop 
380336,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A faulty hanger tore a hole in a new jumper The intitial suggestion to return it to the shop was fortunately rapidly overruled and the cost was reimbursed by the hotel , Spacious well equipped rooms good sound proofing wide choice of food with cook to order options at the dinner and breakfast buffets tram stop nearby
380337,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Two suggestions Replace curtains and lampshade which are old fashioned and damaged used in room 530 To speak French , Dear Golden Tulip Team During my recent stay it was very pleasant The value for money is adequate for the room upgrade in room thank you The breakfasts are varied and copious Smiling and welcoming staffs Travel airport Hotel Golden Tulip I used Tinker very well Tramway 12 close by about 300 meters from Hotel Golden Tulip allows a very fast access to the city center For the visits museums cruise etc think of GetYourGuide we avoid waiting lines 
380338,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, One request we made The only request was a thin soft pillow A hotel that claims to be rated 8 5 10 that can not facilitate this request indeed not even warn us in advance that you stock just one deep pillow will not score highly Our comfort was taken away by Golden Tulip not facilitating this specific request It was disappointing not to receive a response before our arrival , Staff location and general cleanliness 
380339,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, We did a tour through three countries and this was by far the best priced and most comfortable We loved it all Easy tram access into the city very comfortable hotel rooms parking garage a short drive to the Wind mills without driving within the city crazy traffic and great prices I would stay there again and highly recommend it 
380340,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Not very close to city center You should use 2 different tram to go to city center by public transport But way is not long and you will have a possibility to see museum square on the way , Clean and nice decorated rooms Amazing breakfast And cheap hotel parking It was one of the my favourite hotels 
380341,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Great location in the heart of the inner city suburbs The staff were incredible and very helpful genuine and professional Can not recommend this hotel enough great facilities and a delicious breakfast buffet 
380342,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, its 2 trams away from centraal not the worst it just would of been handy if it was a direct one trams are very regular tho , our room was lovely it had a nespresso machine a nice bathroom with a heated floor and the beds were comfy 
380343,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, You had to get two trams into the centre but that said it only took about 10 15 mins and the dutch people are so friendly and helpful it is very easy to get around, The hotel and staff was excellent the staff we so helpful and friendly the hotel is clean and the room was large and very very nice would highly recommend this hotel 
380344,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, kind of far from the center but with little bit of orientation with the tram and map you are perfect , The room was very nice and comfortable exceptional receptionist and the breakfast cannot describe with words 
380345,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Road works just outside the hotel Robes and slippers not provided in the rooms , Great hotel dinner buffet was really good good choice of food Just few seconds walk to tram stop that takes to central within 20min max

380347,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, As regards design this was one of the most impressive ones that I stayed at recently and the rest was fitting this as well service comfort food 
380348,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, my only complaint was the beds They were too hard for us and despite asking for double rooms we had twin beds pushed together which would have been ok except we had 2 single duvets , Beautiful hotel Within easy reach of city centre and airport The shower devine the staff so friendly and the buffet dinner Oh my god I ve never seen so much food 
380349,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Although they had a good selection of foods available the quality of breakfast was not great , Lovely cozy interior Ordered room service and the food was tasty Easy access to get to the city Overall enjoyed my stay 
380350,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, For a 4 star hotel you could expect one or two extras which weren t there Dressing gowns as standard and an ice bucket would have been good , The dinner buffet is excellent and rooms are quiet comfortable and a good size All the people working there who I spoke to were very friendly and helpful in their advice 
380351,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location was far out from central Amsterdam 2 tram rides away from the centre which took approx 20mins Taxi from the airport to the hotel was 50e and taxi around 1am from the centre to the hotel was around 30e , Hotel was clean and modern All staff were very helpful and friendly Good value for money 
380352,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing, We was very surprised with nice helpful and professional stuff We ve asked for a quite room and we received it The room was big and clean everyday cleaning The hotel also has great bike parking Great breakfast for a good price 
380353,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Breakfast was very expensive Cups spoons in the room were dirty and had to be cleaned before use We also had to wait over 2 hours for our room even though we arrived after the check in time specified on booking, Perfect location Airport and city centre very accessible Room very comfortable and spacious Bar staff were lovely
380354,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Me and my partner loved everything about the hotel apart from we booked a double room which we expected to have a double bed in it but it was 2 singles Again no biggy but could be for some people , The saff were very friendly and always willing to help The food drink and overall the whole hotel was up to very high standards The only down fall is the location as it would have been better if it was nearer Dam Square however this is no biggy Will definetly be returning 10 out of 10 
380355,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Food Brilliant breakfast and evening all you can eat buffet Nespresso machine in the room and staff quick to refill when asked Beds were comfy and clean Staff were very helpful and knew answers to questions straight away 
380356,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, staff attitude was awful certainly not of 4star standard Our minifridge was broken and our room was by road works that started at 7am and went on for hours, Dinner buffet and breakfast
380357,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The mini bar was a small vending machine that never worked despite constant request to please fix The lighting at night was not sufficient on the bed sides Hard to read in bed Location not so good but the city has an excellent tram service , The size of the room was great and the bathroom size very good Plenty of room to move around We also enjoyed the bar nice atmosphere and the buffet dinner was excellent 
380358,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Minor delay waiting for check in when I arrived , Excellent value dinner buffet huge selection self service with free soft drinks and coffee for under 30 Euro Was very busy as a result Pleasant bar sizeable rooms modern bathroom facilities good Wi Fi
380359,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Building work starting out side the hotel at stupid o clock and the safe in my room did not work and when we arrived the quality of the directions were poor and hard to understand which meant we got lost and had to muddle our way, The dinner in the restaurant
380360,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Had room service for dinner ordered two pizzas and one fruit salad taste of the food was not that great but we ate all anyway , Amazing hotel very well equiped and extremely clean High level of customer service which is very relaxing and respectful Would deffinitely recommend When going to city centre you have 15 min drive by train and altough hotel is not near city centre it s area allows you fully enjoy 
380361,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, High step from bedroom to bathroom Bedroom area not very spacious for a twin room with 2 standard single beds although they can be pushed apart are still quite close together Bath towels are not very big Mini bar system not working so unable to use fridge for own goods including medication Faulty plug when using iron resulted in complete loss of power but fixed after second phone call to reception we used my phone as a torch until then , Although a buffet food was good but hotel needs to be clearer with their instructions Older female receptionist extremely helpful and understanding Avoid late breakfast and early dinner Relatively easy to get train to centre or schipol Tram stop just outside but need to change to get to centre 
380362,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We did not like how the reception office works We had to wait a lot for the receptionists response the answers to our questions were not satisfactory for example we asked to recommend us nearby post office from where we can send a parsel and did not get clear answer where to go when we checked out in the morning we asked for the invoice for car parking for which we already paid in advance for the whole stay and receptionist told us that he can t print the invoice without parking ticket it was in the car downstairs and we gad to go there we asked for the invoice for the breakfast for which we already paid and did not get the receipt and the receptionist asked us to wait when the restaurant will open We just wondering why to complicate simple things and to ask clients to do a lot of additional movements while checkung out , Location and the rooms were good 
380363,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Fantastic hotel with very friendly and helpful staff and not too far from city center Will be back hopefully next year with my family and will not hesitate this same hotel 
380364,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, the hotel location is a bit far from the center but by tram it is no problem in addition we only stayed there the night before our flight so it is much more faster to get to the airport from this hotel , the room was clean and spacious
380365,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, If I was being really picky I would have to say the food in the hotel wasn t to my taste, Staff were extremely professional and friendly could not fault them really pleasant and very helpful
380366,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We were charged a bit more than they originally quoted but all worth it , Our upgrade was amazingly cheap and we will recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a really nice hotel stay in the dam 
380367,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Not much within walking distance , I stayed twice in the month of October because of a layover I had on my way to and from Italy I had a blast and the hotel was very European I enjoyed it alot It was right by the train to the city and to the airport Extensive breakfast
380368,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Very helpful front desk staff who helped with the aid of a map to provide us with directions to the tram and places to see Excellent service Great rooms a little tired The evening buffet was amazing and the selection of food outstanding this was scored a zillion out of 10 from my 10 year old Overall a great experience and would definitely come back to the hotel and area again
380369,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Once the trams stopped running at mid night there are no bus stops close enough to the hotel that would be safe to walk from to the hotel past midnight So we ended up getting taxis back to the hotel as it was our only safe option , Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights with a group of friends for a birthday celebration The hotel itself was perfect Very modern and immaculate everyday Staff were also very helpful in directing us to the correct transport for areas of Amsterdam we wished to visit We didn t eat at the hotel but the restuarant looked fantastic although we did have drinks in the lounge bar at reasonable prices Great environment Definitely stay again if ever returned to Amsterdam or recommend to friends family 
380370,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The awful mess outside the hotel Poor access The cheek to charge 15 euros for parking a car Amsterdam is very expensive and this hotel would be less than one third the price in Thailand where we live , The room and hotel were in good condition
380371,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We were originally sent to a room that already had people booked into that room There were personal belongings everywhere The lady at the front desk was quite abrasive with us when we went down to the front desk A lot of rules in the hotel that would put us off staying again such as having to pay per 15 minutes if you go over your allocated time in the restaurant or having to leave a deposit for bedside lamps , Close to Tram line
380372,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location was fair approx 25 min by tram to the city centre by walk approx 45 min Due to works on the roads surrounding the hotel in the morning it was very noisy I would recommend to change the curtains because were quite damaged and a little bit dirty otherwise nothing to complain , I enjoyed my stay to Golden Tulip Amsterdam The room was very clean the size was appropriate and the furniture was almost new The staff at the reception was very helpful and friendly I totally recommend this hotel

380374,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The food was not very hot and the cost of the evening meal and breakfast was quite expensive , The rooms were excellent spacious and plenty of variety at meal times 
380375,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The room cleaning was poor Fresh bedding at least once in a weeks stay would have been nice but this didn t happen They also neglected to change glasses and remove room service items form the room , The room was beautiful and full of useful extras The bathroom was superb and very modern I would have spent my whole time in the shower if I could 
380376,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It s a little far from the action if you were looking for a mad weekend We tended to stay out all day rather then coming back to change for dinner in the evening This worked out perfect for us , Conformable room nepresso machine friendly staff easy transport to air port and city with public transport Tram stop very close to hotel
380377,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, They forgot our room service order and when we called to ask what had happened they had closed the kitchen The receptionist manner left a lot to be desired rude , Easy to use the tram to visit AMsterdam centre
380378,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Building work going on outside But that was ok as we only used the hotel to sleep in , Hotel was a great location of you want to stay slightly outside of the city centre Only 7 10 mins walk from the train Station and 1 stop to Central Staff where friendly and accommodating Lots of cafes and restaurants close by for food
380379,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The policy of payement had to pay on arrival after ringing the hotel told by manger pay on depart Or pre authise my card and wouldnt let you on arrival, The location the good rooms comfortable beds
380380,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The food options were limited If you didn t want a full buffet like what was offered at Dream restaurant there wasn t much to choose from otherwise , The rooms were lovely Very tastefully designed and spacious The linens were very nice too I can see much thought went into making sure guests are comfortable 
380381,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Noise from railway track banging doors kept me awake from the earlier hours Next to a busy motorway very far from central, Very far from the centre nothing in the surrounding area costly to get a taxi from central 25 generally poor facilities on site
380382,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Gorgeous hotel very clean perfect location well linked up to Amsterdam centraal sloterdjik train station short walk around the corner would recommend 100 to anyone and will definitely be back my no1 hotel for Amsterdam
380383,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The only negative thing i found was that the male receptionist delayed my check in because he was busy with his computer other than that i didnt find anything negative, Location spacious carpeted room free wifi and toiletries smoking area for my boyfriend heating
380384,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Superb hotel situated outside of Amsterdam however tram stop outside hotel and only 5 stops into museum square Very welcoming and helpful reception staff breakfast and evening buffet well worth a visit 
380385,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, If you could change the pillows and give one that is flatter it would be excellent Both pillows were very fat and I had to use one of the decorations Thank you, Everything was excellent but 
380386,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, No refrigerator in room No speciality about halal food in breakfast , Calm comfort and totally nice place Staff are very friendly Dream restaurant is a dream 
380387,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, We were in a room on the first floor and at one am on the Monday morning the workmen were working outside on the transfer lines banging and hammering , Rooms fantastic clean and coffee machine a nice touch Breakfast buffet was lovely loads of choice 
380388,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Cost and breakfast not included, We paid 208 per night and that didn t include breakfast there was not even a complimentary bottle of watwater in the room way to expensive for what we received
380389,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location was the only thing I didn t like about this hotel but other than that a great hotel think it was about 20 from the hotel to centraal station in a taxi , Beautiful hotel Nice friendly staff Room W s big and very clean 
380390,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The one issue I had was the continued problem with software that prevented the use of the vending machine minibars in any room over the two trips a month apart , I stayed at the hotel for a total of eight days over two trips in August September and overall I enjoyed my stay Good modern rooms with comfortable beds pillows and good showers Exceptional buffet dinners The hotel is not close to the centre of Amsterdam though but tram no 12 access to good and frequent until midnight It takes about 20 minutes to get to the centre of town via two trams 
380391,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The staff is friendly and very nice the room is spacious and nice Breakfast was great Only thing was we found it a bit difficult to find location isn t that bad as tram stop is 1 minute walk and station was 6 minutes walk once you knew where it is 
380392,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The hotel was of a lovely standard staff were very helpful with any questions we had We had arrived early and our room was ready which was amazing The hotel is two teams away from the centre however this suited us as we like to be away from noise and the reception were happy to tell us which stops to use and we bought tickets from there as well In fact going on the trams added to our experience
380393,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Restaurant staff weren t very friendly Coffee machine in the room broke so asked for it to be repaired but it wasn t , The room and facilities were excellent 
380394,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, When we arrived with our friends we were told that their room had been cancelled the week before because when the hotel tried their Visa card just a week before it said it had expired They sent a message to Booking Com who in turn e mailed me to say that the card had expired we were away from home travelling in Europe and didn t had sporadic wifi for two weeks so I wasn t bothering to check e mails On checking when we arrived at our hotel I found out that the message was only sent to us in this regard just a week or so previously and we did not get it It was very inconvenient to arrive without a room This room had been confirmed six months previously with a card that had not expired The hotel was totally booked and there wasn t a room for our friends Gary and Josephine Dawe They had to stay in our room and we had to pay an extra 70 00 for having the only room available with two extra beds We had to go through the inconvenience and disadvantage of having to double up The next day our friends had to move again to a room that became available They used the same Visa card they had given in the very beginning , We liked everything 
380395,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Hotel did book from my credit card without my knowledge or approval When telling hotel manager about their mistake hotel management agreed in paying back wrongly booked amount of money immediately but this money did never arrive at my bank account after some weeks i had to involve lawyer to get my money back for sure this hotel will never see me again ,No Positive

380397,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, I paid for my parking walked straight to my car entered my destination into the sat nav and went to leave When I got to the barrier it would not allow me to leave It took me one minute to enter my sat nav and it charged me 2 euros extra for that time , The room was spacious 
380398,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, The rooms are very spacious and clean It s a little far from Central Amsterdam but it was worth it The hotels in central Amsterdame are much smaller The tram is right across the street and parking is available at a decent price 
380399,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, It was too far from Amsterdam central had to take 2 trams or 20 in taxi , The bathroom was fabulous especially the shower it was huge with with a tropical rainfall normal shower head bed comfy room was big
380400,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, unable to switch our pillows from very high which gave a neck ache to a flatter soft pillow , The staff were very helpful food was excellent and value for money especially the buffet at night we had a large room on the top floor which had a view which was very quiet 
380401,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Restaurant only have Buffets style meal plan It would have been helpful to have option Alacarte as well for uniqe diners But very nice restaurant if you happy with Buffets style meal , Location facility and Staffs all were very good

380410,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location was way to far from central town Not attractive from the outside looked abit grotty It was advertised with a hot tub Jacuzzi but nothing there when we stayed there , Very comfy beds 
380411,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Everything Nothing not to like The staff were friendly professional and courteous The ease of access to the city centre The selection of food was very good both for breakfast and dinner 
380412,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Was a bit disappointed with the hotel restaurant location was further than described on the page, Very modern great wifi access Staff very friendly and helpful 
380413,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, I have stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my husband and my child 12 years old The room I received was on the 3th floor with a nice view of the city no smoking and far from the elevator perfect Furthermore the room which was a Superior was very big clean and comfortable We had breakfast in the restaurant of the hotel It is expensive 15 euros per person 10 euros for child but the price is absolutely in line with the quality and quantity of food you may eat And fresh juice espresso and cappuccino are included in such price Check in and check out were fast and precise The wi fi is free and even if is a low one and has to be reconnected each hour it is a good one I absolutely recommend this hotel for its price 622 euros for triple room for 3 nights superior room breakfast included its position 12 minutes by tram from the very city centre the kindness and competence of its staff and cleanliness of all the spaces 
380414,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Those are minor points but the entrance to the parking garage smelled like urine the shower had two temperatues hot and very hot and the bedsheet was to small to cover the whole bed you could see part of the matress If you are tall your feet would have been on the matress not very hygienic , We got a free upgrade thanks to booking com so our room was very spacious Public transport is easily accessible and the front desk staff was very friendly 
380415,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The aircon in my room was not working and it was really hot Told staff who were reluctant to do anything immediate However they called a specialist the next day but then I had a rough nite due to the airco not working and on the second day they changed my room as it turned out the aircon in the other room had a major fault My only gripe was that after all my effort to explain to staff that the aircondition was not working and that the room was very hot The staff on call took it with a pinch of salt and advised that it would work only after some minutes but I already explained it was on for over an hour and still not working Next day they gave me free breakfast for the inconvenience I still think the staff should be more responsive to Guests requests especially when there is something wrong in the room , The rooms here are really spacious with good size bathrooms plus safe mini fridge and iron Really neat
380416,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The WiFi was pretty poor in our room but nothing to really knock the score down , The room was well kept and looked amazing Plus it was the same price for 7 days here as a cheap hostel in the centre so worth every penny The staff were really helpful as my girlfriends bag was lost at the airport and they found it and returned it to our room for us 
380417,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, We had a lovely stay at the Golden Tulip from the moment we checked in until the moment we left The hotel is comfortable and stylish and I cannot fault it at all We had 2 lovely rooms next door to each other the d cor was really nice and the rooms clean We loved the Nespresso coffee machines and complimentary toiletries and the TV had lots of channels Also a British plug socket in each room is very thoughtful The free Wi Fi was fabulous and it was great that you didn t have to keep logging in I was able to print my boarding passes in the lounge on the free computer and printer facility The lounge and business area downstairs was lovely and always very calm The bar had warm friendly staff and was a pleasure to use We didn t need to trouble the reception staff much as everything we needed was provided for anyway but we did purchase daily tram tickets which was very handy Staff also provided us with a map and tram directions the hotel is ideally situated a little out of town but just a short tram ride away and is conveniently located for Sloterdjike train station If I am ever fortunate enough to visit Amsterdam why would I choose to stay anywhere else 
380418,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Not being a big breakfast eater we resented the fact that either there was a big breakfast or a bread roll and coffee sure would like some fruit not just starch more choice would be good However dinner wa excellent , Good location good facilities we were met by friends so did not use any of the transportation facilities available 
380419,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Closed mini bar without deposit payment so we could not use refrigerator, 10 minutes by train from airport and 15 minutes walk from train station or taxi The hotel is not in the center of the city but easy to go from it to the main tourist places by public transportation tramway 12 13 14 Modern decoration room coffee machine climate control Good furniture bed bath room is perfect Clean Very friendly staff Good breakfast 15 per person 
380420,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location of the hotel is the only small inconvenience we had Getting trams to the centre and not missing the last one home We were told there was a night bus but we didn t brave it , Couldn t fault this hotel It was a fantastic place to stay although location is quite far out of town Breakfast was worth the money with an excellent choice and great quality food We will be back 
380421,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Dinner and breakfast ridiculously over priced It s about a 25 mum journey over 2 trams to get into dam square so if you were wanting a night in the hotel you were asked to pay 29 50 each For a buffet yeah the food was good but there s only do much you can eat Also the beds we had were horrible singles pushed together with horrible yellow mattress bed could have been more comfortable , Bar staff were amazing and food was good Loved the shower also 
380422,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, high price for breakfast and dinner A ways from the centre so we had to spend the entire day doing things as opposed to retreating in the middle of the day to freshen up and return to the centre of attractions Bathroom was smaller for a family of 4 mini bar didn t work , enjoyed the hotel amenities parking comfortable beds great shower power of water great nesspresso machine 
380423,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The hotel is a bit far from the centre but still can be reached by taking a tram 12 and then 13 The only thing that such a good hotel should have an airport shuttle, Bed hotel atmosphere bar staff bathroom and room size 
380424,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West,No Negative, Hotel was excellent we picked this hotel for quietness and to give respite from the Amsterdam hustle and bustle Only a ten minute 2 bus ride from the centre Staff were helpful and courteous will definately use again Transport links to centre are excellent when visiting
380425,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing much, The hotel is quite pleasant it is certainly clean and comfortable and the food is nice too I think i had the cheapest room which was small enough for me to reach the window minibar tv and wardrobe whilst sitting on the bed I would stay here again but if it was for more than one night i would go for a larger room
380426,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, During a one night stay I had to contact with 3 different ladies at the front desk This does not apply to all but the youngest lady that I asked how to go into town by tram almost scolded me by saying that it was written in the map they had given us while checking in She was complaining that no one was reading the map and kept asking them To be honest the map they gave was a print out and I had a colourful one So I did not pay attention to that map It is her job to explain and she explained so what is the point in being rude Meanwhile you have to take two trams to the central station where you can get a canal tour and transfer time between the two trams can be long It took us 45 minutes just to return to the hotel Last point is the parking garage It is fine and well organized well lit But after paying for the parking ticket by credit card at the machine do not lose more than 5 minutes As we are on holiday it took us some time maybe 10 15 minutes to get ready to go on the road And the gate did not open and charged us another 2 euros So we had to go back and pay that amount , Nice room facilities Nespresso machine was great Nice to have a delightful coffee or tea in your room Finding an iron and an ironing board in the wardrobe was a plus 
380427,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Nothing bad all good thank you , Reception staff efficient helpful but most of all funny and real No reading from the manual for this lot it was an absolute pleasure to deal with them 
380428,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, The location was ok and few of the staff members at the reception were not friendly Another bad part was the the parking was somewhat expensive , The rooms were awesome with good facilities
380429,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, A little far out but the team journey was okay even with changes No pool or gym , Good room size spotlessly clean nice staff at checking and checkout 
380430,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, In Hotel localization don t have public transports to early flights in the morning at Eidhoven Airport they are not Guilty You need always a Taxi to the center to take a shuittle that it seems nobody knows that exists or a Taxi to Eidhoven 300 Euros , Price Staff and comodities 
380431,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Location was a little way from city centre but tram stop was just outside Safe didn t work but wasn t a major issue Bar could have had more range of cocktails and snacks and vending machine could have sold soft drinks Room could have had a fridge, Staff very friendly and helpful rooms spacious and quiet wifi worked brilliantly Bar was nice to relax in Sorted out my booking of two rooms even though prior to my arriving had been staying my kids had to stay in a separate room as there were no triples available once they saw me they had no problems with us staying in one room 
380432,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Walls are a bit thin Minibar is actually a vending machine so you cannot cool your own stuff Location was a bit off center and you have to take a 30min ride incl switching trains with the public transport Would not be a problem if train would come more often outside rush hours too , We booked a four bed room and got a very spacious room in the 7th floor room 703 with about 50sqm size It was in T shape while the beds had been to the left and right and in the middle we had plenty of space so our kids 2 and 5 years could play Bathroom was also very large meeting the needs of a family Nespresso coffee was free of charge The room was clean and very modern 
380433,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Was just a little to for out of town , The hotel was lovely room was very clean and comfortable very easy to get to from Schipol Airport We used the trams a lot to get about they were very good value for money 12euros each for 48hrs 
380434,Golden Tulip Amsterdam West, Breakfast and parking were expensive We did not do breakfast as it was 15 per person per day and parking we were forced to and it was 15 per day A refrigerator in the room would have been helpful too since we didn t want breakfast at the hotel , Very comfortable and clean hotel had a coffee maker in the room all amenities were in the bathroom that we needed
