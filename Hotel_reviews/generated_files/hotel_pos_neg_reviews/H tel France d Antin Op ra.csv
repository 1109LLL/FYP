110997,H tel France d Antin Op ra, Air condition facility was broken and asked them if I could change my room But they say that night was full so I shoul open the windows and sleep But my room was on 1st floor Can t do that had to sleep in the very very hot room , Room was tidy When I checked out and asked them to send me a tax and when I was waiting for my taxi they brought me a glass of oragne juice and it was very kind indeed 
110998,H tel France d Antin Op ra, Beware of advice from staff we were directed to a traditional French restaurant that was anything but one of the few mediocre meals we had in France , Nice room friendly staff great location 
110999,H tel France d Antin Op ra, 1 No omelette no hot sausages no even porridge No hot meal at all on breakfast Only pieces of toast and coffee were hot No coffee machine you have to order and wait for your coffee Very poor breakfast for 15 2 We ordered double room but we needed two blankets Well we got used to have separate blankets in double rooms and there always were two of them in all hotels we had stayed at before Always Except for this place After a long discussion with many excessive questions we finally got a simple cover and were happy Until a maid suddenly removed it to the closet Oh God why We didn t ever have a clue where it was until next morning we found it in the closet 3 It was just an unhappy coincidence that we could use WiFi in our room only on the 1st and the last days of our staying but it was very uncomfortable They really made it better now and it works properly 4 TV needs more English channels 5 It s 3 not 4 , 1 Croissants were delicious Not warm but very nice 2 Location is perfect Subway Opera with 3 lines crossing RoissyBus stop from to CDG close enough to the Louvre the Vend me square Gallery Lafayette is a 5 min walk The hotel is situated in a quiet place that makes it comfy 3 The price It s pretty high for us but as I can see not so high for Paris itself so I now rate it as plus 4 Gel shampoo body milk and gel for hands in bathroom Very good for 3 hotel Really guys it s great 5 In spite of some minuses that always can be in hotels like this I would recommend this hotel for a short staying in Paris 
111000,H tel France d Antin Op ra, Room and bathroom was very small but apparently this is normal for rooms in Paris , Convenient location helpful staff pleasant calming atmosphere Had separate areas for relaxing 
111001,H tel France d Antin Op ra, There is only one elevator which is a bit small , Our room was very bright with the sunshine pouring in from two large windows There was enough space even for a family of three as in our case The bathroom was also spatious The room and the hotel in general were very clean Breakfast was typical french with freshly baked pastry french cheese fresh fruit joghurt etc There are several common rooms on the ground floor and the basement where one can relax after a tiresome day in Paris The location is great the Opera and the Louvre Museum are within walking distance whereas there are several very good brasseries and japanese restaurants nearby The staff was very friendly and helpful I think that it is a very good choice for families on a budget especially if you want to stay in this specific Paris neighborhood 
111002,H tel France d Antin Op ra, We spent 4 days in Paris May 24th 28th and the weather was great but very hot Unfortunately the air conditioning in the rooms were not powerful enough or were not working properly to cool down So was quite challenging after a long day walking get back to the hotel and find a warm room , The key point of this hotel is its location Near Opera Place Vendome Louvre Blvd Hausmann many good restaurantes etc so it is easy to walk around and enjoy Paris The staff is very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is good

111006,H tel France d Antin Op ra, First information at arrival was we had accomodate in your room someone else an we are sold out We were offered with large room which was 50 more expensive in the end after haggling we have got this large room for standart booked rate The room smells of smoke like some pub At check out we were asked for approval of the payment even we had paid full price at check in 15eur for breakfast no worth there are many possibilities in the neighbourhood for better price with typical parisian atmosphere ,No Positive
