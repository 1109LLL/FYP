12608,H tel De Vend me, All the staff showed great help except the old reception man in the morning shift 14 july 2017 he was not cooperative at all and he ruined my morning I hope the manger will do something to improve his attitude , The location was great and active room was clean and comfort If u will stay in this hotel u will find alot of coffee shops and alot of Resturants around u by walking only 
12609,H tel De Vend me, Stuck in a lift for 20 minutes no stuff member came to talk to me or assure me Was told to wait for at most an hour imagine I was suffocating in that small lift I was rescued by a friend who came an opened the lift The technician arrived after 45 minutes Terrible experience The technician who answered the bell could speak French only Hotels should have technicians for a crucial thing as a lift on standby ,No Positive
12610,H tel De Vend me, The lack of a spa was surprising given some of the other high end hotels in the area, The manager concierge I feel guilty that i forgot his name was outstanding and went out of his way to make the stay excellent
12611,H tel De Vend me,No Negative, Everything is amazing Very good location staff was very friendly and nice Room was very charming and breakfast is good You can reach all atractions on foot 
12612,H tel De Vend me, The room was warm We slept fine but usually like the temperature a little cooler but enjoyed our stay , The hotel was beautiful and in a great location The room was first class 
12613,H tel De Vend me, Forniture of the room is quite elegant but old aged If you want to drink something at night you must go out because the bar closes before midnight , The hotel is located in a wonderful charming place five minutes walking from tuileries 
12614,H tel De Vend me,No Negative, Superb hotel fab location great sized suite and friendly and helpful staff we will be back We have staid in this area a few times and this hotel was def the best for all the above reasons a gem of a find Thank you and to Claire for being so helpful
12615,H tel De Vend me, There is no lobby in the hotel that is a problem entrance is too small and the door opens and you are cold there when you are waiting for some one , staff was very good location great bed comfortable 
12616,H tel De Vend me, The laundry charge was too expensive I feelt like I m being overcharged somewhat , I liked every single thing about my stay amazing staff superb location outstanding services provided by all staff and they are willing to do whatever to help and make our stay pleasant 
12617,H tel De Vend me, Nothing , Beautiful hotel spacious and luxurious room very clean and renovated bathroom excellent staff Great selection of TV channels and free movies Top location 
12618,H tel De Vend me, Not much not to like perhaps the carpet in our particular room could use a good cleaning quite a few stains The light system was a bit overly complicated to use and it is unnerving to have the lights go completely dark while one is in the restroom , The size of the room quite large especially for European standards Loved the towel warmer and having a seating area in the room Also having a separate door to the hallway and bath area was really nice in case one s traveling partner wanted to sleep in Staff was great especially Claire at the front desk a new friend for when we come back to stay 
12619,H tel De Vend me,No Negative, I think that Hotel Vendome is one from the best hotels in Paris Perfect location very good services cozy breakfast Definitely I will come back here at my next stop in Paris Love it 
12620,H tel De Vend me, Nothing, I loved everything from the great location to the excellent staff and facilities and the outstanding restaurant Would definitely recommend this hotel 
12621,H tel De Vend me, Nothing we didn t like, Everyone was pleasant and friendly They were slightly late in bringing out tea one morning and so they gave it to us for free The location is perfect and the food was excellent 
12622,H tel De Vend me, The room had a lot of dust Sad to see such wonderful furniture lamps in need of a good dusting That is my only negative comment Staff was excellent They were the best , Bedding towels the best
12623,H tel De Vend me, The room was long and the windows were positioned so high we couldn t look out of them , Beautiful breakfast room Amazing location close to all the shops and gardens and galleries Lovely staff the concierge and reception staff were fantastic 
12624,H tel De Vend me, The front desk staff very condencending less helpful They called me thinking I have ran away without settling accidentals and the were speaking bad things in French unbeknown to them my colleque understood french Bad considering the rooms were paid only 30 for water and tourism tax , Location potters
12625,H tel De Vend me, Beautiful bar restaurant that they closed bcs of low occupancy we believe Paris is strugling after bombing attack However instead of cutting cost they should invest in guests that do visit their hotel so they return Wrong service mentality , Very convenient location in city centre pretty rooms great boutique hotel
12626,H tel De Vend me, Breakfast could be much better and bigger but than again French are not known for big breakfast buffets , Very good location comparatively large rooms for Paris friendly staff overall very good 
12627,H tel De Vend me,No Negative, The room was very cosy The decoration and architecture contributed a lot The staff was warm while performing its duty We felt in a confortable cocoon with no icy and superficial luxury It was de bon aloi 
12628,H tel De Vend me, Everything was to expectation , Beautiful Hotel in very central location close to the best and most expensive shops in Paris Beautiful wood panelled room with blue marble bathroom 
12629,H tel De Vend me, So much dust behind the nightstands that I sneezed the whole time I was in the room Definitely not a 5 star hotel also didn t feel safe to leave valuable goods in the room ,No Positive
12630,H tel De Vend me, They didn t clean the room for 2 days we had to tell the reception The room was not very clean the carpet was very stained For the money we expected nicer , The location is great and the staff is more than helpful
12631,H tel De Vend me, Room was a bit dark but other rooms probably are not If the rug were changed the room would have seemed like new Bathroom was very large and nice , Very helpful staff Fantastic location The bar restaurant is lovely and inviting but breakfast wasn t included We felt for the price it should have been The bed was comfortable and linen was fresh and clean The rug could use a refresh But all in all it was very nice and we would definetly stay again 
12632,H tel De Vend me, There was no restaurant bar lounge or proper concierge on duty a fact of which I was not informed until we arrived and were pointed to the cramped cafe across the road In a week of rain and cold having to leave the hotel for every meal was not acceptable The room was compact with the shower within a high bath and on one occasion only one yowel given to us We ended up having breakfast inour room on a tiny table huddled like back packers This is definitely not 5 star , Place Vendome is central and accessible from all directions 
12633,H tel De Vend me, The housekeeping and cleanileness is zero The service is below average for a 5 star hotel There are very few options for food from room service and the restauraunt was closed The furniture is really old compared to what I saw on the website Not child friendly at all wifi was bad ,No Positive
12634,H tel De Vend me, Wifi went out TV went out No ice machine they made beds but didn t clean the room Breakfast was terrible and room service was twice the amount of what you could get right across the street , When asked they helped but didn t go out of their way to make you feel welcome Location was great
