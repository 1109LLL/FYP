95811,H tel Le M, I was charged 50 Euro more at checkout than was stated on my booking when I questioned it the receptionist looked flustered and said she didn t know why and made me look like an idiot I paid anyway because my taxi was waiting I am following this up with Booking com I asked for a room with a view and got one facing a wall but they changed it to a street view after I asked Housekeeping didn t bother to clean any dirty glasses or my sheets The bathroom sink leaked onto the floor Be careful how you get out of bed because you may hit your head on the wall it s that cramped at either side of the bed Ask for a street view it s more vibrant and the Windows cut out all noise , Really comfy bed and a vibrant location with plenty of restaurants on your doorstep
95812,H tel Le M, Staff very cold and not professional I had the room n 1 just behind the reception from which I could hear all noises Small room Only a glass door Bad smell in the room , Position at 5 minutes from the Tour in Montparnasse
95813,H tel Le M,No Negative, Perfect location for tourist purpose all paris attraction sites are within few minutes two main metro stations nearby area full of all kinds of restaurants
95814,H tel Le M, A fuse blew in my room and I had to pack my things in the dark around midnight to move to another floor Linens and bathroom weren t the cleanest in either room which was unfortunate I probably won t be staying here again , Staff were responsive and hotel lobby was well designed 
95815,H tel Le M, In Europe everything is small and this includes the hotel rooms This one was very tiny Just enough room to fix one bed No curtain in the shower so water got everywhere Bring earplugs because this place is on a side street that seems to very alive every single day We heard the noises of the garbage truck people walking up down the street and cars driving by , It was very clean and presentable They let us check in early Bed was comfortable Staff was very friendly and helpful Good location to metro One metro stop from main train station M4 Montparnasse Bienvenue Very close to many restaurants Options are endless 
95816,H tel Le M, The cleanliness and the condition of the bathroom could be much better , The property is located in a very nice area next to Tour de Montparnasse The hotel looks nice and staff really helpful and polite Rooms are not too big or small good enough 
95817,H tel Le M, I ordered a full English breakfast on the phone I was sent some scrambled eggs a yoghurt and orange juice fruit salad cold meats and every type of croissant I didn t eat it 19 swapped the scrambled egg for an omelette it was better, I enjoyed the extremely accommodating knowledgable and friendly staff The location was fantastic near many local and tourist destinations Easy accesss to train stations and

95819,H tel Le M,No Negative, Great compact room with all the facilities Staff were helpful in every way and made the visit relaxing and comfortable Close to the Railway walk around the corner and close to shops restaurants 
95820,H tel Le M,No Negative, The Hotel was lovely In a great location Lots of restaurants of differing cuisine and budgets within walking distance Nice staff and very comfortable Would definitely go back 
95821,H tel Le M, The gym could have a few more weights and machines there is plenty of room, The location was excellent the staff are very very helpful and one of the best buffet breakfasts so far The nearby restaurant Le Plomb du Cantal is fantastic lots of other superb cuisine nearby 
95822,H tel Le M,No Negative, Excellent location close to two metro stations train station in the heart of Montparnasse district Very friendly and helpful staff Very clean room 
95823,H tel Le M, Had a room that had the smallest windows on the floor as in they were literally on the floor of the room Felt like a prison cell , Location is amazing 
95824,H tel Le M, the elevator needs to be fixed it makes very weird sounds there was a smell in the hallway that wasn t appealing on the first day , I found the bed was really comfortable and we had proper room to move around i like the fact that the hotel was also close to 2 metro stops and had a good range of nice restaurants close by
95825,H tel Le M, The shower was broken When we came back to the room the safe was opened and the maid was in the room I called down to front desk and the reception threatened me with violence , There was nothing to like
95826,H tel Le M,No Negative, Loved the room on the outside terrace great to be able to regulate the heating as don t like room too hot Staff helpful to find a room before check in time Position of Hotel good for the trade shows shopping
95827,H tel Le M, This hotel is really a 3 not 4 Plumbing problems with water not flowing properly in basin and bath For a 4 hotel expected bathrobe and slippers as offered in other 4 hotels , Friendly helpful staff Good breakfast though pricey at eur19
95828,H tel Le M,No Negative, The room was small but cozy The bed sheets and towels were very clean but the overall aspect of the room was not The carpet could use better vacuuming furniture was a bit chipped and showed signs of extensivr use the carpet could use Bathtub paint was chipped water temperature was uneven got burned a few times unexpectedly The bathroom door was broken Breakfast buffet had good diversity definitely worth the money Location was so so A little sketchy sex shops nearby and a bunch of homeless people but was near good restaurants and shopping Far from main turist sites 
95829,H tel Le M, The carpet in the room wasn t vacuumed the bathroom door could not close and there was a bulb hanging from the ceiling in the bath Sink and bath tube were pretty worn , The location and staff were great A lot of restaurants and bars close by excellent public transport connections 5 mins from the hotel The room was very quiet 
95830,H tel Le M, We celebrated my wife s 50th birthday and I had pre ordered champagne and roses but it would have been a nice touch to have received a complimentary bottle or half bottle of fizz etc , Location to Metro along with bars was perfect
95831,H tel Le M, Way too hot in the rooms AC was broken and we had to sleep with our windows open Very noisy area Clean but bathroom a bit tired , Location Many restaurants in the area Close to train station Nice staff
95832,H tel Le M, Wifi was a little flakey in the room , Largish comfortable room with more than enough space for our 2 golf bags plus suitcases Quiet location close to Gare de Montparnasse Staff were extremely helpful We would stay here again
95833,H tel Le M, Nothing My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay However had a difficulty with the construction site outside my window , Everything was great Room ambiance and cleanliness was outstanding 
95834,H tel Le M, The street is dirty no fault of the hotel But its a safe location with lots of eateries on the street and further down on Edgar Quinet and downwards Everything you need is only a 5 minute walk away, Clean rooms good location close to restaurants transport system Great and helpful staff
95835,H tel Le M, I have no complaints the only thing is if you are looking to be within walking distance of the Eiffel Louvre etc this is not the place for you If you want to experience Paris stay here , If you ve been to Paris before this is a good place to stay While it s not walking close to the attractions It s in a charming part of the city center with restaurants local patrons and hang out places It s close to the Metro two different stops approximately 5 minutes max walking It s also close to a great spot to get a view of the city from up high We had a minor hiccup in our arrival time and the staff were very accommodating and understanding to our needs Our connecting room was perfect as it had a main door and hallway to two little doors Loved the quiet bar area where the host tried to make us whatever we wanted very adorable 
95836,H tel Le M,No Negative, The room was lovely and I had a terrace to myself which was fantastic it was roomy and I could do my yoga there in the early morning The room had a wonderful carpet in a leopard design The staff were very polite and friendly 
95837,H tel Le M, I have nothing negative to say about our stay here , Great overnighter for outward journey from Montparnasse Main Station On Rue de l Ouest M nails proximity not only to the station but to theatres and restaurants A very good hotel with helpful courteous staff 
95838,H tel Le M, No enough coffee sachets in room , Great location close to Montparnasse train station Staff very courteous and helpful Room comfortable Enjoyed our stay
95839,H tel Le M, The room was very small They provided a cot but it just fitted on one side of the bed so that we could barely walk on either side of it Not much room for the luggages either , The location is fantastic near the montparnasse train station 5minutes walk with heavy luggage The hotel itself is in a nice area with lots of Caf s theatres etc very enjoyable Rooms were clean and bed comfortable 
95840,H tel Le M, Can t think of anything , Room was very comfortable and the staff were wonderful Good breakfast When I opened the window and it broke they immediately moved us to another room 
95841,H tel Le M,No Negative, Quiet location but with nearby Metro and mainline station with a huge variety of restaurants around and pleasant walking up to Les Invalides Tour Eiffel Left Bank etc Tour Montparnasse is an excellent landmark if when walking back to the hotel from the City 
95842,H tel Le M, Always seem to get the small corner room when using booking com I may try a different site in future Front desk staff lacked a warm welcome There is no handrail to come out of the small bath shower facility very tricky ,No Positive
95843,H tel Le M, Nothing, Exellant upon arrival room was ready before check in time Answer ever question superbly Location is first class bed was comfortable many thanks

95845,H tel Le M,No Negative, Perfect locality close to 3 train stations Great local restaurants we ate at 4 for lunch or dinner Trendy theatre area Safe quiet location and knowledgeable staff 
95846,H tel Le M, A little more interaction with you on arrival my first visit to Paris from Australia so was keen to know things They were simply focused on getting me processed rather than suggesting anything This is quite a normal French approach so ask questions Room did not have a corkscrew or any cutlery or wine glasses you can get by asking at the desk and be prepared all wine has corks unlike Australia Remember to book at least 24hours in advance for transport Shuttle to the Airport difficult and expensive cost 55 Euros to get a taxi Shuttle was 25 Euros and was a good service , Closely located to the Pais Montparnasse Train Station good location for trains to outer France and on a street full of eateries I had room 108 that had its own sit outside balcony that added to the roominess of what is otherwise like many other Quaint Paris Hotels a smallish room However it had everything and was quaintly and tastefully decorated Good value a reasonable 2km walk to the Eiffel Tower and tourist sights Breakfast 7 00 to 10 30 am was wonderful Staff all spoke good English were quite helpful when asked 
95847,H tel Le M, The room felt dark small and stuffy with no view and limited window access We basically paid for a bed bathroom and the location The bathroom was small There should be a stand up shower instead of a combined shower and tub in a bathroom of that size because a tub limits shower size , The location was awesome It felt like we stayed amongst locals as part of the neighborhood and not in a tourist zone The hotel had great restaurants and cafes just across the street and a grocery store pharmacy and metro access down the block Very convenient On Saturday the block by the metro station became a local food market and art gallery selling and showcasing all kinds of good things The staff was very helpful especially Tega I hope that s how it s spelled forgive he answered all of my friend s incessant questioning and provided expert guidance on where to go and how to get there Bravo 
95848,H tel Le M,No Negative, The staff were amazing the location is perfect as the metro line 1 minute from the hotel takes you straight to the Eiffel Tower and the main attractions 
95849,H tel Le M, room was boiling at night even with the thermostat turned right down , Nice spacious room comfy bed great shower The staff were very helpful and spoke perfect English Room just as described really impressed Excellent location with a good selection of bars restaurants cafes and metro less than 5 minutes walk away 
95850,H tel Le M, Pillows very small and soft 2 of us travelled with only 1 additional pillow for the first night , Reception staff couldn t of been more helpful from helping us navigate our way around the city to assisting us with our travel arrangements when the French air traffic controllers went on strike 
95851,H tel Le M, didn t pay attention to me asking for a double bed and not a twin room but where quickly rectified and in fact upgraded as this was the only available room , Really friendly staff who bent over backwards for you metro station is pretty much on the doorstep 
95852,H tel Le M, wifi only works on one device per email account and was only allowed to register on email address not very convenient complimentary bottle of water only provided for one day while we stayed for 3 days, staff are nice room is clean
95853,H tel Le M, Breakfast hot food not great Small amounts available and often out of things Staff not that helpful, Design of the room Although not huge felt spacious with the galls wall bathroom Bed really comfy Liked having a window that opens Quiet Nice view of tour montparnasse Great room service dinner best chocolate caramel cake ever 
95854,H tel Le M, It s quite far from the centre of Paris champs ellyses louvre The lift is also slow , I like the room it s clean and cozy the bathroom is spacious and clean Nearby there are lots of nice restaurants so don t worry about being hungry 
95855,H tel Le M, The water pressure was not normal the thermostats was not working properly, The stuff was extremely helpful n friendly the location was quiet not too far from Metro but u must know which way to exit out as the nearest station is Huge has big mall there
95856,H tel Le M, super small window at the bottom of the wall no possibility to open it , Good location not far from the railway station Gare Montparnasse good rooom service
95857,H tel Le M, The decor is a bit particular not to everyone s taste , Ver nice and patient staff We changed our room 3 times and they were extremely accommodating 
95858,H tel Le M, the room was extremely small And we were there with a baby and the baby crib took all the space on the floor The hotel was very empty so really surpriced that they didn t give us a bigger room to give id a better experience We go to Paris once or twice a year and have stayed at the same hotel for the past 15 years and this was the first time we tried a new hotel , Location and the bed was really nice 
95859,H tel Le M, Even when the front desk person was very helpful as a result of my company security in the internet services I could not read my email , Excellent location Very comfortable Extremely clean 
95860,H tel Le M, The pictures of your hotel are another thing comparing of the room they gave us Our room truly looked like a Motel from a road in the USA For the other hand the wiffi doesn t work in the room and finally the air condition heater system didn t work We were freezing as the room had a glass door and the cold air went through the room My friend and I got really sick after this trip , the location and the staff was great 
95861,H tel Le M,No Negative, I know the rooms can be small in Paris and this room was very nice with a really nice bathroom including a separate toilet closet The staff was extremely helpful in providing information on transportation and places to visit Great experience 
95862,H tel Le M, The only problem I had was the pillows too short Also daily water was not available and we had to buy even 1 bottle everyday for 7 5 Euros , Almost everything
95863,H tel Le M, It is a rather pricey hotel but then again so are all Parisien hotels , Le M is a stylish and clean hotel with very comfortable beds Montparnasse is a very lively and upcoming neighbourhood of Paris with a lot of bars brasseries and restaurants 
95864,H tel Le M, Hotel M has become a bit scruffy since our first stay and no longer feels like value for the money spent , Fabulous location near Gare Montparnasse and Metro stations
95865,H tel Le M, On arrival receptionist wasn t too friendly Maintenance people were working as there was some work in the hotel Understandable but guests should be informed We asked if we could upgrade the room answer straight away no Didn t make any effort to check or ask why When got to the room bathroom wasn t cleaned properly Spits on the mirrors didn t give clean feeling Small room No extra pillows For 4 hotel very dissapointing Wouldn t go back no either recommend to anyone , Location was good Great places to eat and have a drink 40 min walk to Eiffel Tower 
95866,H tel Le M, The street was noisy but the room was pretty quiet we guess because of the thickness of the glass door window , We arrived early in the morning and did not expect our room to be ready but there was a room that was ready We were able to check in unpack and go in and out as we pleased during the day This was the best feature of our stay which was otherwise fine The main reason we chose the hotel was its proximity to the Gare Montparnasse where we needed to be the next day The hotel is very close to the station 
95867,H tel Le M, Bathroom wall has a big glass side so people in bedroom can see into the bathroom There are blinds inside the glass panes but these were broken in one of the 2 rooms I booked so ended up with 1 room on 4th floor and another room on 1st floor Breakfast is poor hardly anything available , Room Bed Staff Location 2 min walk from Gaite metro station 
95868,H tel Le M,No Negative, very nice hotel was greeted by a very nice receptionist We arrived ahead of check in time but was helpful and let us leave our luggage Our room was very nice was on the top floor so had a slanted ceiling was a little low however not a major issue at all 
95869,H tel Le M,No Negative, Hotel Le M was very comfortable and very clean The rooms had a view of the theater next door and it was fun to watch the people walking into a show There were plenty of spots to eat and close to the metro station to get to the rest of the city 
95870,H tel Le M, The bath was discusting Ok for a shower but no more than that I had the impression the hotel is not welmaintained bath damaged stains and sink had stains Housecleaning left a wet cloth on my tie Luckily it wasn t damaged Housecleaning put a new towel in the bath instead of where it is supposed to be Looks like they don t really care , Location top price quality top friendly and helpful reception staff
