82191,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Nothing , The bed was very comfy and the room and bathroom were lovely The location of the hotel was excellent for local entertainments and for various metro stations Even though there was considerable renovations being carried out this did not disturb us at all 
82192,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, We had initially booked a classic bedroom but only to find out when we arrived that the room was very very small for even 2 people too pricey for classic bedrooom We had to pay extra to upgrade for a superior room of a decent size If I had known the size of the classic bedroom I wouldn t have booked it at all The photos of the classic bedroom you find here is not realistic I was really disappointed The other issue was the hotel is undergoing renovation and we weren t informed about this There is no breakfast room available Our total price for the 3 nights stay was 700 Euros which is too pricey for this hotel , Had booked classic double room which is really really small and not worth the price that we paid 296 300 Euro roughly for 2 nights We had to move to superior bedroom at our own cost 14 euro extra per night the bed is comfortable modern and facilities in the room is excellent The hotel is centrally located with easy access to Metro I would again request the hotel management staff to put realistic picture of classic double room and please please inform the guests well ahead about any renovation work that is going on in your hotel This would atleast set the expectation We were really disappinted when we entered our room and had to immediately pay for an upgrade 
82193,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Room is relatively small compare to same brand name hotels in USA , It is at the center of Paris Very convenient to go any where Some of the tourist sites are within walking distance 
82194,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, There was no hotel frontage dust and building work going on no restaurant all are being refurbished Rooms were not visited by housekeeping or tea replenished etc I guess with all the disruption and booked breakfast is now in a bag Fine with all this if I had known beforehand and it was cheaper I am sure the hotel will look fabulous when finIshed just not a nice experience for us a real shame , Location is spot on Paris is an expensive place to visit so for an easy day there are some great places nearby to walk and take photos and pretty much every shot has the Eiffel Tower in the background or the Seine Plenty of restaurants nearby one called hippopotamus a family restaurant with a fab lunch menu Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful 
82195,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The room are very small Impossible to leave your suitacase open minimal space around the bed The hotel is undergoing major renovation No Best Western sign anywhere to be seen looks like a Syrian town after a bombing Jackhammers going almost all days from 9am to 5pm No breakfast facilities in room continental breakfast or next door Hotel Chaos buffet breaksfast Not a good experience Very dispointed for the outrageous price I paid Avoid for 6 months , A C was good and worked well during hot weather Shower was really good
82196,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Nothing It was a great stay , We stayed for 4x nights The staff were amazing and so accomodating we were upgraded to a junior suite Especially Juliet at the front desk was incredibly helpful and explained how to get around the city Despite the facility currently being under renovation we did not hear a thing You will smell paint fumes at the front desk but didnt bother us The bed was comfy and the shower had great pressure And I accidently left a pair of my pyjamas behind and I really appreciate the promptness and effort of the staff to advise me of same 
82197,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The only not so great thing was the view only could see adjacent bldg walls and roof but we could check the sky for weather The view was not a high priority for us in downtown Paris if you want that go outside , Room was newly redone and was perfect nice appointments friendly staff always very responsive bed was comfortable They are completing a remodel so there was some carpet pulled up and evidence of construction but it had NO effect on our stay and they told us it would be finished in a month 
82198,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The pillows weren t as comfortable as I would have liked There was remodeling going on outside and in the lobby but it should be over soon They re working on it diligently And it s not an inconvenience But it was a bit annoying , Loved the central location The room was well appointed and newly renovated and the staff was excellent Helped me with booking tickets took time to help with maps and directions The housekeeping staff was wonderful If I were to return to Paris I wouldn t hesitate staying here 
82199,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, the construction, the hotel had many features I appreciated especially the location but we were given no notice that the hotel was under construction and much of the interior was in a state of confusion on our floor and the entrance was unmarked Had we known we might have chosen a different hotel 
82200,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne,No Negative, The staff was friendly and helpful I would recommend this hotel even though there was construction The location was perfect The breakfast was vey good 
82201,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Probability the construction but again it did not hinder our stay , We travelled throughout Europe by car starting in Madrid and ending in Paris We stayed in many hotels and our stay in Paris was probably the best The staff was outstanding helpful courteous and went our of their way to help us enjoy our stay I am not one to write many reviews but I just had to take time to commend the staff at this hotel There was a lot of construction going on at the time but this did not interrupt our enjoyment of Paris I highly recommend this facility 
82202,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The hotel was under construction and we were not made aware of that at the time of booking or prior to arrival The breakfast was included in the price but the breakfast area was under construction so the staff brought coffee tea OJ and two croissants to the room in a bag The room is small which is normal for European hotels but that meant we ate our breakfast on the bed , The staff was helpful and accommodating The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was recently refurbished It is very close to attractions restaurants bars a little grocery store 
82203,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Breakfast was very very poor and staff serving the breakfast was not pleasant at all , Nice renovated rooms very clean and comfortable excellent location close to Louvre Museum metro station just few steps from the hotel 
82204,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The remodeling that was going on in the lobby area but it should be done by now , Friendly staff great location within walking distance of many sights RER train to airport only about 2 blocks away 
82205,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The hotel s 4 star should have been downgraded as the modernization program was still very evident Breakfast was provide by a sister hotel down the street No room service evident and the the provision of coffee making facilities was miserly with one cup per person per day The hotel provided notices informing guest the the refurbish work would only be done Mon Fri 9am to 5pm in fact the work began just after 8am and on a Saturday Not the standard we would expect from a Best Western Hotel, The room was very nice as expected that was the only like 
82206,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, This hotel would have been a great place for us to stay but no one told us of the renovation works going on at the time of our stay The outside has scaffolding up The inside was like a builders yard and very noisy When we arrived we could not check in as the power had been cut The staff were trying to make this out to be just a small problem and all the rooms were done and finished and only the communal areas were being finished off Despite that I was not going to be stopping there as we were away just for one night and my partners birthday would have been ruined Thank you for not informing me that all this was going on during my stay along with a lot of other guests too I would think , The location and staff were very good We can t put any more as we did not get a chance to use this hotel because of the building works dispite us being Poked in
82207,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The hotel we were transferred to was superb No additional cost Located at 23 rue du pint neuf , Ducs de Bourgogne was closed for renovations and we were transferred to 5 star property next door 
82208,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The curtains and the carpet to the window was still wet from the cleaning , The modern toilet bidet was interesting with controls to increase water temperature pressure and water flow 
82209,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, No milk for tea in the room and only 2 tea bags , Due to extensive building works at the Best Western we stayed in the adjacent 5 star Maison Albar Hotel all handled very smoothly lovely hotel 
82210,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, I can honestly say that there was nothing negative to say about the hotel or our stay in Paris overall , We have stayed at the Ducs de Bourgogne before and booked again because we had enjoyed our previous stay When we arrived this time we found refurbishment work in progress and we were upgraded to the Maison Albar Hotel next door but one It was my sixtieth birthday and I was with my wife son and daughter in law The Hotel is fabulous the staff very friendly and we had a wonderful long weekend I don t think you could have a better location to stay with so much in walking distance 
82211,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The works are still ongoing At 9 AM you wake up with construction works At the last day the elevator was working from the 1st floor only so we had to carry our language on the stairs,No Positive
82212,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Room was rather small and coffee machine difficult to use with a shortage of coffee and milk , Lovely helpful desk staff Good breakfast and comfortable room 
82213,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, They are currently renovating and the jackhammers started around 9 00 am I think they could have offendered a bit of a discount on our stay but none was offered , Small room but very well equipped and comfortable Location was great 
82214,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The hotel was under construction and it s so noisy and annoying because my room is right under the construction And I don t happy with it Only choose there because of the location Compared to what I got it s quite expensive staying , Perfect location 
82215,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, It was a fairly decent hotel all things considered However my room was nothing like the photos on the booking website The breakfast scanty and cold was served in a cold dark crowded room in a basement Way too expensive for what it is ,No Positive
82216,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Internet connection was poor two of the three breakfasts were not up to standard , Friendly helpful staff beautiful refurbished bedroom great location 
82217,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne,No Negative, The location was very central and easy to get around on foot The room was comfortable As the hotel is under renovations there was a little bit of inconvenience and mess about Reception staff were very helpful polite and friendly especially Juliet We appreciated the service that she provided 
82218,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Wifi of hotel is not working properly I couldn t do my job Plus I was initially given the room not even close to four stars quality but it was changed the next day The new room was great as is the location of the hotel ,No Positive
82219,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, There was no wifi connection for the entire duration only in the lobby When I asked about this I was told this was due to the rennovation taking place outside Since i was there on business this was highly inconvenient When I checked in no mention was made of the wifi problem It was only after I complained did they admit to the problem Breakfast could be a lot nicer small dark room in the cellar coffee from a machine and poor quality croissants , New bathrooms are very nice 
82220,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Weak wifi no AC noisy portable fan in first room Building is being remodeled so its noisy during the day , At our request we changed rooms after one night The first room had very poor wifi was hot The new room was newly renovated very pleasant With better but still poor wifi The staff members were very pleasant and worked hard to please us Breakfast was very good
82221,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The hotel was covered with scaffold The air conditioning didn t work and it was impossible to open windows because of the work dust on the scaffold I refused to stay in the little first bedroom that they proposed me which was on the back side of the hotel It was all dark with black protective covers and no air con Un trou rats They nicely proposed me an another room with more light on the street side but still far from confortable as it was mentioned on your booking site I would have like to be aware of the renovating work of the hotel so I would have not stay there As a French i believe it doesn t give a good image of French hotels for foreigners and I don t think it is what WE need all at the moment I have been using booking hotel website for years but I don t know if I will use it in the future because booking agencies should be aware of everything about the hotels they sell , Good location
82222,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne,No Negative, Although the hotel was under renovation at the time of our stay the staff and service was impeccable Very friendly people to help a couple of americans in the heart of Paris I would definitely stay here again 
82223,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, When I booked back in January for early September stay I was not informed about renovations occurring Air conditioning was advertised however I was told this was not working in my room and I was provided with a pederstal fan It was a very hot week There was no external window , Good location 
82224,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Did not know the hotel was undergoing renovations and there was no air conditioning , Excellent staff Very willing to accommodate us at an alternate hotel given their renovations 
82225,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, As the hotel is undergoing renovations there was no lift and no air con Our room was on the top floor so the worst place to be with no lift and no air con I didn t find this out until after I had booked and it was too late to cancel , The staff were god very helpful 
82226,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, There was refurhbishment work going on Air con not working The first room we were offered was an airless oven The staff moved us to another room which was ok but still no air con there were workmen on the scaffolding outside so not much privacy noisy Plaster dust outside the room although the room itself was clean A bit of a disappointment but we were only there for two nights so we decided to put up with it Breakfast disappointing although all the staff were very friendly , Good location
82227,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The room was super small to get to the other side of the bed you had to go over the bed There is ongoing renovation should be from 9 am but at 7 am a guy was standing in front of our window We had to leave the window open all the time to get at least some colder air as in room it was 30 degrees C and airconditioning was not working We were all the time in the city so no reason for us to complain but if you want to get a little relaxation at your room then this is wrong place ,No Positive
82228,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, It s the worst night ever in the hotel It was under construction when I arrived Even though I booked it 2 months ago Booking com did t notice it to me No AC in July Moreover I could not open the window because of the poisonous smell from outside I am very upset about the hotel opening in that bad condition Indeed I am more upset with Booking com which didn t notice it I want to get a full refund for my last night in Paris , Location 
82229,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Hotel was being renovated no aircon no lift this was not mentioned in description Shower didn t work properly bed saggy plastic on window so no ventilation noisy , Staff were good location good 
82230,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The hotel is under renovation and it is absolutelly wrong than they don t tell you that before you get there Rooms are really hot and they don t have AC nor elevator and it is impossible to open The Windows because again is under renovation so you don t get fresh air or sun light It s by far the worse hotel I ve been my whole life, Staff is really nice and always tries to help you
82231,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, We were not told that the hotel was being renovated There was no air conditioning Paris was very hot while we were there The cost of the room was too high for a hotel that was being renovated , I liked the staff they were friendly and very helpful They gave my wife some champagne for her birthday and complimentary breakfast because of the renovations The location is excellent and close to Metro stations The staff moved us to a better room when one became available 
82232,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, under renovation lift didn t work booked all hotels with a lift had to move to 2 different rooms to facilitate workers should have been told renovations were underway ,No Positive
82233,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The hotel is being renovated There is no a c and no lift This is not mentioned on Booking com which appears to be dishonest , The location is perfect for me 
82234,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Hotel is under reconstruction now and it is not mentioned on booking com No lift available now no A C and windows are closed due to work on the facade outside The price i paid for one night was definitely excessive due to the current conditions , The concierge was nice
82235,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, When my wife and I arrived the receptionist said the hotel was under renovation so no air conditioning no phone and worst of all no lift We had to walk 5 flights of stairs to our room everyday It would be nice if we could be told the hotel is under renovation before we arrive but we were not informed On the day we left they promised that they will find a porter to help carry our luggage down the stairs but they ended up failing to get a porter to come in In addition we told two of the staff that we needed them to call a taxi for us to go to the train station on the day we checked out but they ended up finding us a hotel transport when the driver was told to take us to airport Luckily the hotel transport person was nice and took us to the train station where we were meant to go to otherwise we would end up being at airport , It was nice that they have sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne knowing that it was for my honeymoon trip
82236,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Hotel under construction This was not advertised Window in room covered in scaffolding No daylight Elevator not working only stairs Air conditioner not working due to construction Bellman broke handles off suitcases carrying them up the stairs Airport driver rate published in hotel book inaccurate driver charged 15 euros more , Good location close to louvre
82237,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne,No Negative, The hotel was in a perfect position for our needs The staff were most helpful gluten free food for my husband was provided It was totally quiet in our very comfortable room Nothing was too much trouble In spite of renovations ongoing about which we did not know it was not intrusive 
82238,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Under construction Stayed on 6th floor and there was no elevator Therected was a mess in front of the window and room was very dirty Don t stay untill it is renovated , Only location
82239,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The hotel was under construction Elevator wasn t working so a former information during booking would be nice because my parents aren t young enough, Personal were really helpful Hotel location was perfect Rooms are quite small but comfortable
82240,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Hotel is under massive renovation guest room windows were blocked AC wasn t working poor air quality at the guest room elevator not working minibar cooling not in use Room was really small for two and walls between rooms not blocking voices at all Breakfast was below average , Location cleaness
82241,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, There was construction and we were woken up every morning by the sound of hammering and banging Would have liked a discount but ever got it, The location
82242,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Building work started at 8am so meant there wasn t much chance of a lie in , The staff were all very professional and helpful When we arrived they gave us advice on bus tours etc This wasn t a hard sell it was just to be helpful to us When we were struggling with tickets for a show the receptionist offered to print them for us above and beyond I reckon Also because it was a special occasion they delivered a bottle of champagne to our room Unexpected and very much appreciated 
82243,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne,No Negative, Lots of renovation work being carried out in and around this hotel We weren t told about this when we booked or before we arrived Scaffolding everywhere no lift noisy The bed was comfy the room was small and the only view out of the window was scaffolding I wouldn t pay 17 euros for breakfast 
82244,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Undergoing renovations at this time We were not made aware in advance but I would have probably stayed here anyway due to the central location , This was our 3rd stay and the staff are the best Extremely helpful and friendly We didn t realize they were undergoing a renovation so it was slightly inconvenient when the elevator was not in service but management offered a discount for our next trip They are reducing the number of rooms soundproofing and increasing the square footage Excellent location in the 1st arrondesment very near Notre Dame the Louve and Pont Neuf 
82245,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, Unfortunately the Hotel is being refurbished will last till Nov The front of the building is covered with a double layer of scaffolding covering most of the windows Also a new lift is being installed so no lift if you can t manage stairs I should leave it till next year , The staff were all very welcoming desk staff very knowledgeable about Paris especially walking routes Lovely breakfast 
82246,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The Booking Com profile suggested that the hotel had parking When I arrived at the hotel I was told by the receptionist that there was a place reserved for me in a private car park down the street When I was checking out the next day I was informed that the parking was nothing to do with the hotel It cost me an extra 40 euro I knew from the reaction of the receptionist that this was not the first time that this problem had arisen It us a complete scam The lift was not working in the hotel and we had to haul our bags up 5 flights of stairs , Central location 
82247,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, room was really small and the wall was slanted tub was on the slant so it was really awkward to lay in the tub and try to shower at the same time , within a block of the Louvre 
82248,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The room size is around 4 sq metres the size of my bathroom a very uncomfortable bed impossible to open properly the cabinet as the room just doesn t fit any furniture If you open the door to the bathroom it feels like a prison cell The clean lady didn t bother to fill the empty bottles of shower gels and shampoo There is no temperature control in the room only the central heating which was acting up all the time Or it impossible hot so I had to open the windows or it freezing The reception was useless It couldn t be a 4 star hotel , very good location

82252,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, the carpet was stained with dirt the room was freezing heater was not working I asked if someone could have a look at it but the guy at reception was the only person working that night the walls are so thin I could hear the conversation the guy next door was having Also I could hear the loud bang of elevator door closing and opening each time The windows are thin too so the noise outside could be heard easily , location is great other than the shortage of staff they are helpful Bathroom is clean 
82253,Best Western Ducs de Bourgogne, The bedding smelled of smoke More tea bags would have been good They only gave us two when they cleaned the room each day I asked if they could leave a couple of extras but they didn t , Good bathroom with good water pressure in the shower Bed was comfortable
