375107,The Mandeville Hotel, For the price I expected a little more of this hotel I m sorry I cannot be more specific but I just left feeling like it could have been more than your average unexciting hotel , Quiet room Clean Friendly staff 
375108,The Mandeville Hotel, Attitude of management staff given problems of being charged in full without notification a month ahead when we had confirmation to pay at hotel No consideration given to customer is right totally unbending Met with manager of customer relations for coffee to discuss at her suggestion The coffee then appeared on our bill at check out left a very bad taste We had one free breakfast for all the hassles around the booking which turned out to be awful Much better quality and price at local restos on the High St Booking com was far more accommodating , Although typical London rooms are on the small size but bathroom very nice with separate bath tub and walk in shower Everything very clean and maids are good but unobtrusive Turn down service if you want it AC works well Generally a nice boutique atmosphere We know London well This location is very good We love sophisticated Marylebone High St with all the restos shops etc If you love books visit Daunt on the High St Quite an icon For fish go to Fishworks restaurant Try to get into the Marylebone back streets Lots of atmosphere Maybe touristy but if you like the world famous shops and business of Oxford St it is a stone s throw away 
375109,The Mandeville Hotel, Housekeeping i found hair in the toilet during check in I paied for superior room and i got small sized room instead then i had to change it the next day The elevator takes long time to arrive, Friendly reception
375110,The Mandeville Hotel, The rooms are quite small however for a one or two night stay it was fine , This Hotel is in an excellent location for site seeing and shops The staff were delightful and the bed was extremely comfortable 
375111,The Mandeville Hotel, Air conditioning unit was pumping out fumes We we were moved without question however wifi signal was very very poor in the new room We also had to ask for coffee and wine glasses as these hadnt been restocked from the night before Perhaps that s why there is a charge of 3 00 on my bill We would return however we would choose a larger room , Staff very friendly and accommodating
375112,The Mandeville Hotel, We booked 2 room of which one the a c was not working very well although they sent the maintenance guy twice The toilet in the other room was too small We did not actually speak to any one to change the rooms as we didn t want to take the risk to move to rooms that may have other problems and not close to each others I am not very sure about the cleanliness of the beds as 2 out of 4 of us weren t able to sleep before covering the pillows as they couldnt stop coughing , Stuff at the prescription and the concierge location size of the room compering to other hotels in London and the speed of delivering any request 
375113,The Mandeville Hotel, I thought the TV channel availability could be better particularly sports , We have tried many hotels in the West End over last several years trying to find that balance between location price facilities etc and consider the Mandeville passed our expectations We booked a Deluxe Double room which was very nice although quite compact Separate tea coffee facilities safety box Bed was very comfortable linen fresh The bathroom was excellent well appointed and large with separate shower and bathtub yes a true bathroom unlike some places which advertise a bathroom but which has no separate bath and is actually just a shower room The AC was excellent and we were able to keep the room cool very important in London in the summer Lounge bar was a great venue for pre dinner cocktail or after dinner relaxing Staff were all very efficient and friendly Overall we were very happy Free WiFi very good and we did not have to continually re login which can be a real inconvenience in some locales Location simply excellent with great pubs dining across Wigmore Street in St Christopher Place also along and behind Marylebone High Street 
375114,The Mandeville Hotel, Small standard room, All staff amazing bar staff brilliant Ian conserierge he s the reason we keep coming back he is an amazing asset to the Hotel Please make sure he reads this
375115,The Mandeville Hotel, Our view from our hotel room could of been better , The location of the hotel was great not to far from oxford street or the American embassy Room lovely decorated and comfy bed two showers which was good when there s two of you 
375116,The Mandeville Hotel, Our superior room was very small and the aircon very noisy I know this is London but for the price you can do a lot better Room service stopped at 11 pm but the menu in our room didn t mention that so a snack planned for our return from a night out didn t happen Sandwiches were available but there was no menu for that We had to go to reception to find all this out as the phone in the room didn t work No action on that was taken by reception staff Will not be returning here , Staff were generally very good Location was the reason we booked here 
375117,The Mandeville Hotel, Difficult to find a fault the only fault would be mine should have booked another night , The bedroom we stayed in was a superior double and was extremely clean and comfortable The shower was excellent and the bed comfortable so that ticked the boxes Located where it is just off of St Christophers Place which is just off Oxford Street we were able to pick from many excellent restaurants to eat Selfridges and other major departmental stores are also within half a mile walk at most and the underground station was a few minutes walk away The hotel has its own restaurant which we did not eat in this time but can recommend from previous visits and the bar is a big advantage after a day spent shopping A big advantage is being able to leave your bags with the Concierge after checking out if you need more time in London 
375118,The Mandeville Hotel, Nothing really , The staff was really nice Quite location Excellent both for shopping and for sightseeing as it is close to Bond street station Recommend getting the Oyster card as it is so easy to travel all around London in the underground 
375119,The Mandeville Hotel, We booked on booking com the website sent me an upgrade before we arrived including a discounted breakfast which we accepted but on check out the hotel tried to charge us too much for our room After some discussion I was charged the correct price But i wasn t impressed that I had to argue my case ,No Positive
375120,The Mandeville Hotel, Thus I turned off the air condition during night it still caused some blubbery noises which gave me a rough time falling asleep, Excellent location very clean and more than friendly staff
375121,The Mandeville Hotel, Nothing , I stayed in one of their Christian LaCroix designed rooms and it was just beautiful It was on the top floor with zero noise The room was beautifully designed in every way and slightly bigger than your standard rooms Check in out were super fast and while i know that the hotel is packed it never feels this way on the reception desk or the lifts 
375122,The Mandeville Hotel, Superior double wasn t so superior view over the heating system They repeated numerous times that the hotel was completely smoke free but then at night my whole floor and room smelled of smoke Had security come two nights in a row to verify Seems there s an employee smoking area right in front of the air conditioning vents , They allowed us to check in early 
375123,The Mandeville Hotel, rooms check in staff were not helpful, room was nothing like the photo on the web site Room was small dingy and not at all luxurious Feels more like one of the budget brand hotels Location is excellent if you want to be near Selfridges and Oxford Street 
375124,The Mandeville Hotel, Toilet seat was unconfortable as the space was too little , The Staff was extremely professional and polite The room was great I really enjoyed my stay Less than 6 mins walk to oxford street 
375125,The Mandeville Hotel, There was a price difference between Booking com and the hotel The hotel reception decided at 11 00pm at night after travelling for 7 hours that the pricing issue needed to be dealt with before I checked in It is disappointing that when a guest is tired and just wants to go to their room that a 30 minute discussion is needed over pricing This not the first time with this hotel , Comfortable rooms good service
375126,The Mandeville Hotel, All good , Warm welcome friendly staff room 418 was quiet clean and sunlit Great location for shopping and dining in London This property is a gem 
375127,The Mandeville Hotel, The breakfast is very expensive for a very nice but nothing out of the ordinary buffet selection , The hotel was well located and the doormen were incredibly polite and helpful The check in out process was efficient and there are lots of cafes bars and shops within a very short walking distance 
375128,The Mandeville Hotel, Poor noise insulation very loud from other hotel rooms and from the street We were moved to a higher floor after complaining where it was slightly better Breakfast was rather lacking the pancakes were not good and fruit low quality , Great location close to Bond Street and very friendly staff 
375129,The Mandeville Hotel, The only bad thing was that the handy phone would allow wifi tethering to personal phones which is far more important these days , Location is amazing the staff and rooms are great The handy phone is cool 
375130,The Mandeville Hotel, location of toilet in bathroom was most inconvenient Towels too small don t wrap comfortably around you Quality of towels average They have an espresso machine and kettle and tea and milk but no granulated coffee Housekeeping needs retraining They left dirty glasses and took away coffee cups and did not replace them Air conditioner was quite loud, Location Room was fine
375131,The Mandeville Hotel, The was absolutely nothing I did not like , Property was in terrific location minutes away from Bond Street Underground terrific restaurants walking distance to Hyde Park and Covent Gardens 15 20 minutes Had an excellent rate from Booking com Stayed in London many times and given the rate and quality of everything at the Mandeville probably the best hotel for the money I have yet to stay at don t think I d say that if I had to pay the book rate which was about 40 higher than rate I had from Booking com 
375132,The Mandeville Hotel, The bathroom door lay out , The hotel is comfortable and very clean and in an excellent position The staff were professional yet very helpful and friendly The twin room wasn t very big but it was fine for our needs and the beds were very comfortable We had no trouble with noise and slept really well There are tea coffee making facilities which was nice after a long day My only complaint would be the bathroom door and the towel size I shared the room with my adult daughter and the bathroom door was frosted but really not frosted enough If we hadn t averted our gaze then we would have seen more than enough of each other when taking a shower That wouldn t have been so bad if upon leaving the shower there was a nice big towel to cover up with but we didn t have bath sheets just small bath towels Whilst the bathroom is adequate it is very small and so when you step into the shower your backside is on show and when you step out of the shower you end up in a full frontal position right behind the door and there is nowhere to hide Ok if you enjoy doing a bit of burlesque Can I also say that one of the beds my daughter s was directly facing the door so it really wasn t the best set up for us but probably ok for partners and spouses I would happily stay again if not for this 
375133,The Mandeville Hotel, Nothing, Great location 10 minutes from Soho and 2 minutes from oxford street Many restaurants and coffee places around The staff were super nice and helpful Will defently come back 
375134,The Mandeville Hotel, Noise from cooling system at 4 am in the morning was so loud that you can t sleep I overheard it was not only in our room but others too AND it was the same problem 2 years ago Still no fix for that But they offer to relocate or even upgrade you to better room ,No Positive
375135,The Mandeville Hotel, Expensive but it is worth it , Location is perfect for shopping you have Selfridges and Oxford street in short walking distance Plenty of eating options nearby If you don t eat breakfast at the hotel there is a Costa coffee just around the corner Very nice staff room is nice furnished and bed and pillows were very comfy Will definitely stay here again 
375136,The Mandeville Hotel, Some of the breakfast staff were a bit surly morning after the night before All the rest were lovely The bill at the end is difficult to understand but was not more than I expected ,No Positive
375137,The Mandeville Hotel, the furniture is too much old the queen bed it is not the normal size it was smaller and room is too much small you can not walk 2 steps or feel comparable so we upgrade and pay around 48 pound per night to have bigger room for few meters, The location is perfect everything is near to hotel shopping supermarket coffee shop restaurants also the room service is good they clean the rooms twice a day final they give you a mobile phone with data and calls for free of charge to used during your stay
375138,The Mandeville Hotel, Construction outside the room combined with the incredibly poor sound insulation of the windows made for a lot of noise Overall parts of the hotel could use a re fit The incredible staff saves this place , Staff was exceptionally kind and attentive 
375139,The Mandeville Hotel, Superior double rooms are not recommended for a long stay it s very small we switched to Delux double rooms and were great and satisfy our demands , Well we stayed for 11 nights in the Mandeville hotel it was a really great experience Reception staff as well as the concierge staff were very friendly and helpful honestly the best ever I met in other hotels the location is good very close to the nice area where shops and restaurants are easy to reach bathrooms are bright and clean Housekeeping maintains the rooms twice a day prices were not really high compared to the service and quality you get 
375140,The Mandeville Hotel, they open the window while I was away so when im back the room is extremely cold but then the staff is SUPER SUPER HELPFUL TO SORT IT OUT , Nothing is perfect but this is close 
375141,The Mandeville Hotel, Bathrooms are small but this is not a complaint this time i was in a single room which was generous size single bed for this trip last time i was in a bigger room but bathroom was same size as the single room so if u need bathroom space this may not be for u, Lovely staff nice feeling when i stay ill be back 
375142,The Mandeville Hotel, Expected room to be bigger Not sure I actually received a Deluxe single Bathroom shower could do with some refurbishment, Central Location
375143,The Mandeville Hotel, My room on floor 7 was quite cold during the night Despite using the heater it did not warm up But I ve stayed before and this is not usual , This is a good hotel I like the design of it and it s not huge and corporate which is off putting to a constant traveller Good bathrooms Nice bar area and the food in the annexed Reform Club is good and not expensive 
375144,The Mandeville Hotel, One could hear the neighbours from time to time but it really didn t bother me a lot , Really nice and personal welcome Very helpful and they showed attention to us getting a cab helping with the luggage etc My daughter and I had asked for two beds and a quiet room They could not give us separate beds but had made up the bed with two separate covers So they really made an effort and we got a room high up in the building as quiet as possible So I feel very satisfied with the way they solved our demands Very comfortable cushions Super location Next time in London I would book again 
375145,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was a little bit too small but everything else was fine so it made up, Great location just a few steps from Oxford street The staff was super friendly and smiling 
375146,The Mandeville Hotel, Check in only one person manning the desk had a problem check in ahead So waiting for about 20 mins should have concierge trained up to jump onto the desk in such situations Immediately created a poor experience however the rest of the customer experience was excellent , Overall experience was good excellent restful nights sleep Overall excellent customer experience 
375147,The Mandeville Hotel, All good , The location is perfect Within walking distance to many amenities The staff are welcoming attentive and friendly Beautiful boutique hotel 
375148,The Mandeville Hotel, Why do hotels put in televisions which are difficult to operate and have no instructions whatsoever After15 minutes I simply gave up Very frustrating , Excellent generally Rafael knew my name instantly when I had to go back to the desk Very impressive The reception manager was grumpy but perhaps she d had a bad day bed very comfortable 
375149,The Mandeville Hotel, The word deluxe had no place in the description of the room I stayed in I was very relieved that I had up graded from the self described tiny single room I presume a body would have to reverse into it and open a window for oxygen The TV required a lot of getting used to and a degree in engineering to operate , The staff were among the most friendly helpful and courteous I have ever met well done there 
375150,The Mandeville Hotel, Initially I was checked in to an accessibility room without any notice so I asked them to change it Then the new room we moved was very small although it is called superior double room It was really hard to move with only two adults in the room The door of the room was really hard to open and limited the space for getting into the room There were maintenance works nearby and it started everyday from Thu Sun at 08 30 am Inclduing Saturday and Sunday Overall it is was a really bad experience Considering the GBP 180 190 daily rates I would not recommend this hotel to anyone Worst experience through booking com ,No Positive
375151,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, the staff was great helpful and friendly with a big smile and warm welcome the most i like is the mobile that was provided to us with free internet and free local and international calls for your country the concierge was so helpful and kindly provide you with all information you need to know about the country 
375152,The Mandeville Hotel, The lift a little slow and at some hours slightly overbooked , The design and the atmosphere of our room was really exceptional despite a small size The dedicated attention from the entire staff to the clients
375153,The Mandeville Hotel, Far too noisy Poor double glazing A glass swing door between the bedroom and the bathroom gives no privacy whatsoever and if either one of you need to use the bathroom through the night by putting the bathroom light on it illuminates totally the bedroom Won t be staying at this hotel again ,No Positive
375154,The Mandeville Hotel, Their Breakfast menu options are tricky to understand and pricey too for the availability They were probably understaffed on housekeeping front as they forgot to make our room ready and clean one whole day We only realised it when we arrived late evening after a day out and it wasnt something to be expected for the price you pay , Just besides oxford street and Bond Street Station Easy access to most things London either by walking or via modes of transport The room was sufficiently big for the area and comfortable Staff was really helpful 
375155,The Mandeville Hotel, the staff requires more of customer satisfaction knowledge and training rooms are small epically for twin rooms rooms furniture is old , the location is great
375156,The Mandeville Hotel, There s nothing specific I think needs a huge improvement, Bed and linen extra comfy Friendly staff the room offered many facilities and was an agreeable size Will definitely be going back 
375157,The Mandeville Hotel, Air conditioning didn t work properly mini fridge wasn t cold fairly small rooms Was expecting more for the price Disappointed overall , Good location
375158,The Mandeville Hotel, We stayed in 3 rooms on the first night due to horribly noisy air conditioning systems in the rooms The first room s system made noise constantly We then moved to a second room where a loud buzzing happened about 20 minutes after we settled down to sleep This stopped after about 5 minutes and then started again 20 minutes later We were then moved to a third room and provided with ear plugs as they couldn t guarantee the air con would be any better The following night we were upgraded to a lovely room where thankfully the air con stayed quiet for the night , The staff were fantastic and extremely helpful the rooms were clean the breakfast was lovely and the location was perfect 
375159,The Mandeville Hotel, Maybe look at doing breakfast, I booked this for my parents as it was my dad s 70th birthday They upgraded him knowing this and were always there for any questions 
375160,The Mandeville Hotel, Was allocated a room for the disabled 1 WE ARE NOT disabled however we asked to be moved and they sorted another room out however the facilities in the room didn t provide the right equipment didn t understand the needs of a disabled person 1 no hoist for transfers from bed to wheelchair shower toilet 2 no shelving within the shower to hold your shampoo etc 3 very small washbasin I totally understand the needs of the disabled I have a company who serve the disability market in looking for comfort My company Silvalea patient sling manufacturer , Close to the shops welcoming Stayed several times will continue to visit 
375161,The Mandeville Hotel, Breakfast was expensive so ate out in restaurant a couple of minutes away would have liked if breakfast was included in price or cheaper Restaurant s menu wasn t varied but there were lots of good restaurants nearby , Location excellent friendly and helpful staff nice hotel 
375162,The Mandeville Hotel, Shower curtain in the tub Information about 220 electrical circuits would have been helpful Maybe provide a converter for unexacting guests , Accommodations were really nice The Free International Cell phone that came with the room was unexpected but an excellent perk Close to everything we wanted to see and do 
375163,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was very small staff told me that it was a great room where I did not think so and the window did not open The AC made horrible noises and I woke up from my sleep in horror I think these type of things should be checked on a regular basis , Staff was great and the location was also great
375164,The Mandeville Hotel, A complimentary bottle of water in the room would be nice , The hotel is ideally located everything sights parks metro restaurants shops within walking distance Rooms are comfortable and clean Friendly and helpful staff Highly recommended 
375165,The Mandeville Hotel, The doorman at door were extremely rude won t help with bag The first night we found a cleaning towel in the bed sheet was disgusting , Front desk 
375166,The Mandeville Hotel, Lacilitiea poorly maintained The shower flooded 5 mins after we arrived and had to wait for a plumber we were moved to a different room which was meant to be an upgrade where the bathroom tap was loose it was fixed the next day The only food on room service was 4 sandwiches at 11pm We were travelling all day and we were starving We ended up ordering pizza from papajohn s We were given complimentary breakfast but it was not great I had poached eggs and they were actually hard boiled inside and wet on the outside not pleasant We didn t have any noise issues until our last day there We were woken up by the guy next door throwing up for 45 minutes right by our headboard Gross Followed by shouting and laughing uncontrollably by 3 4 girls in the other room which lasted from 9 12pm , Location staff decor tv hair dryer smart gadget to guide you around town 
375167,The Mandeville Hotel, Bathroom needs a little improvment but its no big deal, We will definitely come again Best location for shopping Perfect staff polite and respectful The size of the room is greater than london hotels and very clean 
375168,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was a bit small We have ordered 2 rooms seperate orders same price and the other couple got an upgraded room and we arrived together I think we should have been told for the difference they had to give us the same room , The hotel is very nice location great and the stuff was very helpfull clean room everything was very good 
375169,The Mandeville Hotel, Wifi and television was not working one day but I was offerred another room , This hotel is in an excellent location A few minutes walk from Oxford street There are many good restaurants nearby The hotel is clean The bed is comfortable The staff were very polite and freindly 
375170,The Mandeville Hotel, Workmen in the hotel Workmen outside the hotel Heating noisy Definitely a noise problem Shame We were given a complimentary breakfast when we complained about the noisy heating We should have been informed of work being done in hotel I was supposed to have a day of rest after an eye operation not so , Staff friendly and helpful
375171,The Mandeville Hotel, the bed and the room were small and some sort of water pump kept coming on and waking us up When we were leaving we were asked about the mini bar We did not even see one , The staff were friendly and the room was clean
375172,The Mandeville Hotel, I was totally misguided by the picture on booking as the standard room is much more smaller than the one on the website there is no place for the kittle The smoke alarm activated after coming out of the shower because of the steam The tv browsing technique is not easy , The shower and bath Also the free smart phone offered by the hotel The staff are one of the best i met The temperature was well controlled inside the hotel One of the best locations in London I was kindly offered the service to keep my bags in the locker before checking in and after checking out 
375173,The Mandeville Hotel, D cor for this deluxe room was tired as an observation particularly in the bathroom due to the flooding phenomenon The air con was set to heat only following the cold snap in recent weeks and despite setting it to 16 degrees heavily pregnant and desperate to cool down the system simply continued to heat the room This only really became apparent overnight by which point I was terribly uncomfortable and unable to sleep due to the twin evils of heat and a very noisy deluxe room located against the road on the 1st floor Final death knell to the decidedly below par experience came the following morning when the bathroom flooded in short order following a shower to avoid this the head would have needed to be angled to the furthest corner of the walk in cubicle rendering it ineffective for its primary function ie water on skin The walk in shower was the selling point of the room for me and I had spoken in advance with a pretty surly example of a reservations clerk and had explained that I would be nearing my due date and in need of quiet and a walk in shower arrangement She wasn t paying attention during the conversation and it became evident during our stay that my requests had fallen on deaf ears poor show for a hotel that ought to be punching at least to its weight and currently isn t A very upsetting overnight experience which unfortunately set the tone for what was to be a special time away before becoming parents again 17 years after the birth of our first daughter , My husband addressed the failings of the room with the manager the impact of only a few hours sleep at 35 weeks pregnant on me and he was duly amenable most attentive and offered a percentage refund and a complimentary afternoon tea for when we are next in town going to be the birth of our baby The chaps on the door are super helpful and friendly Location couldn t be better 
375174,The Mandeville Hotel, Room was a bit warm had to open a window even on the lowest heat setting , Great location and lovely hotel Staff were very friendly and helpful Would love to stay there again 
375175,The Mandeville Hotel, The travel companion whilst it was a great idea didn t work properly most of the time , The WiFi was exceedingly fast The staff were lovely and friendly too 
375176,The Mandeville Hotel, Coffee machine in room that doesnt work properly, location location location best location hotel staff are exceptional design of hotel is great nearest hotel to St Christophers place Selfridges and very near Bond street station
375177,The Mandeville Hotel, Breakfast was a little slow almost half an hour wait for eggs florentine Only a few other people having breakfast so it wasn t really busy , Lovely hotel staff friendly and helpful
375178,The Mandeville Hotel, kids room and bathroom was very tiny not possible to heat use hotel microwave for kids food, location 10 10 size of our room and bathroom was quite big and we love the privacy all the time clean and cozy hotel helpful staff and like to help all the time hotel security is very good highly recommended
375179,The Mandeville Hotel, Rooms very small and the decor is disgusting we were emailed if we wanted to get a upgrade at a reduced rate We got email confirmation of the upgrade however on arriving they knew nothing about it It was embarrassing breakfast was disgusting and refused to pay for it However the Manager was very sympathetic and understanding of our concerns ,No Positive
375180,The Mandeville Hotel, Room was quite small for a superior double but kind of to be expected for in London , The staff were extremely friendly and the hotel was perfectly placed close to all the action 
375181,The Mandeville Hotel, Breakfast was a disappointment Cold and grossly overpriced even for Central London , Very comfortable bed Use of complimentary smartphone was a nice touch 
375182,The Mandeville Hotel, room not sound prof, excellent location walking distance to oxford street while reaching many restaurants and shops and for arab travelers karak tea nearby Arabic restaurant nearby staff are super polite bed is comfortable 24hr service currency exchange 5 minutes walk 
375183,The Mandeville Hotel, Room was rather noisy from the busy London streets but this is a small price to pay for such a great location in such a comfortable and friendly hotel Also I think water should be free , Extremely friendly and helpful staff Very comfortable room 
375184,The Mandeville Hotel, The size of the rooms were very small if you have 3 or more big travel bags they wont fit in the room We were 2 in the room and the bed was small queen size The sound of other people in othere rooms and corridors were very noisy , The location was perfect and the staff were so nice and the rooms were clean 
375185,The Mandeville Hotel, There was an incident that the maid interest the room while my friends were in the room and the sign on the room said don t disturb We complained to the staff but the only thing they said that they were sorry This is the last time I am staying in this hotel,No Positive
375186,The Mandeville Hotel, The room its self was very poor as i pointed out to the reception that room was not what i have come to expect from the mandeville the carpet was filthy never ever expected to see that in a place where i have stayed and loved staying , bed was fantastic bed linen was unreal
375187,The Mandeville Hotel, Said in hotel information tea was not provided in room just coffee machine In the morning we found tea making facilities with excellent choice of teas inside wardrobe TV was difficult to watch from bed, Bed was very comfortable 
375188,The Mandeville Hotel, The restaurant seemed empty at all times of the day, Perfect location for our trip Effici nt and friendly staff Excellent conci rge named Carlos always interested and ready to advise us with our reservations 
375189,The Mandeville Hotel, tiny room for the money spend narrow bed overheated and impossible to reset the temperature control personnel made up poor excuse for fire alarm going off , location
375190,The Mandeville Hotel, The room is quite small but consider the location might be understandable and pricy , The location is great five minutes walk to the underground and very close to various shopping destinations There are also lots of restaurants near by the hotel The room is clean and tidy equipped with everything you can think of for a short stay The hotel staff are very nice and helpful 
375191,The Mandeville Hotel, staff were all very good and efficient except on the day we checked out one of the staff arranged our airport ride at an agreed price of 105 pounds but when we arrived at the airport the driver told us he had to double check with his boss and he ended up asking for 120 pounds the car was also an uber car , excellent location just steps off oxford street and the very quaint st christopher s place 
375192,The Mandeville Hotel, Next time we would request a room at the back of the hotel as the road noise was quite loud , The hotel staff were the friendliest I have come across we had such a lovely time 
375193,The Mandeville Hotel, I can hear something strange from the wall every night which made me feel afraid , The location Close to the Oxford Street Staffs are friendly The room is big 
375194,The Mandeville Hotel, The bed is very very small We had to turn in tandem to ensure not pushing the partner out of bed It was very difficult to get to sleep This is the only reason we will never return to this hotel A good bed is the first requirement , Location personel 
375195,The Mandeville Hotel, Breakfast was disappointing although incl in room rate it was limited to full English Cappuccino lattes were also excluded Suggest to go out for breakfast many places close to the hotel The mattress was a little firm would prefer a softer mattress , Location is perfect Nespresso coffeemaker in the room Rain shower was great
375196,The Mandeville Hotel, In our room which was on the first floor we experienced a significant amount of noise each evening till about 2am , Perfect location for purposes of our trip which included shopping as only a few minutes walk away from Oxford St Good variety of eating places very nearby Five minute walk to Bond Street underground station Hotel staff extremely welcoming and helpful Our room superior twin was very clean with good facilities including a Nespresso coffee machine 
375197,The Mandeville Hotel, Would have liked robes already in room Bath taps very complicated to use Hotel bar very noisy nowhere quiet to sit , Quiet room very comfortable and coffee machine
375198,The Mandeville Hotel, The hallway on the 5th floor was weirdly pink don t get me wrong it was a happy colour and it looks cute and funny but just a bit weird haha, The staff was extremely nice and always ready to help the bathroom was beautiful and the view from the room was amazing 
375199,The Mandeville Hotel, A bigger room would have been easier for us elderly , Lovely linens and room cleanliness A bit small though Nice in room coffee and tea Frig useful Staff excellent in every respect Very quiet 
375200,The Mandeville Hotel, Booked a superior twin back in July and got a double suite king size bed and camp bed in the small sitting room was dissapointed dont expect to book a superior twin and end up sleeping on a camp bed , Very central location lots of nice pubs and restaurants close by
375201,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, This is the fourth time we have stayed at this hotel The location for shopping in the West End is excellent all the major stores are literally within a short walk We had dinner in the hotel s restaurant on one night which was exceptional and reasonably priced and with St Christopher s Place among others just across the road there is no shortage of excellent restaurants to choose from The reception team were extremely helpful and polite As we were staying on in London on our last day there was no problem looking after our cases on check out Great hotel 
375202,The Mandeville Hotel, Yesterday s meal was out of order so they had to go and make something else nice Actually I m staying at the Harley Street Clinic for neurosurgery So i sent my mum and brother round to stay with you , The beds were extra comfy and the croissants were extra flaky 
375203,The Mandeville Hotel, The fact I paid for a superior plus when I arrived the receptionist told me I was lucky the room wasn t cancelled bacause my payment was declined but no payment was taken Then to be told I ve had a upgrade to a superior plus which is what I paid for in the first place Then got a mini bar but no bottle opener or glasses for the drink Very disappointed, The location of the hotel was fantastic
375204,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, The location is very strategic The staff was very helpful and friendly Eventhough the room was a little small but it provides with all that you need A very good experience and would recommend it 
375205,The Mandeville Hotel, Rates quite high probably because of last minute booking for an unexpected trip , Comfortable room serene color scheme complimentary Nespresso and convenience of location Friendly and helpful staff 
375206,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was so tiny that you could only get out of the double bed on one side the other side was pressed up against a wall The room description said we would have a bath and shower but we had no bath and the shower was horrible The towels were tiny and old and the the toiletries were cheap quality , The location was the only good thing about this hotel
375207,The Mandeville Hotel, Three things are extremely annoying and the reason not to go back there soon First I wrote an email to make sure I get a room with walk in shower Although the graded me up in a suite with just a simple separate room in addition with little value I got no such shower Despite a written confirmation Second I had to collect ALL the pillows bath and handtowels and bathrobes to try to isolate the cheapest single glasing metal framed windows around two sides of the bed Even then the super cold air literally rushing through the room left me now with a heavy cold Third checking the paid bill it was not presented to me first I noticed an amount of GBP 3 The answer a service charge Or tip We can remove it if you want And yes I wanted 5 minutes of additional waiting I then paid the 3 GBP in cash Free will , Mr Rafael at the front desk is always equally friendly and helpful Attentive He is the happyness and gives me a feeling of being welcomed 
375208,The Mandeville Hotel, Old decor needs upgrading High prices are not justified, Excellent location Walking distance from Bond Street and Oxford Street Lots of nice place to eat
375209,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was very small and their was only a view of the backs of other buildings and air conditioning units, It is a very stylish hotel in an excellent and surprisingly quiet location

375214,The Mandeville Hotel, nothing, It s one of those hotels i always go back to the location is amazing and is away from the crowd the service is very good would recommend anyone to try it
375215,The Mandeville Hotel, The glass door on the bathtub doesn t cover enough to prevent the shower water from spoiling the bathroom floor It s not that bad but it could be a lot better if they have curtain instead or full glass door The emergency phone in the elevator wasn t working when I was there Something happened and I had to use my mobile to call the reception , Hotel location is great Everything is close by The hotel is decent staff are friendly and rooms are clean with sufficient space 
375216,The Mandeville Hotel, They didn t have 2 champagne glasses that we could bring to the room Not a biggie but maybe something to look into for future arrivals Also the gluten free selection in the menu could be bigger But as I said it s a great hotel and this is just meant as friendly advice , On arrival they greeted my boyfriend happy birthday we stayed there to celebrate him and they had given us a free upgrade to a deluxe room We really appreciate it The room was great clean and beautifully decorated with a big bathroom and both shower and bath tub The staff were always polite and helpful Great location great hotel 
375217,The Mandeville Hotel, The shower did spray all over the ceiling and floor are room smell of Indian food and we have ask for a refund and to talk to the manger and the staff keep making excuse one said he was in a meeting and the other said he wasn t there Also we have emailed the manager direct and still no reply what I lovely romantic break away that turns out to be ,No Positive
375218,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was apparently an upgrade but was tiny the bathroom was bigger than the room space We applied for extra upgrade with hotels deals programme but were not told when we arrived that we had not got one so were instantly disappointed when getting in the room There were inadequate free drinking facilities No free water Only 3 coffee pods and 3 tiny plastic milk things Not even a complimentary biscuit , The bathroom and the modern upgrade of rooms Breakfast staff very polite and welcoming Water my European lady with black hair Was totally charming
375219,The Mandeville Hotel, I was told I could upgrade for 7 and there I was charged much more I was really disgusted with this found it false advertising and actually upset my special occasion , very clean
375220,The Mandeville Hotel, I have stayed plenty of times at this hotel however they are never able to locate previous stays the latest was July 2015 so not so long ago They have very nice deluxe rooms but this time the room was very small A totally different experience as well as value for money rating There is no complimentary water bottle really So old fashion , The location is very convenient although the neighborhood is undergoing construction work that makes it less charming The concierge on duty this weekend was AMAZING The Wifi worked pretty well 
375221,The Mandeville Hotel, Our room was clean a nice size the bed was great The wallpaper was stained discolored which was out of place in such a otherwise pleasant updated room The position of the toilet was boxed in by the large sink awkward Shower was nice size of bathroom also good Lastly the blinds overlooking the street were too see through the door to the bathroom was frosted glass or something one could see the outline of the person using the bath odd to be sure The hotel was so nice in other ways I would go there again , Staff went out of their way to make us comfortable made great suggestions when asked 
375222,The Mandeville Hotel, Confusion at the start with our room and the fact we had 2 beds pushed together to make a double fell apart in the night, Location and staff weee brilliant

375231,The Mandeville Hotel, The service throughout the hotel was standard until it came to breakfast The staff were rude an would not accept our booking even though confirmation was shown we were a large group as part of a wedding party and when approaching the staff about why we had waited over an hour for poached eggs on toast her reaction was I m not the chef So we all ate seperatley and most of the food was inedible As we waited so long for our meal we were also late to check out and almost late for our return train Not to be expected from this hotel , The bed was comfortable and the hotel location was excellent 
375232,The Mandeville Hotel, Little touches like only 3 milk provided with 4 tea bags not even a bottle of water or a few biscuits which I think would make a lot of difference I thought this was normal in these hotels everywhere else in London I ve stayed these were provided Charged room service for a iron request and charged room service for a 11pm call for asking for milk which their own staff never gave us during the room clean , Location and helpful front desk staff
375233,The Mandeville Hotel, I arrived London Feeling absolutely tired and had a long day back to my hotel the door wasn t working so I had to wait for an hour up and down to get help It was frustrating , The Bed is good The breakfast is good The location is excellent The size and the interior design of the whole hotel is fairly good

375253,The Mandeville Hotel, The deluxe room I had to move to felt like a different hotel They don t have a consistent hotel style I would not recommend it for allergic individuals either I got up with a blocked nose and itchy eyes everyday Some of the staff were unfriendly It is expensive and smaller than other hotel rooms I have been to in London that have better locations , Location wise it is good The superior room I stayed in was spectacular and cosy 
375254,The Mandeville Hotel, Corridors narrow and need redecorating looked a little dingy Lift also looked a little tatty , The fact that it was the 1st London hotel I stayed in regularly when visiting London Brought back good memories 
375255,The Mandeville Hotel, My room had to no iron which was unfortunate as I would have liked to straighten out a few of my clothes Since my needs were a bit short notice the laundry service was not an option Therefore it would be great if the iron might be part of the standard equipment in rooms , The location is one of the best features of the Mandeville especially if you are only staying for a short time or travel to London for the express purpose of shopping The single room was sufficiently spacious and equipped Staff was very friendly and helpful 
375256,The Mandeville Hotel, Some rooms need renovation , Excellent value very good room service and restaurant I m staying in Mandeville since 2009 and it s one of the best hotels that you could find in that price range

375262,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, The staff were exemplary I must single out Ian the concierge and David Fabio and Reggie They could not have been more professional or kind to me on my extended stay with my 15 month old son 
375263,The Mandeville Hotel, The elevator didnt work for four days our entire stay We tried to talk to the Duty Manager and the reception was not letting us talk to him I am very disappointed I ve never seen such a thing that the manager does not come talk to the customers and appoligise It is a pity as the hotel has a nice location , Location Cleaning and turn down service

375269,The Mandeville Hotel, Rooms can always be bigger , Staff was very accommodating loved the location quiet street just blocks from all the action Lots of coffee places juice bar great pubs and restaurants nearby Quick walk to amazing shopping also walkable to Hyde Park and other sights Very close to Bond St tube stop

375271,The Mandeville Hotel, Coffee was not topped up when empty Only 2 herbal teabags which again were not replaced when used Some tired worn areas stairs landings , The bed was comfy made each day The bathroom was clean plus there was not a loo brush which is a plus as I believe they harbour germs are unpleasant Hotel in excellent position 
375272,The Mandeville Hotel, Room was a little on the small side which meant it was hard to open my giant suitcase If there had of been two of us in the room there wouldn t have been enough space , The staff were lovely especially the concierge Always so helpful and it was an ideal location 
375273,The Mandeville Hotel, Room was really small with a view of a wall Seriously pokey bathroom Clean and well equipped but could barely fit round the edge of the bed , Location restaurant Reform Social Grill staff Nespresso machine in room but no fresh milk Bed comfy good pillows nice quality complimentary toiletries Good water pressure in shower

375277,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, We were upgraded and loved the penthouse suite Staff all polite and friendly Breakfast was delivered on time and was delicious Will come back 
375278,The Mandeville Hotel, Room amenities could be improved for a hotel at these rates bathrobe slippers etc , Amazing location at the heart of city but at the same time very quite hotel
375279,The Mandeville Hotel, Not a criticism but an observation really the design of the hotel is modern and cool old paintings of people wearing bright lipstick in big plastic frames etc and yet the dinning room bar was kind of Olde Worlde which seems incongruous with the whole look and feel of the place , Funky modern yet homely hotel just behind Oxford Street I had a single room with bath and everything one could want It was perfect 
375280,The Mandeville Hotel, We had a rather unattractive view to the back of the hotel and the bathroom is small so there is no ventilation when you shower It can get quite steamy in there Also replacement of toiletries were a bit stingy , The location was excellent and the cost for the size and standard of the room and hotel was very fair indeed especially as you are in in the heart of London Staff were very helpful I would definitely stay again 
375281,The Mandeville Hotel, It was fully booked couldnt have my room for a little time longer than the time of checkout, Great location very convenient its quite comfortable no noise of what sort except for the next building due to renovations etc The staff are very friendly they served me very well Room service are prompt with the time to bring the food to my room I like this hotel thank you so much 
375282,The Mandeville Hotel, The staff member who checked us in was quite rude and dismissive upon our arrival The double room was very basic and over priced , Bed was extra comfy and location was excellent The staff member Reginald was very helpful

375284,The Mandeville Hotel, The room size was very small Too much noise from outside One of the room service attendant was not very polite when asked to changed sheets The policy of not changing sheets everyday was quite stupid , The concierges were very helpful The location was very nice and the hotel was quite clean 
375285,The Mandeville Hotel, Would ve been nice to have bottled water in the room Available in mini bar at a cost But a great hotel in a good location , Enjoyable stay in a nice hotel The Reform club restaurant definitely worth a try Nice comfy beds a plus 
375286,The Mandeville Hotel, The weird part was the bathroom door which was made of frosted glass but without a sealed frame the noise easily travelers into the room This made it uncomfortable to use the bathroom being with a room partner visitor , Deluxe room was spacious the bathroom too There was both a walk in shower and a bathtub 
375287,The Mandeville Hotel, There were no negaitves it was all perfect for us A nice touch would have been complimentary bottled water in the room perhaps , We honestly loved everything about our stay and even extended it by an extra night as we were having such a lovely time We had a Lacroix room which was lovely and quiet super clean and it had a fantastic bathroom and a decent hairdryer The location is perfect for a weekend break no need for taxis or tubes and in addition to being near St Christopher s Place Selfridges and Oxford St it is also close to Marlybone High St which is quite lovely Throughly recommend this hotel and will be returning 
375288,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, Bed was so comfortable The design was quirky with the best British flair Still a bit too corporate to my taste but with some really nice touches Impeccable room service Quiet street in a great neighborhood 
375289,The Mandeville Hotel, cannot fault this hotel, Excellent location cannot get better if you are looking for shopping on Oxford street All great restaurants are just a stone throw away and even more closer A nice family hotel with good facilities
375290,The Mandeville Hotel, Room was very small Bed was Queen size 4 hotel windows were old and some wind was coming is and they offered very little temperature protection some sweets left near the window were colder that from the fridge the next day Maid didn t refill the shower gel every day I would say it is a 3 hotel that got 4 due to a great location They bombed us with upgrade offers many times but we expected to stay out a lot and didn t care Didn t know about the queen size bed though Will probably stay there again if price is right Also better have breakfast outside of the hotel as in the hotel it is rather poor and costs a lot more than at a restaurant nearby , The location is great Right near some great restaurants and shopping 2nd time there for us 
375291,The Mandeville Hotel, Considering the price we felt that the room and bathroom were both very small The shower in the bathroom was also poorly positioned so that lots of water spilled from the shower onto the bathroom floor , Staff guest services were great We felt welcome and at home 
375292,The Mandeville Hotel, The bar could do with staying open longer in the night We had last orders at 10 30pm surely can stay open for residents , Pretty much everything The location of the hotel is excellent as are the common areas Checkin with quick and easy Rooms were very nicely decorated could have been a little bigger I guess but this is central London Bar was lovely too a nice space and great cocktails 
375293,The Mandeville Hotel, Room was so small that even room service couldn t deliver food while I was in the room I had to go into the passage If I stretched out on the bed I could touch opposite walls with my feet and hands ,No Positive
375294,The Mandeville Hotel, Very expensive breakfast buffet we didn t try it it might be worth the 22 and minibar prices , Beautiful clean rooms Nice large bathroom with excellent hygiene products Very quiet location less than five minute s walk from Oxford Street We had a lovely supper at the restaurant 
375295,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, CONVENIENT LOCATION NEAR TUBE BUSES AND SHOPPING STAFF WERE SMART AND FRIENDLY I LIKED THE NESPRESSO COFFEE MACHINE AND THAT THERE WAS ALSO A KETTLE FOR TEA IN THE ROOM 
375296,The Mandeville Hotel, We could not get hot tea at breakfast Room was small even though described as superior , The location was excellent and staff were very helpful especially the concierge and the doorman 
375297,The Mandeville Hotel, Room could have had a filter coffee maker , Breakfast was delicious Staff were very friendly attentive and accommodating Service was first class all round Shower was powerful too Highly recommended 
375298,The Mandeville Hotel, Rooms are really tiny so be prepared as Is the lift The menu was poorly explained butchers steak wasn t fillet was soaked in butter which isn t mentioned in the description, Great location room well equipped clean
375299,The Mandeville Hotel, Very nice rooms However changed from a deluxe to a superior room as the sink in the toilet in the more expensive room significantly reduced the space in the toilet making it very difficult for anyone who is larger than a size zero to use Such a shame they didn t think more carefully when designing Also frustrating that there are no plug sockets next to the bed And the TV in the superior room in a strange position Superficially looks great but shows that the designers have never travelled on business , The staff where very helpful in changing room
375300,The Mandeville Hotel, expensive for what is this but location to be considered breakfast not included noisy corridor impossible not hear other guests slamming the doors heavy door almost impossible to leave the room quietly, location comfortable room upgraded on arrival
375301,The Mandeville Hotel, The glass door on the bathroom had no catch nor lock , The room and bathroom were adequate and very comfortable The restaurant both service and cuisine was superb 
375302,The Mandeville Hotel, Were woken up twice during a nap since the hotel had forgotten that the room had already been serviced Cleaning lady even saw us sleeping and then house keeping rang up 5 minutes later No real reaction of hotel to that which seemed very unprofessional Also light over the door stayed on together with the reading light , Very friendly and supportive
375303,The Mandeville Hotel, Zero, Excellent location in Marylebone It s a five minute walk to the Oxford St tube station a two minute walk to Manchester Sq and the Wallace Collection Tons of restaurants on Wigmore and James Sts Loved Nebugo across the street for breakfast The staff is friendly and helpful especially the concierge staff Richard the doorman is entertaining and friendly 
375304,The Mandeville Hotel, Being woken by the noise of the bins being emptied at 6am understand this is unavoidable though , The location was fabulous especially given the price we paid 
375305,The Mandeville Hotel, The attached restaurant was nothing special but there are many great options within walking distance , Very helpful polite staff comfortable quiet room excellent location 
375306,The Mandeville Hotel, Missed a fitness room Would be a nice amenity Basic single rooms are bit small though well appointed Rooms facing the rear in the old section of the building can be noisy due to external air conditioning and ventilation units , Excellent location near Oxford Street Friendly and attentive staff pleasant bar 
375307,The Mandeville Hotel, Could do with more complimentary coffee mineral water Didn t like the construction view from the room Room was rather small , Friendly accommodating staff the Nepresso machine Location close to multiple eateries with pleasant surrounding 
375308,The Mandeville Hotel, The only thing i was not too happy about was the fact that i couldnt open the windows fully to be fair i am certain it has nothing to do with the hotel itself more with health and safety issues ,No Positive
375309,The Mandeville Hotel, Limited room service menu options And i dont know if the premesis has a gym or not because no one mentioned it, I like that its quiet staff are friendly and very wlecoming reception Great location and good value of the money
375310,The Mandeville Hotel, nothing, Room staff etc were of a very high standard with the staff very helpful in facilitating our request of a later check out time due to my wife running London marathon
375311,The Mandeville Hotel, I didn t like the fact that at night I heard noise from outside in the street and inside the hotel in the corridors I would expect rooms to be more sound proof It s a shame the room is so tiny and there s no bar at the hotel premises I also didn t like at all that while the taxi from the hotel was booked no problem they didn t let me know there was an extra 5 pound charge for card payments I specified I d pay by card , I liked that it was clean and modern Great location too I really appreciated the fact that i was allowed to check in early in the morning 
375312,The Mandeville Hotel, It s London so do bear in mind rooms a little small and slightly cramped bur didn t spoil our stay and you can upgrade to a larger room , Great hotel great staff great location would highly recommend Response time to requests excellent 
375313,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was quite small and on the 1st floor overlooking the building renovations of the building across the road The noise started early in the morning The cost of water in the room is 3 Ridiculously overpriced In most hotels this would be free The lifts are very slow small and cramped , The welcome to the hotel was great Very friendly staff Easy to get a taxi in the morning Very good location 
375314,The Mandeville Hotel, Pillows extremely soft uncomfortable Black phone bleeping ar 4 30 am very annoying Concierge not v friendly Kept having to ask for milk for tea kept bringing up 3 milks You need 2 for 1 cup and there are 2 of us , Receptionists ok and helpful Provided decaf tea when asked Location great

375316,The Mandeville Hotel, Bed was way too soft handheld shower in the bathtub was malfunctioning Too much street noise as the ventilation opening in the window was detached or even missing cleaning staff should report that kind of stuff, location room was very clean size and equipment of bathroom
375317,The Mandeville Hotel, The room size for a junior suite was a bit smaller than expectations Facilities in the hotel was minimal like a gym , I loved the room and i loved that they actually cleaned the room twice in the same day I appreciated the nice nespresso machine
375318,The Mandeville Hotel, Rooms are not the same we got a room that we didn t like We ask to change the room because there was a noise from outside When we moved to the new room we found it much better and bigger They didn t upgrade the room caregory they told us it is the same category, Great location staff the nspresso coffe machine 
375319,The Mandeville Hotel, We can t complain , Very central location close to Oxford Street and short walk to the closest tube station Lots of bars and restaurants nearby The hotel bar had nice style and ambience and provided free crisps The room itself was of a decent size and had a nice decor We would definitely consider staying again in the future 
375320,The Mandeville Hotel, Breakfast available at a reasonable price, Lovely friendly gentleman on reception who was able to tell us some history of the hotel with ghost story Quiet comfortable hotel Beautiful room 
375321,The Mandeville Hotel, N a, Very quiet air conditioning Comfortable and elegantly furnished room Staff helpful and cheerful Excellent characterful restaurants nearby Two minutes from Oxford Street 
375322,The Mandeville Hotel, The music in the restaurant grill was too loud and not to my taste rock n roll type , Location exceptionally clean ultra comfortable Restaurant grill excellent 
375323,The Mandeville Hotel, The rooms were a bit small don t think it was good value for money , Staff were very pleasant very tentative Location was very good just off Bond Street so you re in the heart of London Also very close to restaurants and bars 
375324,The Mandeville Hotel, noisy air conditioning first night went quiet after that so maybe it was something I did , Location is excellent easy 2 minute stroll to Oxford street Staff attentive and cheerful Late checkout at no extra cost very welcome 
375325,The Mandeville Hotel, All great Loved the corner room on 7th floor 706 But didn t like the way receptionist during check out and another man tried to convince me not to take the black cab taxi to airport because they wanted to call a mini cab instead I quess some one they know That was not professional in my opinion , Location Value for money 
375326,The Mandeville Hotel, I can imagine if I were staying in the double room I was in as part of a couple it would feel a bit small But it s a central London hotel so I suppose I d expect it Also no lock on the bathroom door which just felt a bit weird to me , The staff were friendly The room service dinner I ordered was delicious 
375327,The Mandeville Hotel, Tiny rooms noise from street could be heard easily with windows closed thus awake all night and awful nights sleep Date tiny bathroom , Bar and bar staff were great
375328,The Mandeville Hotel, Aside from the location I didn t feel that the price was reflected in anything else The room was super noisy even when construction stopped for the night and draughty as well , staff were incredibly sweet and helpful
375329,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly and accommodating staff The location is the best you could ask for and very clean Everyone at the hotel is also very enthusiastic to help with anything you need

375332,The Mandeville Hotel, When we asked for something small to be brought to our room it seemed to be an inconvenience for the staff , Room very comfortable and clean and a good size 
375333,The Mandeville Hotel, The windows are not winterproof there was a very cold draught but the thick curtains and electric heater helped and the double rooms are veeeery small but I guess this is standard in London , The BEST location you can get in London three minutes to Marylebone Village and five minutes to Oxford Street Lovely lobby friendly staff 
375334,The Mandeville Hotel, The coffee machine in the room Not great coffee , Extremely friendly and efficient staff and once they knew it was a birthday treat our room was upgraded After we had returned that afternoon we found that they had left a wonderfully decorated plate saying happy birthday with several delicious cakes 
375335,The Mandeville Hotel, TV in the room was not easy to operate and the system crashed a few times while we were using it , Comfortable room although a little on the small size and poor view from window Room initially chilly but after finding an electric room heater in the cupboard the room soon warmed up and was very cosy Stylish bar 
375336,The Mandeville Hotel, Someone playing loud music past midnight had to call reception who dealt with it Breakfast not included and charged at 22 50 each, Great location Comfortable room
375337,The Mandeville Hotel, I booked 3 double rooms which were all the same price yet one room 311 was alot smaller than the other two rooms , The rooms are very comfortable and attractively furnished The cooked breakfast was excellent and I appreciated the late serving time of 11 30 at the weekends 
375338,The Mandeville Hotel, Housekeeping was a disaster It s run separately to the hotel and it s very bad They even phoned us up to ask when we were leaving the room so they could clean They forgot to refill tea cups glasses etc every day , Very nice room and helpful reception and concierge
375339,The Mandeville Hotel, The lift was very small, We had a lovely room and the bathroom was fab We booked a meal in the resturant and took advantage of the steak dinner offer with a 1 2 bottle of wine each great value The staff were so accommodating and friendly We would return at an instance as it was so comfortable and met our needs
375340,The Mandeville Hotel, Notwithstanding that the bathroom is well equipped including Mandeville bath slippers the only minus is the bathroom for two people it has too little space to put toiletries , In the years we visit London we stayed a couple of times in The Mandeville hotel located in Marylebone With a bunch restaurants around this hotel is within a 5 minute walk of Selfridges and 10 minutes walk to Bond Street Although the location is perfect we booked frequently another hotels The reason was that we got in the past very small rooms we hardly couldn t move in our room one step of everything This time it seemed as the rooms were renovated the rooms are colorfully decorated and we even had a Nespresso coffee machine in our room what gives this hotel as well more allure We had a really pleasant stay and what helps the staff is friendly and helpful 
375341,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, Had a problem with the air conditioning system the first night of our stay The day after they changed our room and upgraded us to a better one at no additional charge for the remaining 3 nights as a way to make up for the nuisance Furthermore I really appreciated how helpful and caring their staff was throughout our stay It was my 3rd stay at the Mandeville and they never failed to exceed my expectations Definitely my to go place when in London 
375342,The Mandeville Hotel, No central heating in room Had to use plug in radiator so took a while to warm up , Fantastic hotel Staff so attentive and helpful Great location Very clean room spotless 
375343,The Mandeville Hotel, The elevator was slow how indepth I m going as it was that good to stay in finding very small holes here, Quite literally everything not a single thing I didn t enjoy 
375344,The Mandeville Hotel, The heating was off in the bedroom on New Year s Eve and it took ages to discover why the room was so cold After discovering this and switching it on everything was OK , Very nice hotel and in an excellent position 
375345,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was small and were surprised at how small it was The nespresso machine was great however we were told that it would only be topped up once and that any more refills that we wanted we would have to pay for We of course politely declined , The Hotel staff are very friendly and accommodating The room was small but nice and clean 
375346,The Mandeville Hotel, No breakfast included room was tiny lift didn t work hair still in the sink No facilities at the hotel cost over 250 for a night very costly for what we got , Right off Oxford street great location friendly staff extra blanket in the wardrobe very quirky theme throughout hotel
375347,The Mandeville Hotel, The smell in the stairs We didn t have a view of the street A bit too expensive , Location and the nearby cafes and restaurants The decoration is fab 
375348,The Mandeville Hotel, Room had bed against the wall coffee machine instructions were wrong bathroom was wet room for disabled tho we are fit with very low tiny hand basin which had no hot water toilet blocked due to a basic plumbing misfit We have stayed 3 times before but won t return, Situation helpful staff and room at the back which was quiet as requested 
375349,The Mandeville Hotel, n a, Fantastic location lovely building very friendly staff and will definitely stay again Will recommend to my friends and family The 3 of us stayed in a junior suite 
375350,The Mandeville Hotel, Rooms are typical London size and being unable to open the windows and both having colds at the time the room felt stuffy Breakfast is over priced , Location friendly polite staff well appointed nice bar 
375351,The Mandeville Hotel, The glass bathroom door looks cool but doesn t block any sound not very romantic Decor not as glamourous as the photos made it look , Very helpful staff particularly the concierge and doorman
375352,The Mandeville Hotel, The room 106 was at the back of the hotel it was noisy on friday night The windows were very thin and let in the cold and noise , The staff were very friendly and polite The location right next to Oxford street and St Christophers Place was perfect for shopping bars and restaurants The hotel Bar was very stylish and the Lunch Menu until 7pm was perfect for an early dinner at a very good price I will stay here again next year on my Christmas shopping trip to London 
375353,The Mandeville Hotel, Noise from road as couldn t close window properly Smelly scatter cushion Expensive coffee pods and very very expensive mini bar Frosted bathroom door 1st room we had was a box room 30 min late breakfast in bed Un edible waffles And bed mite bites , Location Staff
375354,The Mandeville Hotel, Furniture and bed are to a good standard The room itself was tired There was an old window which wasn t water right and condensation was a real problem with their being a puddle on the window seat in the morning This moisture was effecting the room as there was damp on the ceiling and above the window The window should be uvpc double glazed to stop the damp and also reduce the noise of wind and city life Which was a problem when 8 floors up The bathtub also leaked leaving more puddles in the bathroom upstairs For the price of a night you don t expect this , Loved the location At the shops and near Hyde park for winter wonderland And food at st Christopher s
375355,The Mandeville Hotel, small room tiny bathroom thin duvet not adequate for December hotel not noisy with guests but noise does appear to travel easily so could be quieter over 20 for breakfast so I didn t bother, super staff spotlessly clean
375356,The Mandeville Hotel, Our room was on the cool side and even with help from the maintenance team we did not succeed in turning up the temperature We did find an oil fired heater in the wardrobe which helped Breakfast was disappointing lukewarm coffee and stodgy pain au chocolat , Stylish decoration excellent location near both Wigmore Hall and the shops of Marylebone High Street very comfortable bed with soft pillows very rare to find 
375357,The Mandeville Hotel, The rooms and bathrooms are in need of updating The room was very noisy as the double glazing needs replacing , Liked the location Paid for a deluxe room and it was nice and spacious 
375358,The Mandeville Hotel, The room next door shower sounded like it was in my room in the morning At about 11 30pm not hot snacks were available at the bar despite the menu saying it should be Complimentary crisps didn t make up for the treats we read on the menu, Location and price very good
375359,The Mandeville Hotel, The superior double rooms are cramped Bathroom sinks are very small and inconvenient The bathroom door opened onto the bed in one of the small rooms we booked , location and friendliness 
375360,The Mandeville Hotel, Room key didn t work when I returned at night so had to go back to reception other than that perfect, Everything lovely room very comfortable staff were very friendly and helpful
375361,The Mandeville Hotel, small rooms Very cold draft coming from window No vegetarian salad option on room service menu Bed much to soft , Location Most of the staff very helpful and happy Clean 
375362,The Mandeville Hotel, Service is so slow We contacted house keeping for an extra pillow and some tea coffee sachets Had to chase it 3 times and even when it was delivered we never got the pillow Gave up in the end After the room was cleaned for the first day the cleaners took the cups away and never brought them back We booked a table in the restaurant for the first night and it took over an hour before our meal was brought to us and whilst it wasn t the worst meal we ve ever had it certainly wasn t the best Whilst eating we noted quite a few people complaining After our main we were handed the desert menu and 5 minutes later a waiter came up took the menus off us and said Sorry it is too late for desert and the kitchen is now closed Just gone 9 30 on a Friday evening in London and the kitchen was closed Maybe if they served meals quicker they d be able to serve desert too This happened to 2 other tables too Do find local restaurants for breakfast and dinner as it will be far superior On checking out there was a query on the bill where reception said we were due a refund but they had no idea why and said they would check 4 days later we re still waiting to hear despite chasing , Location for Underground shops and other attractions is spot on One of the few hotels where the beds are comfortable Rooms nicely furnished 
375363,The Mandeville Hotel, Weather could have been better Bars around hotel location were very busy but I guess it is Xmas time , Good location close to Bond Street underground station and close to Oxford Street 
375364,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was chilly and this must be known as there was a spare free standing radiator in the wardrobe presumably to use if needed Surely a hotel like this should have a centrally heated room , Ideal for the West End but also slightly away from the mayhem of Oxford St Also brilliant for Marylebone High St and the Wallace Collection 
375365,The Mandeville Hotel, Was in a rear room where the window was not double glazed very drafty and noisy 7am building work outside woke us up extremely noisy, Great staff Concierge very helpful telling us about nice places to eat and how to get to places 
375366,The Mandeville Hotel, Very expensive for the deluxe room comparing with the room size bathroom just beside the bed with no lock or privacy for those how like to have some privacy while using the bathroom , Great location not very crowded and close to shopping area Staff who work at the concierge and the meeter greater at the door was helpful and polite 
375367,The Mandeville Hotel, Nothing , This hotel is in an excellent position especially well situated for Oxford Street and the theatres The room was spacious and clean There was a lovely comfy bed Breakfast was of a good quality and plentiful The Staff are excellent very knowledgeable polite and helpful 
375368,The Mandeville Hotel, Room was touch on the small side but fine for me on my own , Great staff always friendly and willing to help Rooms kept to a high standard and well maintained

375373,The Mandeville Hotel, The room was very small had booked a superior double room Fortunately we did not bring suitcases otherwise it would have been terribly crowded , Close to everything nice and modern
375374,The Mandeville Hotel, For a single supliments I got the smallest room I have ever seen For 275 00 a night I would expect a bottle of water in the room It cost 5 00 This price did not include breakfast Really a joke, All staff
375375,The Mandeville Hotel, Pillows were too soft and flat for our preference Nespresso machine tabletop was too small and tiny we had to struggle abit every morning trying to make the coffee , Location extremely convenient 5 10 mins walk to Bond Street station 5 mins to Selfridge Lots of food choices to the left and right for meals Very lovely and pleasant staffs especially the front desk guy who handled my checked in sorry to have forgotten your name 
375376,The Mandeville Hotel, Absolutely nothing to fault , The staff at this hotel are excellent Welcoming friendly and willing to go the extra mile to help We needed a dentist on arrival and the Concierge made recommendations then phoned ahead before the visit Rooms are high quality and the location is perfect for getting around London and for restaurants 
375377,The Mandeville Hotel, Rooms were small compared to the perceptions given by the photographs I would not say even when taking the area into consideration that it was worth the price , The location is great The beds were superbly comfortable 
375378,The Mandeville Hotel, The single room was tiny Lot of noise from outside the window of an airconditioning unit or something like that Value for money not great on that type of room, The location is absolutely fantastic 
375379,The Mandeville Hotel, Getting a room for a single person same priceclass as the replacement according to the staff in wheelchair without being disabled but got the replacement I was originally expecting for me and my wife after complaining, WiFi the best yet The restaurant also the best Hotel Restaurant yet of very many The location superb
375380,The Mandeville Hotel, There was a building site out our window The work started here at 8am sharp every morning This was not mentioned through the booking process As we were here for our honeymoon it did affect any chance of a lie in , Hotel was centrally located near Oxford Street with close access to tube
375381,The Mandeville Hotel, Horrible shabby tiny elevator to the higher floors extremely small rooms which hardly left room to walk arould the bed which was also very small for 2 people tiny little bathroom, Very good location close to Oxford Street and Bond Street Subway station and at a walking distnace to Soho Regent Street and Piccadilly Circus
375382,The Mandeville Hotel, We booked through Booking com and felt the room was quite small The cost of breakfast at 45 for us both was extortionate we didn t partake It would have been nice and sent us on our way much happier , The staff were very friendly and the hotel was well managed well positioned and stylish 
375383,The Mandeville Hotel, Noise there was construction on the three sides of the building 1 inside the hotel 2 road construction very noisy 3 cross the street construction of another building, Location near Oxford and everything in central London within walking distance New clean facility room size is ok better than others
375384,The Mandeville Hotel, You could hear the Workman working outside very early We are early birds but didn t have to be anywhere specific this day So spilt a little quality time we should of been advised when choosing this hotel , Nice comfy bed quite spacious for london great location we have stayed here previously 
375385,The Mandeville Hotel, General maintenance of the room was a bit poor from a hotel of this standard door of mini bar fridge coming off its hinges batteries flat in TV remote and shower that leaks out the door It was also frustrating to have the Do Not Disturb sign on the door when our son was sleeping and then having housekeeping ring the telephone twice to ask when they could make up the room and then someone else knocking on the door another day to do some sort of routine inspection , Location was excellent for us We always stay in Marylebone when we come to London and this particular location is perfect for both access to Bond Street station Mayfair and the Marylebone High Street Staff very friendly and helpful 
375386,The Mandeville Hotel, A high price for an edge of central London Hotel that did not include an English Breakfast within the business booking cost Then the small print on the restaurant menu that then adds VAT and then a service charge meal cost then much larger than originally indicated We have normally staid at the Charring Cross Hotel or other then Grumond Hotels All of which were fully booked for our potential stay night Hence the booking with you via Booking com that then caused problems since you only sent confirmation of one of the two single room bookings I had made to me My business partner did not seem to have a room booked , Very good concierge and reception staff 
375387,The Mandeville Hotel, Nothing bad but a welcoming smile from the receptionist would have been nice, Our stay was made personal by being presented with 3 cakes on a plate with Happy birthday written in chocolate
375388,The Mandeville Hotel, Thank you to let me tell you my experience I had during the breakfast the last Monday 12 at your comedor The Chef a Laidy did have very bad manners with the employees may be she had bad humor that they but me and my wife felt very sorry because of them This I consider unusual whit all the people who attend un during my staying couldn t be better Thanks again ,No Positive
375389,The Mandeville Hotel, The superior room we had room 103 was dreadful Complained about an awful noise coming from the air conditioning unit even though not switched on Woken at 3 30am with awful noise again didn t get any sleep Did report to staff on check out but didn t seem too worried in offering any discount or apologies , We have stayed here on quite a few occasions and like the location 
375390,The Mandeville Hotel, rooms too small for price cleanliness of beds and content of covers too old Air con too loud Coffee at breakfast unacceptably bad no free expresso in exchange, Location Quiet room to the back
375391,The Mandeville Hotel, We did not get the best room in the place but it was OK On 1st floor with nothing to look at except a building site across the road , Location was excellent
375392,The Mandeville Hotel, Bath would not empty as plug stuck Coffee machine not working properly Expensive Breakfast , Location situated in West End of London so great for Oxford Street shopping or Theatre trip 
375393,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, Fabulous hotel fabulous staff and wonderful location I really can t recommend this hotel enough If you are planning a London break away don t hesitate to book The Mandeville 
375394,The Mandeville Hotel, What can say Hotel prices in London are just crazy With 300euros per night you get shoebox size room single without mirror or minibar You have no space open you luggage etc Breakfast also overly expensive with dirty tableware and very limited buffet But still hotel is OK compared to some of the hotels in same area , Good location clean rooms ok service 
375395,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, The Mandeville is a lovely hotel just a short walk to Oxford Street and Bond Street station The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room very comfortable Only drawback was the size or shape of the room made manoevering three suitcases awkward

375401,The Mandeville Hotel, The double room is too small The toilet of room 209 is TOOOOO small to even wash I was super disappointed by it specially that i was in a room with a bigger toilet and i moved to the same room just with 2 separated beds and i paid more to upgrade but the size of 209 was more like a downgrade to be honest I was sad about it , The location is AMAAAZINGGGGGG The staff are fruendly The service is fast
375402,The Mandeville Hotel,No Negative, Carlos the concierge was excellent We arranged for transportation obtain theater tickets and provided directions and recommendations He made getting around Lindon much easier 
375403,The Mandeville Hotel, Our room was nothing like the ones showing on their website It was dated and did not give a luxury feeling at all Paying 230 per night did not feel right Bed was however comfortable and the room was quiet The bathroom was very large which was a nice thing for a hotel room in London We also found the staff rather un engaged or to almost distrustful , Location is fantastic close to a buzzing and noisy Oxford street but yet in a very quiet street 
375404,The Mandeville Hotel, 420 for 2 nights is very expensive and should have at least included breakfast Also think the view of a back yard in the superior room was poor making us wonder what the standard rooms would be like , Location and comfort
375405,The Mandeville Hotel, Disappointment The room is smaller than what the description says The staff at the reception are not necessarily helpful or friendly surprising The shower was a disaster the whole floor just drowns every time you take a shower , Location is wonderful The bar staff are very friendly and know what they are doing The reception staff on the 3rd day were friendly and helpful Nespresso machine in the room
