494792,Hotel Liberty, There is no wi fi in the rooms and no air conditioning Place need some substantial renovation The furniture and appliances are very old , Good location quiet if rooms are on the internal side Staff are helpful and friendly 
494793,Hotel Liberty, The hotel was advertised with air conditioning however when asked it was stated it was too early for it to be put on I thought the staff member meant time but he actually meant in the year It was May and it was 26 degrees so the room was extremely hot Shouldn t advertise air conditioning if it is not in use , Great location with public transport links on door step and short work into town Breakfast was great and especially liked the coffee 
494794,Hotel Liberty, There was no hot water in my room and staff were uninterested in resolving this They just shrugged their shoulders and handed us a jug of hot water for washing Under pressure my room was changed Also there is a bathroom just off the lobby but it has no running water and again a shrug from the staff most unhygenic surely a health and safety matter Also items ran out at breakfast food bowls glasses and it was difficult to get these from the staff , Tram lines
494795,Hotel Liberty, NO wifi in room You have to go to portal for internet No window in room only door that open in an outside passage and therefor could not be left open for fresh air by night Aircon to weak to cool room on the bed as it is around the corner No pace to put your suitcases Very very small tv Toiletries provided were very basic and to little for two persons , Breakfast was good 
494796,Hotel Liberty, Our bed wasn t made the next day The AC didn t work so it was absolutely boiling in our room We had to plan showers around how long we d be in the room for and this was mid may so unsure what it would be like in the heart of summer , The room was clean 
494797,Hotel Liberty, Breakfast very simple and basic Room drapes are ripped Pillows too soft , Location 5 mins walk to main train station Property surrounded by eateries and souvenir shops Old fashioned and manual lift Comfortable bed 
494798,Hotel Liberty, This may have been a four star hotel 20 years ago Today it badly needs renovating Rooms bathrooms carpets are worn out Looks like the hotel has been abandoned by its owners If you really must stay there avoid rooms streetside Noisy ,No Positive
494799,Hotel Liberty, The hotel is terrible they advertise for AC which does not work in the entire building although it was 26 degrees As the owner do not want to run it The room telephones are not even connected not even to call reception The bathroom bath was incredibly dirty I took pictures never seen this in my entire travels Overall disgusting They hotel looks like it got stuck in the 70 s and never moved on Completely obsolete A disaster never stay there really How can even booking com have this hotel on its list is a big question mark That hotel should not even trade Or May be as a hostel, Nothing
494800,Hotel Liberty, In simple words STAY AWAY This hotel fails to provide any minimum comfort The shower was so dirty and disgusting i could not even bring myself to shower Dirt and dust and hair from previous guests This hotel requires an extensive renovation or simply cleaning ,No Positive
494801,Hotel Liberty, Rooms were tired Carpet needed a good clean or replacement Plumbing system outdated Various fittings were missing or knobs had come off There were about 5 lamps that needed replacing The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax , Trams passed the front door Attractive foyer Staff spoke English and gave good guidance to how to get around Breakfast waitress was very helpful but the selection of food was limited and breakfast finished at 09 00 
494802,Hotel Liberty, I can t see the four star rank I don t mean for the current state but for the little cubage of rooms and premises small TV sets and Wifi not available , Suggested for non allergic people to mites fans of vintage and retr setting good location near to Navigli 
494803,Hotel Liberty, Hotel needs a good cleanup allover and breakfast needs improving though good enough for short stays , Hotel location is excellent Tram stop just outside the door Staff are very friendly and ready to help out Overall stay was wonderful and was the cheapest available hotel during the end of April 2017 
494804,Hotel Liberty,No Negative, The Wi Fi was reachable near the lobby The room was old and I didn t feel it welcoming The breakfast was one of the simplest I have had I like the location near public transport bars and restaurants 
494805,Hotel Liberty, Extremely dirty probably has not been cleaned properly in many years Hair in the shower and bathroom floor Don t look under the bed the dust is appalling Cigarette smoke with ash trays outside your room Hotel needs some professional management , Breakfast was ok 
494806,Hotel Liberty, When you pay that much of an amount with an expensive city tax you expect premium service Which was hardly the case The whole experience was depressing at the best A so called four star hotel with no WiFi in rooms The lobby is deceiving of the interiors The rooms are dismal The staff is not very friendly One guy was quite rude Terrible experience , Just the breakfast service 
494807,Hotel Liberty, No WiFi at room The staff was not good when we asked him he seemed to be non interested or not in knowing mode of it to be honest I dint like my room either , Just the free breakfast 
494808,Hotel Liberty, The room not comfortable and the bathroom truly bad , I really unhappy with the room vessel and sink in bath room was damage and the rate not value for the room quality I never come back this hotel for future

494811,Hotel Liberty, everything how such a facility can take 4 stars The room was dirty Even in bathroom there were hair and dirt everywhere Very small uncomfortable, nothing except location
494812,Hotel Liberty, The shower water pressure was absolutely missing I guess the falling rain have greater pressure That was the only thing that I hated because not being able to take a proper shower made that stay a lot less comfortable, The stuff was extremely nice The breakfast was delicious it was typical Italian Breakfast Also my girlfriend loved the room design it was really stylish and old style
