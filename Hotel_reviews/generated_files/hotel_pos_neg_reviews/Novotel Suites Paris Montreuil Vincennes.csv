108125,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Really far away from centre but I suppose that s why it is cheaper than others and travelling about the city is all part of the experience too We stayed on a ground floor room and returned one evening to find two strangers were in the room who promptly jumped out when we walked in Nothing was stolen I think we caught them just in time so it was more a strange experience than a frightening one Paris is not the same as it was just 2 years ago because of the terror threat , Hotel was clean and modern Staff were friendly and helpful Really cheap Only place we had been to on this trip which had its own fridge which was a bonus 
108126,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Nothing , Easy to get to by car plus parking on site Family friendly Lovely suites and metro just 10 minute walk away that s get you to the centre of Paris with no hassle 
108127,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The area wasn t great but we knew that when we booked perfect location for access to metro and roads , Near metro shopping centre and access to main road round Paris 
108128,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The hotel was located in a rough area The first day we walked outside to get food as the hotel had no restaurant and we had stuff thrown at us we were recorded and had people shout things at us all within a few steps away from the hotel There is a metro station about 5 minutes away from the hotel but we were unable to use it as it was too dangerous to walk We ended up using Uber s to and from the hotel and even the drivers were reluncant to drive here and had a few drivers cancel on us because of this The drivers that did pick us up all told us not to stay out late and get back and stay in the hotel room Really wouldn t recommend the hotel to anyone especially tourists of family s and groups of young girls The location of the hotel did ruin our trip as we couldn t stay out late because of how bad the area was meaning we were back by our hotel at 7 every night There is meant to be a super market near by but every time we tried to find it someone would make us feel uncomfortable so we had to go back to the hotel The hotel it s self was nice the staff were okay and rooms were really nice however drivers told us this hotel is used for prostitution so really wouldn t recommend to families , The room was great especially for the price we payed 
108129,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Shower cabin looks like a boat module We were expecting a bit more quality here Disappointed by the quality of the breakfast overpriced no refill There is no kitchen in this hotel which is out of the city come back with full stomach Staff was not really inviting , Last minute trip to Paris by car this hotel in near the peripherique belt around Paris and easily accessible by car with a secure car park Rooms are big and very comfortable and we were surprised by the quality of the noise reduction Good beds Novotel standards The location is not touristic at all but near one of the best subway line and easily reachable with a VTC by night 
108130,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Pretty much everything in an awful area not safe to walk home from metro at night Beds are so uncomfortable Air conditioning was worthless also, Staff were nice in fairness
108131,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, All good Receptionists hotel staff attentive and helpful to all your needs great or small May need to get order takeaways food or choose to go to any of array of european world cuisine nearby , Spacious family business person friendly with well ventilated bright en suite rooms with large comfortable bed sofa bed large study desk wall shelfs angle poised lamp x2 inbuilt wardrobes large bathroom shower separate small toilet Huge TV channels Shop eat till you drop multiethnic european african asian arabian area friendly safe area at least while there with massive shopping complex and fantastic huge 3day global market in large car park in front of hotel Receptionists fabulous and helpful as were the chambermaids who cleaned rooms virtually daily Excellent transport nearby Places to eat relax in large lounge breakfast area by reception and adjoining bedecked back garden
108132,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Location too far from anywhere Across from market on weekend dirty difficut access with cars blocking roads , Rooms were spacious comfortable 
108133,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Aircondition in one of our two rooms was not working and reparation was delayed three days without result Then we shifted to another room with the same problem Bad service Incidence of weekly street market which lies just beside the hotel was unfortunately unlucky for us because of a lot of noise and traffic problems ,No Positive
108134,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The location was feeling unsafe due to the markets put up in front the hotel staff were rude and unfriendly we had room cleaning done while we were away and put the DND sign on the door we were made to wait 4hours for the room when we reached the place , Nothing
108135,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The staffs communication and the booking process I booked three nights for 4 pax which I suppose it should be 4 person in one room because it s a 4 pax suite indicated on the booking com website through booking com On arrival the lady who assisted us gave us two suite room which can fit in 8pax and didn t explain further When I queried about the numbers of room that i booked she just told us that was what showed in their system and said that i only requested adjoining room We accepted what the lady said since we already there and just paid for the amount that she asked me to pay and unfortunately I didnt check through the bill statements and happily moved in to our rooms Everything went smooth on the 1st and 2nd days however we realized one of our rooms card been deactivated on the day that before checking out I went to the front counter and query but the process was very unprofessional The guy who assisted me told me that i didnt pay for the room and that s why the card had been deactivated It surprised me How can i just paid for one room instead since i settled the bill on arrival in the hotel Why the lady who assisted me didn t charge the bill properly in the first place The guy asked me to bring the bill statement down and showed it to him then I realized that only one room had been charged for the last night At the end i need to settle the bill again Something came into my mind maybe that s actually what I booked from booking com 1 suite room and i just don t understand how s their process In such a big hotel company I believe it should have a very well organized operating system and well trained staffs to assist their customers to enjoy their stays with them Even though this is just a minor mistake or miscommunication but it is good enough to cause unpleasant experience to the customers Thank you , The room is very clean cosy and the bed is comfy 
108136,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Air conditioning did not work all three days The management did nothing about it just claiming it was working fine We reported all three days in the morning and night In response we got fans Not a 4 star if we have to use fans in the middle of summer, Comfortable bed Clean room Toilet and Bath seperated
108137,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Outside of the hotel it was dirty streets were dirty walls full of graffiti propanda and the smells from the sewers were bad The people were very diverse in terms of the very poor and the working class and middle eastern dominant , Inside the hotel spacious modern reception area with garden Air conditioning hot and cold water espresso machine tea cookies bottled water for the guests in the rooms amazing free breakfast for young kids 
108138,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, We booked specifically 2 adjoining rooms were we thought that those were two rooms which had a door in between to adjoin them only to find out that it was just simply two rooms next to each other without a door to connect them Coffee in the room was for free but they only had paper cups and no spoons Parking was 15 per day not per night too expensive for that part of Paris , The rooms were very comfortable new and clean 
108139,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Unfriendly staff overall Specially one of their night evening supervisor named Namakan He is non cooperative and rude Other than that even location of hotel is not good highly unsafe ,No Positive
108140,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The staff was very unprofessional at first too many systematic mistakes They gave us a wrong room number were we entered to a room full of guests They denied the fact that we requested an early check in even after we showed them the email They denied the collaboration between them and booking com The room they gave us was very smelly Furthermore we requested a taxi from the hotel they delayed the process The overall staff was very unprofessional unlike other novotel staff in other countries,No Positive

108142,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, No plates for breakfast put food on serviette on tray Bit noisey and untidy on weekend but ideal if you like markets , Good parking nice room and staff 
108143,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Breakfast could be a bit better , Clean rooms Good location Relative close to a Metro station with direct link to center and easy to change for Disneyland even with kids Nice parking and not too expensive 
108144,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The receptionist of the check in was not friendly as we expected The comunication with him was difficult and he doesn t made effort to really help us They neex to improve it , Cool appartment Just like the photos Well located It is close to a train station and mealing area The guy who did the check out was veey friendly 
108145,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Horrible neighborhood they didn t have keys to the rooms so they had to let you in when you came and went Breakfast was 15 per person , It was a relatively new facility they had a few nice additions in the works 
108146,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The rooms were not temperature controlled We were moved twice and none of the 3 rooms we were moved to had a working thermostat Based on the reaction from the maintenance individual this was normal and my understanding was a complaint they rarely had to do much about as their culture doesn t make much use of AC As I understand it this particular Novotel is used mostly by local business individuals and not foreign vacationers There are some plumbing issues In the third room we were moved to we often heard the water gurgling back up the drains of our sinks and bathtubs after we flushed a toilet or ran shower bath One day in particular the smell of urine was pretty strong in both the toilet room and shower room I would agree with many others that the pictures are a misrepresentation of what you are actually getting Additionally I agree this is really a 3 star hotel not a 4 , There was a market across the street for several days which provided some fun shopping experience I will say that the market does leave behind a LOT of trash at the end of each day but it gets cleaned It didn t bother us in the least The staff was friendly most of the time The beds were very comfortable There have been several ppl stating they felt this area was unsafe We never felt unsafe at any time 
108147,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, I stayed at the Novotel Suites Montreuil one week with my disabled boyfriend I honestly don t know how this hotel could be a 4 stars hotel Rooms are not well manteined not clean bath and shower were stained and not clean The area is very shady and sketchy not good for walking or wandering around especially for girls There is no restaurant in the hotel and is very difficult to find a good one around There is also no service whatever you need towels soap etc you need to go down to reception ask for it and get it yourself Cleaning ladies would just come into the room without even knocking they did so repeatedly one morning they came in 5 times despite we told them not to The personnel at the reception changes a lot and apart from one nice blond lady the rest of them were not helpful not kind not nice I definitely wouldn t suggest this hotel to anyone Bad bad experience ,No Positive
108148,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The location is not the best I knew it from before so I researched the metro services Metro service took me to A to Z , Clean safe worth the money and it s easy to travel to Direct bus from the CGD airport Metro station 10minutes walk away Good staff 
108149,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The 1st Point of conctact the receptionist blond young lady was unwelcoming Unprofessional and her customer service was far below average not reflecting the Hotel true 4 Stars Standard at all the Rest of staff either at reception or housekeeping were polite genuine and helpful, The bath Comfy beds and the room was spacious modern and clean Safe carpark
108150,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Place is near a parking lot cum market which is a bit shabby and smelly some times , Speacious room for my family of 3 Comfortable bed Clean bathroom Accessible my metro with a of about 7 minutes
108151,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The breakfast could have been better and my friends did not find their single mattresses and pillows as comfy as the double bed was Other than that we had a great stay as there was loads of places we could go to eat and the metro was easy to find , The rooms were spacious the fact that it had a market area in front of the hotel was a good thing as we were able to buy some of our gifts from there and other things It had a little front garden and a small beach area which was quite chilling and relaxing 
108152,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Rooms could have been maintained better and would ve have been nicer Many things were slightly broken in our room our toilet wouldn t flush this was fixed our bathtub would not hold water the shower head was broken and would fall off its mount etc Further there is little individual climate control in the rooms Since the heat was still on high we were forced to leave our windows open to cool it down which makes the rooms very noisy from nearby autoroute and morning markets , The staff was helpful and allowed us to check in early The bed was comfortable and the rooms a good size enough to comfortably fit a small family and had a small refrigerator Metro was close as was a grocery store 
108153,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, They added on a fee of around 20 euros when I initially paid for my room for something called city tax which is something I have never heard of and should definitely have been advertised in the price Replacement items were extortionately expensive if you wanted an extra tea bag that they replaced daily anyway it cost 3 euros for a single tea bag which is absolutely ridiculous Felt like a very dangerous area too lots of homeless around and not close to any sights , Room was very clean came with a kettle and a microwave which was useful Also provide a coffee machine and 3 coffee packets too 
108154,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes,No Negative, Nespresso machine in the room is a bonus I ve stayed here 3 times now and it had beengreat I had some troubles and although the blonde girl at reception was very very rude the manager Mme Fourone was excellent and helpful I would stay there again for sure
108155,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Location was in front of a very disgusting flea market Trash was everywhere Individuals were trying very hard to solicit business at the flea market , 5Min walk to Metro Location was next to grocery store and small mall Parking was only 15Euros 
108156,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Everything the staff was arrogant way too expensive hotel the location is remote the facilities are really bad the room felt like a oven very hot and the air conditioner did not work the hotel staff was arrogant and did not help resolve the issue The breakfast spread was really bad for 15 euros one can get much better bfast anywhere else I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and I would file a case against the hotel and demand a refund , Nothing
108157,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Pollution due to being right next to the motorway Dirty run down area Bed was not very comfortable Air conditioning did not work in our room , Staff were friendly
108158,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The location sucks If you like to walk out of your hotel and explore Paris this isn t for you We requested a wheelchair accessible room and the hotel accommodated us accordingly however the bathroom in our room would flood every time someone showered Without 800 1000 towels per day the floor would be too slippery and unsafe to walk on particularly if you re mobility impaired , The room was clean and comfortable and the amenities were fantastic The breakfast was not too bad either Metro was a short walk from hotel which was handy 
108159,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, No smart tv Couldn t understand what was being said on TV Area Outside property not clean rubbish outside off putting, Liked hotel bed room nice and comfortable Had everything you could need 
108160,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, There is a market outside of the hotel which durin the day is quite nice but very dirty after , Beds were extremely comfy bathroom was exceptionally clean Staff were extremely friendly and helpful There is a motorway right across the road but from the rooms it can t be heard 
108161,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The location neighborhood was in a more commercial kind of ghetto area There was a market across the street which made it very difficult to travel in and out of the parking garage Upon arrival we had some difficulty communicating and getting into the garage with the staff which was frustrating The hotel was overpriced We paid for a superior suite but the room was quite small There were also hole designs in the doors to the bathrooms which was quite weird and didn t allow for ANY privacy ,No Positive
108162,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, We booked a non smoking room but we were placed in the pro smoking floor they changed our room after we asked In addition smoke and weed smoke was passing through doors so consistently that we could not sleep We still do not understand why we could smell weed scent also in the non smoking room The bathrooms were also stinky as if they were not used much The moquette was dirty , Rooms were large The personnel was helpful and kind All the towels and sheets were very clean 
108163,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The position of the hotel is in a strange area of Paris A lot of weird persons are in the area but the hotel itself its protected by the hotel staff It s very recommended that you book your room with parking included It s not adviced to park outside , The beds were incredible good The food was ok 
108164,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes,No Negative, Clean comfy secure parking great value for money great location metro line 9 just around the corner if you get of at trocadero you come out to see amazing views of Eiffel Tower
108165,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, We had a really bad experience we paid 284 to stay two nights with 5 people and two dogs which was 2 rooms that was not a problem We had a good time so we decided to stay an extra night which i paid 137 for the same two rooms for the night The next day after we get back to the hotel we were asked to paid for an extra 137 because the staff made a mistake and only booked us for a one room I explain to staff that I paid for the same two rooms the day before which i had my receipt and we asked to talk to a manager to straight it out and the staff refuse basically we were told to pay for their mistake or get out this really turn our family vacation negatively We had to get our stuff an leave the hotel because I refuse to pay for their mistake the staff was really rude and didn t care to help us , It was clean
108166,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Wifi was only in the lobby which was a little annoying though not really an issue , The facilities are excellent and the staff were very nice It was very clean and reasonably easy to travel around They also have a shuttle which was pretty convenient 
108167,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes,No Negative, The rooms were amazing It is near by to the metro station The flea market opposite to the hotel is amazing to walk The staff was very friendly and i will recommend it to others for the stay

108169,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, we are family of 5 we were given two separate rooms so family had to split up between the two rooms Only continental Breakfast and breakfast area too small Area is rough tricky for someone don t know paris, Rooms are excellent free wifi
108170,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The surrounding area was scary crowded with vans dirty and noisy We were very fearful for our safety all the time , The rooms were very spacious and the layout was great with a separate toilet and shower The staff were all extra friendly and helpful

108173,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Air conditioning was horrible location was terrible elevators old and slow as a conclusion it wasn t like a 4star hotel, Room size parking cleaning
108174,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Hotel seems to be in a bad part of the neighbourhood Often asked for money by people walking passed There are markets and street vendors nearby that also hassle you, Staff were friendly and made everything easy Coffee was restocked everyday 
108175,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, When we were there it was very hot and air condition was not working staff did not help at all and was just saying sorry could not sleep whole night and when requested for fan was given next day manager promised a c will be repaired but it did not happen and was like I am sorry so I would not recommend this place in summer if you are looking for pleasant sleep The room on my side was very noisy , Room was ok clean had microwave and coffee machine which very rare 
108176,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, TRAP This hotel deserves a 2 or maximum 3 stars The location is super bad The reception is smelly The breakfast is poor If you think this is a 4 star hotel think again ,No Positive
108177,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The location is very bad it s in front of a big nasty flea market Attached photos from my window in the 9th floor On my arrival there was a big fight related to this flea marked which scared the people in the street and it was big that it even blocked the street for cars to pass It vanished in minutes but the experience was horrible On one night a fire alarm was triggered at 2am It woke the whole hotel up in a horrifying way and the situation wasn t handled that good I had a terrible sleep that night and a bad day at work in the next morning , The room was clean and very quite I was in the 9th floor Carrefour is so close to the hotel Metro Line 9 Station Porte de Montreuil is 8 minutes walk from the hotel NOTE The hotel is located east of Paris so plan your trip well as it maybe far from your needs For example it will take you around 50 minutes to reach Eiffel Tower by Metro 
108178,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The location is slightly off the city centre u need to change 2 trains station area looks dodgy especially in the night ii gets scary if u r with family Also the bathroom n toilet doors r funny they don t have lock from inside and has a big hole which acts like a handle right in the middle which is embarrassing when u have kids staying with u, Liked the rooms they r quite different compared to most hotels It s a cute little hotel Carrefour n a mall is next door

108185,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Location was a bit scary A market in the carpark opposite the hotel which left a horrible mess when they left Not sure I would wonder around after dark on my own in this location When the room States single and sofa bed it s not actually another bed it s a Matress stuffed under the sofa bed , It was really easy to get to the subway station which could take you anywhere Some lovely little restaurants about The room was spacious and clean A supermarket like a two minute walk Good wifi Was a lovely room all in all 
108186,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, No information of hotel facilities in the room Hotel common areas and lifts need a little refurbishment, Friendly staff nice room very clean good breakfast good location
108187,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The area is a little rough at first on the weekends a giant Flea Market arrives in the parking lot across from the hotel This brings a lot of peddlers with items that look suspiciously like stolen goods This threw off my liking of the area as it brought a lot of people to the area who looked up to no good The location is a bit far from all of the sights but the metro is just around the corner and with a navigo pass it is easy to get around Also the workout room only had 4 cardio machines and a pushup ladder Nothing serious can go on in here unless you just want to run , The room was massive and had everything I wanted The staff are so very nice and accommodating In French or English they can assist you well The breakfast was delicious The room cleaning staff were predictable and very thorough They always did a good job at keeping my room clean and fresh The shower is big the bathtub was sufficient and the bathroom was just overall nice The TV has alot of channels too something a previous hotel lacked 
108188,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, We came back after a long day to find the room to our door propped wide open The area is really bad Room service ignores the do not disturb signs , The staff was friendly and the room was big and quiet The beds are comfy Close to Metro 9 The breakfast was worth paying 15 to have an easy start to the day 
108189,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, Worst Hotel Ever If you know what s good for you and value your hard earned money you will heed this warning This hotel was dirty location was horrible right next to a freeway and a dirty flee market I think this might be where the Paris ghetto is It s far from the city center airport and train stations Had to make at least 3 transfers to get to the major attractions The employees were very rude The door to the fitness room there was one thread mill inside the fitness room wasn t working There was no way to control the temperature in the room We had to open up the only working window which wasn t a great idea since our room was facing the busiest freeway in Paris So we pretty much didn t sleep The bed was so uncomfortable nasty stains on the carpet and the entire room was disgusting It was so horrible that we didn t even stayed the second night even though we paid for 3 nights I didn t even care that I lost my money the room was prepaid in the process I feared for my safety I should have taken pictures of the inside of the property but I couldn t get out there fast enough , I didn t like anything on this property 
108190,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, The area was right next to a giant flea market There were vans everywhere from dawn and we had to pick our way through the stalls to get to the underground station On the Saturday night there was a massive traffic jam because it s right on the roundabout for the ring road There was quite a lots of noise early in the morning too , The room was great with lots of space and very comfortable beds There was a big Carrefour supermarket next door so we could buy anything we needed

108192,Novotel Suites Paris Montreuil Vincennes, the room is big but looks old the furnitures the floors The hotel is not really safe either I kept my luggage in the luggage storage in the hotel and what has happened is someone broke the zip and the other zip i used 3 locked combination key but someone could open it Fortunately there is nothing valuable inside Although they locked the storage they allow customers to go inside the storage without their companion sometimes Also there is no concierge They just have 2 receptionists That s all It not what you expect from 4 star hotel ,No Positive
