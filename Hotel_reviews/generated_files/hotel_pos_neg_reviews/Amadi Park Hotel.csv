316051,Amadi Park Hotel, You might hear street noise but AC is good if you need to shut windows Rooms are bowed so not especially spacious but adequate for 2 people , Mum teen daughter trip The hotel is a little different being in an apartment block but it s pretty cool having glass walkways between areas Rooms were modern clean comfortable cool glass bathrooms robes and free beer juice in the minibar also a good coffee machine with various teas too Staff really friendly allowed us to leave our bags when we checked out so we could tour unhindered until our taxi Great area too their breakfast looked lovely but we went to nearby Mook Pankakes instead Also the Food Hall is nearby again lovely food you feel more like you are getting a feel for real Amsterdam staying here rather than right in the centre but still close enough to walk to everything Museums canal trips 9 streets a must if you are female into shopping at all A little research on the area is needed as there s some great places nearby 
316052,Amadi Park Hotel, It was nice that the items in the minibar were free but I wish there was free water in the room rather than free Fanta , Great location lovely staff Lovely restaurants nearby 
316053,Amadi Park Hotel, I m not sure if this is a hotel it gives more a hostel feeling I ve stayed in Amsterdam a few times before 4 hotels and I m struggling to understand that this would meet 4 accommodation , The location is good close to the center walking distance and a few good restaurants very close by Easy to get from the airport etc It just the way it s set out it s a bit unusual 
316054,Amadi Park Hotel, Room was small but this was stated when booking so can t complain , Incredibly friendly check in Lots of time given to us to and was so welcoming He deserves an award Good location nice coffee machine great shower Not a hotel feel with the layout but still perfectly nice 
316055,Amadi Park Hotel, I didn t eat breakfast there because it was too expensive per day Also the shower is poorly designed The water flows out too far and then takes long to dry , The location was not bad Close walk to main museums and parks as well a couple of popular squares The room was really cute and just right for one person The hotel was quiet and clean The minibar items were complimentary which was nice Staff were friendly and helpful answering any questuons that I had 
316056,Amadi Park Hotel, Tiny tiny room less like a hotel more like student accommodation Barely any room to spread my stuff out Single bed but it was comfortable enough Bathroom was the worst also tiny with only half the shower closed in by glass No exhaust fan either , Good location away from the madness of the city centre but close to public transport Nespresso machine in the room with coffee pods restocked daily Great wifi 
316057,Amadi Park Hotel, Room is a little small breakfast is a bit expensive even if in line with what others hotels in the area offer I went to the bakery opposite the hotel and had some lovely fresh pastries for a decent price , Quiet location but still close from the museum area 10 minutes The City centre 20 minutes or the old Amsterdam 15 minutes Friendly and helpful staff with a lot of very good tips and advise on restaurants thank you for the Sea Food Bar this was amazing complementary drinks in the room are very nice Room is clean bed comfortable and funny bathroom 
316058,Amadi Park Hotel, N A, Hotel lived up to my expectations and the accommodation was first class The staff were extremely friendly and informative which made my stay even more relaxing This was a stop over for me returning home fom a long vacation that took me to Sicily
316059,Amadi Park Hotel, Internet sometimes a bit slow , It s a pity there s no extra wide smile for rating of staff and breakfast Extremely friendly and helpful reception Walking distance from the city center Coffee and tea in the room Quiet 
316060,Amadi Park Hotel, Better onboarding by hotel staff to explain basics would ve gone a long way to being better orientated to and inside the room I took me time to find my room location wasn t intuitive and this could ve been better explained The cleanliness of the room was not up to standard The floor was dusty and there was only half a roll of toilet paper loaded in the bathroom The worst thing for me was not being able to turn off the A C only to find out later that there was a separate lever to do this that was not explained , Location room size decent pricing 
316061,Amadi Park Hotel, I hardly can call this hotel a 4 star The rooms are located in a residential building and hotel rents out some of the rooms of this building there are other offices and residential apartments in the same building My room was not made up until 16 o clock and that was everyday practice , A spacious safe box in the room A nespresso coffee machine in the room
316062,Amadi Park Hotel, There were many businesses in the same building It was confusing The hotel was in the same floor with a dentist The shower was open which made a mess in the bathroom The room was small , Breakfast and location were very good 
316063,Amadi Park Hotel, Perhaps just one or two more items on the breakfast menu however reasonable value for money compared to local cafes , Room bigger than expected small room booked staff very friendly fresh breakfast with good coffee quiet room tram stop near hotel 
316064,Amadi Park Hotel, I do not recall any negative points , The hotel is clean and we were given a newly decorated and spacious room The area is not far from the Museum quarter bordering the centre of the city the Oud West is full of design stores cool cafe bars and some of the best restaurants in the city 
316065,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Amadi Park Hotel is well located in walking distance from many popular attractions in Amsterdam It is not actually downtown but you can easily walk or take local communications to get there The breakfast room is small but you can choose to sit outside if the weather is good The breakfast is very fine We had a nice stay there 
316066,Amadi Park Hotel, Basically the hotel is a set of residential apartments within a residential block altered to be Hotel rooms The only shared accommodation is a check in and small breakfast area two floors above Rooms are small and not ones that you would spend any time in Seemed expensive for what we got but I guess all Hotels in Amsterdam are expensive No bikes available for hire but a hire shop just down the road , Easy central location just outside the old central canal section Secure within a shared building that also has residential flats Near many cafes and restaurants 
316067,Amadi Park Hotel, The mix of residence and hotel was very confusing I did not like the fact that the bedroom windows could be walked past directly by other guests residences I would not choose to stay there again because for the price I know I can stay in a better hotel with much better facilities, The shower was excellent
316068,Amadi Park Hotel, Breakfast was expensive It was a bit strange to not find the reception at the entrance Instead we had to go to the 4th floor to check in This was not an issue but it s just something to be aware of as we felt a bit lost when we arrived and we were unsure if we had the correct address It is not a conventional hotel the building is shared with other businesses , The rooms are nice and very clean It is close to the city centre 20min walk with good transport links 
316069,Amadi Park Hotel, Staff didn t know how to patch through a local phone call from a friend to my room Maybe a part timer But not a big deal , I like the coffee machine in the room
316070,Amadi Park Hotel, VERY small room expensive for what you get one pillow no top sheet just the comforter no tissues shower water gets area in front of sink pretty wet AC fan were weak very funky layout don t expect a traditional hotel hard to find reception area on fourth floor internet was spotty would not recommend , Pretty decent location for walkers room was clean fresh towels everyday would ve been nice to know beforehand that pop beer in frig were free I didn t enjoy them because I thought they cost extra 
316071,Amadi Park Hotel, They charged my card before check out without my permission and I didn t even want to use that card I was very unhappy with that They didn t even share the bill with us before taking money out I was disgusted actually,No Positive
316072,Amadi Park Hotel, We had an outside walk way balcony which would have been nice if it had a couple of small chairs to have your morning coffee , The bed and pillows were really comfortable had a great nights sleep A lovely residential area so away from the commercial side if that s what you want 
316073,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Hotel is perfectly situated far enough from noisy city center but still close to walk around the city pretty close to major places of interest Rooms are well equipped and tidy coffee machine in the room is a plus 
316074,Amadi Park Hotel, The hotel is in the building where there are business offices and apartments There are not much surface space in the bathroom There are not much closet space You feel like living in a suitcase , Location
316075,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Room was wonderful and cosy everything was spotless Location is 10 min walk from museums so close enough to attractions but out of the hectic city centre which I found perfect 
316076,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing, Everything The hotel is great the staff is amazingly friendly and helpful the rooms are clean and spacious the bed is very comfortable the location is good close to many places but about a 25 minute walk to city center the building is very secure will definitely recommend it to others 
316077,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, The room was clean and modern and better than other places we have stayed at in Amsterdam that were actually more expensive so it is great value for money location is nice the area has lots of really nice pleased to eat and drink that are not over ran by tourists and is easy walking distracted to most things you want to visit Staff were very nice and helpful we also loved the little touch of free mini bar this is a lovely touch and more hotels should do this I would stay here again
316078,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, It was an amazing experience to stay here although it was only for a night It might seem a bit expensive but actually Amsterdam is pretty expensive in general The service was amazing Even the chek in was a really great feeling Very friendly and supportive The Mini bar was for free I will come back Since it was a Business trip and we have a office in Amsterdam I also recommended it to all of my colleagues 
316079,Amadi Park Hotel, Too expensive for the price I paid Bathroom not comfortable not cosy at all Room directly at an aisle so people can easily look into the room, Staff was very friendly Coffee service 24h
316080,Amadi Park Hotel, Breakfast was not included in the price , 5 minute walk from the square the Leidseplein Good breakfast personal attention and lots of choices Friendly staff 
316081,Amadi Park Hotel, Room was very small not sufficient walking space Just enough for sleeping not even for a walking talking phone call TV is awkwardly placed so even while lying on bed you cannot face the TV straight but only at a 45 deg angle The hotel itself is in a building that also has other residents a dental practice some kids facility etc Identifying the reception for the hotel which was in the 4th floor itself was an achievement , Staff were friendly 
316082,Amadi Park Hotel, Room and bed were rather small as well as breakfastroom limited choice what breakfast is concerned No parking at the hotel , The staff was very helpful and friendly Location not too far away from the museumplein concertgebouw Leidseplein Drinks limited choice are free in roombar 
316083,Amadi Park Hotel, This is not a hotel don t be fooled It is like an Air BnB 1 Claustrophobic rooms When mentioned to the hotel staff they responded You got what you paid for when I said the room is fairly small I only said this as I received an email suggesting that the hotel was going to make it special for us as it is our anniversary I felt they did nothing of the sort 2 We don t drink and as it was our anniversary the hotel staff grabbed the two prosecco bottles from the bedroom table and said well we will offer the mini bar complimentary even though it is included in the price So didn t really do anything for us make sure you look at the cans before you drink Also the bottled water is tap water filled up no seals on the bottle 3 Dangerous window in the bathroom fully opens which is surely a health hazard There is no stopper besides the shower head which it rests on when opened 4 The room was freezing windows were left wide open therefore as much as I had the heating on the cold air was just not getting any warmer Also so loud in the mornings as it s right next to a school college so beware of screaming kids 5 Issues with the internet connection after ringing twice for the assistant to come and have a look to then being told that I should go up to the 4th floor and sit there to use it 6 Bathroom sink leaks I only noticed when I went to use the toilet and my feet were in puddles Absolutely disgusting as you can image I rang the assistant and she basically said she can t do anything and will have it looked at the morning we check out In the meantime put towels there Great 7 Organic breakfast not much selection at all and definitely not worth 15 EUR a head For 220 EUR a night definitely not worth it Stay in the heart of the city or a reputable hotel trust me it will be worth it 8 Ruined our anniversary spent nearly 4 hours in total complaining to booking , Nothing the only thing was that it s a 20 minute walk to the centre But as it was raining we ended up getting the tram 
316084,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing, Very helpful and friendly staff Comfortable bed Very clean room with excellent facilities Had a free upgrade as it was my husband s 60th birthday 
316085,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing I disliked Very easy to get around, The staff where lovely very clean room nice and quiet at night Loved loved the location it was in the area around was very cool and urban
316086,Amadi Park Hotel, Everything was perfect I have seen this hotel before when I was looking for accommodation and the photo with the glass fa ade made me a little indecisive But now that I have stayed in this quality boutique hotel I would recommend it very strongly , The Staff were wonderful Always helpful and willing to answer questions about what to do and how to go and where to eat or even how to find a movie theatre Wonderful 
316087,Amadi Park Hotel, Would agree with real estate standard for Ams and fairly central location but still consider the place to be overpriced against what it offers , Small basic Acceptable for a short stay More of a bedroom than the actual apartment Cleanliness nothing to negatively comment on Good 
316088,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location away from the chaos but 2 min walk to the tram and 10 min walk to the park or shopping and restaurants area The staff was really kind and ready to help with anything 
316089,Amadi Park Hotel, The desk in my room was very small so hard to work in comfort Still a great spacious room though , Staff were excellent On arrival I was met by a friendly desk staff This continued when I met the evening staff whilst getting a free coffee They also give you a mini bar with some free drinks already for you in your room Great location It was quiet at night unlike other hotels I have stayed in previously 
316090,Amadi Park Hotel, Bit confusing when your in the lift couple of doors where falling off the hinges the dressing gown was a bit corse on the skin , Not thing was wrong loved how it has a free drinks in the fridge friendly staff nice welcome to the hotel Defiantly cone back again 
316091,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, received a free upgrade from a single bed to a double bed room Very friendly staff Nice breakfast and the hotel is located in a very convenient location easy to reach with public transportation 
316092,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was very close to a tram stop The tram number 1 takes you from centraal station near enough outside the hotel this is the tram that takes you to all the main palces in Amsterdam also It was a nice distance away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre
316093,Amadi Park Hotel, The hotel occupies the part of residential apartment block The hotel reception is located in one of the apartments on the 4th floor and not easy to find The breakfast is served in the same apartment as reception All the rooms are located at the back wing on the 2nd floor The rest of the building are private apartments To get from your room to the reception you will need to walk through an open air space so consider the weather condition Very poor sound insulation between the rooms I perfectly could hear the person walk and talk behind the wall Thankfully the apartment on the other side was dead quiet It wasn t probably occupied This is very odd place And 4 star hotel rate is not applicable for this hotel It feels more like a family run Bed and Breakfast , Staff is extremely friendly and welcoming 
316094,Amadi Park Hotel, Room and bathroom was very cold The cleaners took our packet nuts but we planned to finish them Bed linen was never changed in 4 days , Free mini bar 
316095,Amadi Park Hotel, It is a bit of a walk from the central tourist area , Good location if you like a quiet neighbourhood still good restaurants and cafes nearby and near the museums Clean and modern Breakfast was a bit expensive but very good 
316096,Amadi Park Hotel, Reaching the secound floor to the hotel was a little confusing , What impressed us the most was the welcome we received So warm freindly and informative It truly was one of the best I have experienced froma hotel 
316097,Amadi Park Hotel, The entrance was not very clear , The receptionest was very helpfull and hospitable Made us feel very welcome Good room and nice bed bedcover Nice shower 
316098,Amadi Park Hotel, Room was a little small but it never caused any problems , The room was clean tidy and very modern with a free min bar was a bonus The location was very easy for the local tram sercives and shops were very close 
316099,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing really It d have been nice to be able to smoke outside the room but that s really nit picking, Very nice place Location is a taxi or tram ride from dam square but there are loads of lovely restaurants close by Everyone was very nice and the rooms were lovely and clean complete with a free minibar that was restocked daily
316100,Amadi Park Hotel, The only thing I think cold be improved is the lighting in the bedroom There didn t appear to be a main light in the room only feature lighting and lamps which made it difficult to see our belongings when getting them in out of the wardrobe Lighting in the bathroom excellent Lighting in the bedroom itself not so great , The hotel itself was fantastic quirky layout modern design and extremely helpful reception staff Particularly the man on reception on the evening of our arrival 18th Feb who gave us some very helpful local pointers The room was really comfy and a moderate size which was perfectly fine for the two of us nice and cosy 
316101,Amadi Park Hotel, I would ve prefered the access through the french door from our room to be to a private balcony rather than a communal walk way eventhough no one actually passed by , The reception staff spent time detailing attractions points of interest throughout the city to ensure we made the most of our visit In addition the complimentary mini bar wifi safe were a welcome touch to our stay 
316102,Amadi Park Hotel, Price is quite high for such a small room , It was a comfortable one night stay Nespresso machine in the room awesome And some free beer and soft drinks in the mini fridge Stuff has been friendly and helpful 
316103,Amadi Park Hotel, Towels were a little small and TV didn t work , The location was excellent So close to all major tram lines into city and airport It didn t feel like a hotel but more of apartments which made it feel more private Staff were also brilliant in helping me arrange a valentines surprise for my boyfriend and complimentary drinks restocked every day in mini fridge in room was a bonus 
316104,Amadi Park Hotel, The room may be a little small for some people but was perfect for us , Free mini bar good location easy access to trams and close to bars and restaurants great shower and super friendly receptionist
316105,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing that stands out , Staff were lovely and very helpful took 20 minutes to explain how to get to various places in the city and recommended things to do and see off the beaten track Bedroom was beautiful and very comfortable Very quiet cleaning staff were very thorough Very enjoyable stay overall would highly recommend 
316106,Amadi Park Hotel, 1 Location is a bit far from the center of town but we were on a budget trip But it was value for money , 1 Rooms for a change were big 2 Clean bathrooms 3 Room cleaning was good 4 COFFFEE MACHINES ROCK inside the room
316107,Amadi Park Hotel, A member of staff came into our room whilst i was asleep and woke up just before, The gentleman who checked us in on friday sorry forgotten his name after 6pm was extremely friendly and gave exceptional customer service We also got upgraded to another deluxe room with no extra cost which was beyond amazing 
316108,Amadi Park Hotel, Think the hotel should celebrate the area a little more some great bars and restaurants really near to the hotel yet on check in we were advised to head into centre for good food Some of the restaurants in the oud west area have better food ratings If you want to be very central this hotel is 30minute walk to centre but has great public transport links , Great area with really hip bars and restaurants Alan the night porter was so helpful and suggested great restaurants in the local area Great that the hotel sent us an email explaining how and where to check in as the configuration of the hotel is a little unusual 
316109,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Staff were excellent As helpful as you will find in any hotel Thank you again for being so understanding regarding the additional room that we had to cancel Very nice modern room Nice balcony Great Shower Good bed Nespresso machine Nice modern decor Very clean Lovely quiet location guaranteed a good sleep We would definitely recommend
316110,Amadi Park Hotel, The rooms were very dark Didn t have any proper ceiling lights apart from two by the wardrobe but one wasn t working The only proper lighting was in the bathroom, Super cosy bed and great location not too close and not too far
316111,Amadi Park Hotel, The room could ve used a bit more light , Free coffee and drinks Exceptional friendly staff Good location even though it s not directly at the Grachten 
316112,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Amazing staff very polite eager to solve even a small request Very good location near the museum area and nice walk to the city centre There is not far from Lidl supermarket and cozy cafes The hotel is situated in good and modern apartment complex The standard room is big enough with all necessary stuff and the balcony There is a coffee machine and free bar in each room Very very nice 
316113,Amadi Park Hotel, There is nothing to dislike about this place Nothing nada nicht , The staff are super friendly and helpful Sandra and Alper were a delight to deal with Would highly recommend Amadi Park Hotel if you want to be at a walking distance to all the amsterdam attaractions without breaking your bank Loved it would definately come here again 
316114,Amadi Park Hotel, Room was less spacious Reception was bit far it should have been either on ground floor or Ist floor to have easy access Breakfast was not included in Room Tariff , Very well Located and very hygeinic Staff is excellent hardworking courteous and assertive All three people we interacted with at reception were wonderful and dedicated to their job Special mention for Ms Sandra who was brilliant in her work courteous yet assertive and very communicative They briefed us about the attractions near by hotel beautifully 
316115,Amadi Park Hotel, The bathroom is like a wet room completely made of marble so when the floor became wet in the shower area it was very slippy Some sticky pads may be helpful in the shower area , This was our first stay in Amsterdam and it was quite a bit to take in attempting to get to the hotel from Centraal station but it turns out there is a tram stop right near the hotel Staff were friendly and helpful and we actually got upgraded to a junior suite free of charge There is also a free mini bar and a safe as well as a coffee machine in the room Transport links are very close by but we found it easier to walk around Amsterdam The hotel is approx 25 30 mins walk from Dam the centre of the city Overall it is a very reasonably priced hotel for the accommodation we had and we would definitely stay again 
316116,Amadi Park Hotel, Not so close to amsterdam central as advertised because you will definetely take another route The room could have been bigger and could have a double bed, Free minibar water 1 beer 1 coke and nespresso machine in the room The room had a balcony 10 minutes walk to leidseplein a bar opporiste the hotel and2 burger restaurants
316117,Amadi Park Hotel, They would always forget to fill up the coffee and toilet roll Had to switch rooms because the bathroom blind was broken they seemed annoyed that we requested to switch , Good showers and comfy beds Pretty quiet area Complementary mini bar 
316118,Amadi Park Hotel, Toilet amenities were not so good , The lights in the room were very cosy The bed was very comfortable The pancakes served at breakfast were really yummy I miss its taste Tea coffee were offered all day and it is complimentary 
316119,Amadi Park Hotel, it is common in Europe heater works only when you are in the room If you out it does not work So if it is 7 outside it is almost the same inside , Personnel is very friendly and ready to help
316120,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, When you re in Amsterdam or any other city you don t spend much time at your hotel This was a perfect retreat after a day of sightseeing and walking the canals The apartment is part of a residential complex and there are also other letting companies It was quiet and felt safe About a 25 30 minute walk from Central Station where the main attractions are 
316121,Amadi Park Hotel, The single rooms are very small The complimentary mini bar was only stocked once I have never seen such a small bottle of Heineken Rhe TVs are a little dated , The staff at Amadi Park are very friendly The location is excellent a 10 minute walk from Leidseplein The hotel is best accessed from the airport by the 197 bus from stop B9 Alight at Leidseplein This is not so much a hotel but a small flat were you can come and go as you please There is no kitchen though There is a nespresso machine however but securing the coffee pods can be a struggle 
316122,Amadi Park Hotel, high prices for parking in the area high price for breakfast high price at all, close to city close to restaurents close to public transport quiet
316123,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, We arrived to the hotel at arround 11 and were checked in straight away Very friendly staff free coffee at reception 24h Free minibar in the room refilled every day and coffee machine Rooms are small but clean with comfy bed Located close to Van Gough museum 
316124,Amadi Park Hotel, This is not a 4 hotel I think they would be lucky to have 2 The building and the hotel arrangement is weird but that I could ignore The room was extremely dark after the sunset there is barely any lightning perhaps to hide how dirty they are From mould on the ceiling to dirty bathroom walls The cherry on the top was a chewing gum rubbed onto the floor by the bed When we notified the staff a friendly lady at the desk at that time offered us prosecco asked if we want to check out later even offered to attempt to clean it but since it was already 3 o clock at night we just wanted to go to bed and there were no rooms to switch The lady promised to notify the manager so he can offer some amends Sadly when we went there in the morning to check out his only offer was that they will clean it today after we leave while I was expecting at least a friendly glass of juice since we didnt order breakfast there Really nothing in this hotel was satisfying The mini bar had 2 diet cokes who even drinks that 2 warm heinekens and an open refillable bottle of water The toiletries are two hanging containers one in the shower another one by the sink of the same pink soap that u can use for everything really 4 material no paper tissues no cotton buds no cotton pads The toilet paper was this greyish recycled stuff they hang in public toilets Really a very sad hotel experience lucky we needed it just to sleep , Great location staff was friendly 
316125,Amadi Park Hotel, Hotel room wasn t properly cleaned before our arrival we found cookies under the table and hairs on the bed Lightning is terrible both in the room and bathroom Window curtain was ragged Room was not cleaned during our 3days staying not once nor the towels have been changed Overall one of the worst hotels I have ever been which is even worse having in mind how expensive it was Not recommend at all and I must say I was really surprised with the booking com rating that the hotel has I usually agree with the hotel raiting on web but not this time , Wifi location staff
316126,Amadi Park Hotel, A bit bigger rooms Everything else is great , The hotel is comfortable clean good location very close to the destination where we had to be AOC at WG plein Rooms are not very big but okay if you don t want to stay in your room I live in the country and could hear the traffic quite well 
316127,Amadi Park Hotel, Room was extremity and I mean small bottom of the bed to the wall probably 12 inches or less the smallest I have ever stayed in Restaurant at ground level looked good but didn t eat there as there is a lot of choice around, Excellent reception staff nothing was a problem approx 20 Min walk to Dam square and half hour to Central Station and Red Light District or you could take the tram no 1 and be there in minutes Room bathroom was excellent We had a balcony but it difficult to get from the room to it Mini bar had a bottle of water 2 x coke and two bottles of Heniken which was free 
316128,Amadi Park Hotel, The room is dark and there are not enough lights, The hotel offers some free drinks in the mini bar and there is also free tea coffee next to the reception 
316129,Amadi Park Hotel, Room smelled of cigarette smoke and bed was a little too hard , Very friendly staff and good location Nice breakfast Spacious room with great shower 
316130,Amadi Park Hotel, Room was small and needed some tlc Housekeeping didn t make the bed well on the second day and didn t remove our cups Floor was scuffed and had bits of gum stuck to the floor , Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was clean and the bathroom was nicely decorated with a good shower 
316131,Amadi Park Hotel, Breakfast not included in price that was charged per night, I travelled solo for 2 nights and stayed in a single room Though the size of the rrom was small it was clean and the bed was comfortable The bathrroms were clean too Staff was also friendly and on my lastnight they helped me out with the easiest and most economical mode of transport to the airport The only thing i did not like was that in the price they charged breakfast wasnt included I had to pay 15 euros extra for breakfast After charging 150 euros per night and u realize that u have to shell out extra for breakfast dint go well with me Overall it was a nice experience the place is easily accessible there is a tram stop nearby which helps u reach dam square and centraal in 15 mins Vondelpark is 10 mins walking so if u feel like going for an early morning walk its easy to reach there Would recomend my others to stay at this hotel And for my next visit would again love to stay here 
316132,Amadi Park Hotel, Over advertised the property and amenities are not eevn close to how nice they are explained The wifi is also very spotty and the electronic doors kept breaking ,No Positive
316133,Amadi Park Hotel, The restaurant is limited to serving breakfast only, Hotel is on the outskirts of town and a short tram journey to the city centre Very friendly staff and welcoming approach to their guests This is an unusual boutique hotel that s located in a building serving other businesses another hotel and residential apartments and having a central atrium 
316134,Amadi Park Hotel, Sheets were less than clean upon arrival Room wasn t clean during stay Hotel is in a mixed use building so some suits are offices or apartments Not the worse thing but makes for a disjointed guest experience , Good location 
316135,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing , The stuff is amazing and so kind and helpful The rooms are great even that they are small since it is Amsterdam it s quite normal I will come back for sure 
316136,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, The staff is super friendly and service level is very high the hotel is very nice good value for the money the room was a bit small but more than enough for what I needed Will sure come visit there again
316137,Amadi Park Hotel, Little details ventilation was a bit noisy not air conditioning cleaning and maintainance of the room varied from day to day , Very good location friendly service at reception and breakfast 
316138,Amadi Park Hotel, All though there was air conditioning it never cooled the room Hot winter blankets in summer A little far from the center you will have to take tram 1 to get back and forth , Nice and helpful staff Good satellite TV Modern decor and a nice balcony
316139,Amadi Park Hotel, Just slightly too far out of town for our liking we walked everywhere and it was at least a 25 minute walk into the center It was a pleasant walk though in fairness but just too far to pop back throughout the day, The staff were super friendly and professional The room was extremely clean the bed was comfy and the mini bar was free Also the room had a powerful 2 headed shower good tea and coffee making facilities and had a good range of channels on the TV All in all an excellent hotel 
316140,Amadi Park Hotel, Cleaners perhaps need to pay a little more attention to detail, Pleasant modern hotel ideally situated for City centre Friendly helpful staff Good tasty freshly prepared breakfast Excellent facilities 
316141,Amadi Park Hotel, Breakfast was expensive 15 per person per day was more than what we could have purchased in the shop in the same building, Location was good had a few local places close to eat and drink 
316142,Amadi Park Hotel, Room wasn t clean shower room grimey and old coffee spills left on furniture , Location excellent nice restaurants nearby and close to vondelpark Beds super comfy staff very polite and helpful coffee machine in the room
316143,Amadi Park Hotel, Kind of a tiny room but fine for sleeping , The breakfast was extra special with a wonderful cook to order cook The concierge gave us special care There is a great sculptural light show built into structure Don t miss it 
316144,Amadi Park Hotel, Bathroom is strange When you taking a shower water is fills up all the floor Maybe drain should be cleaned or some border should be , Best location Hotel located next to city center but in non touristic epicenter So it was quiet and close to center Near the hotel a lot of shops and bars It is located quite close to museums square and vondelpark 
316145,Amadi Park Hotel, If the elderly lady who did the checkout would be more friendly and not so petulantly and the table in the room would be a bit bigger I would have nothing to complain about , The staff is extremely friendly and helpful except the senoir lady who did the checkout she was very petulantly The rooms are small but nice decorated Good coffee machine and a mini bar with some drinks from the house two sodas beers and bottle of water Furthermore the room was cosy quiet and clean One of the best rooms I have stayed in Amsterdam Perfectly located next to the centre and not in the middle of all the tourist hassle 
316146,Amadi Park Hotel, The room is not clean and the hotel just a part of building The reception it on 4th floor abit strange Not comfortable to stay there No parking , Nothing
316147,Amadi Park Hotel, AC could be better in the Summer , This hotel is fortunately around a very nice calm area with some great restaurants nearby It is away from tourist madness close to the museum quarter and easily accessible by tram The staff was very welcoming kind and genuine The single bedroom is small but it had a nice balcony 
316148,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Very safe and secure hotel also its very clean with a view on a vital street 5 10 mins walking to the center there is also an awesome Turkish restaurant down stairs called Street Kitchen you must try the mix grills wow Things in minibar were complimentry which is the first time I see a hotel giving drinks for free in love with this hotel and gorgious staff 
316149,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing much , The staff was super friendly I had a great time talking to Alper at the reception area He gave me good addresses to visit The location is convinient

316151,Amadi Park Hotel, The shower flooded into the bedroom everytime we used it The facilities were probably a 3 5 star as opposed to 4 star , The gentleman on reception was really friendly and offered us the option of an upgraded larger room or balcony room then showed us both to choose from the location was good with only a 10 minute tram ride to the centre and the hotel was quiet 
316152,Amadi Park Hotel, This NOT a 4 star hotel hotel is on the upper storeys of residential appartment area akward no sign of a safe location for family travelling together not clean for my standard especially the building shared patio downstairs and price is quite expensive for the condition When we arrived they told me that we need to move to other room the next day because shower is not warm they should have emailed us so that we have the option to cancel the reservation , Nothing that I like except the location
316153,Amadi Park Hotel, No A C in June summer and HOT in the room called front desk and only 2 days did they get it fixed First day no remote control for the TV and the solution of the front desk was stand up and change the channels This is an OVERRATED 4 star hotel No continental breakfast just a small buffet on the back side literally of the reception I would not call it a hotel its a room in an apartment complex building Look for other HOTELS to stay in ,No Positive
316154,Amadi Park Hotel, May be it s because of my last minute booking for the weekend stay the room price is way higher than what the hotel offers You may expect everything like a service apartment from the building layout to the rooms design to the staff service , Located in a relatively quiet street but still easy to get to the city center by tram
316155,Amadi Park Hotel, Everything was good Since I was traveling solo I booked a single bedroom and I wish I had more space inside the room The room felt really packed It may differ in other room types So please message them beforehand Their staff is very responsive , The staff was amazing Really helpful Location is okay Facilities are good You have a coffee machine a mini bar with complimentary goods 24hr free coffee and tea in their dining area

316159,Amadi Park Hotel, no parking only public parking on the side of the road close to the hotel size of the room the bathroom was basically as big as the rest of the room not a lot of space around the bed, position it s 10 minutes walk from the Museums area and 20 minutes walk from the Dam service the staff is really nice and helpful free mini bar Nespresso coffee machine in the room silence even if we were with our windows on the main road we haven t been bothered by the noise of the traffic
316160,Amadi Park Hotel, Breakfast too expensive so only went once free mini fridge not restocked as promised never saw a cleaner though towels were replaced twice during our stay bedrooms scattered throughout block quite confusing no contact with staff at all Not what we expect from a 4 star hotel, Room and beds comfortable though there was very little room to spare 
316161,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing , The triple room was beautiful Modernistic bathroom with a double shower head extremely comfortable beds lovely terrace and best of all it was very peaceful Not too far from Central and other main spots Overall this was a lovely place to stay and I would definitely stay here again 
316162,Amadi Park Hotel, The hotel i integrated in a multi purpose building and apart from the rooms and breakfast area it doesn t offer other facilities , Boutique hotel with very friendly and attentive staff The room was comfortable and well equipped inlcuding nespresso coffee machine and free drinks in the fridge The breakfast is excellent 
316163,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Excellent breakfast all organic comfy beds clean modern showers A C They even loaned me a charger for my phone after I noticed my new one wouldn t work in Amsterdam They were pleasant and helpful but not chatty That worked for me but my colleague likes a chatter so depends on your personality 
316164,Amadi Park Hotel, Broken led lighting under bed and wires exposed mini bar not filled up one day not enough lights in the room maybe because LED strip was broken no slippers as promised in booking air conditioning was not working that great not blowing hot so room bit colder at night , Bed was comfy and spacious bathroom
316165,Amadi Park Hotel, The cups in the room were dirty also the mini fridge didn t work Aside from those minor issues we ve had a very pleasant stay , The place is very central in Amsterdam West which is a hip neighborhood of the city with a lot of restaurants and is easy to get to The rooms are clean and spacious by Amsterdam standards and the bed was very comfortable There s ensuite toilet and shower with towel and shampoo provided If you re there for Museums then this is also a great place to stay because Vondelpark and Museumplein are literally a stone throw away 
316166,Amadi Park Hotel, very small room Room was not clean and not cleaned even after request location difficult to locate price is too high for the poor service offered , quiet place near tram station
316167,Amadi Park Hotel, Pretty decent internet for a hotel but it would still get randomly disconnected every 15 min or so Rooms are TINY No armchair in the room there would be enough space for one ,No Positive

316172,Amadi Park Hotel, I believe the price for breakfast 15 it is a little high I didn t bought the breakfast due to this I believe that a 9 10 would be affordable but taking into account the small space for breakfast I believe the price is related to this higher price few people , Really big room compared with other hotels in Amsterdam Clean nice view minibar included expresso machine available with coffee capsules included Staff really nice and helpfull 
316173,Amadi Park Hotel, We did not have the breakfast because 15euros for some bread and spreads is a bit crazy You can get same stuff for 5 times less at the grocery store or you can go get a big hot breakfast plate anywhere for half the price , Location is AMAZING for anyone new to Amsterdam the Oud West is beautiful and close to everything Also the hotel is 2min walk from tram 17 that comes from Central Station Beds were comfortable and bathrooms were huge with a wonderful shower Really spacious bathrooms for Amsterdam

316175,Amadi Park Hotel, Small room poor lightening no ventilation in the bathroom one chair in a double room pretty cold in the room for April the air conditioning was more like a spring breeze I skipped breakfast and that was a good choice because from what I saw it was not what you would expect for 15 euro , Nice staff location cleaning comfy bed fine pillows free minibar coffe and tea machine 
316176,Amadi Park Hotel, Going home, This is an excellent hotel In the old West part of Amsterdam There is a triangle area across frrom Hotel which has bars menus etc bosco and Pastis both great for drinks and food parks and theatre land etc 10 mins walk away perfect
316177,Amadi Park Hotel, very small room strange checkin reception is in a 4th floor , location staff easy to find very calm out of the noisy downtown but close to it decoration
316178,Amadi Park Hotel, Everything else Upon entering the building you might think you arrive at a prison although I have actually stayed in one at Helsinki that has been changed into a 5 star hotel this did not feel like a prison The receptionist is perhaps the prison warden who would not take a negative response The room I stayed is so small we have move like craps moving only sideways , The person serving breakfast
316179,Amadi Park Hotel, Breakfast a bit expensive 15 euro , Very clean room with modern facilities Nespresso machine and a few free drinks in the fridge Good location close to museum quarter

316184,Amadi Park Hotel, No real facilities to speak of hotel shares building with 2 other hotels and some local business dentist etc , Comfortable bed good location within walking distance to city centre Friendly staff and free drinks and tea and coffee each day was nice 
316185,Amadi Park Hotel, Difficult to find but quickly overcame that Other than that the standard double room was not the largest room however was great value for the low rate paid with everything else taken into account , The bed was very comfy with a lovely bathroom and the free topped up mini bar with beer and nespresso machine all nice touches Staff very helpful and friendly Good location on a tram route and short walking distance to Leidesplein 
316186,Amadi Park Hotel, The soap dispensers in the shower were broken the reservation said slippers and robes There were not any I had to seek out toilet paper in the bathroom cabinet there was a pair of manky earrings in there The mini bar was a nice touch except it was regular coke rather than diet coke , The staff were really helpful and friendly with tips for the city The bed was very comfortable and room was quiet

316190,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and the hotel itself very nice The room was perfect for two the minibar was for free and it was clean It s a 2 minute walk to the next tram that goes directly into the center of Amsterdam and there are cute restaurants and breakfast places right next to it There was always someone at the reception if we had questions Although the room was looking right towards a street it was quiet enough and you couldn t hear any noises from the other rooms I would definitely recommend the hotel 
316191,Amadi Park Hotel, The heating system was not working well enough and the room was cold In the bathroom there is no heating system so you freeze after shower , The place is quiet and the location is quite good Clean spacious room a nice place to stay 
316192,Amadi Park Hotel, The breakfast was strange because of the different culture Uncooked bacon , The location was very good The beds were very comfy The free mini bar was great Staff were very helpful and friendly 
316193,Amadi Park Hotel, The ventilation in the bathroom could have been better , I really liked our room the bed was great and the bathroom really fresh Nice and helpful staff we loved the breakfast as it was freshly made for everyone 
316194,Amadi Park Hotel, Possibly a bigger sign on the outside as its is shared access it s alittle bewildering finding the correct buzzer, Excellent facilities with drinks available at reception Coffee machine in room great touch Quiet hotel no noise 
316195,Amadi Park Hotel, Very small room had a double but just inches to walk around the bed, Excellent location on the edge of the central area Plenty of local facilities and equidistant to 5 tram lines covering most major routes Good value if booked early Very nice and helpful staff said by many and I would agree 
316196,Amadi Park Hotel, Not a con but it s odd that the hotel is only part of a mixed use building When you arrive you ring to get into the building the Go to the 4th floor for reception Again not bad per se but unexpected , Very cozy well equipped rooms with free soda beer in the minifridge Great neighborhood with shops restaurants and tram stops very close by Excellent wifi great bathrooms and friendly staff 
316197,Amadi Park Hotel, While the room was nice I wasn t completely comfortable in it There was a tiny bit of old blood on the sheet and the laminate floor was a bit scruffy The lighting wasn t great , The staff made this hotel A free bottle of Heineken each day was nice too 
316198,Amadi Park Hotel, There was nothing not to like really , Very very friendly staff Excellent location from central part of Amsterdam Close to museums and nightlife Small Room has nice modern decor comfortable bed free safe and minibar not to mention a UK socket which came in very handy as I forgot my adaptor I will definitely come back here again next time I visit Was perfect for me 
316199,Amadi Park Hotel, Hotel is a huge disappointment capital H First of all access to the hotel room is terribly organized reception is situated on the 4th floor that you reach using public building elevator and then in order to reach your room you have to switch to the other room is small and dark wifi is too slow but this is just a low priority complain Please be warned about possible lack of felling secure in your own room Hotel is organized in a way so anyone can pass next to the glassy room entrance door what would not be a problem if it would not encourage immature idiots to bang on the door any time they pass next to it It was happening every single night morning around 4 or 5 am Firstly you are frightened and then you are just pi ed off At the end on the second day of our stay we left 50 out of the safe box and of course it disappeared Any time we try to referred to the staff nobody showed any intention to help us solve the problem or compensate anyhow defending with the argument it happens , Location is good
316200,Amadi Park Hotel, The room was smaller than I imagined but still a comfortable size the lighting could have been better around the wardrobe area but overall a great experience , The room was lovely with a balcony easy access to restaurants and tourist attractions The staff were very friendly with excellent local knowledge of where to go and how to get there We will be back 
316201,Amadi Park Hotel, Heating in room didn t seem to get hot enough , The staff were all helpful and welcoming location was great Room was comfy with all the expected amenities plus a mini bar 
316202,Amadi Park Hotel, The shower was not well covered so when I had a shower the whole bathroom was wet , Great location 15 minute walk from the museums neighbourhood Also many caf s and shops around to grab something to eat 
316203,Amadi Park Hotel, The room and overall style of the hotel is more like a hostel The reception is on the 4th floor there are 2 other hotels in the same building and the set up reminded me more of an office buiding than a hotel The room was not totally clean and the bathroom was build into the room itself looks all nice but cleanliness and quality pretty basic , Very friendly people very helpful Location is fantastic to reach Oude West and the center as well as Vondel Park etc
316204,Amadi Park Hotel, I did not love the location the building was a little confusing at first , I liked the style of the hotel the room was comfortable and uniquely designed Typically hotel rooms are very plain i e neutral colors typical layout I thought that the room looked nice The layout wallpaper and furniture arrangement was visually pleasing The staff was also friendly and helpful 
316205,Amadi Park Hotel, Complicated to get to expensive for the room you get Overall not clean When I arrived a couple was complaining about dirty towels and my room there were used glasses lipstick and the bed cover was also dirty on the inside , Location is good if you want to stay close to the Musumplein 
316206,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Place is very modern and has lovely comfortable bed aswell as nice walk in shower and toilet area Free mini bar is two soft drinks and two bottles of beer topped up each morning when room is cleaned Free teas and coffees in your own room as well as in the apartment reception Reception staff are there 24 7 and are really nice to deal with Breakfast is fifteen euro and is well worth it Now stayed here on two occassion and when in Amsterdam this will be where I come from now on 5 min walk onto the Kinkerstraad with plenty of options to eat and shop also 
316207,Amadi Park Hotel, Maybe a little bit far away from the Center , Good level of confort and cleaning Adequate installations a confortable calm and nice room Good service at the restaurant
316208,Amadi Park Hotel, Hotel was a little strange to find having to buzz in and go up a lift before reaching reception Hotel is close to Leidseplein but further away from Dam Square etc approx 25 min walk , Very nice hotel room was clean and modern staff very friendly and helpful
316209,Amadi Park Hotel, Getting ready in the dark The lighting in the room was pretty abismall , Loved the fact the room had an espresso machine with complimentary coffee pods Heineken replenished daily Great location just a short walk from the action of Leidserplein without the noise 
316210,Amadi Park Hotel, check in process very slow we arrived just after another group and were left waiting a long time fridge did not work drinks weren t cold we passed this on to staff but it wasn t addressed hair dryer didn t work power very low the light on the shaving mirror did not work around the bed and under bedside tables was filthy loads of hairs and dust room was very dark would have benefitted from more lighting a bit of a strange set up not a normal hotel We found the building but finding the reception was a little challenging , manager gave us complimentary bottle of prosecco and upgraded us as it was a special occasion room very luxurious lovely bathroom
316211,Amadi Park Hotel, The layout of the building was a little odd In the end though it made sense and gave a feeling of privacy , Lovely staff Perfect recommendations for cafes and pubs nearby which reflected the laid back but civilized atmosphere at the hotel 
316212,Amadi Park Hotel, Faulty fire alarm went off at 4am and management didn t even care to apologize just said well luckily they work in case of a real fire Rude and terrible housekeeping Definitely not very clean rooms dusty faint smell and no replenishing of toilet paper on our second day Small cramped room not at all like the pictures shown when booked Late and slow breakfast service 8 30 am start and 1 person working Broken coffee machine for 3 days Expensive and no value for money Definitely wouldn t recommend or stay again , Walking distance to museum district and a few items in your room fridge beer cola water 
316213,Amadi Park Hotel, there was no window at the room or the bathroom so the air felt a bit compressed they should ventilate the air, it was a specious room and the bed is amazing 
316214,Amadi Park Hotel, Size of room was very small but perfect for one night sleep the reception was 2 floors away so a little inconvenient View was of adjacent apartment buildings in the complex , Loved the modern building and room comfortable bed hotel staff extremely helpful good value for money close to the action 
316215,Amadi Park Hotel, the lighting In the room was abit dark even with the curtains open other than that all good , the room was nice and cosy comfortable beds the layout was great the building was nice and the location was not too far from the centre walked around pretty much everywhere 
316216,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing we loved our stay here, Hotel was lovely and modern Staff were so nice Location was very good It s away from the centrum but the walk in was nice Couldn t actually fault this hotel it s one of the nicest I have stayed in the bed and shower were great too 
316217,Amadi Park Hotel, No slippers toothpaste or toothbrush available in room TV not working at all Reception is on 4th level and in the same building with another hotel which created some confusion when I first arrived , Good service from the staff nice breakfast 
316218,Amadi Park Hotel, The rooms are a little dark but other than that everything was perfect , Staff were incredibly friendly and always happy to help if you have any questions The hotel d cor is great and I will definitely be staying there again 
316219,Amadi Park Hotel, The rate for cleanliness in this hotel is 8 2 which is great rate for what we found in our room The room was unclean full of dust somebody s hair I think that cleaning lady just change a bed linen in our room , Position It take few minutes to get in center with tram 
316220,Amadi Park Hotel, No bad experiences really only thing I would say is that when the room was turned over the floor wasn t cleaned But nothing other than that , All staff were very accommodating and very friendly The room was lovely and clean Would definitely come back to this hotel if visiting Amsterdam again Thank you for a lovely stay 
316221,Amadi Park Hotel, The hotel was sort of far from a tram station Great for summer but perhaps not during winter Nevertheless would still return , The staff were super awesome The little breakfast area where you can make unlimited teas or coffee was the icing on the cake 
316222,Amadi Park Hotel, Air con was poor very noisy and didn t seem to do anything the room was too hot at night Lack of privacy with people walking by the windows A little far from city centre but a nice walk if you don t mind walkin 25 mins or so Was told by staff the hotel has a deal with the taxi firm whereby there is a set fair to the airport this wasn t the case, Bed was comfortable and the pillows were really nice Room was a nice size as was the bathroom Free mini bar although it wasn t filled one of the days
316223,Amadi Park Hotel, Disjointed hotel mixed in a building with apartments etc Very dark room Not easy to find as not a traditional hotel Didn t have that special feel more like going to an apartment , Clean room with very comfortable bed
316224,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing significant Front facing rooms slightly noisy but nothing that prevents a good night sleep We were a family of 5 staying in 2 rooms Unfortunately the rooms were located on opposite sides of the hotel nothing more than a minor inconvenience , Very modern clean comfortable rooms Excellent location and reasonably priced Good breakfast can be bought downstairs at the caf for a third of the price of the hotel breakfast and equally convenient 
316225,Amadi Park Hotel, If you want to stay near the centre of the city this hotel is not for you Unless you don t mind a 10 min Tram ride or 20 30 min walk , The room is comfy and the bed was just right for me Room comes with a small fridge and and safe I had a balcony which is great for an early morning coffee or late night drink There are a number of nice cafe s and restaurants around the hotel You are minutes away from the main museums Vondelpark and Leidseplein Square All within walking distance 
316226,Amadi Park Hotel, Room wasn t cleaned properly beds were not clean dust on the floor no fresh glasses etc Lots of noise from the street , Walking distance to most important sights Modern architecture and interior 
316227,Amadi Park Hotel, Lightbulb missing from bedside light but I managed and forgot to even tell the staff so a minor gripe, Friendly and helpful staff Rooms really quiet loved the courtyard arrangement Excellent breakfast 
316228,Amadi Park Hotel, Poor sound insulation between rooms I was disturbed by noisy neighbours which was very disappointing , Very friendly and courteous staff clean and modern Well located for Leidseplein
316229,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Good location close enough to the city centre for a visit but far enough outside for tranquillity Staff are friendly and very helpful Great Dutch style breakfast 
316230,Amadi Park Hotel, The fire alarm went off three times one night which was slightly annoying but an apology was given We didnt like the fact there were small flies in the room mostly over the bed throughout our entire stay We did ask for fly spray and they said they would attend to it But there were still flies on our last day Not sure why there were so many flies in the room One last annoying thing our first night was disturbed by loud banging knocking movement above at 3am , Friendly helpful staff provided a map and useful directions Complimentary drinks in room 
316231,Amadi Park Hotel, I foun hair on the bed and in the toilet also in the shower The E key wouldn t let me in every single time i left the room i had to go back to reception to change the key which didn t work so had to go back again to be accompanied by member of the stuff to get in The smell of Canabiese all over the night was overwhelming Also on arrival at hotel entrance was quite confusing one building several hotels and ringing the armadi hotel bell no one answered had to wait for some other people to come out of the building for me to get in Was crazy night didnt like it at alll, I foun hair on the bed and in the toilet also in the shower The E key wouldn t let me in every single time i left the room i had to go back to reception to change the key which didn t work so had to go back again to be accompanied by member of the stuff to get in The smell of Canabiese all over the night was overwhelming
316232,Amadi Park Hotel, Nothing major we enjoyed our stay , Having been to Amsterdam several times this was a perfect choice We wanted to stay somewhere that was a little more comfortable that a grungy hotel but at a reasonable price The location is the best part We ate almost ever meal within a few blocks of the hotel and had breakfast every morning for an extra 15 euro each Some may say it is overpriced but it is buffet style with many options eggs bacon meat selection cheese selection yogurt granola fresh squeezed orange juice and quite the assortment of dutch breads You are paying for the convenience Many people complained on this site that the hotel is part of a larger complex of apartments and businesses but I found I enjoyed this aspect because I felt more like I was at home The hotel lobby is on the 4th floor and the rooms were on the 2nd floor We had no problems with maid service and they have a free mini bar in the room and unlimited high quality water in the lobby There is a great bike rental place just a block away and I recommend this mode of transportation around Amsterdam Museums are an easy walk and Leiseplein my favorite square is only 5 10 minute walk from the hotel From there you can easily hop on a tram to and from central Amsterdam or catch a bus 197 to and from the airport 
316233,Amadi Park Hotel, The fact the hotel is within a big complex of other hotels and apartments Cost of a single room too high in comparison to the doubles considering the size , The staff make this hotel excellent They are pleasant helpful and ever ready to offer advice Nothing is too much trouble They looked after us as if we were family their special guests Breakfasts were organic delicious plentiful and cooked according to individual taste and requirements 
316234,Amadi Park Hotel, Room was on the small side and I would say it was over priced , Good location nice waterfall shower and very comfy bed The staff were really helpful and polite 
316235,Amadi Park Hotel, Not clean Spots on sheets and vacuumed properly Very small because of the odd space of the room and lost space, close distants to lunchrooms cafe s and museums good free wifi helpfull staff

316237,Amadi Park Hotel, My only wish was that the single room was larger it was definitely a tight space even for one person But the facility was clean and modern , The entire hotel staff was extremely accommodating They went out of their way to provide anything I asked even printed directions to destinations I stayed for 2 weeks and was consistently pleased with the service the entire time 
316238,Amadi Park Hotel, The bathroom was not planned well as the water from the shower flowed towards the toilet and so the floor was wet A screen would have been good We would have liked some tissues in the room There was a writing pad but no pen The receptions number should be written on the phone , The Manager and his friendly staff and the fabulous breakfast our bed and clean towels and room 
316239,Amadi Park Hotel, wifi is a bit slow, Friendly and helpful staff free tea and coffee at reception anytime with the lovely balcony seats they even provide coffee machine in the room 
316240,Amadi Park Hotel, Your bathroom needs shelves to hold things I moved the chair into the bath for my wife to put her toiletries on A door on shower to contain water while showering Hand rails in shower since it was is very slippery , Staff very helpful in every question we had You might offer a special or two to previous guests to encourage return visits 
316241,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Absolutely lovely room and hotel Really modern and fresh Lovely staff who helped a lot with recommendations of Amsterdam and extra things like printing our boarding passes Would definitely stay again

316243,Amadi Park Hotel,No Negative, Good location close to plenty of places to eat in an evening and easy access to the centre of Amsterdam Friendly staff that made you feel welcome Single rooms are small but if you don t plan to stay in them for long it really does not matter 
316244,Amadi Park Hotel, The bed sheet was not rubbersheet so it easily moved while you tried to sleep which was pretty annoying ,No Positive
316245,Amadi Park Hotel, Think the courtyard could do with a brighten up its not very welcoming , Staff were most helpful in all regards
