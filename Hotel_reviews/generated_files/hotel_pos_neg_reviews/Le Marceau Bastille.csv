43733,Le Marceau Bastille, Skip the 24Euro breakfast and walk to a local bakery for breakfast , Excellent proximity to Gare de Lyon and Paris sights in the Bastille area Room and bathroom were modern and VERY clean Nice towels Air Conditioning worked well Room was very quiet Outdoor courtyard perfect for an evening picnic and glass of wine Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful even helped us check in early at 1130 after our long flight from California Would definitely stay here again should I find myself needing a hotel near the Bastille Gare de Lyon 
43734,Le Marceau Bastille, The breakfast is good but not at 4 level , The staff was friendly The bed very comfortable The hotel is very well located The room was not noisy at all 
43735,Le Marceau Bastille, Nothing , The staff was very friendly and helpful The hotel is situated very close to centrum The rooms are cleaned up every day and the breakfast is just nice A nice sweet lady helps in the breakfast room We thank you for your kind smile and attention 
43736,Le Marceau Bastille, There is no parking at the hotel you need to use public garages Do some research to find the cheapest one if you don t mind a 10 15 minute walk you should look further out rather than the places directly near the hotel , The hotel is in a good location close to the Bastille metro station 5 minute walk This provides quick and easy access to the heart of Paris It is also within walking distance of Notre Dame 20 minute walk The room was very clean with a comfortable bed Also the staff were friendly and we were greeted with a smile The price is very good as well especially after comparing the price with other places on adventures in Paris Everything you could need for a weekend city break 
43737,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, Great location and very helpful staff Our stay was only short but the location of this accommodation gave us a great launching pad for exploring Paris 
43738,Le Marceau Bastille, The room was a bit overpriced for a 4 people considering the small room but small rooms seems to be pretty consistent in Paris , The staff was nice and helpful 
43739,Le Marceau Bastille, Nothing, The Hotel was beautiful very clean and comfortable The staff were more than helpful and Cyril was absolutely great what a personality he has and no matter how busy he was he always made us feel special All staff gave us information needed to make our stay just about perfect The breakfast was more than adequate with plenty of choices This hotel is nice and central near a metro yet far enough away from the centre of Paris to be quiet and retain its Frenchness 
43740,Le Marceau Bastille, Shower bracket was broken so difficult to wash hair Lack of horizontal surfaces near top of bed to put stuff on Room safe was fitted vertically in wardrobe and so heavy safe door was difficult to open View from hotel room window was interior wall but not a big problem, Buffet breakfast was excellent and breakfast staff were attentive refilling supplies often Reception staff were helpful on arrival with local knowledge and advice 
43741,Le Marceau Bastille, Parking is advertised and was selection criteria confirmed with comment on booking No feedback however and upon arrival it appeared it wasn t possible Glad to find public parking nearby for only 72 2 nights , Modern central location 
43742,Le Marceau Bastille, wifi was slow and sporadic, Alexandra was first rate in helping us moderate our booking for some of the nights due to a change in no of people She was also wonderful in helping us change a one flight Exceptionally professional and all done with a smile the hotel was lovely good sized rooms excellent beds nice breakfast 4 min walk to the RER for disneyland 3 minute walk to metro bastille no1 and 6 min walk to metro 10 that took us directly to Roland Garros tennis Will definitely come back
43743,Le Marceau Bastille, The Wifi and the LAN is a disaster I wasted a lot of time because of it and had to pay a lot of money for data roaming to do my work Breakfast is minimal and costs a fortune , Nice clean good size room well decorated Very nice staff 
43744,Le Marceau Bastille, 3 remarks 1 the wifi is not strong enough to stream videos 2 the bath is not equipped to take a shower The glass screen is way too small and does not seal against the wall basically this is a bath only bathroom However now many travelers prefer to take a shower because it is faster It won t be hard to install a proper shower curtain and it will make the stay much more comfortable for many travelers 3 For a 4 star hotel too much noise from the hallway It would help to install another door between the entryway and the bedroom , The location is good and convenient for travel from Gare de Lyon The hotel is stylish 
43745,Le Marceau Bastille, The hotel sign on the front of the building is a bad design in cheap materials and discourages a client from continuing to the hotel The front hotel sign is a bad graphic design the letters are too thin and small The black and white colors are boring and unimaginative Hire a Paris graphic designer to create a new imaginative graphic sign for your hotel front 25 euros was an outrageous price for breakfast I went to a cafe instead , My room was large and newly renovated The bathroom was large and new 
43746,Le Marceau Bastille, Unfortinately the room wasn t ready upon our arrival we had to wait between 2 and 3 pm to have access to it the staff apologised but that wasn t good enough as it changed the planning of our day The second day when we went back after lunch just after 1 30 pm the room had not been done yet the explanation being that we hadn t told the reception about our intention of returning to the room at that time , I liked the modern decor in the reception area The quality of the breakfast was also above average The room had excellent sound insulation 
43747,Le Marceau Bastille, There wasn t anything we didn t like about our stay the wi fi could be a little stronger kept dropping out , The staff were very welcoming helpfull Location wasn t far from anything at all was nice to walk about and be able to spot stuff right away didn t get lost Everything was beautiful 
43748,Le Marceau Bastille, Hard to keep windows open Cigarette smoke form other clients via outside areas or them smoking out the windows can make your room smell like smoke in minutes Although this is a common problem with most European hotels , Rooms are clean and nicely appointed Location is great only a few blocks from Gare Le Lyon and the Bastille Monument Its beautiful area of Paris Breakfast is great 
43749,Le Marceau Bastille, Dysfunctional wi fi in the room but the staff told me they are working to change the system so it should be ok soon The wi fi works well in the lobby and breakfast room , Very nice and helpful staff excellent breakfast comfortable beds 
43750,Le Marceau Bastille, The breakfast was quite expensive But there are plenty of options near the hotel The two single beds were almost one as they were very close to each other, The room is very pleasant There s space and the big windows light it very well The Bastille station near the hotel is very useful as the 3 rail lines will frequently takeout directly were you want to go
43751,Le Marceau Bastille, When I arrived at the hotel I was told that my room was not ready and that I needed to return at 3 PM which I did However when I arrived AFTER 3 PM I was told that it still wasn t ready and that I needed to continue to wait The staff wasn t particularly about the annoyance and inconvenience caused offering only a drink as by way of an apology The rooms are rather small We had a twin bed room and there was not much space once we had pulled the beds apart In addition I think a 4 rating is overrating it a bit I would say that it is a good 2 3 standard, Comfortable bed wel equipped rooms The staff on the whole were helpful when I asked them questions 
43752,Le Marceau Bastille, The WiFi was pretty bad , The location was excellent close to bars and restaurants as well as a metro stop The staff were lovely and friendly and forgave our horrendous French skills The room was a good size bathroom was lovely and had a fantastic shower 
43753,Le Marceau Bastille, wi fi signal was not good, It was a really nice stay Breakfast was so tasty delicious coffee orange juice etc Room was clean with very comfortable beds Staff was helpful and nice 
43754,Le Marceau Bastille, There was nothing special about the breakfast typical three star European with stiff scrambled eggs etc in a warmer and so on The honesty bar for outside breakfast hours is silly a 4 50 cup of coffee from a machine is a joke , Quiet room in a great location if you want need to be near Gare de Lyon station like we needed to be Maybe not so good if you want to be near other main tourist spots The view from our room was very Mary Poppins with rooftops and chimneys very romantic 
43755,Le Marceau Bastille, The street could have been a little cleaner but I suppose that s not the hotel s responsibility , Staff were great Room was great Breakfast was YUMMMMY 
43756,Le Marceau Bastille, Room service was a local burger restaurant food was mediocre, Location was great near metro markets and not too far from centre Excellent staff and room Highly recommended 
43757,Le Marceau Bastille, Because they ve had trouble with guests booking on line guests now have to pay in advance which is off putting For the same reason presumably the hangers were that awful click in type from which everything slid off My room was quite masculine in feel with no view there wasn t a single drawer but only a couple of metal shelves the safe was installed sideways on the bottom of a cupboard which meant I had to crouch on the floor to get to it and still couldn t read the instructions so I couldn t use it I informed the pleasant staff of these objections who were apologetic but these are things that can t be changed without a policy decision , The staff were friendly and helpful the hotel was clean the bed was comfortable my room was quiet the towels and bedding were good quality terry cloth robes and slippers were supplied and the room temperature was easy to control 
43758,Le Marceau Bastille, At something like 24 euros per person don t bother with the breakfast , I was pleased that my room faced the quiet interior courtyard It seems the hotel has been recently refurbished everything is nice and fresh I appreciated the good Wifi the luggage storage and the friendly accessible staff An added plus there was NO noise in the morning No vacuum in the hallway no slamming service doors I really got to sleep in 
43759,Le Marceau Bastille, Heaven on earth , The location of the hotel close to la Gare de Lyon since I normally arrive there from Lausanne Switzerland the friendliness and sunny smile from the receptionists the excellent breakfast I simply love to eat fruit the large room and its cleanliness sorry almost everything in the hotel I will certainly come back to your hotel 
43760,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, So unlike the many over priced and slightly warn down Parisian hotels Charming and still modern well equipped great decor and fully functioning wifi and the kicker the very helpful and accommodating people who work there 
43761,Le Marceau Bastille, Super friendly staff We could park our bikes in a safe place overnight Great location close to the canal where you arrive by bike if you come from Belgium Holland ,No Positive
43762,Le Marceau Bastille, Minor Bed too hard Choice of music in hotel not very relaxing Major Lobby area extremely over perfumed daily This would be the one reason I would not stay here again , Cleanliness Lovely breakfast 
43763,Le Marceau Bastille, The wardrobe was so close to the bathroom that it was not easy to open the bathroom door while the second person in the room was looking for clothes etc in the wardrobe The safe was situated very low, The breakfast was very good The staff very nice and helpful the room was very clean
43764,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, Great location close to the Basttile square and Metro station very kind receptionists helped us with every request we had Clean and good atmosphere 
43765,Le Marceau Bastille, The local area Close to Norte dame but not a lot else Also it was in the very centre of a political demonstration so we struggled to get back to the hotel Some notice would have been good , The hotel itself was a very nice trendy place with good facilities However it was an oasis in a wilderness 
43766,Le Marceau Bastille, One of the staff members was fighting in the lobby with another men using negative language in front of guests of the hotel Otherwise the staff was very helpfull and proffessional, Helpfull staff and the room where cleaned well every day
43767,Le Marceau Bastille, The location while ideal for onward travel is not the nicest neighbourhood The rooms are quite small The bathrooms have a tendency to get wet due to powerful showers but small shower screens , Breakfast is good Great toiletries and nice beds Proximity to Gare de Lyon is the main reason we stayed there but the service is very good and very efficient Loads of storage in the rooms 
43768,Le Marceau Bastille, There were many mosquitos in the room while leaving the window of the room open We could not sleep well The management of the hotel should take measurements against it as there is unpleasant to overnight in a room without fresh air in the summer time ,No Positive
43769,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, I stayed for two nights during Euro 2016 Nice freshly renovated white quiet clean room I liked the big tv set 10 min walk to Place Bastille also relatively close to Ile de la Cite Very polite and helpful receptionists 
43770,Le Marceau Bastille, The internet connection is not good enough and its a real problem for a business traveler , The hotel is quiet clean professional establishment that has comfort 
43771,Le Marceau Bastille, Minor point colors could be less flashy in the room, Well located hotel near Bastille Away from the madding crowd but still close There is a metro station bus station and free city bike Park nearby The room is spacious for Paris Clean And the last but not the least they serve a perfect breakfast Buy it it is definitely worth it 
43772,Le Marceau Bastille, From the website it showed that we were getting a 48 reduction and that the room was originally CHF 468 and the reduced price was CHF 139 However the room was quite a dissappointment and hard to imagine that it would originally cost CHF 468 as the size of the room and even quality does not match the price at all We thought we were getting a good offer but it didn t seem like it as I am positive the room we stayed in does not cost CHF 468 per day I am even wondering if this is a methodology used by the hotel to get customers to book the hotel Overall I did not get what I expect and would not stay there again ,No Positive
43773,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, I was looking for a good place between the Gare de Lyon and the Louvre I liked the general location the hotel atmosphere and the helpful staff Celine and Diego One of the best buffet breakfast offering I have ever seen good choice fresh food clean 
43774,Le Marceau Bastille, Staff were a little disorganised and slow No tea coffee facilities in room , Room was quiet clean and comfortable and walking distance to Bastille and great restaurants 
43775,Le Marceau Bastille, The only problem was that it was a bit far from the centre , The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly Thought the hotel was excellent Enjoyed stay
43776,Le Marceau Bastille, The wi fi signal was weak in our room and also in the lobby therefore the internet connectivity was slow it was a bit annoying , The hotel looks clean and well maintained the room and the bathroom were also very clean and comfortable the breakfast was rich and delicious as well the hotel is 5 6 minutes walk from Bastille metro station we enjoyed our stay at this hotel 
43777,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and helpful They helped us with booking tickets for Versailles Palace on the hotel computer and set up taxi service to the airport when we left We thought the room was very convenient to the train station and the room and hotel are very well maintained 
43778,Le Marceau Bastille, The internet was VERY poor weak signal very slow I lost often connection and than i had to login again And i lost VERY often connection The internet quality was very beyond what you may expect from a hotel of this standard and price , The hotel is located in a quiet street near Bastille There are a lot of all different kind of restaurants in the surrounding The staf is very friendly alt ought not very helpful to solve the internet problem 
43779,Le Marceau Bastille, no coat hanger in room have to hang the coat together with other clothes in small closet , hotel in quiet street staff is courteous clean room toilet comfortable bed breakfast is OK 
43780,Le Marceau Bastille, From my room 110 you could hear the breakfast tables being laid and general bustle Wasn t terrible but woke me up The gym equipment is rubbish and subsequently you can t use the gym , Travelled with my elderly mother Lovely quiet rooms at the back of the hotel Fabulous breakfasts in great art gallery
43781,Le Marceau Bastille, por service we were biten all over the body from flyhs or somting else they had all room service closed down from 16 00 all nights because of some problems The airconisuner was not working I stay in paris evry month and this is the worst hotel I have staid in, the bed and shower
43782,Le Marceau Bastille, I can t give the comments for the breakfast since I did not take it , the location is so good very easy to take the subway and bus to the train stations and the scenic spots there is the beautiful part close to the hotel it is great if you like to have a morning running around there is Chinese restaurant and Thai restaurant next to the hotel very good for the Asian people I will be back again for sure if I come to Paris 
43783,Le Marceau Bastille, Fitness area was disappointing absolutely useless If this is important for you don t choose this hotel , Quiet area easy access to metro nice room friendly staff breakfast was good 
43784,Le Marceau Bastille, Wi fi could have been faster We had no iron in room or tea making facilities , Staff helpful Clean hotel and perfect for location for walking to most places Breakfast lovely and relaxing overall
43785,Le Marceau Bastille, WiFi reception in the room was not good and problems connecting had to go to lobby , Excellent location for all things Paris close Metro walking distance to Notre Dame Opera de la Bastille 
43786,Le Marceau Bastille, Room a bit small for 3 bedroom warm but we did not try the ac It was april, Beds comfy variety and quality of breakfast lots of nice touches in the bedroom
43787,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, Great Breakfast Very fresh and a very large varieties of tasty products Le Marceau is very quite and we can even sleep with the window opened for fresh air without the city noise Quite street Always nice and welcoming staff Finally I like the bright hall with modern positive energy painting 
43788,Le Marceau Bastille, The room 502 seemed to be a little stuffy but we were able to open the window for fresh air to come in The pillows were too soft as was the bed we are more used to a firmer mattress The pricing was reasonable high , The staff were all very pleasant and helpful Nothing seemed to be too much trouble even when I locked myself out of the safe box in the bedroom it wasn t any trouble for the receptionist to come up with me to resolve the problem Celine was very helpful with the maps and with ensuring we knew where we were going great directions One of your other receptionists was very helpful with an enquiry about the canal openings unfortunately our stay was just too early for that trip WE will have to come again The water was always hot and in good supply 
43789,Le Marceau Bastille, My room was too small not a good feeling when inside , modern Hall and clearly recently renovated Good breakfast Good position between Bastille and gare de Lyon
43790,Le Marceau Bastille, My room was really small, Staff was very nice breakfast delicious not in the very centre but not too far walking and well connected with metro clean and bright room with a very nice bathroom
43791,Le Marceau Bastille, A little expensive cost vs quality I ve had much better breakfasts for 24 euro price Rooms are a bit small , It was nice atmosphere and very nice personnel Hotel is clean and cosy Recommend to stay for a weekend
43792,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, Room was spacious for Paris Room available at 9 30am Staff helpful without being on your back Breakfast was good in a nice space Super clean So close to Bastille its opera metro cafes and restaurants
43793,Le Marceau Bastille, The seating at breakfast looked funky but was either too high bar stool type or too low pouff style and the normal tables were too few and reserved for travel groups , The Hotel s public area is modern and chic and the rooms are cosy with a very comfortable double bed a small desk and armchair The bath shower room was modern and spotless 
43794,Le Marceau Bastille, The room was a bit small but anyhow liveable and in line with Paris standards , Really clean room staff always cute and careful with us great breakfast in the morning central location few minutes on walk from Bastille 
43795,Le Marceau Bastille, The room safe as it was large for its cupboard location and not fixed to anything was cumbersome to manage A loose shower head fixing made showering awkward , Easy walking distance from Gare de Lyon Metro Stations and Ile de la Cit Very good local food options and variety 
43796,Le Marceau Bastille, Very poor WiFi connection room is too small there are very thin walls between the rooms you could hear almost everything in the neighboring rooms Inflexible management who did not allow to modify the date even due to the recent terrorist threat in Paris , Impeccable cleanliness plentiful and great variety of delicious breakfast good location Kind and courteous staff 
43797,Le Marceau Bastille, Fitness room is awful could not use it No treadmill other cardio units too hard to use no aircon ventilation , Nice room large as to Paris standards with good enough soundproof windows good breakfast

43799,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, Perfect for a visit to the opera just round the corner and a good place to start a walk along the Seine to the Louvre and back Loads of bars and restaurants nearby 
43800,Le Marceau Bastille, They announce free WiFi But it is very very poor You must reconnect with your credentials every other moment and it is really slow When I commented the issue they replied that unfortunately several clients where connecting at the same time And what did they expect , As hotels go in Paris this one is correct comfortable clean and well located near Bastille and Le Marais Rooms are OK no complaint but I don t see exactly the point of calling this a 4 boutique hotel beyond the fact that uit has a nicely decorated lobby
43801,Le Marceau Bastille, Nothing We wanted a reasonable hotel for one night near the station This was fine but it would have been good if the price had been less , Fairly near to Gare de Lyon

43805,Le Marceau Bastille, Wifi was not very good sometimes it was not possible to connect Even when connected an internet connection was not always possible And the speed was usually very low The TV had lots of channels but only news in English Some channels with entertainment from BBC or similar would be nice additions , Clean and modern room big and comfortable bed very nice placement close to Gare de Lyon and metro system Breakfast was set in a small room but still contained a lot of well prepared food But near the end of the serving time juice and hot food was often empty 
43806,Le Marceau Bastille,No Negative, Staff very helpful We were upgraded which a very pleasant surprise Room was spacious and very clean Breakfast was more than adequate with a range of choices and plenty of it 
43807,Le Marceau Bastille, Slow wifi was a problem and some older people could have problems getting out of very low chairs at breakfast tables But you need to be young or young at heart to appreciate this hotel , Breakfast is relaxed but continually and efficiently restocked Excellent aircon in room Decor is modern and lively and art downstairs is for sale
