91533,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Price per night simply reflects the area n at Park Lane Would not pay that tariff for tired and dated facilities anywhere else Unable to open window as screwed shut and mobile air con unit made the room even hotter as the motor was running so long , Close to Hyde Park for a BST concert we were attending Fri melt and helpful staff good food and a breakfast deal if you booked on arrival which we opted for 
91534,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel needs to be upgraded I had a single room which was good value for money but it was just that a single bed and very small room not often found in hotels these days , Really good location Friendly staff The breakfast was OK 
91535,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not accessible so don t book here if you re in a wheelchair because there are 3 steps to get to the lifts , The location was pretty good if a bit hard to find 
91536,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Place in general is very tired Beds are not comfy or luxurious but sheets are very clean Bathroom is really outdated and in very poor condition , Location is great Room was hot due to good weather Room had an AC machine which is great to cool down room quickly but it s very bulky and very very noisy
91537,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The location of this hotel is at the rear of the Hilton at Park Lane Directly opposite is their loading bay Constant noise of recycling of glass bottles and heavy goods vehicles Entry and exit point for staff End of shift staff from the Hilton blaring radios on scooters and shouting loudly to each on breaks , Nothing in particular
91538,Park Lane Mews Hotel, everything , nothing surly reception chipped formica bedside ripped wallpaper hole in window for dirty old air conditioning hose disgusting loads of outside noise filthy sofa in reception too chambermaid was only saving grace with spotless towels bedding but NEVER again 
91539,Park Lane Mews Hotel, no room boy to take your bags while check in and out , big rooms and clean staff are so kind and smiling all time the location of hotel is near greenpark and shops great room secvice

91541,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The property is badly run down and needing attention badly marked walls and doors dirty appliances and I wouldn t take my socks off on that carpet The lifts stopped working The hot water was unreliable on the first night Very surprised at the state of the hotel given the price ,No Positive
91542,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I was asked if I wanted breakfast the following day when checking in but decided in the morning that we did not want any so I called at 9am to cancel however was told that because I booked it at check in at a promotional price I was not aware of this I was not entitled to a refund Quite disappointed this was not explained at the time 32 down the drain , Competitive price for where you are staying 
91543,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Facilities were antiquated The room was small carpet was old wallpaper torn smudged and in extreme disrepair Air conditioning was noisy at all times Breakfast was marginal For these reasons would not book a stay there again , Staff was very helpful pleasant and assisted us assisted us in every manner House keeping was actually found our rooms cleaned and fresh supplies daily This however could not offset the condition of the room Channel selections on the TV were marginal at best very few available stations to watch in the evening when we return to the room
91544,Park Lane Mews Hotel, See above , There was no drawers or place to put clothes Was very noisy Staff was below the window making slot of noise No concierge Not very Helpful with tourist assistance Told me to pick up one of the brochures I actually walked over to the Hilton for advice They were really very nice and helpful 
91545,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Windows in the room were difficult to open and air conditioning was noisy Not sure we would feel that we got value for money if we had had to pay the full listed hotel price , Location was very good for our visit to the Hyde Park festival and relatively quiet Staff were friendly and efficient Breakfast was good and was worth the special offer reduced price Nice comfortable public room with bar We considered drink and food prices reasonable for a central London hotel 
91546,Park Lane Mews Hotel, If you are after a gym and pool or a fancy restaurant in the hotel then this ain t the hotel for you but if like us your weekend is already packed then this makes a great base , Great location for Hyde park Green Park and buck place if it takes your fancy The local bars and restaurants are just meters away on a small mews behind the hotel are a really high standard The hotel is fairly basic but its tastefully decorated and the room was very clean and perfectly functional 
91547,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was small and noisy the air con sounded like a tractor and the noise from outside was constant all night If you want a good night sleep don t stay here We had an executive room so for the extra cost you get a dressing gown which we didn t use 2 bottles of water which are not replaced for the second night and some shower gels the room is small and has no drawers for clothes we won t be returning,No Positive
91548,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast wasn t hot and tea and coffee very poor And don t ask reception to book a taxi Went to Marble Arch fixed price of 17 00 black cab back cost 4 80 from the same location Taxi rank just outside the Hilton 1 minute away, Great location Comfy bed good air con
91549,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bed The TV Having to pay separately for the breakfast, The bed was too small The TV did not work The air conditioning was very noisy but the staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was not included so I signed for it but the waitress was difficult about it Why not include breakfast 
91550,Park Lane Mews Hotel, furnishings decoration and bathroom 40 years old literaly Unproffessional staff though front desk pleasant Not a Quality price match , Pleasant old time ambience Could be good given an update and make over without killing old gentleman s club style Breakfast O K though staff untrained 
91551,Park Lane Mews Hotel, It would seem original air conditioning unit not working any more Ones in the room very noisy and not terribly effective , Small rooms but perfectly adequate for the price Location excellent Nice complimentary shower gel etc Special offer on breakfast 
91552,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Front desk staff were not very knowledgeable room keys did not work on 4 occasions and had to be replaced bar was not very good eg put a slice of lemon in my scotch I would not go back, Location OK
91553,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Maybe it s just western culture but I found the beds to be a bit uncomfortable but nothing that really took away from the overall experience , I loved everything about this Hotel Property is a bit dated but to be honest this only adds to the charm as it is well taken care of 
91554,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The dirtiness the staff the cost everything was to the detriment of the guest Apalling, This place was dirty and overpriced 332 00 for 1 night without breakfast Really bad Very upset with Booking com as my booking changed I booked for 2 nights at 332 00 and when I arrived it changed to one night 
91555,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Dirty bathroom old facilities worn furniture torn and dirty curtains Furniture all shabby doors and all wooden elements cracked scratched carpet dirty with stains one doesn t want to take off shoes mir even sit on the chairs lamps hang out of shape air conditioning placed in like in a shanty shelter huge hose hanging out of the only window cracks and holes plus writings on the shabby wallpaper lamp have cracked covers the rentokil box rats under the receptionists trolley also didn t make me feel very cosy I can provide photos of all this over all s shabby highly over priced location I m happy I have not chosen by myself but was offered as a compensation for the most scandalous accomodation I booked with booking previously stunning Bond Street apartment in south molton street which has been cancelled by the owner Carol with me shortly before my arrival and only upon MY calling the accommodation to ask something on luggage drop this was the biggest scandal I ever experienced with booking so after hours of negotiation with the former landlord and booking I was finally helped out with this park lane mews hotel as a compensation accommodation which I am luckily not paying off fully still waiting for booking to contact me plus refund me , Excellent location helpful nice and extremely friendly staff especially Daniela the receptionist After the strongly needed renovation this hotel could turn into a Mayfair gem Right now it is scandalous in comparison to the rate I paid 
91556,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very noisy neighbour I eventually complained to reception at 1 30 when the visitor was asked to turn his television down He did but at 7 he had it back on again full pelt I had asked for a quiet room but I was right by the lift So not a good night s sleep , Very well located for my evening at the Hilton Cheaper than the Hilton But still not really value for money 
91557,Park Lane Mews Hotel, renovating the lifts and rooms , Great breakfest but too pricy They switched my room free when I complained about small twin bed for 2 persons Nice reception great location walking to Buckingham palace restaurants hyde park 
91558,Park Lane Mews Hotel, It is not a four star hotel The picture are not compelling to the reality The corridor are scary dark and ruined The room are small and old The materas is old and uncomfortable Internet wasn t working properly We have had to leave and they not even reimburse for the night we have not used It is should be advertised as a three stars hotel ,No Positive
91559,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The condition of the hotel fell far far below four star class and I m amazed they ve retained this rating if they have The corridors were tired with door frames marked by years of trollies banging into them The room was blessed with a noisy antiquated air conditioner dirty wall a carpet with scorch marks from an iron and a small double with an old mattress Not worth the money even in such a good location , The outside looked nice and the staff were friendly 
91560,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was incredibly warm and the air conditioning wasn t working Thankfully we were able to transfer to another room and that was better The place could do with a lick of paint it is tired worn and a bit grubby Rooms are tiny with incredibly small wardrobes , The location is excellent and we got a good room rate compared to other hotels in the area 
91561,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Air conditioner didn t work well Last day there were no hand towels in the bathroom There was an additional bath mat hung up where the hand towel should be , Location Good breakfast buffett 
91562,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The hotel clean with nice and friendly staff easy to find and in a nice area After our business meeting it was easy to have dinner in a nearby pub 
91563,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Noise from aircon in the room that didn t even work Rang staff and asked for a fan at least as boiling room yet they never sent the fan nor rang to apologise for lack of one Not even a bottle of water in the room Will not recommend or stay there again, Location
91564,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel lobby is reasonably clean and well maintained but the hotel corridors look shabby and the rooms a bit tired The carpet in our room was not in good condition The bed was very uncomfortable as were the pillows The curtain was so thin it let in all the light with sunrise at 4 40 am this meant a very early wake up A renovation of the hotel interiors is overdue , Our room was spacious relative to other hotels in London in the same price range in this area The staff were very helpful and cheery The bathroom though small was functional and very well lit The location is excellent We did not try the food 
91565,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Poor WIFI not for business use Old furniture time for a refresh I would never pay the full price at this hotel the beds are old and uncomfortable room equipment need a refresh airco not working , Location
91566,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was very small only one pretty uncomfortable chair sticky surfaces therefore not as clean as it should be noisy air conditioning Check in staff distracted by someone else half way through the process , Not a lot but close to several nice restaurants and pubs
91567,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The staff were great but the hotel itself is dated and desperately in need of renovation For example when I got to the room it was chilly and rather than just turn up the thermostat I was advised to go to the wardrobe to get the portable heater out and plug that in The room was very compact and beige 
91568,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Restaurant staff bit grumpy Reception staff very good Rooms bit small but overall not bad value considering location , Centre of London Great for visiting sites 
91569,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is in need of an over haul We knew not to expect too much from this hotel having read previous reviews and chose this hotel based on price and location IF you can over look the following you can manage to stay here Windows required two of us to try and open We managed 2 space for fresh air Curtain will open with some difficulty Toilet often times required 4 5 flushes to work we mentioned this to staff and it didn t come as a surprise We did require help turning on TV as they are set up strangely and require you push numbers into remote to work staff kindly came to room to help but could have easily been avoided with instructions for guests Woodwork is damaged throughout the hotel The bed was soft for my liking We had just come from 3 differing places in Paris where the beds were very comfortable This may be a matter of taste Seemed to be dust dirt build up around the edges of room , The breakfast was worth not going out in search of food It was very windy and rainy for our stay and we were glad we made the choice for breakfast Staff over seeing breakfast was friendly and helpful Front desk staff for our check in was very accomidating and friendly 
91570,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Executive room was tiny air con had a fault and was uncontrollable although did produce cool air when on room was directly about the smoking area unofficial so was prone to unpleasant odours street view only, Great position relatively inexpensive for Mayfair
91571,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Original room booked was small and stuffy with one window that could not be fully opened and no working air conditioner or fan , Upgraded to Junior Suite which was a good size room 
91572,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Because we stayed 2 nights would of liked a top up on tea and coffee facilites but not a major issue as plenty of cafes bars close to the complex, Bed comfy and clean
91573,Park Lane Mews Hotel, It wasn t as clean as I would have expected the furniture is tired and the sofa covers need cleaning the d cor could do with some updating a little grubby in places the phones were really outdated and somewhat worse for wear the window didn t open and on a really hot day it is must as the air conditioning was not really cold , The location was great for Buckingham Palace Hyde Park Piccadilly all within walking distance It is close to Shepherd Market which had several pubs and restaurants close by Most of the staff were friendly and really helpful Breakfast was okay Choice of cereal fruit sweet breads and cakes cheese ham and the full English Scrambled egg was very good 
91574,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was not climate controlled and London was warm We were very glad that fans were available upon request at the desk Both room and lobby were due for redecorating but clean and comfortable , Location was great Charming neighborhood restaurants and pubs within a few blocks Small grocery nearby for water and snacks Easy access to bus and underground transportation 
91575,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms were dated and like a sweat box we did request a plug in fan and were supplied with a desk top one which did help the rooms and hotel in general were very dated I asked for ice with my drink and was told the ice machine was not working so I was only able to have one small piece my water was warm, The location and receptionist were fantastic
91576,Park Lane Mews Hotel, This could be a bijou with refurbishment Decor rather tired and worn did not match expectations from the external photos of hotel , Excellent location Easy access to all amenities Staff extremely courteous and obliging Allowed later check out so that we might prepare for attendance at Royal Garden Party and stored our luggage until our return Directed to facilities here we might change our clothes before return journey 
91577,Park Lane Mews Hotel, the air conditioning was not really working well we asked the front desk to send someone to fix it because other than turning it on or off there was nothing we could do not temperature control nor hi low of the fan the response we got was because the building was old there is nothing the hotel can do to fix the problem , the staff in particular Paula is extremely helpful especially in the situation where my flight was cancelled on Saturday May 27 due to the IT system breakdown of British Airways and I needed to immediately find accommodation for the night Paula remembers the guests by room numbers and immediately recognized me when I called the hotel offered me a room right away Generally all members of staff are helpful and polite 
91578,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Air Con was broken but not advised on Check In had to ring once got into the room and then waited over 90 mins for someone to deliver then fit the portable one Breakfast was not great food had dried out as it was just sitting in the warmers,No Positive
91579,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff were harassed poorly trained and grumpy with only one notable exception I asked for a strong coffee in the morning this was refused twice and when I asked again if it may be possible to have a stronger coffee the coffee served was the colour of weak tea the waitress brought me a sachet of nescafe and told me I could tip it into the cup The evening receptionist was too busy slamming down telephones and was extremely harassed and angry when I arrived The morning receptionist made up for it by being very understanding and arranging for a refund for my breakfast , Location is good 
91580,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms are a tiny and a bit tired Headboard had big stain on it But otherwise generally passable Wifi was poor , Excellent location for Green Park surrounding area incl Buckingham Palace The reception staff were extremely helpful and allowed early checkin at no extra cost Well done to them 
91581,Park Lane Mews Hotel, not customer oriented Very bad service Ordered some room service the bar called me later on to say that my card wasn t pre authorized and therefore I had to prepare some cash Upon explaining that no one asked me to pre authorize my card and that I didn t have any cash left they replied that I should come down to pay with my card and hang up on me I needed a pair of scissors but no one at reception or at the bar would have one to lend I emailed to enquire whether I could check in earlier but no one ever reply back , centrally located close to metro affordable for Mayfair area Bedsheets were clean
91582,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The whole hotel needs a serious update For the location and usual price I was expecting a better looking hotel Not worth paying for it Travelodge is better , Friendly staff
91583,Park Lane Mews Hotel, We were fortunate to get a table in the restaurant for breakfast they are not geared up well for breakfast , It was convenient for this particular purpose but is some distance from the nearest tube and would not necessarily suit every visitor to London 
91584,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very noisy bathroom air filter air conditioning not very good Room very small and not much of a selection of teas in the room , As attending the garden party at Buckingham palace the convenience of walking distance 
91585,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Shower was broken and the receptionist told me it was probably because I did not understand how to use it TV remote and TV were struggling etc probably ok 15 years ago ,No Positive
91586,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Arrived late in the evening and left in the morning so didn t have time to find any dislikes , Didnt choose to take breakfast Location was perfect for where we wanted to be 
91587,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was lovely our room was very quiet clean and comfortable The location was great and the staff were very helpful and friendly We were worried about previous reviews we had read on this site about the hotel but when we arrived we needn t have worried Everything was perfect Breakfast was lovely too Shepherds Market and the mews behind the hotel was a lovely place to stroll around in the evenings 
91588,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Price arranged through Booking com colleague booked same stay nights through travel agent same room type etc cost 50 of your price RIP OFF , Not a lot
91589,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The light switches in the room were dirty the window did not shut properly and the position of our room on the front of the building meant we heard every single bin being emptied at the crack of dawn and even earlier some late night revellers in no mood for sleep had awful nights sleep, The property was very conveniently positioned and the bar was open late
91590,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Nothing you get what you pay for , The position of the hotel is perfect to observe the style of life in Mayfair You are close to pubs clubs restaurants casinos shopping theatres and a walk in the park Hyde Park 
91591,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Service in the restaurant was very slow and they weren t replacing the food as soon as it ran out The shower in our room was just a trickle of water Property very run down ,No Positive
91592,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, Albeit a little dated in furnishment and the general look the hotel is extremely clean and well equipped offering for example coffee tea and kettle in the room for extra comfort Its main asset however is the superb location with everything London has to offer close by including very nice restaurants and pubs practically around the corner 
91593,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bedroom was extremely cramped The breakfast muesli which is supposed to be healthy was very sweet and sugary , The location The quaint breakfast room 
91594,Park Lane Mews Hotel, My room was facing onto the back lane and it was very noisy Woken up at 2 45am thinking it was road works but the hotels towels were being collected and the guy moving the crates was making the biggest racket in the middle of the night Then around 6 30am it was the big wheely bins turn to be emptied Not the quietest of rooms, Very helpful staff Forgot my toothbrush and they offered me a complimentary one when I was fully expecting a charge Offered an upgrade so got a massive bed The breakfast qas lovely good fresh food 
91595,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms are dated and in desperate need of refurbishing our room was very hot and window could not be opened as it had been screwed shut , Location is good and the staff are excellent
91596,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very expensive for what it was it was a small basic room and limited space Paying 160 for a small bed and a small toilet was a little disappointing , The staff were really friendly and helpful I even told them it was my boyfriends birthday and they put some balloons in the room 
91597,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Did not enjoy anything Has this place been cleaned or renevated since 1800 its 2017 clean would be nice Could not open Windows , Room was so dirty Stains everywhere Disgusting Carpet was not cleaned Dont even want to know what was on the chair 
91598,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Whole hotel in serious need of refurbishment Bed particularly uncomfortable All the furniture very knocked about , Location was what we needed very near where we wanted to go 
91599,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel corridors are in need of tlc, The check in was slick and we were allocated a room early The room was on the small side but perfectly acceptable for our needs As always we had breakfast in an Italian restaurant in shepherds market nearby Excellent staff 
91600,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms were old but clean an update is definitely in order The location was excellent close to so many key locations and beautiful parks , The room was small but the beds very comfortable Breakfast was expensive so we went just down the block to Sofra an excellent little restaurant with FABULOUS breakfasts 
91601,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The only thing I would comment on was that the bath was not terribly easy to get out of A larger person than me would probably still be there There are handles on the side but it IS a compact bath might be safer to use the shower , I liked the very friendly receptionist the fantastic location the quietness of my room the comfy bed the fluffy towels the tea and coffee facility in the room and the cost which was brilliant for central London Shepherd Market is full of pubs cafes restaurants yet you are only five minutes walk from Piccadilly and Green Park 
91602,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Only criticism is that the facility could use a remodel, Friendly and helpful front desk staff room kept really clean by housekeeping and a great location
91603,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is so old The paints are fading wall papers cracked furniture looks like 30 years old and the toilet doors could barely be closed , The staff is not bad and the breakfast is decent 
91604,Park Lane Mews Hotel, It was a well worn hotel with little to offer other than its position which is excellent The staff were friendly but the whole hotel is well below the standards set by the big chains such as travel lodge let alone any Mayfair top grade hotels I couldn t recommend it to anyone I know , Friendly staff
91605,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was far too small even tho o was moved to a larger room I still had to dismantle my wheelchair so I could move around the room The whole hotel needs doing up as it s falling apart The lift is tiiny and accessibility is not very good for disabled travellers , Bed is comfy and having a bath was good
91606,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bedrooms are a little dated in their decor but we didn t go to London to stay in a room , Welcoming hotel in a niche area of London Clean comfy rooms and friendly staff We didn t eat in the hotel and restaurants around all close at 10pm Good bars nearby and lovely shopsin Shepherds Market 
91607,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was priced ok for London but hotel is very dated and could do with some modernisation , This hotel was well located for us Staff very friendly and the rooms were spotless 
91608,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room we were given initially was not good enough as decor was not ok , Sandhya was very helpful and went the extra mile and gave us upgrade and made us feel welcome She was very accommodating and kind She was very professional and courteous She booked a cab and also made sure she held the door when we were struggling with our luggages She is an asset to the service 
91609,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very small considering we were told on check in we had been upgraded I m not sure what size the room would have been before an upgrade Although we were upgraded to executive double there was only facilities for one guest , The staff were friendly the location was good and it was clean
91610,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Everything The breakfast was of low quality The bed I slept on was so thin that I could feel the spring under The AC was at least 30 years old and was blowing unfiltered air very dusty The hotel shows its age and the staff are clearly in for the dough , Nothing 
91611,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Overall this hotel is in need of refurbishment Our 4th floor room was rather dingy and relied on 2 oil filled radiators for heating , Very good cooked breakfast The bed linen was good clean The location is terrific 
91612,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms in need of refurbishment The carpet was terrible and woodwork peeling No room for the case and had to sleep with this on the bed I am 65 I could not have goy into the batch shower, handy for where I was going next day
91613,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Every day the same breakfast with small variety of food Tinny rooms with no safe Comparing with other hotels in London where we stayed before its realy overpriced , Well placed hotel Easy access Pretty neighborhood Good internet free of charge 
91614,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is very dated and in need of some serious updating Wallpapers peeling off tired furnishings marks on the walls roller blinds not working etc It is not worth the 4 star rating , Staff was very attentive The location is perfect 
91615,Park Lane Mews Hotel, When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded to a double room room I had booked a twin room as I was travelling with a work colleague to a conference for work The curtains in the room were filthy and hanging off the wall and we were right next to the lift and we could hear it all night , Breakfast was fine Location was good 
91616,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms are very old and the furniture as well The bed is not comfortable the pillows were flat And the cleaners were noisy at the morning couldn t sleep well , The location is excellent
91617,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast was cold bacon mushrooms beans hash browns due to poor food warmers The decor was in need of decoration doors were chipped and wallpaper a bit grubby and tired looking, Location excellent friendly and helpful staff good service at breakfast all food well cooked and tasty but 
91618,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel particularly our room in desperate need of a refurbishment Very very tired looking hotel tired looking room and bathroom Was advertised as being discounted from 800 night Like they say if it looks to good to be true it usually is , Nice lounge area Breakfast was nice 
91619,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Dinner was awful and breakfast was shambles with half the dishes missing Staff tried but could not understand English well so communication was hopeless Bedroom was very tired with frayed carpets and the bathroom so tiny that if a person was large they could not sit on the toilet Pillows so thin that we needed to ask for 5 each in total to get a decent nights sleep , Just the location nothing else and would certainly NOT stay there again 
91620,Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was no hot water or heating in the evening but they had fixed this thankfully by the morning these things happen Breakfast was included in the Booking but they have charged to my card taking this up with them these things should not happen , Nice friendly staff and great location
91621,Park Lane Mews Hotel, room a little small, Excellent value for money The location was fantastic Although the room was on a little small side I wouldn t expect any bigger for the money The breakfast was really good The quality of the sausages and bacon were very good and they made our eggs to order which was a nice touch I think this hotel is a hidden gem for those that are economy conscious yet still like high standards
91622,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The heating in the room did not work we were supplied with a portable radiation so the room was cold untill you put the radiator on The hotel needs a make over the hallways and rooms are very tired , The staff were charming helpfull Enjoyed breakfast 
91623,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The water pressure wasn t all that good and the shower was a bit poor as a result Room 500 I think would be a bit drafty in winter but quite acceptable in April and much to our joy the windows actually opened I don t want to be over critical as some appear to be we had a great weekend and had two good nights sleep and as we went to London to sight see and had two nights at the theatre booked the hotel met the needs we had perfectly well , Location Location Location and this hotel is in a great location Like most City hotels could do with a bit of TLC in places But it ticked all the big boxes It was clean the bed was comfy the linens fresh and the towels fluffy Staff were lovely very helpful Breakfast well I guess you had to get up at a decent time for it to be at it s best but we preferred to stay in bed until 10am so what did we expect However even at 10 40 the eggs were fresh and if not just ask and it will be done The buffet while a little depleted was still plentiful and we didn t have to wait to be seated 
91624,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel a bit run down and noise outside on the street can be heard by night in the rooms no double glazed windows 50 hold on card when arriving two to three days to get back into account yet to see if it arrives back in Breakfast and everything else besides the cost of the room is over priced , Location was extremely convenient
91625,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was noisy as windows are single glazed , Great location Easy to get anywhere in central London from here as tube station a couple of minutes walk Staff friendly we arrived early and they made room available Breakfast was nice 
91626,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room is run down Quite a pity given it s good location This is the first hotel I stayed in with socks on all the time as the carpet felt dirty and dusty , Location of the property is good ie within walking distance to Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace Many selection of restaurants and pubs in the neighbourhood 
91627,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Pillows weren t very good Plug in sink needs replacing TV not the best, Hotel is situated right in the heart of London very comfortable with a welcoming atmosphere friendly staff great food Loved it thank you Will definitely come here again
91628,Park Lane Mews Hotel, When we arrived for breakfast the restaurant was full they asked us to wait and then sat people that arrived after us first there was no consideration when we sat down for the full English breakfast there was no bacon no scrambled eggs no Fried eggs no hash brown The only thing that they had in plenty was mushrooms and tomatoes The staff were not organised and were rude at breakfast which was a shame as all the other staff were very pleasant, The young lady that checked us in was very pleasant very professional The location was great
91629,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was pokey Bed was small and uncomfortable Decor was dated Heating was substandard Shower took 5mins to heat up Bathroom couldn t accommodate 2 persons Premier Inn would have been a better option and better value for money , The location was good Breakfast was good Staff were happy to store our bags before check in and after checking out They were helpful and friendly 
91630,Park Lane Mews Hotel, only one easy chair in the room, extremely helpful of manageress on departing in arranging for taxi to collect our luggage from the hotel and deliver it to us at Euston station leaving us free to enjoy our last morning without having to return to the hotel to collect the luggage As wife on stick hotel arranged a room with walk in shower
91631,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel is tired Rooms need decorating Good value for a Sunday night deal but I would not want to pay anywhere near full rate for a very small basic room Again staff fantastic could not have been better , Very friendly and helpful staff

91633,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staffs in the breakfast room were offhand and just waved at the table they wanted you to sit at, It is quiet and peaceful with very comfy beds and a beautiful breakfast
91634,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The location was perfect for us and the reason we chose this hotel It was all a little dated which is why it fell into a lower price range for the area but perfectly clean Being a mews style property it was located on a small side street and very quiet for central London The staff were very friendly and helpful

91636,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Some of the decoration and furniture could do with a spruce up however as we were only booked for an overnight stay we were not in the least bit concerned , A superb location with a very welcoming atmosphere from all staff excellent choice at breakfast Extremely good value for money
91637,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Awful breakfast not cheap but nasty would not purchase another First time we had had a room at the front beware the bin boys arrive at 6 20am About 20 large bins behind The Hilton Really noisy unless you are a heavy sleeper , Good value for type of accommodation Room clean and comfortable Reception staff good Very convenient central location 
91638,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Should not be a 4 star no minibar no room service or at least doesn t take your breakfast order in the morning weak water pressure in shower flush not working well etc, Location

91641,Park Lane Mews Hotel, My friend wanted de caf coffee for her breakfast The staff were Eastern European and could not understand what she wanted I am not racist but if I come to a London hotel I do expect all staff that have face to face contact with customers to be able to speak good English ,No Positive
91642,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was in need of refurbishment and redecoration a little shabby but very clean and comfortable , Upgrade to king size room clean and quiet The staff especially Glenn and Sandya were excellent friendly and very helpful Breakfast was excellent 
91643,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel needs to be refurbished With investment and the existing staff plus rates this hotel would be a gem of a find in Mayfair , Staff were very friendly and helpful 
91644,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Noise pollution very hard to sleep Lack of organisation at breakfast no clean tables very slow service Very old fashioned hotel not as appears in photos Very overpriced , Welcome at the hotel
91645,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not anything too dislike unless you are one of those people who moan for a living or have forgotten that please and thank you go along way , the reviews do not do the hotel justice It was welcoming on the outside and reception were welcoming on the inside Our room was lovely clean and cosy Nice to have coffee and tea facilities as so many don t these days Bathroom very clean and plenty of hot water Near tube station and ideal location if you are visiting London and want to visit everything 
91646,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel overall could use a make over I paid 199 and got one of the smallest rooms in the hotel , The mattress was extremely worn Ditched in the middle the headboard was loose All night I was disturbed by HGV s loading good right outside my window room 302 and drivers being very loud at 3am 
91647,Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was a rodenticide trap in my room next to the air conditioning Disgusting The bed was worn out the carpet on the floor was disgusting The pillows were the thinest I ve ever experienced in a hotel the walls were dirty only one power plug in worked The toilet didn t flush in the bathroom and the sink never had hot water , The location is convenient 
91648,Park Lane Mews Hotel, the room was expensive but due to it s location in London there were several plug sockets in the room but all were too close to a shelf to actually use meaning only 1 plug socket in the room was functional the room was a little dated with damp patches evident for the price i expected more, room was comfortable with plenty of space good sized bathroom location was quiet short walk to tube station 
91649,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The carpets in the room could have been cleaner but I m being picky here , The breakfast was good and the bathroom was big Some of the reviews for this hotel are brutal but I didn t have an unpleasant stay Either the other guests have been unlucky with their rooms or they were expecting the same standard offered by the Hilton on Park Lane This hotel was fine for the cost and I would stay there again 
91650,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The corridors and reception paint work was very scruffy the hotel looked very down at heal would have to improve for us to stay again TV in the room was very antiquated 
91651,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rat vermin traps in the bedroom head waiter in the resturant was very unhelpful we had to ask three times for a hot cup of tea coffee the food at breakfast was tepid warm not hot my husband did not eat any of his breakfast food hygine ratings being hidden behind a plant pot so that customers could not see the 2 star rating no appology from staff dirty untidy reception area hotel decor very tired needs updating,No Positive
91652,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bed was very uncomfortable you could feel the springs in the thin mattress and also the divan was like a piece of board Waitress at breakfast could have served with a smile seemed like every thing was too much trouble, Location
91653,Park Lane Mews Hotel, All good thank you, Yes the rooms are a little tired that s why it s cheaper But everything worked Reception and breakfast staff all very friendly well done Kate Excellent value for money 
91654,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very noisy for several hours outside with bin lorries unloading and noisy reversing so hardly any sleep No hot water in morning Room very shabby New kettle and our recharging plugs could not fit into sockets because of old fittings, Staff were helpful and courteous
91655,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Lumpy double bed with springs starting to bulge through Room more shabby than chic and quite Small It needs to be refurbished, Staff were lovely Brilliant position in centre of London Surprisingly quite despite being just off Park Lane 
91656,Park Lane Mews Hotel, 1 The reception stuff not friendly 2 The bed not comfortable 3 Ther s no hot water and they keep laying to you that they will fix that issue but nothing happen until my last 4th night I decided to check out and say we will give discount from the amount that I already paid from Visa card every one uses it knows how that returns visas money not comfortable not satisfied returns At least it will take 5 to 7 days work tell the money back and if its not returned 4 Sample thing there s no Luggage carrying service 5 Brekfast is just thanks God I don t want to explain 6 Last night the reception nock the door and the ball during sleeping asking me if I ordered Sleeper the funny thing that was trying open the door Just imagine Not advanced from me , The location only
91657,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hot water system had broken down and we had no hot water in our room for the duration of our stay Therefore no baths or showers taken The staff were very apologetic and gave us a 35 discount on our booking Apparently the hotel were waiting for a part for the boiler Nobody mentioned this to us when we checked in it only came to light when we complained The hotel would benefit from a refurbishment , Really good breakfast 
91658,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Sadly the boiler was not functioning properly so a low pressure warmish shower on a cold night was not great , Staff were pleasant and helpful and the breakfast was pleasant 
91659,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff were pretty bad Very vacant check in staff I had to wait at the reception for ten minutes before I was dealt with Not an ideal welcome Check out was worse The girls attitude verged on rude Very tired hotel Needs a major overhaul , Location
91660,Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was no hot water available in the hotel and one of my colleagues had to ask for a change of mattress as the one that was on the bed originally was very old, Location was ideal for an event in Park Lane but not so easy to get to on public transport
91661,Park Lane Mews Hotel, No hot water in the evening or morning the internet didn t work properly there was no desk or chair to use for work and the heating didn t work there was an electric radiator which didn t warm the room enough ,No Positive
91662,Park Lane Mews Hotel, No hot water for a shower or wash noise from road outside bin men at 2 in the morning plus staff from the Hilton hotel opposite outside smoking and talking loudly Room decor very tired looking, Location breakfast
91663,Park Lane Mews Hotel, 1 Rooms were too old and small I could hardly keep my medium sized suitcase at a double bed room 2 Hotel heating system didn t work during my travel They changed my room 3 times but it was still same Later they gave me 2 mobile electric heaters so somehow it was managed I was listenning others to complain same So while travelling in winter one must ask ahead 3 Window leaks cold air from outside 4 Doesn t provide free toothbrush or tooth paste 5 I wanted to borrow an electric plug pin converter but they had none 6 Very few TV channels, Staffs were freindly breakfast was good best location 
91664,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very small but you expect this in central London There were no tea bags in the room and although I rang to request some none were brought to the room , The hotel s position was fabulous in a small mews and close to lovely shops pubs and restaurants The bar restaurant was comfortable and smart and a lovely place to have a pre dinner drink before heading out into Mayfair 
91665,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Everything except the staff, This is arguably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and especially for the price It is probably a 2 star not that I have ever stayed in one
91666,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Thought it would be a real treat to stay there but it wasnt Excellent location but a tired looking place needs updating and a good clean The lifts were scruffy and curtains were hanging off the rail in reception not a good welcome The toilet in the room was without windows or fan so you could just smell the loo the whole time Heating not working so a small portable radiator was placed there Just disappointed I would never stay there again cost a lot of money Spend your money elsewhere, location that s about all
91667,Park Lane Mews Hotel, There is nothing that you can dislike about this hotel and staff , The best kept secret in Park Lane Fantastic staff and brilliant location The staff are all so happy and do anything to please you and they go that extra mile 
91668,Park Lane Mews Hotel, the receptionist the day I checked out who wanted to kick me out at 12 00 knowing that when I checked IN the day before around 23 30 it had been agreed that I would check out at 13 00, The location
91669,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff on the evening when we had something to eat was a bit frosty when ordering our food the hotel is nice just it s appearance could do with being updated the room was pleasant the plunger in the sink wasn t working so we reported that breakfast room was small we didn t feel comfortable as everyone was very close when sitting at a table reception area was also used for breakfast , Friendly reception staff great location within walking distance of main attractions 
91670,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Advertised as 4 star hotel hardly worthy of 2 The entire hotel is in desperate need of maintenance and updating Some staff great the rest can t understand English The most serious issue is the fact that disabled people have to use a side door once the furniture is moved out of the way due to the age of the building that is not the problem and some staff are unable to open this door If there is to be a fire The breakfast I asked for bacon sausage and a fried egg Got bacon and sausage as well as beans mushroom tomato hash brown and scrambled egg Asked for fried egg again still waiting for it , The location is great It was a lovely building once upon a time 
91671,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room had been cleaned but was old musty and still felt dirty shabby The bathroom was shambolic You had to climb over the toilet which didn t flush adequately to get into the shower a large person would not have been able to do this The sink water did not run away for ages and you could not pop up the plug sufficiently At breakfast the staff only 2 were so overworked and they ran out of clean cups Not their finest hour , The staff were lovely and it s a great location
91672,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast room small it could not accommodate all residents resulting in queues for sitting Also only two staff on duty who were helpful but frazzled , Location excellent 
91673,Park Lane Mews Hotel, All great, Location excellent 5 minutes walk from Green Park Tube Staff friendly and helpful Breakfast very nice Rooms very quiet and nice Will definitely stay again 
91674,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The faculty is old and not well preserved The internet connection was poor and I desperately needed it since I was on a business trip I had to connect to the internet via roaming The bathroom was small and the shower definitely old uncomfortable Elevators are very badly preserved Overall the faculty is a very poor, Breakfast and the staff
91675,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bathrooms corridors tired early refurbishment overdue Hilton Hyde Staff smoking point noisy early hrs a m delivery lorry prompted room change room UPGRADE Great response , Location is excellent Reception Staff friendly v helpful Two night stay vfm when Sunday night discounted rate applied 
91676,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Incredibly uncomfortable and rather small double bed I struggled to sleep and was turning constantly all night , Location and breakfast choice was perfect
91677,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Everything was perfect for me except the heater was not working in my room Staff were aware with the problem They provided an external mini heater in the room which didn t help though in 2 degrees temperature night It was freezing and Couldn t sleep well from the cold draft comming from ventilation caught a bad cold Heating in such cold weather is basic essential ,No Positive
91678,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was dirty there were no hot water that i could not have a shower and had to changed my hotel the next morning Also wifi was not working I wonder how this hotel marked as 4 star hotel in London ,No Positive
91679,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Only down side is the rooms need to be updated also very loud noises from traffic bin men could do with window Being changed , This is a friendly hotel in a great location breakfast was really good had a great time 
91680,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The requested double bed was two very tired twin beds pushed together One had a huge dip in the middle and the other had large springs sticking out the side , Location was excellent
91681,Park Lane Mews Hotel, A bit noisy when the bins are emptied at 4am Local parking is VERY expensive but it is in London , Excellent staff and location A reakky welcoming place with a wide variety of guests 
91682,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is very sad and desperately needs an upgrade Heating not working so oil heaters in the room Paintwork all cracked and chipping carpets dirty and stained Has an odour of old frying fat in the lifts and reception We stayed here 20 years ago and it seems nothing has been done since then Such a shame , Location is excellent
91683,Park Lane Mews Hotel, No hot water in the morning but think they had a problem with the boiler as there were also plug in rads in the room Was very noisy at 6am when the dustbin lorry came Also could hear every time a door in the corridor shut This this is because it is an old hotel , Good location Polite service Excellent choice at breakfast clean 
91684,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Power sockets on the wall fixed too low and close to the surface of bench which is un adjustable so could not plugin any adapter or plug with cable protruding from the bottom of the charger adapter plug , So close to Hyde park and Mayfair and practically centrally located to all the ammenities and public transport 
91685,Park Lane Mews Hotel, It needs refurbishment NOW Without heating in London with 0 degrees was problem I got cold and two days I am out of the office They had a small additional rediator Just to mention that I had an oil to apply for my moist ache and when I tried it was frozen like a cream This is unecceptable If they new that they have problem they should change our room If was general they should supply all rooms with bigger This is an excuse especially when you stay one night I asked the lady and she said they had problem So I do not care I could say the same that I have problem and I cannot pay them The heating is the most important Next step is to claim my money from booking and I will do that , The situation is perfect but this is not enough for the rest 
91686,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The front of the hotel was very noisy due to staff working at opposite hotel and smoking outside in large groups it was ridiculously noisy and unnecessary really,No Positive
91687,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Patchy Wi Fi a little dated in parts not really an issue but would have expected a bit more from a Genting property , Compares well with other properties for the price and great location and very friendly staff 
91688,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, Over all it was a very pleasant experience with the staff very helpful and the breakfast was very enjoyable The location was ideal for the business appointment we had for that visit 
91689,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I must have been given one of the older rooms which needed refurbishment Room 501 On entering the room I noticed a portable electric heater which should have rang alarm bells I didn t have time to speak to reception to ask for another room as I had to depart quickly for an evening function Once back to the hotel and during my sleep I awoke feeling cold and had to put an extra blanket on the bed Even with the electric heater on full the room was freezing The bathroom extract fan was so powerful and noisy it was pulling high volumes of cold air through the leaky window adjacent to the bed making it draughty The repeated noise of the nearby lift through the early hours didn t help either Poor hot water pressure and flow in the bathroom topped off the experience Other than that the staff were friendly and breakfast was good Avoid Room 501 if you re offered it , Location is ideal and close to tube 
91690,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was cold despite a small electric radiator that had been added Fan in bathroom sounded like a diesel generator and you couldn t switch it off Tried heating airconditioning but that was also very noisey like a jet engine so switched off Water was cold for bath and shower, Staff were friendly and helpful Location is great for Mayfair Hyde Park and a reasonable price 
91691,Park Lane Mews Hotel, the breakfast was cold it did not taste nice How can they get this wrong the corridors and rooms were dated in need of a refurb decorate We were upgraded to a King room I would like to of seen a Double room to compare very disappointing we wasnt impressed with the room and shower facilities It didnt feellike a 4 hotel Real shame, the staff were v friendly and welcoming Reception gave a lovely impression of the hotel Until we went upstairs 
91692,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bed was very cold no quilts just sheet and room was cold all night Breakfast cold and not appetising Paid a considerable amount for below average hotel Would not return or recommend , Staff and location
91693,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was a little small no mini bar or safe and lacked in cupboard space Hard bed and room needed a little sprucing up Nothing disastrously bad just minor niggles , Amazing location excellent breakfast and very friendly staff The hotel looks lovely with a very attractive reception and dining area I would definitely stay again at the right price 
91694,Park Lane Mews Hotel, In need of a lick of paint general updating , Brilliant position helpful staff Plenty of tea coffee milk Small but comfortable room with plenty of storage space proper bath with big towels 
91695,Park Lane Mews Hotel, very shabby public areas especially in toilet area Repairs made to bathroom very poor cracked ties etc Overall the hotel needs to be decorated and brought out of the 1980 s, helpful staff at reception Good location
91696,Park Lane Mews Hotel, No TV remote in the room staff very bewildered and couldn t come up with a solution Wrong breakfast delivered in the morning Staff not particularly friendly except one guy serving breakfast Nothing major just small annoyances but brings down your opinion of the place , The location is great and rooms are decent enough
91697,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Uncomfortable bed very old you can feel the metal bit coming out everything is very old I was quite surprised such a beautiful area but is very poorly and old design Hotel they need loads of investing me and boyfriend try to change it the other room but there all same room shame poor service they didnt fine my booking half an hour we were already late other meting in london many other thinks anyway bad experience will never go there again , Location
91698,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, Good location Nice and quiet considering just off Park Lane Buffet breakfast was very good Plenty of choice though dining area small Get there early Shepherd Market right behind hotel is a gem of a find 
91699,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was a little worn out but great otherwise I will return so not really an issue, Great location within 5min walk to Green Park and Hyde Park Corner stations and lots of nice pubs cafes nearby Great service from the reception staff
91700,Park Lane Mews Hotel, No wifi or non existent Really struggled for entertainment in room No one picked the phones to Didn t have synthetic duvets Woken up at 6am with those getting breakfast ready Seriously spend your money elsewhere I was allergic to dust and guess what drawers full of dust Hotels tired looking , Good location 
91701,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Did not get the type of room that was paid for in advance Had to pay an extra 40 on arrival and even then it was still not as it looked in the photos Room was not recently refurbished as described Did not have a walk in shower as shown in photos Room was very very dated Stains on walls and carpets tiles damaged wallpaper ripped etc , Comfortable bed 
91702,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was tiny shabby and not the cleanest I also had two mobile radiators in my room which left even less space to move about Not worth the 130 price tag for room only Would not recommend ,No Positive
91703,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms were really dated Needs a bit of an upgrade for the price , Breakfast was good the location was perfect and the staff was mostly friendly The room was clean 
91704,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was small and had received what must of been a very basic clean so it was quite dirty in the corners and dusty throughout Generally very old decor greatly in need of investment to update it Odd perfumed scent attempted to mask the old smell in the room when we first walked in The heating didn t work properly so they had a little heater on full blast when we arrived it must of been running all day as the room was like a sauna The mattress was unbelievable uncomfortable with broken springs in places The bedding was clean but didn t smell fresh Like they d been through a very hot wash thousands of times but never replaced All in all a hotel where the staff are great but let down hugely by lack of investment and proper cleaning , Staff were very friendly and helpful especially the wait staff at breakfast who were brilliant attentive and welcoming 
91705,Park Lane Mews Hotel, This was NOT a 4 hotel as advertised Although clean the rooms were a joke 120 to stay in a very cramped dated not centrally heated room is ridiculous furniture is strained and battered Plug Sockets are un useable being located so low to counter tops not leaving enough space for cables We had to unplug our only heater to charge phones leaving the room freezing I would give this hotel a 2 5 Star Max and wouldnt pay more than 50 Per night , Staff Were extremly plesent But im sure this was to make up for the shabby ness of the hotel 
91706,Park Lane Mews Hotel, A We had to change our room 3 times before we got one that was even close to being habitable B First room carpet torn and heavily stained The bed linen appeared to have been used before C Bedroom 2 the mattress was old and the edges were only 5 deep and broken down It was also very stained with blood and bodily fluids No proper mattress protector and the four pillows were thin 2 and old D Throughout our stay we spoke to the Head of Housekeeping a number of times regarding the quality of the rooms and she informed us that almost ALL the rooms were in this condition It was only thanks to her intervention that we finally were moved to a room that was satisfactory E The Hotel was tatty and run down in appearance Our understanding from your website that this Hotel has a 4 Star rating Sadly this is not the case F Since we selected this hotel on the basis that we were booking 4 star accommodation we are prepared to pay the full price for the two nights where the room was satisfactory however we feel that a full refund for the three previous nights would be appropriate G The above were the main issues more listed below 1 Duvets wafer thin 2 Odd cups chipped 3 bathrobe one for 2 people 4 Unfinished furniture in room no doors on armoire 5 All paintwork chipped and damaged 6 Peeling wallpaper Etc Etc Photographs are available if required We look forward to your early response John and Jan Summerfield, Only the location
91707,Park Lane Mews Hotel, What didnt we like most things To start with beds were by far the most uncomfortable bed i have ever slept in It felt as if it was falling apart and for that reason very noisey Both myself and colleague shared a twin room 302 heating was broken freezing cold night only 3 working plugs in the room how are business people meant to work Carpets were really dirty also which is very off putting Huge draft through the window made our night totally horrific it was freezing made sense why there was a portable heater in the room which was useless Pillows were falling apart i had to sleep my head on a blanket we were also awoken to the bin men right outside our window at 6 am for a solid 40 minutes For 10 cheaper i could have stayed at the Millenium hotel just down the road which is by far much more superior and also much better value for money Its not even a cheap hotel to warrant having such bad qualities , clean sheets
91708,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast staff couldn t even muster up a small smile all morning Very loud rooms single glazed window right outside loading bay , Lovely staff on reception very friendly and welcoming Lovely location in terms of tourist sights and walks 
91709,Park Lane Mews Hotel, We stayed in this hotel 25th 27th dec 2016 Our phone charger was found lost at 4pm 26th dec 2016 All our personal toiletries total of nine items were found lost when we back from dinner at 9pm Reception staff apologized and promised to find our lost belongings We kept calling the hotel on 28th 29th 30th for any updates Reception manger named Jiada told us none of the items were found and she will forward this to her manager who is on holiday till 4th jan 2017 We then left our email address for them to contact because we are flying aboard for new year We wrote two e mails to contact the hotel on 9th jan 2017 and 22nd jan 2017 It is been almost a month We are still waiting for the response from the hotel yet no one appears Just to warn any potential travellers to think twice before you make the reservation with this hotel , Location is good 
91710,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Cold bathroom too small and very old, Location and quiet Hotel very tired and cold heating not in room Badly needs refurbishing Would not go again Staff excellent 
91711,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The location was ideal and value for money considering the location was excellent We thought the hotel itself was very homely and full of character 
91712,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not enough space at breakfast for all the guests needed to wait for a table and the food was in short supply The rooms are basic and the whole hotel is run down but fairly clean , Decent location just behind Park Lane and close to good restaurants Walking distance to Oxford Street 
91713,Park Lane Mews Hotel, We had a fuse blow in the room causing the lighting to fail completely Apart from socket lighting We phoned reception and some 10 mins later a porter arrived with a light bulb He realised it was the fuse problem saying he could not do it We were left to get ready with no lighting which consisted of showering then hair drying and makeup to be done Hence no one returned to fix the fuse I reported it once again to Reception when booking out of hotel To which she replied she would get someone to look at it To which I replied well that s not going to help us now is it , Staff were friendly enough although not sure if Receptionest understood us
91714,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was so hot I managed to open the widow which was not easy other than this small point everything was ok , The room was very good value for the money and the Hotel is very central 
91715,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Erm oh the bathroom was a tiny bit small and whilst it had a lovely looking tub the hot water pressure was not enough that you could have successfully run an bath But that is pretty much nitpicking , Location was amazing Value for money at the time was incredible Room was lovely Super comfy bed Breakfast Was tasty I highly recommend their cooked breakfast but the the serving of warm croissants was amazing 
91716,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The property is looking slightly tired but fine for an overnight stay, Its location was perfect for me as I was attending a function at the Grosvenor House in Park Lane very good value for Mayfair
91717,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was extremely shabby Soft furnishings furniture was completely worn out I m glad we didn t pay very much however it s no excuse for shabby rooms, Location was excellent
91718,Park Lane Mews Hotel, All rooms are very tired and need of new paint and decorating They were cold too and each had a plug in oil heater One of my business guests had a cracked window in his room they did kindly change his room though noise level outside was bad too , Location is great breakfast and staff all very nice and helpful 
91719,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The upgrade wasn t particularly special I wonder what the 150 night would have gotten us if we didn t get an upgrade Very expensive for something that isn t at all modern We were in a room facing the street and it was noisy even though we were a little off the Main Street It was quite old fashioned , We were upgraded when we got there The reception staff were lovely The downstairs lounge was cozy Quite close to Hyde park green park station Buckingham palace and surrounds Good hairdryer in the room and it was clean 
91720,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room a little tired and in need of updating Mattress not terribly comfortable Couldn t open window to let fresh air in , Excellent location and good value for central London
91721,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel room badly needs to be renovated as the carpet is worn and the rest of the room is quite dated and suffering from long term effects of wear and tear , Price was good
91722,Park Lane Mews Hotel, My room felt like the servant s quarters The curtains didn t close which was a shame as there was a draught coming in from the window Heating was provided by a small electrical oil filled radiator Due to lack of space and electric sockets I had to choose between heat and charging my phone The decor was very tired In particular the carpet was covered in burn marks and was very frayed , Location The period furniture and decor in the reception and dining room The staff were friendly The tea and coffee facilities in the room mugs instead of tea cups 
91723,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The curtains drapped either side of the window only had a few hooks eyes so didn t hang right could ot be drawn also the room had to have an free standing electric heater to heat the room , Great location for my requirements Easy friendly check in service 
91724,Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was a whistling machine outside in the street so it was little bit annoying Municipality services for the trash started at 5 am outside it was too early to get up for a vacation, Very good for a very good price friendly staff
91725,Park Lane Mews Hotel, We had a little problem with the water of the bathtub which drenched the moquet going through the walls but we were immediately moved to another room , The staff was very kind and understanding 5 Min from Hyde Park Corner station Clean
91726,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room cramped and really knackered Breakfast was very unappetising and dull Have had better in what would be considered a poorer quality hotel Definitely not worth the price and wont make that mistake again, Location is quite good but next time will research the area for a better hotel
91727,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Beds hard run down more like a 2 star disappointing, Stayed here a few years ago and it was ok the recent stay was not worth the money very disappointed 
91728,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms are not correctly described on site of booking com It is definitely not 4 stars hotel We have coffee and tea only on first day in the room then no one check and add more , The staff on the reception desk has been very friendly and try to assist as much as they can 
91729,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, Great location for Mayfair and extremely good value for money The room was small but perfectly adequate for an overnight stay The staff were friendly and helpful I would certainly stay here again 
91730,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Noisy dirty poorly maintained lack of service wrongly rated I have photos of taps dripping sink with waste water that wouldn t empty hairs on toilet seats the list goes on and on Save your hard earned cash We are a late 30s and early 40s professional couple normal couple with normal expectations , Location is the only thing going for this hotel I do not write reviews normally but feel compelled to warn others with hard earned cash to spend it elsewhere this hotel does not deserve my or your hard earned money
91731,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was over priced for the condition The bed was absolutely terrible and the slight movement the whole hotel could hear you , Perfect location and very central
91732,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Cleaners tried getting us to clock out at 8 30 am even though clock out is suppose to be at 12 so we sent them away and they came back at 11 and told us we had to leave , The location is right near Hyde park but set back of any main roads
91733,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms are a bit tired some are small this our third stay at the hotel and understand it could be possibly refurbished next year Very good staff, We stayed in the Park Lane Marriot the night before the breakfast could not compare with the Park Lane Mews breakfast which was hot and excellent Will stay again
91734,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bed was like a brick pillows flat room had not been decorated since the 80 s Electric heater on floor bathroom dirty , Close to Hyde park for winter wonderland got discounted rate which was a fair reflection of the room quality ok for one sleepless night 
91735,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Instead of a double bed the put 2 twin beds together AC not working 2 heaters in the room were already there Noise from the street all night and in the morning from loading and unloading Lots of noise from the cleaning staff on the hallway Dirty bathroom trashbin door Carpet dirty The shower was not working we had to use the tub, The location
91736,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Xmas tree looked awrful Walking down park lane at other hotels there trees were gorgeous Don t think it would have coat to much to have a really nice Xmas tree in reception would have made such a difference Only other point was the staff from the Hilton hotel at night they seems to use the area at the front of your hotel to have a smoke and a chat it goes no on and off throughout the night Emptying the bins was not really a problem but did wake us up, Good location and fantastic breakfast sausages were best I have had 
91737,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel was lovely and the staff extremely friendly and helpful The only thing that let it down was the fact the the room was very tired and desperately in need of work There were marks on the wallpaper the skirting boards were completely covered with scrapes and very large scratches and the lamp shades were badly damaged with holes and rips in nearly all of them Everything else about our stay and the hotel was wonderful ,No Positive
91738,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff service and location, This is a fantastic hotel with brilliant staff in a fantastic location You could wish for any better in this very prestigious area and business meeting s location
91739,Park Lane Mews Hotel, the beds were not realy made up just closed without even streching the part on the matras , I have been here several times and I like the English cosiness
91740,Park Lane Mews Hotel, No hairdryer in the room Receptionists were not helpful were not able to assist with such a simple thing as printing the flight tickets , The perfect location Within walking distance to all the attractions 
91741,Park Lane Mews Hotel, 2 parts of bed base did not line up causing a bruise walking past in the small room Heating not working room overheated by portable electric heater opened window but noise from road works and the Hilton s extraction plant was a nuisance , Great location
91742,Park Lane Mews Hotel, No real complaints other than it being a little tired , A small hotel in a good location with tube parks restaurants pubs in easy walking distance It was quiet and I had a good night s sleep Although the room and bathroom were a little tired the quality of the original fittings tiling etc was good The hotel was well priced The reception staff were efficient and pleasant 
91743,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, I did not expect to find such a great little hotel just round the corner from Park Lane and Piccadilly Lovely warm room and an added bonus was a full sized bath and fluffy white towels and bath robe The room was very quiet and breakfast plentiful Breakfast is on special offer when you check in 
91744,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I had inadequate heating in my room and lacked the ability to resolve the situation Very very poor service and response to my complaint Rooms haven t been decorated for 10 years , Good location
91745,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is completely run down and booking com should have had something of note on this fact displayed on the listing I booked the most expensive room on the site there were 5 available at time I booked I went most expensive because the picture and description let me believe it was the best room at the hotel Very far from it The room was a dump It was very old and dingy What pissed me off was that I was charged 289 when for 30 more I could have stayed at the Hilton in a better room Management absolutely would not adjust my pricing to reflect the standard dumpy room rate of 145 Instead they offered to move me to a bigger room which I agreed to and they did Natalie the manager on duty at the time could not have been more professional She did her best to reason with me and to liaise with their corporate office Natalie was a star My recommendation don t stay at this hotel Seriously for a bit more stay at the Hilton if price is an issue anyway you should not be looking at rooms in Mayfair , The location is tops simply cannot be beat Heart of Mayfair next door to 45 Park Lane and The Dorchester and The Hilton Across the street from Hyde Park What is there not to like 
91746,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms need to updated urgently tatty cold cramped very noisy at night double glazing needed on windows someone try to enter our room in the early hours it was only the security chain that stop them coming in very scary we won t be staying at the hotel , Location
91747,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was tiny you had to close the door in the bathroom to be able to move around and I could touch both sides of the room whilst stood in front of the window where the tv had been positioned due to the lack of wall space the dirty carpet with two large holes where furniture had warn through to the floor boards topped it off , It s proximity to the Grosvenor House Hotel where I was attending a function
91748,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff were rude I asked if I could swap rooms as my room was noisy the girl didn t even lift her head and said no the site closes in 2 hours Same member of staff the next day was rude again when checking out again didn t lift her head when I asked where a hair salon would be to get my hair done No air con in rooms Big disappointment and wouldn t want to stay again , Really great location
91749,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Receptionist offered a discount on the breakfast if we paid at check in After that it was not available However if you booked a room directly on the hotel site a complimentary breakfast was included in a lower price than booking com The rooms are filthy They put a queen size bed in a room large enough for a twin bed and call this deluxe The staff is surly What is to like about this place The establishment overrates its accommodations We reserved a deluxe room the first room we had was sub standard and filthy We requested a change to a deluxe room and were moved to a slightly better room Both rooms were very low end When we requested a rate adjustment for the difference between deluxe and standard a difference of 150 pounds they gave us a 50 pound courtesy rebate hardly a sufficient adjustment They admitted to the low quality but did nothing about properly adjusting the rates Booking com responded to correspondence daily requesting copies of the bill then copies of my credit card statement and then finally refusing to do anything unless I provided photos of the room Beware of Booking com and this hotel Also take photos of everything questionable , Self serve traditional breakfast buffet Nothing spectacular
91750,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I was thirsty as we were checking out and I asked the waitress if I could just have a little glass of juice set up for breakfast but she said as I hadn t paid for breakfast I couldn t have a drink Nice , Reception staff were very friendly and helpful 
91751,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms were very dated scruffy with rips in the carpet Not worth the cost of the stay This hotel is trying to be very posh succeeds until you get in the lift , Friendly staff location 
91752,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was dated carpet dirty scruffy wallpaper shabby furniture broken kettle lid only 4 milk portion 1 packet of biscuit tap in bathroom sink had a broken seal not worthy of a four star very upset suppose to have been a delux room we complained about the first room we were shown and this one was the better of the two Also tv reception awful curtains were of the bracket so didn t meet in the middle when shut ,No Positive
91753,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was really small and quite noisy The plugs were ridiculously placed so near to the counter top that you couldn t get a plug in , Rooms were clean and comfortable with lovely large soft towels Staff were really friendly and extremely helpful Location is excellent 
91754,Park Lane Mews Hotel, A real radiator in the room room 502 one connected to the central heating would have been nice There was a broken sort of heating unit under the window Heavier curtains that actually close to block off the window in addition to the thin blind would be good too I appreciate I was in a single room and these are often overlooked by hotels as if we do not matter but to be up in the roof space in a poky room with a tiny electric oil fired radiator plugged in well I think you can do better The duvet was as thin as a pancake and not at all warm I needed the towelling bathrobe on top of my bed and a jumper to sleep in The radiator was plugged into the only useable 13amp socket in the room This is because the other sockets are placed so low down you cannot get a plug into them without damaging the flex So for charging phones using a laptop I had to unplug my only heating source Plus at 6am in the morning the shower was not hot enough , Bed was very firm which I like but room was cold Excellent location albeit on a backstreet but an excellent location for Hyde Park Corner Piccadilly etc Staff on reception were lovely 
91755,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rather tatty Tiles coming off in the tiny bathroom Very small bedroom Needs re decorating a lot of chipped paint and wallpaper coming off Some of the staff very difficult to understand Had to put down a 50 deposit as well as paying up on arrival , Comfortable bed 
91756,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Dated In urgent need of a renovation Small rooms dates furtniture Ancient tv would have been better to not have had a tv in the room I used my laptop , It was so bland that there was nothing to like 
91757,Park Lane Mews Hotel, 2nd time there both times overhearing other guests having problems with their bookings Hard beds , Small quiet and homely but great location and more than fulfills all your basic needs 
91758,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff were not friendly on check in the welcome was poor staff going about their business not really acknowledging a new customer but simply processing us taking our money and the departure staff were not interested how the stay had been They also allowed other guests to interrupt rather than ensuring that our departure was efficiently sorted out before dealing with them We didn t have breakfast but it didn t look worth 17 per person seemed excessive even for London Although check out was 12noon from 9 30am the housekeeping staff were knocking on the door to see when we were leaving Bed wasn t comfy and pillows flat as pancakes neither my daughter nor I slept well we wouldn t chose this hotel again , Room was cozy well cleaned That s it really nothing much to like about it really 
91759,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff in the dining room could have been a little more friendly Some of the decor is very tired , The bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was excellent 
91760,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Shabby room which has not seen investment in years Generally tired and faded furniture and fittings Carpets well worn This hotel needs a refurbishment badly Reception staff off hand No payment receipt available and one is required to pay on arrival not on departure Perhaps because nobody was at reception in the morning it just reflects how capital and operating costs are run at a bare minimum Will not return , Excellent location
91761,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very small it was not very clean there were marks on the bedding as you entered the room 110 the frayed carpet I caught my foot in there was very little interaction from staff they only spoke to take my payment told me nothing about breakfast the facilities and didn t make me feel welcome at all The room was old and cold and I was disturbed in the morning by my bell ringing asking if I had reported my heater not working I hadn t reported it but anyway in summary I don t think I have ever stayed somewhere before and not had a friendly welcome or any information just the simple things although the room sink and toilet could of been cleaned better as itvx, The location was fantastic
91762,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is very dated The whole hotel is dirty the rooms are gloomy we had to move room once as the first room smelt really bad The second room was not much better but we just had to get on with it as they would not refund us our money so we could go somewhere else The staff are rude and not bothered in customer service The breakfast is 16 for dry bacon and dry beans I would never stay here again and don t recommend anyone too There are much cheaper better hotels Wish I would of read the review first I am not a person to complain about silly things but this really is a joke , There was nothing at all what i liked about this hotel
91763,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The cleanliness of the room was poor Wall paper falling off the walls Marker pen over the walls The toilet was in a disgusting condition Looked very old In need of decorating throughout Expect much better from a hotel in park lane , Location
91764,Park Lane Mews Hotel, we were told our room was upgraded and it didn t seem to be Their was also no wardrobe in the room which I found difficult to believe in this day and age the handy man decided to varnish our door when we were in our room and told me to watch my suit when I came out of the room later a sign went on the door for wet paint what is that all about , The service at reception was excellent a room was reserved as an early book in our luggage was kept for us while we took in the sights after booking out Breakfast was really nice with a wide range and selection 
91765,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Although the exterior of hotel was very pretty the rooms were very run down and in desperate need of updating so much so that the room and bathroom felt dirty , Location was excellent for purpose of our trip which was to take part in Royal Parks half marathon which started in Hyde Park 
91766,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The staff did their best but the state of the hotel leaves much to desire The whole place needs renovations The carpets curtains cushions on chairs and couches are stained dirty and smelly The heating does not work the bathroom is in bad shape The TV channels were only partially available in the room For a business hotel expecting to accommodate international guests absolutely NOT good enough The price for the room night compared with the service bed hygiene quality of food location of the safe non existing Minibar and non working phone so we were unable to call room service or the reception but had to go to the lobby to request toiletry that was not replenished and to pick up a bottle of water ourselves is unacceptable Again it should be noted that the staff tried hard to get things right Management the owner and booking com is to blame for the state of this offer 
91767,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was dirty There was a water leak in the room making the carpet drenched Amenities were very run down Very expensive for the quality , Nothing

91769,Park Lane Mews Hotel, It is very Shabby The small room was clean thankfully The front desk folks were nice but really had no idea about finding out little things I would not recommend this to anyone unless they prefer shabby The whole place needs to closed for a makeover , Location
91770,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Noisy during the night I know we were in Central London but this was because we couldn t shut the window due to the Ac unit outlet being placed in the gap , Fantastic location for Shepherds Market where we ate that night Staff very friendly and room very comfortable
91771,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast was over cooked and dried out Staff not particularly friendly The Room was shabby The lift was out of order as was the toilets Overall incredibly disappointing,No Positive
91772,Park Lane Mews Hotel, It s a tired hotel in terms of finish but not a reason I wouldn t go back there , It was well located being the side road for an event at the Park Lane Hilton and much better value
91773,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel has not seen any renovation for years My room had a carpet that looked pretty disgusting at some places Also the shower did not work properly it only knew hot or steaming hot , Very quiet location slept with open window Good location in general I thought The room was clean such as bed sheets toilet and shower 
91774,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast was cold limited variety and empty when we arrived at 9 Staff were not helpful they were cold and everything felt like a chore for them Moody is a word I would use for one of them It was not worth 11 95 each The bed was horrible felt every spring The room was not what we thought from the pictures on the site but felt like a fair size We were front facing so the blue light outside came on at night and our curtain had a few pegs missing so had gaps of light The staff at front desk were not forthcoming or helpful Somewhat rude answering the phone whilst speaking to us , The location was a 5 min walk to park lane which was ideal 
91775,Park Lane Mews Hotel, A sheet on the bed rather than just a duvet But the air conditioning was brilliant during an exceptionally hot spell of weather , Really helpful reception staff and friendly atmosphere 
91776,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Air conditioning unit is on the inside of the room and it makes a racket It is impossible to sleep wit it on It couldn t be switched off by us or staff so had to take the fuse out the wall The whole Hotel needs an upgrade ,No Positive
91777,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The service at breakfast was slow this time but this is the first time we encountered this the waiting staff were doing their best but another pair of hands would have helped We would prefer a teapot on the table so we can refill anytime without having to wait to be served this would also help the staff this was on offer when we first started using the hotel The room we had was smaller than the ones we normally have for the same price and it was looking a bit tired but we realised that there were going to be some alterations which didn t happen , The staff especially the reception staff were again extremely pleasant and helpful The left luggage facility is very welcome We always use this hotel since we found it a few years ago as the location suits our needs We really like the ambience of the place and the decor and wouldn t like to see too modern decor as it would lose it s good feeling But we will continue to use this hotel as overall it is a nice hotel 
91778,Park Lane Mews Hotel, D cor was looking tired , Ideally located for Hyde Park and Piccadilly Quiet location off Park Lane Friendly helpful staff Hotel has a small bar and served a good breakfast

91781,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I didn t like the look of the Executive Double room we we re staying in The bed was clearly very old as it has a dent in it and made a lot of noise as well as the room being muggy and old Had to pay an extra 7 on top of the 22 breakfast charge to have breakfast in bed which annoyed me , The staff were nice 
91782,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfast items could have been replenished more promptly but that was not a major problem , I had requested a disabled bathroom as I m awaiting hip replacement and it was excellent The staff couldn t have been more helpful and the location is ideal There s a good selection of restaurants close by and I had an excellent evening meal at a Lebanese restaurant just round the corner It felt very safe despite being a woman alone The room was well furnished and spacious It was extremely quiet as well I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel 
91783,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfast is too pricey , Good location very courteous and helpful staff I was out at one point looking for a nice coffee shop Came upon one in the narrow lane behind the hotel It was run by a lovely Spanish family and I had a cup of latte there that was the very best one in all of London 
91784,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Size of room was very small D cor in the room was very tired with a musty smell in the room TV was very poor quality and signal poor Bathroom was very cramp and not very welcoming Unlikely I would stay here again , Good location

91787,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The disabled facilities at the property weren t the best The wheelchair had to be wheeled in through the restaurant where chairs and tables had to be moved around so the chair could pass through every single time we came in or left the hotel The disabled room was pretty small for a wheelchair , Friendly staff Could leave your luggage on the day of check in or check out Good location Clean rooms 
91788,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff has not checked the request I have asked which was not to disclosed the price of the room which I ve paid in cash but instead he shouted out loud how much was it Bad bad, Location is great 
91789,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The first room we got into Was not what I saw on the photos And to upgrade it cost me another 40, Location was great Staff were nice And bed was firm and comfortable
91790,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Our room was very tired looking The wallpaper really let the room down as it was grubby shabby looking which considering this was a four star was a bit disappointing However that said it didn t affect our stay in way way whatsoever , All staff were very pleasant and accommodating The room was very comfortable The beds especially and the fluffy towels There was everything that we needed in the room The air conditioning was a godsend The location was perfect close to the centre without being too close and thus noisy 
91791,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, This is a lovely small hotel just off Park Lane My room was a single but very well appointed with plenty of room for a single visitor Importantly on the hottest weekend the air con was on when I arrived and easily adjustable for nighttime too

91796,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfast variety cost Also for the hotel s business benefit if the concierge services includes the intermediaries go between tour bus transportation services purchase the skip line for the various museums with a minimum charges it would bring more business to the hotel and the helpful to the tourists Finally pay attention a little more in up keeping the room cleaning services , The hotel located in a fairly close to the public transportation park and the variety popular restaurants Especially the Shepherd s Market was very helpful We had the breakfast daily and used the amenities from the markets 
91797,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The pictures that is show on booking is different from reality when it comes to the room No water in the rooms even the big ones The Ac is very loud the blanket I saw the one under the cover looks old and rotten Check ur self, There was Ac in the room
91798,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Check in not great didn t take my card so caused problems when trying to order room service Key card stopped working halfway through stay Lifts were fairly temperamental which meant going up and down three flights of stairs most the time AC unit in the room was incredibly loud which meant you couldn t sleep with it running Just lots of niggles caused by a lack of attention to detail really and below par service not really what you d expect from such a great location Would be hesitant to book again ,No Positive
91799,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room service maintenance was very poor we had a dirty chair in the room the curtain was partly hanging down the shower curtain was smelly also the one it was replaced with after we had complained only the third one was ok there were piles of dust on the floor underneath the beds table surfaces in the lobby were wiped with an apparently dirty cloth you could see the smear on the tables Our room was quite small for the amount of money we paid No place to put the suitcases There were no hangers on the walls in the room where you could put jackets etc While all the male waiters at breakfast were really friendly helpful and nice the waitress was not , The location was very good right next to all the first rate luxury Park Lane hotels Public transport is easy to reach many buses stop very close to the hotel Hotel looked very nice 
91800,Park Lane Mews Hotel, On arrival at the Reception Desk I was questioned if I was booked in the hotel as the lady on the reception couldn t find my booking I showed the lady my printed version of my Booking com reservation for Two Nights and still couldn t find me I was then asked if I was booked in another hotel and if I came to the wrong one After 5mins they found me and only for one night I did say it s booked for two nights and then was asked for Photo ID to prove who I was The rooms are very dated side units were damaged Sink full of weed like substance upon arrival cups with the Tea Facilities need a good cleaning beforehand Asked for a free map on arrival through Booking com and didn t get one Overall Location fantastic but Checking In very poor Rooms dated Also if you don t want to pay 16 95 for breakfast at Hotel nice little Caf 3min walk away opens at 8am , The Location was fantastic

91802,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hot water was an issue on ONE day , Spacious room Decent ensuite Two lifts ensured there was never a wait A secure safety deposit box was available for guest use 
91803,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The mattress was really uncomfortable pillows and bedding very basic and d cor and furniture tired The poorest 4 star I have stayed in and a very small room A shower curtain in the bathroom which is never good , The location for Hyde Park was excellent
91804,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Air conditioning not functioning in room 407 on 20th July Window screwed in to a fixed position so no external air flow encouraged Staff attempted to find me a fan but this did not show up Resorted to jamming room door open with the solitary chair in order to try and encourage air flow Eventually lay down the wrong way round on the bed gasping for air from the warm breeze created by the malfunctioning aircon resembling a swaety goldfish deprived of oxygen about 2 hours sleep achieved so abt 120 per hour of sleep ,No Positive

91807,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfast was very disappointing corporate and unimaginative very pre packaged , The size of the hotel is good it gives it an intimate exclusive feel
91808,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The aircon in the room left a lot to be desired but it is only a small niggle and was only heightened because of how hot it was while we were there , The location was great and the staff were wonderful The room was big and the hotel itself was lovely very quiet and elegant 
91809,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The fact that while we were waiting in the lounge area it was extremely obvious that a man was checking into the hotel with two prostitutes The clerk said the room is only for two people and the guest said they won t be staying long a little disturbing, The staff was extremely helpful in providing travel tips 
91810,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The only issue is hotel is tired and dated , Breakfast was great location fantastic this is the second time we have stayed in this hotel and recommend it 
91811,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room carpet was dirty I dropped a tie and looked under the bed and was met with a thick layer of dust The air conditioning didnt work so a mobile untit was positioned in the corner An air pipe led from the air con to an open window 1 the noise of the adjoining street was heard and rhe mobile unit was uncomfortably loud The doors were scratched whick matched the state of the decor The bathroom was clean Though the towels were mean and thin Breakfast is NOT worth the money Do not be talked into it It looks good but is poor Using Booking com I got a great rate booked some monthes in advance Sadly that cheap rate which was NOT the ceapest room they offered also met that I did not get a decent room Pay LESS and dont stay here Go and boom somewhere a little further away , I booked due to location

91814,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Issues at check in resolved ultimately a good stay Had booked 3 twin rooms but none were available on the day We were allocated 3 super king size rooms which luckily for our group of girls was suitable Disappointed by this as there were 3 available twin rooms at the time of booking which is why we chose this hotel The rate was the same The receptionist sent 2 bottles of wine to one room as an apology We appreciated this gesture were happy with the rooms given but would have preferred the combinations we had booked well in advance , We arrived early and had coffee in the lobby which was great whilst the kind receptionist got one of our 3 rooms ready early This meant we could have a base for our luggage before returning later when the other 2 rooms were ready Liked the tea coffee in all rooms which were all very clean Location fabulous great to leave the Hyde Park venue just cross the road to get back Loads of restaurants just outside A little tired in places in the corridors but cleanliness location win out 
91815,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Tired property in desperate need of renovation Staff without motivation and without any idea of customer service Would prefer to sit a chat between themselves rather than check customers in Breakfast awful should have gone to Pret to get considerably better at a quarter of the price I stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and it has gone down hill terribly A hotel to be avoided , Location

91818,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was small tired peeling paint and dull colours The safe did not work and was told by reception we know about that thanks for telling us but they did make alternative provision On arrival there was a breakfast offer which we took up to be told the next day by the man on reception we had not His very poor response was to say that the offer was only available if booked on arrival which we had and that as he had no record we had not Had to make a bit of a fuss which at least the restaurant manager understood what I was saying The man on reception has no understanding of customer service , The location is good for central London public areas well appointed breakfast reasonable The young restaurant supervisor was the only member of staff who had any understanding of the concept of service recovery
91819,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Cab arranged on the way back to the airport was unprofessional and rude He would only accept cash which we were not informed about at the hotel and initially refused to issue is a receipt ,No Positive
91820,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The fabric of the Hotel was a little thread bare and the Hotel decor in general was in need of a make over Rather over priced for the state of the decor, Staff helpful and friendly Excellent Location Generally the Hotel was clean and tidy 
91821,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff said everything right but it was unconvincing No eye contact only responded to direct questions Aptitude fine attitude needs work , Location
91822,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The only thing we didn t like was the fact that we had not booked a longer stay , Staff very helpful early check in no problem breakfast really good location excellent for getting around London as Tube only a six minute walk Bars and Restaurants within a couples of minutes and a great Indian Restaurant recommended by Keifer Sutherland the Taj Mahal on your door step Hyde Park is on route to the Tube lots going on there if you like people watching and if you like walking we walked from the Shard along Fleet Street through Trafalgar Square and back to the Hotel it took a while but we are 60 years old and it was a bit on the warm side The following day we went to Camden Market Lock nice and easy to get to you really must try this amazing 
91823,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very nisy all through night staff at Hilton opposite stand outside the mews in their breaks for smoking and are very very noisy if you are in a room at the front of the hitel, Location excellent for whatever you have planned in London
91824,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff and management was rude and extremely unhelpful We paid for accommodation on bookings com When we got to the hotel they made us pay again So we paid double accommodation The reception lady was the rudest and most unfriendly person we have ever come across The tap in the bathroom was broken The plug was broken The room was tiny The air conditioning was broken There was a portable aircon that was put in the room by the window in essence the window had to stay open the entire night and we could not get any sleep as we could hear all the noise from the street with the window being open Park Lane Mews hotel was the most expensive in the area Did not include breakfast Whenever we asked for assistance everyone treated us badly and made us feel like we are a problem to them This is without a doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed at and I do not recommend this hotel to anyone , Did not like anything at all Will not suggest this hotel to anyone 
91825,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bacon at breakfast tasted awful I have never had bacon that had such a horrid taste I couldn t eat it and we were looking forward to a nice breakfast wouldn t have it again The hotel drastically needs decorating bedrooms landings etc , The location
91826,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was very dated plus us to leave 50 damage deposit I could understand if we were 18 and in Ibiza but not 45 and in Park Lane We checked out before the cleaners have gone in to decide whether we had to pay any sort of damage which I think is so wrong because you got to keep checking your bank account to see if it s been taken, No better place in London for getting around
91827,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel is very out dated and everything looks and feels very old Room didn t have a hair dryer and the bed and pillows weren t extremely comfortable , Location is great and it s very close to 2 tube stops Really easy to get to Heathrow from the hotel I was able to check in really early at no extra charge and have a late check out for only an extra 10 pounds 
91828,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff very unhelpful and they found it difficult to understand what was happening with our booking simply because 2 rooms were booked by me but one room was down under my friends name Not asking them to do rocket science,No Positive
91829,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms were tired wood work tatty very noisy air con units rooms too hot No water glasses or water in rooms Accessible entrance is into dining room but requires moving furniture to get wheelchair through Big kerb outside this entrance into Shepherds Mews so the long way around is necessary for wheelchairs , The staff were very eager to help and friendly good position tucked away behind Park Lane and Piccadilly clean towels and good sized mugs for hot drinks
91830,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very small and the bath was very difficult to get in to as the room was so small The room was very dated and in urgent need of updating No mini bar And the hearing was stuck on Tv didn t work properly , The location was very good Staff were very friendly and helpful 
91831,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, Great location can t comment too much on the facilities as we checked in briefly before meeting friends and in the morning checking out within 30 mins of waking up Would definitely consider staying again Only criticism is that the room was warm but I have found that in many hotels so maybe it is just me 
91832,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms tiny and cramped a huge air conditioning unit totally DIY with a huge exhaust hose going out the window Apart from this unit being noisy which made it impossible to sleep with it on it also took a good part of the room There is no mini bar or fridge or safe in ANY of the rooms the furniture is extremely old the cover of the one chair in the room was in tatters The general condition of the hotel is not up to standard All this at an exorbitant price Never again will I come to this hotel , Location
91833,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very noisy from the rear of the opposite hotel during the night as the talked very loud while smoking etc , Excellent position for our special Cavalry Parade in Hyde Park on Sunday
91834,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bedroom was a little cramped although small the bed proved comfortable , Enjoyed breakfast each day The food is good I liked the choices available 
91835,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, Very pleasant stay room was a bit small I did not appreciate being woken up after getting back late from my job working in a hospital after agreeing a late check out with Reception 
91836,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bill had to be settled immediately on arrival This is very poor practise You should always pay on checkout AFTER you have enjoyed the stay , Good location in the heart of Mayfair
91837,Park Lane Mews Hotel, At peak time breakfast their isn t enough tables You either had to wait or have your breakfast in the bar lounge where you sunk into the sofas and it was very uncomfortable eating your breakfast, The beds were comfortable We also got let into our room early on arrival The staff were very friendly
91838,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The decor is looking very tired and dated it being a busy hotel we felt it should be maintained more often, The location was excellent the housekeeping staff very pleasant and helpful
91839,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Receptionist seemed a little concerned that we had such a cheap rate from booking com And reminded us that it would be over 200 next time we wanted to stay The room was very small very basic and quite tired The bed springs were coming through the mattress so was quite an uncomfortable night Arrived for breakfast 10 mins before they stopped serving and instead of a good morning we were informed that we had 5 minutes left She seemed annoyed that we had arrived towards the end of service and that she wouldn t be able to clear down as early as she d hoped Poured us both cold coffee and because English wasn t her native tongue it was quite difficult to get it changed Quite an unpleasant experience all round really and wouldn t go back , Location Middle of Mayfair which was nice Nothing else 
91840,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very small rooms but clean No water was provided which is quite bad and should be provided for the price paid Also the girl in the restaurant in the morning was not helpful at all and I found her quite rude as well , Check in was done very nicely The guys in the evening were friendly and made feel welcomed
91841,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Only downside was the early morning wake up provided by the refuse collectors 12 large bins to be emptied under our window at 0700, The staff were excellent
91842,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in an excellent location The hotel was both quiet and comfortable The staff at the hotel were polite and efficient The room was comfortable and clean The breakfast was generous a great start to the day 
91843,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms could use with an upgrade particularly the bathrooms, Great location friendly staff and good value including the breakfast buffet which is not always the case
91844,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location It was comfortable and we enjoyed a very good breakfast This was our second visit and we plan to return next year 
91845,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Paid 189 for the smallest room I ve ever stayed in Twin room but one bed against the wall No room to move around Nowhere to put suitcases which were just overnight bags Loo didn t flush had to call maintenance Came promptly but made fun of us as we d not done it right He had to increase the in flow though Electric sockets are so close to counter top that the wire coming out of the bottom of the plug fouls the connection so we had to hold them in the wall while we charged our phones or used hair straighteners Breakfast bacon sausage was dry very disappointing as I had invited my son in law to join us as he was in town that day , Pavement appeal excellent Reception staff friendly Ambiance good 
91846,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The sofas in the general lounge were badly stained and wood work in halls badly worn The wall paper in the rooms was tiered looking and the net curtains needed a good clean , Friendly and helpful staff good food clean bedrooms
91847,Park Lane Mews Hotel, On arrival at the hotel it was apparent that the standard of hygiene was below that you would expect from the prices of the facility The corridors were smelling of tobacco where guests had clearly been smoking indoors When we got to the room myself and my wife were uncomfortable due to the lack of air conditioning The very old air conditioning in the room had a damp smell that was reminiscent of drainage system The poor climate control was further hampered by the window being screwed closed Breakfast was equally disappointing and the response from the staff was typical of the experience I would not stay in this hotel again and nor would I recommend it to friends ,No Positive
91848,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The fan was a bit noisy so turned it off and opened the window Shower not the best pressure but managed More tea bags would have been good , The homely comfort of the hotel was great Lovely fresh towels and linen Loved the soft pillows Enjoyed the Dining room not too big and the food was very good 
91849,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel looks quite tired and could do with being updated I paid 139 for one night My friend booked shortly before me and paid 259 for two nights She had breakfast included I was advised that I required to pay 16 95 for breakfast I informed a member of staff that all I wanted was tea and toast She then required to speak to her colleague who in turn required to speak to someone else This took some time so by the time she informed me I could pay for tea and toast only my friends had finished their breakfast No discretion was used by the staff and I left the hotel hungry Not great customer service , Good location 
91850,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Old fashioned and shabby in places decor needs updating Slow service when checking in Some room features a bit impractical struggled to plug in hairdryer and phone charger due to impractical socket placement, Location really good and good value for money
91851,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Just needs a little bit of tlc but that s not a complaint , Great location with friendly staff nice and clean everywhere and good breakfast would definitely stay again so it s an 8 out of 10 from us 
91852,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Can t expect every hotel to be perfect in every way although I agree with other guest s reviews the decor should have been changed a long time ago Not sure how good the double glazing is A great location and the hotel was reasonably priced for the centre of London Overall a good hotel experience but it could have been a great experience with a few tweaks and a focus on decor , The staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was tasty and hot scrambled egg warm and boiling water was provided for coffee and tea always important 
91853,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Layout of bathroom a bit on the small side small bath that was very high and could be difficult to get in out , Very nice attentive staff Good breakfast 
91854,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bar staff unable to open or pour champagne without spilling at least half a glass and still charged for the whole thing Very poor Dining room unable to cater for the amount of guests and nowhere to wait apart from 2 chairs right next to the cold buffet , Large comfortable bed Pretty from the outside 
91855,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The weekend price is right The breakfastfirst class Multi purpose staff which means you can wait for lounge service thpugh not for too long and when it comes it is friendly and efficient 
91856,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The photos were Nothing Iike the real thing The hotel was really shabby plastic plants outside a dirty building old cheap tatty furniture wardrobe doors that would not open mini fridge that could nt be opened without being on your knees to plug in and was empty trouser press hanging dangerously off the wall and dirty blinds up the windows Window over looked rear of Hilton hotel who had very noisy deliveries and bin collections , The staff were helpful
91857,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms require refurbishment none of the power points were able to accommodate a plug from Apple as the points to close to the floor They have a big box that used to hold crt tv now they have old fashioned flat screen on top of it , Location was excellent
91858,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, The Hotel was in a perfect location we took in all the sights Watched a show visited Wembley enjoyed a lovely meal in Shepherd Market and finished off with the Marathon Good Breakfast to set us up for the day Staff very helpful
91859,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The internet service went down in the evening before I left Several phone calls to the front desk were met with the response that the router had been reset Only after about three hours did they acknowledge that the service was not functioning Nor was it restored prior to my departure Thus it was not functioning for the final 40 of my stay This was aggravating because I could accomplish no work and there was no solution to be had by the hotel The staff apologized but I know it was out of their hands and in the hands of the cable company who was on sight as I departed , Although rather small as rooms go with somewhat Spartan furnishings I found the bed to be quite comfortable and I found myself spending my off time in the room I enjoyed the breakfast and found it to be varied and tasty The lifts elevators where quite fast 
91860,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms are a bit small and cannot even open suitcases covers Otherwise everything was perfect, Hotel was nice personnel were perfect and always smiling and helpful Location also perfect Breakfast also perfect 
91861,Park Lane Mews Hotel, some d cor a little tired one of the rooms had broken aircon tv didn t work Rooms a bit over heated , Excellent location pleasant staff good service and food
91862,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The Hotels App to order Taxis not working We had to walk to nearest Taxi Rank not fun as disabled to get a Taxi to station Also a bit of a misunderstanding over room numbers meant I carried own ordered hot chocolates to room but this was no biggy Just a bit worrying staff member said our room did not exhist , Bathroom clean and water hot and flow and heat easily managed Breakfast was excellent selection food was hot and service good staff attentive and efficient however not overly impressed with sausage it being a particular food I am particular about but sausage was edible Local But Butchers Own Make is always best
91863,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff couldn t be bothered to help our first encounter on entering the hotel was a young woman who said reception s not my job talk to him The second encounter was no better with the receptionist telling us his day was about to get better because his shift was nearly over He gave us 2 electronic keys and we had to ask where the room was because the receptionist hadn t said On entering the room a double accessible room we found the bed was pushed against the wall and was far from accessible There was mould growing on the walls the paper was hanging off the wall under the window and the carpet was frayed and dirty We returned to reception to ask if there was a more suitable room available and were told I am not authorised to move rooms you ll have to speak to the next person who come onto reception Needless to say we were disappointed as this was a birthday treat and whilst we were not paying the full rate we would have expected better service from a Mayfair hotel , The area it was quiet but very close to Hyde Park and Piccadilly There were numerous restaurants and pubs within easy walking distance too 
91864,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Decor was a little tired and room a bit small, Staff were friendly and breakfast was excellent Excellent location of Hotel next to Shepherds Market and Hyde Park
91865,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Cheapest in the area for a reason unfortunately 169 was still far too much for a cramped room with a tiny double bed and a shower that s shorter than me The shabby look I can deal with but the staff staring at us while we were waiting for friends in the reception bar area was a bit off The breakfast tasted of dust but I imagine it s difficult to find fresh ingredients when you re in central London I guess all of the other establishments have scooped them up Shouldn t moan as that was included in the price and service at breakfast again reminded us that it was cheap , It was very clean 
91866,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel needs a revamp and a damn good clean The reception gives you a sense of gradure and then beyond that it s stuck in the 80 s with dirty worn out furniture and carpets The room was disgusting The carpet was dirty and Ill fitted with peeling wall paper and the valance was stained and disgusting The toilet didn t even flush 169 wasted and the breakfast was equally awful The cooked breakfast was dripping in fat and then I asked for porridge that wasn t inc in the price and I was told I had to pay 4 20 Sadly that was equally awful so I left Hungry and totally disappointed Why didn t I complain The staff s English wasn t t good and i didn t speak their native tongue A truly awful hotel that is masked on this web page by the posh name and location , The location was exactly where we needed it 
91867,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Furniture and finishes could do with updating TV didn t work properly staff friendly and helpful but inexperienced so check in and out was slow , Brilliant location in central London nice warm atmosphere clean room and comfortable bed 
91868,Park Lane Mews Hotel, This is not a glossy business hotel It is rather old fashioned and a little worn The interior needs a touch of paint in places but I found the former charming and the latter acceptable given the overall level of service and the cost , The hotel is situated in a quiet backwater just off Park Lane Piccadilly in an area more interesting than either My single room was compact but great value Clean quiet with a good bathroom It is excellent value for central London and if like me you are a non business traveller and need a convenient base for an event at one of the larger hotels or clubs without paying a silly amount it s perfect Good generous breakfast 
91869,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not much really perhaps the bed was a little small, Good price for the location close to Shepard s Market friendly staff good breakfast including in the price 
91870,Park Lane Mews Hotel, We book a twin room meaning two single beds but when we for there we found a gigantic double bed in our room and squeezed to the side of it was a tiny flimsy creaky and uncomfortable portable single bed which took up all of the remaining space in the room meaning we had no room for luggage at all As a result we had to get the portable bed removed and we had to sleep awkwardly on either side of the double bed The types of bed were the most important part of the room and they didn t get that thing right Absolutely unacceptable Water pressure in the shower head was tiny , Breakfast was good
91871,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Extremely noisy room at the front of the hotel Delivery trucks from the very early hours to the Hilton Hotel over the road Rooms were very dated and not particularly clean The pest control box located in the dining room was rather off putting The beds were very noisy creaky etc and every time you moved they banged on the wall, The breakfast was good and check in was easy it was a cheap hotel but even so
91872,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfastroom is to small, Very good location Shepard s Market is a very nice little village Very good breakfast and helpful staff all over 
91873,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Asked for quiet room Although inside hotel was reasonably quiet didn t expect to hear staff from Hilton laughing talking outside of our bedroom window 15 huge bins being emptied every morning before 7am However in saying this it would not put me off returning It was a nice clean room for the night ,No Positive
91874,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms could do with some fresh wallpaper paint , Perfectly located hotel for west end Rooms comfortable clean and breakfast delicious good selection Staff friendly 
91875,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Nothing, Everything from start to finish of our stay at the hotel was excellent 5 staff very friendly and breakfast superb Can t say anymore
91876,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is falling to pieces I was in 501 I was not told it was a disabled room The carpet needs replacing very quickly filthy and coming up at the bathroom tread I put the chain on the door and tested it the frame came away The shower and bathroom were very old and dirty and battered The disabled shower was vintage There was almost no water pressure The soap dish fell to the floor as soon as I touched it The toiled roll holder fell to the floor as soon as I touched it The toilet was filthy and had not been properly cleaned for a very long time NEVER NEVER AGAIN , staff were friendly Location is great
91877,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was too warm and difficult to cool the controls on the A C were not clear Duvet we thought was rather small for the bed I am over 6 feet tall and it wouldn t cover both ends at once , Breakfast was good the dining staff were attentive friendly and efficient Ground floor lounge was comfortable For our purposes the location of the hotel was excellent 
91878,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Contacting us when taxi was not ordered and we were waiting in reception and had to run in the rain to get one ourselves That was not acceptable , Cleanliness of tables at breakfast and the selection The staff were immaculate and attentive Cups of normal size instead of thick bucket like mugs 
91879,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel s public areas corridors and rooms feel dated and in need of refurbishment , Rooms are tired but adequate with a good sized bed and free wifi Location of the property is excellent 
91880,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast and service at breakfast wasn t great Felt very disorganised and hectic Room was small very dated and bed was poor quality particularly the pillows which were very thin Everything about the room was a bit cheap We couldn t open our window either We got this room on a deal but if we had paid full price I think we would have asked for a partial refund really not up to standard and definitely not 4 stars , Friendly receptionist nice reception area and good location
91881,Park Lane Mews Hotel, My single room was very small and the TV didn t work so after unpacking all my suits etc had to change bedrooms On the first visit to the room my key card didn t work which meant going downstairs again with all my bags to get another one , Great location and excellent food
91882,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was adequate if not a little dated The TV reception was awful Worst of all was the proximity to the trade entrance of the Park Lane Hilton and the noise from 0530 onwards was unbearable The windows are not sufficient to dampen the acoustics Therefore I would be unlikely to select this hotel in future which is a shame because it has enormous potential , The welcome at reception Jade and the excellent location close to Shepherds Market Good value at 116 00 inc Breakfast if there was less noise 
91883,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, I have stayed there before and chose it again It is small quaint but very friendly and cozy and a welcome change from large hotels Location is excellent and the price is good I will come back 
91884,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Front facing room meant being woken up at 6am by the Hilton bins being emptied from the night before a lot of glass bottles etc , The location is great and the staff always around to help 
91885,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The electrical plug sockets in my room were so close to the built in furniture that it was impossible to use them Probably just bad luck , Location is very convenient nice helpful staff breakfast was fine Common parts are worn and need a refurb but the rooms were adequate if only a bit on the small side 
91886,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Heating in Room very old fashioned could not work it out, Very central had free up grade but feel the hotel need s some tender loving care ie carpets shabby need to up grade from shower curtain s to screen more waiting staff on For peak time for breakfast two girls rushed off there feet where unable to give the service for 4 star ratings
91887,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel pictures must be old as hotel looks battered It really is in desperate need of a refurb Expensive for the standard of bedroom accommodation Look around before choosing to stay here as it really is disappointing and not good representation of value for money Rooms are small bathrooms not full size General cleanliness poor I did not take my shoes off in bedroom as carpet was so dirty Had room not been just a crash pad then I would have complained Bedroom furnishings so dated and bashed looks like a run down B B Noisy too guests coming in at all times yes I know it s a hotel paper thin walls and located near lift Avoid Receptionist was not very inviting I must have interrupted her conversion with her colleague to check in Prepare for a short stroll to nearest tube When I requested a taxi at reception I was told to walk to the Hilton Hotel wish I d stayed at the Hilton Returned to hotel around midnight straight in past night manager who did not even look at me I could have been anyone going into lift Breakfast was busy and although looked ok selection all needed replenishing and had to keep asking the 2 waitresses who were so busy for items so I Would not stay here again or recommend Don t be mislead by the pictures Glad that I was solo as embarassed hotel was not my usual standards , Nothing positive was very happy to leave and if I had looked at room before paying I would have left and tried to find somewhere else even paying more Location suited trip although it s not that close to tube used as a crash pad free wi fi but again only used for 30mins so can t comment on reliability or speed are really only positives
91888,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms need refurbishing as they are tired but the prices charged for central London is great value If you want to explore this is a great place to make your base, This is a great hotel just a short walk from Oxford Street Green Park and easily accessible to all central London attractions and sights The staff were excellent The location was superb and the facilities for the price were very good Breakfast was very good with highly attentive but discreet staff Check In was prompt efficient and professional I like this hotel
91889,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Ordered breakfast in our room as my husband had a conference call Breakfast was stone cold No milk for the tea no butter for the toast Eventually a new breakfast came Not too much better Very poor , Lovely pillows Upgraded to an executive room Would not have liked to see the normal room 
91890,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bathroom was very small if the door opened the other way or something that would make it easier to manoeuvre around, Room was lovely bed was comfy breakfast was yummy and location was perfect what more can you ask for 
91891,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Had to wait 15 minutes to be checked in No receptionist Then was given a room where the lights didn t work and was next to a lift On my booking I had put a request for a room NOT next to the lift Rooms are tired and dated Bed very uncomfortable and room was very cold I have stayed here several times before and the only reason I come back is the location If I could find somewhere else I wouldn t come back Having said that the staff are friendly enough , Location

91901,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not the Hotel s fault but noisy neighbours kept us up until about 4 am On complaining staff knew about it but the feeling I got was tough I would use it again but with little sleep it s difficult to give comfort a good score , Great position near to Oxford street Great breakfast

91916,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Got into a dirty bed full of stale breadcrumbs and fingernail clippings at 10 30 at night They moved the room straight away and the receptionist saw it and was really embarrassed When spoke to the management the next day they weren t bothered at all and said they d look into it and call back but nothing they could do They never called back Really poor service and completely inexperienced and such a shame given what a great location this is , Location
91917,Park Lane Mews Hotel, This hotel is really tired and in need of refurbishment Everywhere you look there are marks on the walls tired carpets and damaged wood work In my single room the heating did not work a small plug in rad was put in to compensate but this was not man enough for a winters night and I had to get extra bedding My room had the following faults Curtains hanging off the track did not close window screwed shut and no way to get any fresh air bathroom had stray hairs behind the door and on the bath the underside of the taps has brown scale build up the soap tray was corroded the spy hole in the door was blocked up with loo roll the bath panel was bubbled from water damage the walls had marks and there was no BBC channels only news 24 , staff were lovely the location was perfect for my needs
91918,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, Excellent price combined with perfect location for an event at the Grosvenor The staff were lovely I love this little hotel it s nice to be somewhere so boutiquey right in the heart of all those big Mayfair hotels 
91919,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The central heating is obviously not working a smallish radiator in the room which just about took the chill off Actually I like a cool bedroom so not a big problem No hot water on arrival 5 p m or that evening Television very badly pixillated Engineer came said problem with aerial Breakfast chaotic too many people at once The dining room is not big enough for the number of rooms Bathroom showing signs of wear and tear but there is a small bath always most welcome as alternative to shower , Excellent location and staff are doing their best I understand the hotel will be closed in the summer for refurbishment which is welcomed no doubt the prices will rise 
91920,Park Lane Mews Hotel, 1 aggressive interrogation by staff on our return from the ballet on Friday night including an insistence of taking our key and checking it in their reader 2 a 15 min queue for breakfast clearly no thought given to guests and their needs, Location
91921,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Electric radiator in room felt cheap and possibly dangerous , Generally happy all round Shower was excellent Breakfast was tasty staff were friendly enough 
91922,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff argued with me over something minor Very poor customer service Rooms and d cor was extremely shabby and outdated I felt it disrespectful and shameful that Genting Casino UK that owns this property was quick enough to take clients money but put no effort into making the rooms look any better than a poor 2 Star Staff need training in customer service The price of the room is not that much cheaper than the Marriott in Grosvenor Square where I stayed the remaining nights of my trip Park Lane Mews SHAMEFUL, The only good thing about this hotel is the location 
91923,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room whilst being clean was very worn and not up to a basic standard, The entrance hall reception They allowed me to store my luggage there all day 
91924,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Sloppy cleaning in the rooms Had to ask them to Hoover again wash mugs for inroom tea making Deluxe rooms are too small to fit king size bed There is no room to walk around the bed without bumping into your partner sharing the room , Good location Bed was big Took up the whole room though Staff very accommodating Good for short stay 
91925,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The dirty sock on the floor when I arrived The size of the bed which was tiny for tow people The thin duffet in December which meant I was up all night freezing, Location
91926,Park Lane Mews Hotel, It has been my worst hotel experience ever I have never been so dissapointet the hotel is rated as a four Star hotel and as a luxury hotel but it was so BAD ucly carpets the tapestry was dirty and broken old and very bad mattresses the TV did not work the toilet couldn t flush out One duble room ordinary Price 1650 for three nights I thought I got a very good offer 554 but it was a horrible Price for what we got Behind the hotel is a Managergroup but who are they Selling these rooms at these prices is robbery , Central location 
91927,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is very tired and needs a face lift Some areas were dirty but not daily dirt hence the comment about the need for a facelift The bathroom was clean generally but again in need of attention and refurb Would not recommend the breakfast It was dry due to being a buffet and food left over heat , Location is perfect and the staff are really helpful accommodating and polite Very warm and reasonably comfortable 
91928,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Woken up at 1 2 3 4 am with Xmas party goers returning Understand that this is not the hotel s direct fault but for me it didnt provide the basic ability to get a night sleep some better separation noise abatement might have helped , Boutique hotel Small
91929,Park Lane Mews Hotel, It wasn t that I didn t like anything in particular but I thought my room was adequate at best for the price I paid I was certainly not going to pay 16 plus for breakfast so checked out early and had breakfast elsewhere , The hotel was in a good location
91930,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I could not wait to leave depressing bedroom old broken stained and tatty walls fixtures fittings and bedroom furniture noisy fan in room could not switch it off springs coming through the mattress pillows were old flat and extremely thin less than one inch in thickness , the lady on reception was very kind she was the only saving grace at this otherwise dreadful hotel 
91931,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Plug sockets so close to floor unable to get a plug into them So not able to charge phone laptop , Location value for money comfortable rooms quiet 
91932,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Genting Group that own this hotel are dismissive of guest level of standard This is supposed to be 4 and would hardly pass as 2 Run down and out dated decor poor facilities in the rooms Unprofessional staff with minimal customer service , The only plus is the location 
91933,Park Lane Mews Hotel, This is the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in It is in an alley behind the Hilton and there is 24 hour noise of garbage collection staff on smoking breaks and limo drivers hanging around talking Windows offer no insulation Walls between rooms are paper thin and nonstop sound of doors slamming We had specifically asked for a quiet room so heaven help anyone who had a noisy room Worst night s sleep I can remember in short , Great location decent value
91934,Park Lane Mews Hotel, my tv wouldn t show a picture it was 9 0 pm on Sunday night reception staff came the look at it but nothing could be done until the next morning however when i was checking out the staff must have known but nothing was said and to be honest for the price i paid i didn t push it , the location suited my needs
91935,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Dated decor in room uncomfortable pillows but good sized bed Poor view , Good breakfast but expensive welcoming reception staff size of single room Good location for Piccadilly West End
91936,Park Lane Mews Hotel, VERY NOISY OUTSIDE MOST OF THE NIGHT STAINS ON CHAIR IN ROOM POOR WAITRESS SERVICE AT BREAKFAST FRUIT BOWL RAN OUT HOT FOOD RAN OUT AT BREAKFAST THIS MADE US LATE LEAVING AND FOR RETURN JOURNEY NO ONE ENQUIRED IF ALL WAS SATISFACTORY VERY POOR , GOOD LOCATION

91938,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was tiny, Breakfast was unavailable at due to a kitchen technicality Despite not getting any breakfast the hotel refused to refund the money claiming an email needed to be sent to claim it back 
91939,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel was very clean but from a different era 1980 s Needs some TLC but as its London and great location they don t have to do anything Adequate would be a good summary , Proximity to Park Lane

91943,Park Lane Mews Hotel, the room we stay in was noisy as it was a loft room we could hear the air condition or the heating system also the lift we were on the 5th floor most of the night so it was noisy in that repect, it was close to where we visiting
91944,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rather than go on about it I think you will all know what I mean when I say it was just tired It s about 10 years past its refurbishment date not sure how it scored so highly on earlier reviews , Chose hotel because of its location

91946,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bed was really uncomfortable and the pillows were really thin The kettle leaked It became very noisy outside with lorriers dustbins reversing at 6am onwards , The hotel is centrally located Staff were very friendly and reception area was welcoming 
91947,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Needed a refurb bit tatty, The hotel is a typical old London hotel a little tatty and could do with a referb But for staying a stones throw from mayfair you get what you pay for Staff where really friendly and when we asked to upgrade to a suite they have it to us free of charge Would deffo stay here again
91948,Park Lane Mews Hotel, its quite dated and worn down Heating in room didnt work so they put a heater in, Very cute and quaint hotel in excellent location Breakfast was good but too expensive

91951,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was way too small and very hot The bed uncomfortable breakfast was almost inedible The bacon was burned eggs floating in oil and the poached egg arrived after I d finished my breakfast I then watched the girl who was working in the room opposite pick up a dirty towel from the floor and dry the glasses with it for the bathroom Bath was tiny and didnt drain carpet curtains very dowdy Poor experience in total, Lovely towels and a dressing gown in the wardrobe
91952,Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative, This is a great location Each year we visit for a conference at RAF Club in Picadilly and easily in walking distance Also loved all the great bistros and coffee shops situated so close by Would definitely stay again

91954,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I thought breakfast was overpriced but can t comment on quality as we didn t have it went to Shepherd Market instead for a little over half the price, Location close to Shepherd Market and Green Park is excellent the facilities were perfectly adequate without being luxurious and we had a good night s sleep in comfortable beds 
91955,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bathroom not very modern No minibar, Location for our trip was perfect The room had very good air con and a very comfortable cosy bed Breakfast was lovely and staff very attentive Would stay here again

91957,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I would not stay here Our room was so small you could not swing a cat in it There was no space to put our bags and as the bed was pushed against the wall I had to climb over the furniture to get to it The room was designed for a disabled person but there is no way a disabled person would have been able to move in this room or manage a wheelchair or walking frame in the bathroom We had to pay an extra 25 pounds for an upgrade , The location 
91958,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I booked a delux room I dread to think what a standard room looks like Dirty carpets blocked sink toilet that would not flush properly chipped mugs a reception clerk who was not interested I would not stay there again , Location was great

91964,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Letter of complaint submitted with photographs Disgraceful bedroom lights not working stains on bed extractor fan filthy mobile radiator in room , Location
91965,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The only thing that I thought needed improving was the telephone in my room No matter how I tried I could not get it to work or to let me even phone home When I went downstairs to tell the staff this they told me that they could get this done for fifty Pounds Sterling This was my only complaint but I was not going to pay fifty pounds to get a phone call to my Wife at home Apart from this no other problems A good hotel indeed , The Staff are very good and extremely helpful All very good
91966,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was tired and in need of updating Breakfast was poor with only one member of staff attending where food and plates ran out No handsoap in the room and at 239 per night excluding breakfast it was poor value for money , It was directly behind the Hilton hotel 
91967,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very very unhelpful rude staff one lady and a man During the check in two visitors in front of us were treated badly without any respect Not very well to us either even though they know that we are British couple Next morning whilst waiting for check out they were found to be unhelpful to another visitor who was waiting for breakfast a long time The breakfast was a joke We will never stay there again Very expensive to stay even in London standard The worn out room was just enough for the double bed We almost have to dive into the bed , Location

91971,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms were in a shabby and very run down state Beds were basic and bathroom barely adequate This hotel has plummeted in standard in the last 15 years When we stayed here last it was the Hilton Mews and it was a very high standard small hotel Small is fine when quality is good The breakfast was most disappointing a very basic one star buffet with poor quality food When I last stayed here a very high quality English breakfast was served from the kitchen I don t mind a buffet if it is a high standard but this was rubbish , Good location walking distance to tube and access to Hyde Park
91972,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was a bit run down and a c heating unit seemed to broken This was replaced by a boxy portable unit which took up a lot of the room Room didn t have much in terms of a view and there were few amenities no mini bar no water no complimentary breakfast nobody offered to take up my luggage And after a 12 hour trip I stood at the front desk for several minutes before anyone even made eye contact or welcomed me Room decor and furniture needs to be upgraded , Location can t be beat Quaint hotel
91973,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bedroom Hair in sink plug hole Peanuts under bed plain to see beds had never been pulled out and cleaned Found socks in cupboard Staff did not care a bit asked them to clean room when we went out but never did it Maid knocking on door telling us to check out early so she could clean The room Breakfast a joke took 10 mins to get bacon and sas by that time we had eaten Dont go there , Location 
91974,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I arrived after a long journey keen to get into my room No one at all on duty in reception The restaurant manager did phone for someone but no one responded and I was left hanging around for over 20 minutes until the receptionist finally arrived No apology for keeping me waiting just he was dealing with a guest Clearly they do not have sufficient staff on duty if they leave reception every time a guest needs something After this bad start I spent a comfortable night and the girl on reception in the morning was far more pleasant The evening staff let the place down , Good location comfortable room Nice breakfast 
91975,Park Lane Mews Hotel, No way to change cash in local currency the taxi reservation done with a very expansive limuosine not with normal taxi , The lobby looks nice like to be at home

91981,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is weary and in great need of refurbishment It is only value for money because of its location not for its rooms or facilities , Location is excellent HAKAN works tirelessly in this establishment He is an EXTREMELY VALUABLE EMPLOYEE without whom this hotel just would not be able to operate
91982,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Couldn t open the window for fresh air although there was really good aircon in the room Sometimes fresh air is all you need , This hotel is absolutely wonderful Lovely friendly front desk staff lovely executive king room with amazing bed Will definitely be staying here again it s location is perfect for a London trip 
91983,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Standard rooms are quite small and fairly basic and the bed needed updating but in this neighborhood you don t get too much for your money , The hotel is in a good location near to Hyde Park and within easy walking distance of many attractions cafes and bars It is a nice relatively affordable alternative to some of the swanky places around the area 
91984,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room decor tired Paintwork chipped radiator not working and cover broken Staff failed to organise taxi then did not own up making various excuses , Ideal location
91985,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room size considering price very dirty and worn carpet in room minimal amenities tea coffee etc window sound insulation general bedroom furnishing standard In urgent need of refurbishment , Location and staff friendliness

91987,Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was not a safe in our room Our TV didn t work which was only annoying when we wanted to watch the news a couple of times Our toilet sometimes didn t flush Usually these things would really bother me about the property but the hotel is charming clean and in a good location so I can forgive them , We love the location The rooms while small are all you need for the price and location If the room were any smaller it would have been too small for comfort The rooms are cute even though a bit dated This was the second time that I had stayed in the property 
91988,Park Lane Mews Hotel, everything is old no hot water bad wifi the whole hotel is old and in very bad condition this is cant be a 4 star hotel should be 2 star, location very old hotel dont try it
91989,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Poorly fitted out and shabby rooms The rooms I booked were heavily discounted evidently because I am a genius booker I have a feeling that these rooms are always at a discount so booking com are being disingenuous The full room tariff was 375 for a double for which I paid 144 I can t believe the room we stayed in was worth 375 at any time , Location was perfect for exploring the West end of London
91990,Park Lane Mews Hotel, I felt that the service was perfunctory at best The barman was unwelcoming the champagne was flat and I had to ask to get the usual crisps or olives with the glass of champagne I ordered continental breakfast which cost 17 with a 7 50 room service charge I m used to spending that for a good hotel s breakfast but it was poor One patty of Flora rather than butter and grapefruit juice made from concentrate For a Hilton Hotel on Park Lane albeit the Mews Property rather than the major hotel that is damned poor I would not stay there again An American tourist or any other tourist to the hotel would be very disappointed I also felt that had I been a man in a suit in the bar ordering champagne that the service would have been better , Location
91991,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room keys for the entire hotel sometime work and other times they don t This caused the entire clientele to wAit at the front desk until the staff could get it fixed They tried very hard, Staff was excellent friendly and helpful
91992,Park Lane Mews Hotel, No wifi within the room area moreover no enough space for bags nor for our clothes in closet further more if u don t leave your room before 1300 hrs you receive calls from reception as well as knocking door from house keeping for room cleaning and that was annoying If u have a medication needs to be kept in the fridger u have to use the hotel one beside there was no safe for your personal belonging , Location as well as staff were very friendly
91993,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Can t complain really I guess the only complaint would be that the rooms are quite small but you expect a basic room when paying these prices for such an affluent area of London , The staff were very accommodating and pleasant especially a gentleman named Hafan sorry if I ve misspelt that who recommended restaurants and bars in the area The room was pleasant and had a few home comforts Excellent value when considering the area and surrounding hotels 
91994,Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff attitude Dirty Room smelling of cigarettes dirty curtains We found glasses that previous people have left asked if we could change rooms which they did however that room was even worse When we mentioned that on our departure receptionist answered Don t worry we are closing down Would never stay there again , Location

91998,Park Lane Mews Hotel, This hotel was definitely not up to 4 standard D cor needed revamping Also very noisy at night time at both front and back of the hotel People loitering outside until quite late talking very loudly with no consideration for others trying to sleep Traffic noise was persistent throughout the night , The location was best part of our break Convenient for nearby restaurants and pubs Buses also with easy access 
91999,Park Lane Mews Hotel, The interior of the building is a disgrace An executive double Rm 104 cannot be true as very small with only a single chair , The chatty and helpful staff
