33943,Hotel Astor Saint Honor , We sat down in the bar to have dinner after an exhausting day of travel to Paris We were informed that the chef is on vacation in August but we could have room service We should have gone out as room service was marginal , This was the third time we have stayed at this hotel and have found it comfortable with a great location 
33944,Hotel Astor Saint Honor , The foyer is a bit messy football , I was taken to the train station unbelievable kindness Every one is happy and helpful to step out on my balcony and see the sites of Paris was amazing 
33945,Hotel Astor Saint Honor , horrible hotel hotel was so dirty the wall was stained with anything you can imagine and the cleaning service was horrible they dont really clean up the room just leave more towels there s no airconditioning the hall way was more cooler than the room we had to leave the door opened and what ever Concierge says about condition of tourist spot was not true do not stay here , nothing

33947,Hotel Astor Saint Honor , Nothing This was a most enjoyable stay , Full buffet breakfast Very knowledgeable helpful and considerate staff who spoke excellent English We used the hop on and hop off bus for our main transportation around Paris and the walk from the hotel to the hop on on hop off stop was only a 7 10 minute walk For us a great location 
33948,Hotel Astor Saint Honor , There was a soaked carpet in one room The next room they gave me had a toilet that didn t flush and an area in the room that smelled of urine The elevator jerked badly every time it stopped on the lobby or the floors above , The staff was very kind and tried to make up for the poor condition of the hotel

33950,Hotel Astor Saint Honor , The room we were given on the top floor was really smelly We reported this and were give two glasses of complimentary champagne whilst the technician checked it It apparently was the aircon which he switched off and we were given a heater This was OK in the bedroom but the bathroom was very cold It would have been better if we were given a different room However this did not spoil our stay Food in restaurant excellent and staff very helpful,No Positive
33951,Hotel Astor Saint Honor , This property does not reflect Hilton image at all I stayed in 611 and found the room to be pretty stange interms of convenience access and in general Service was bad and the whole experience wasn t pleasant My colleague who stayed in 303 was earlier directed to a room where there was someone already staying and that too in the middle of the night A serious lapse on part of the hotel reservation team I would say there is a lot to improve upon , Nothing in particular but maybe cleanliness
33952,Hotel Astor Saint Honor , I would rate the Concierge Service 10 10 but in comparison the Front Desk Service was 5 10 they were very pleasant but inefficient and slow , Great concierge service which was extremely helpful with restaurant bookings
