435486,Evenia Rossello, The room was not very well insulated in terms of sound The noise from surrounding rooms carried , Our room was was modern with some striking decorative features The hotel was perfectly situated for exploring Barcelona on foot We were spoilt for choice with places to eat nearby 
435487,Evenia Rossello, With 2 double beds makes the room smaller Lack of dresser space to unpack if you are staying longer , When you first arrive upon check in they supply you with a map of the local area and metro system and local tourist attractions The rooms were very nice and clean The beds were very comfortable and large Overall the place was very nice Very convenient to local attractions Within walking distance to La Pedrera Not a very large hotel which gives it the more personal feel 
435488,Evenia Rossello, The room was not super clean Too much dust on the table wardrobe etc and stained shower curtain , The overall atmosphere of the hotel is good The location is not bad except if you are walking from the beach or from downtown it is a long long way 
435489,Evenia Rossello, I had to leave the hotel at 4 45 in the morning had taken care of all the payments and reserved a taxi a night before Well at 4 30 in the morning the receptionist starting yelling while i was in the taxi pretending why i had not passed thru the reception 4 30 in the morning yelling at a lady Everything taken care before The hotel for the price is nothing special and the services are more of a 3 starhotel than 4 , The bed was comfortable
435490,Evenia Rossello, The room was a little small but I didn t mind so much I wish it had a kettle and coffee so you could make your own drink in the morning , The bed was lovely the room was really clean and I loved the bathroom 
435491,Evenia Rossello, there is a kid playground behind the hotel which can be very noise Room s walls are thin and not insulated which was noise for one night, location and room size
435492,Evenia Rossello, Hotel description claims the rooms are soundproof but in our room on the front of the hotel even on 4th floor we were kept awake into the early hours by the street noise below However we asked to move rooms and the hotel staff were very helpful and moved us to the back of the hotel which was extremely quiet , Very comfy bed Very friendly helpful staff Located in a nice area of the city
435493,Evenia Rossello, The room was really cold and there was no heating at all Actually the temperature was higher outside of the building , The room was very stylish and the breakfast was delicious 
435494,Evenia Rossello, all rooms have a very intense smell of perfume room flavoring too strong for me the personal was very helpful and showed me another room but in the end I went to another hotel because the smell was too strong for me to sleep there got full reimbursement from the staff , nice staff
435495,Evenia Rossello, Nothing , Excellent hotel very friendly helpful staff Brilliant location Couldn t find any faults with this hotel Will defo be back again would recommend to anyone 
435496,Evenia Rossello,No Negative, Everything was perfect The room sooo luxurious the stuff is cool and what is the best is the acces to everything subway restaurants pubs stores perfect choice to spend my birthday 
435497,Evenia Rossello, The rooms were hot and AC not working toilet lid doesnt stay still once pulled up rooms a bit too small for a 4 star hotel Very bad quality shampoo , Comfortable beds good location calm very kind staff clean We asked to change rooms because we didnt have a bathtub in the one they initially got us and they agreed we asked to keep our luggages after check out and they agreed 
435498,Evenia Rossello, Unfortunately it was friday ans saturday and there was a bar in the street next to the hotel that was very noisy , Location rooms and staff were all very nice

435500,Evenia Rossello, a bit too far away from the main attractions for me personally no tea and coffee facilities in room we were only here one night so did not get chance to experience much here, clean and tidy comfortable staff were helpful
435501,Evenia Rossello, Nothing best hotel , The Staff are amazing and this stay was my second at the hotel I would like to thank Michle who work at night shift at the reception he asked the house keeping to clean up my room before cleaning the reception at 6am and he checked me in at 6 15 am without any additional charge And the housekeeper she refused to take a 10 tip I tried but she refused again and she said no no it s my job Also the location is perfect it s a safe street at all time and I really mean that it is in a very safe location you can walk in the street at any time You will feel at home in this hotel All the rooms are new furnished and renovated 
435502,Evenia Rossello, Air conditioning could have been more effective didnt eat breakfast there as it seemed very expensive compared to nearby bakeries and cafes , Comfortable room spotlessly clean Very close to a lot of good restaurants Free safe in room 
435503,Evenia Rossello, The staff is not so friendly though this is quite common in Barcelona There was an unpleasant smell coming from the pipe in the bathroom The breakfast could be richer considering this is a 4 stars hotel , The hotel is located in a residential area very close to one of the most beautiful part of the city The room is clean Though the room is not very big the bathroom is spacious and equipped with bidet
