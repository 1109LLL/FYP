178153,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, A bit noisy in the streets there is a few restaurants and clubs near by and they keep it going in to the early hours of the morning in the weekends Recommend ear plugs , Quite spacious for Paris excellent location if you arrive by train close to Gare de Nord and Gare L Est Double room for family was actually two connected rooms with two bathrooms VERY friendly receptionist from Manchester let us keep the luggage in the hotel after check out Hotel felt safe 
178154,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The area where it is located is very vibrant with a lot of activity specially at night but sometimes it did not feel very safe Maybe that is just Paris in general , The rooms were small but comfortable and very clean 
178155,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Internet facility had restricted access no waatsapp connection to talk only sms Room was too small Its in a busy area, Proximity to public transportation and restaurants Friendly staff Good bedding set 
178156,Best Western Aulivia Op ra,No Negative, Location is very good Attention on the Front Desk awesome and Room clean and functional just a little bit small Highly recommended for couples or friends
178157,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, I had a little bit of difficulty to find the location from the Gare du Nord station But I finally found it after asking a number of people on the way, The staff was really helpful and nice The room was clean and comfortable It s also close to restaurants and at a walking distance to train metro station
178158,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Some facilities didn t work that well For example barely anything came out of the taps and the lights we too bright couldn t be dimmer and flashed very brightly when turned on or off Not the best value for money Slightly rough area , Hotel manager was very friendly easy to get to from CDG Airport and easy to get to main attractions 
178159,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The toilet was so close to the wall that you had to sit at an angle In our opinion it had been put in the wrong way in the bathroom , The bed was really comfortable and the shower was lovely 
178160,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, I didn t like that the walls were so thin that you can hear everything from the elevator opening and closing to the talking, The rooms are small but very comfort The bed was also very comfy and the bathroom was very beautiful and clean The stuff cleaned up the room every day with new towels and everything 
178161,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Small room and small bathroom also very cold unfortunately the heating system does not work Unpleasant , Clean room and hotel spaces also situated in arrondissement 10 Nice breakfast and lot of locals pubs restaurants area was full of young people pleasant atmosphere for spending a relaxing evening and eating a tasteful traditional dinner Hotel is situated at walking distance from Notre Dame and is very close from metro station Nice people all around 
178162,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Ask for an inside room as others could be noisy during the night as immediate area is lively, Great location Audrey on reception was brilliant and really helpful with lots of ideas of places to visit which enabled us to plan and action packed weekend Lots of bars restaurants within walking distance and metros nearby tontravel further around the city 
178163,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Temperature was a little low We couldn t find a way to tune it to our liking Also absence of a mini fridge didn t allow us to keep some water or juice refridgerated , Size of the room bed and bathroom was to our satisfaction Extra points for the artistic additions on the walls 
178164,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Proximity to car park neighbourhood not the best, Quirkiness of the hotel proximity to metro friendly greeting well presented rooms reduction in car park fees
178165,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Nothing not to like everything was great , The location was perfect to access all of Paris and the room was well sized and beds very comfy Staff extremely helpful and polite too The staff went out of their way to make my boyfriend feel special by leaving a little gift and wishing him happy birthday The nice little touches made our first trip to Paris very special 
178166,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, When the waitress asked what we wanted in the way of drinks we asked for Tea What we got was a cup of hot water and no explanation of where the Tea bags were So i asked and the Tea was not good I found the taste of the Tea very week and so did my husband He even put 2 more bags in and it was still tastless The waitress was not very friendly Also the resceptionist when told of a problem with pillows and a dirty sink behind the bar was not happy to be told th se things So we left on a bit of a sour note , The situation of the hotel was good not far from the gare du Nord And chez Flo Breakfast was good except for the drinks
178167,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The room is quite small there were no separate shower gel and shampoo Room was quite cold were there during extreme winter time , Easy to check in and out normal Western European hotel Has German TV stations 
178168,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, I made hot tea and thwre would be a film in the cup on the top of the water I cleaned the cups out but it would return again which leads me to believe the the hot water brooer had not been cleared in some time Also the drinking cups in the bathroom were stained at the bottom in brown So I was hesitant to use them The next day the spon I used for my tea was not replaced with a clean one , I loved the staff The room was perfect The location was amazing You couldn t ask for a more wonderful place to stay while on vacation Thank you so much 
178169,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Daughter s request for a cot had not been actioned and her partner had to construct it himself at 12 30 am , Good location easy walking to centre and Montmartre 
178170,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, I used the hotel computer set up for guests and was frustrated by the French keyboard I didn t know all keyboards were not alike This is not the hotel s fault just another travel experience , The accommodations were comfortable The staff was very helpful 
178171,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Location was not good People around doesn t disturb you but makes you feel unconfortable Breakfast at hotel was expensive , Close to metro stations There are markets cafes near the hotel The room was clean but very small You cannot control the AC 
178172,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Sewer odor in the room due to insufficient flushing of the shower and lavatories Small problem that gives a bad first impression Another minor inefficiency in a three days occupancy was not refilling the room s coffee supply Electric light controls are somewhat cumbersome Perhaps some graphic indication may help , The superb attention by Reception personnel Small and comfortable room properly clean and equipped 
178173,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The rooms are extremely small The area is maybe one of the dirtiest and worse areas of Paris There was no fridge and it was really hard to move inside this tiny space , Nothing
178174,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, We lived in room nr 203 which is very small so it is difficult to turn over there While booking there should be information that it is SMALL room The lady serving breakfast does not speak any English she cannot even understand espresso with milk On the last day there was no scramble eggs and fruit salad , Very nice area to stay Maybe not the cleanest one but full with shops bars Bisstro s where you can drink and eat even late at night Nice and helpful staff at the reception Good breakfast amazing baguettes 
178175,Best Western Aulivia Op ra,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and friendly I asked for a couple things more coffee towel etc and they always had a smile and jumped right to it for me The location was central to a lot of the sights while being reasonably prices There s a bike rental stand just outside the front door which was VERY convenient 
178176,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Check in took longer than expected when we arrived late night Narrow lift and corridors just 1 adult and bag could fit in at a time , They had a free luggage room and the rooms we stayed in were bigger than I imagined 
178177,Best Western Aulivia Op ra,No Negative, Rooms very clean and comfortable The staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome The reception staff were very knowledgeable and helped us with directions on the metro The metro is a super way to travel Will use this hotel again 
178178,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The room was quiet fine but quite small But for the price and considering we were in Paris it was just fine , Very clean and friendly helpful staff 
178179,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, the house keeper kept on knocking on the door cause they wanted to clean the room and i was not done dressing but i had to open , the staff were friendly and helpful 
178180,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Small rooms plastic doors as if you were entering some wardrobe poor breakfast for 15 never ever mini lift mini floor generally I have no clue who gave them 4 stars I would rate this hotel with max 2 stars especially for the weird staff for me no go next time but maybe somebody likes such minimalistic rooms, location in very close proximity to centre BUT see above
178181,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The area was a bit run down and if you went left towards the nearest Metro station you felt relieved to get there without being accosted Once there it was OK though and quick to get to central Paris with only one change , The young lady receptionist was very friendly and helpful Although the breakfast area was small the choice of food was good and included a hot option 
178182,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Price for breakfast was quite high 15 Euro There are many brasseries around where you could get a cheaper and also well tasting breakfast My room did not get much day light due to the small window However the lights were very strong so it was not a big issue , Very central and close to important metro stations and the Paris Est train station Additionally there are many bars restaurants etc around Good room service and friendly staff The room was clean and tidy the bed was comfortable Airconditioner to choose the preferred temperature 
178183,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, No fridge in the room expensive breakfast, Very clean comfortable bed good location near metro station excellent staff really helpful lots of restaurants and food stores near felt very safe
178184,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Rooms were small, The staff was very nice Hotel was near the subway Facilities in bedroom and bathroom were excellent even a bluetooth wireless speaker Breakfast was good 
178185,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, , Very good housekeeping Everything was superclean when I arrived and even though I was out late daily i always found my room cleaned with fresh towels and complementary goods renewed Area is very lively and up and coming with lots of young people and hip and happening bars and restaurant Excellent location even said by locals 
178186,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The only thing I found that the hotel was the room was a little bit small and the shower room , Facility was excellent the staff was very friendly very informative the cleansing this was very high would definitely recommend it to family and friends 
178187,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Too much noise form the cleaning room service sence very early in the morning 8 am , price cleanliness close to subway staff very friendly close to many good restaurants
178188,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The nearest metro is Ch teau d Eau which is in an area that feels a bit diffrent, Staff was nice Room was clean and kept clean every day good restaurants in a walking distance
178189,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Rooms were on the small side but other than that no problems , Charming and helpful staff provided a warm welcome The hotel itself was nicely presented we will definitely stay again 
178190,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Toilet door didn t shut Alot of people hanging around streets outside hotel and metro by the hotel , Close to metro l Offered breakfast late night bar 
178191,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Bathroom was a little bit small but for Paris it was fine Everything else was great , The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was nice and clean with a nice view onto the courtyard Comfortable bed Grocery store over the road which was very handy There were heaps of restaurants around the area and a metro stop close by Would definitely recommend 
178192,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Light switches just turned on and off random light with each click , Comfy bed location was great very near metro line felt like an intimidating neighbourhood but turned out to be fine no hassle Cheaper food and drink near hotel as it s outside Paris centre 
178193,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The bathrooms could have been bigger, The staff were very friendly Especially Mr Morris he was just Awesome and already ready to help in directing you wherever you are going
178194,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Breakfast although decent should have been included in the price Also the regular price is WAY too steep look for 60 70 discounts Room walls are on the thin side so somebody taking a pee at 7 am will most probably wake you up , Great location if someone likes the lively atmosphere of Saint Denis and Xme Arr in general nicely and probably recently renovated interiors Good price when discounted 
178195,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Very small room with extremely limited facilities and grossly overpriced for what it offers 178 per room per night breakfast NOT included Surely this cannot be ranked as a 4 Star hotel Complete disappointment in comparison to other Best Western hotels I have stayed in with a similar ranking Never again , The Night Porter was extremely friendly 
178196,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, At first it was a bit confusing to use the light switches so helpful to know how to operate it at check in , The location was perfect for our trip Even though the area near the metro seemed a bit rough it was not scary The hotel manager Maurice was exceptional he gave us useful tips to find our way around and helped us with keeping things in the fridge too 
178197,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Shower would need a bit of maintenance as water goes all over the place from the shower head it took me ages to work our the lights in my room and couldn t find a way to switch all light off to sleep for 5 minutes , The decor staff breakfast rooms are clean and well decorated modern 
178198,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, I think rating this Hotel by Star is a very bad joke Who rated this place with 4 star really I can t give even one star to this place terrible locality as if you are in a middle east country full of prostitutes small room and terribly small WC Without any facility like micro wave or refrigerator which is necessary for a 4 star hotel But I should add that the players were very polite and helpful , Only the staff were polite and helpful 
178199,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The room was surprisingly small but perhaps that s how things are in Paris , The location is very convenient walking distance to two major train stations 
178200,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The lift is tiny and a little scary for those who are claustrophobic Other than that nothing bad to report, The breakfast was amazing and the staff were very friendly Both day and night staff were fantastic
178201,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Very bad neighbourhood Too noisy especially at late night Room walls are like paper you can hear the person breathing in the next room Room doors are extremely noisy you wake up when someone closes the room door ,No Positive
178202,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The room service took 45min the first night for a club sandwich which was just a little to long The lift was quite small but I was happy to take the stairs , The lady in reception was really great and accommodating The room was comfortable and great for a solo traveler The metro was close by and a main line so you were only 10min from NotreDame Would recommend and stay again 
178203,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Location not for everyone Tiny rooms Definitely not 4 stars , Close to subway metro Very clean Friendly staff If you need a roof above your head this hotel can be your home for a few days Probably worthy if you get the room s for a discount or promotion 
178204,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, Horrible room too tiny AC working too loudly Hot water after 10 minute Internet turtle speed Lift magnificently big The reception attempted to withdraw the price twice , Nothing 
178205,Best Western Aulivia Op ra, The rooms are very small but I think all the paris hotel rooms are small This may be a bit annoying , Hotel staff service and location is wonderful It has a working life too I would highly recommend it
