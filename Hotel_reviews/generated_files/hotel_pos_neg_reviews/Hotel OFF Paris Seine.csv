256618,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Unfortunately i myself am not very good at walking and it is too far from everything if you are slightly challenged So taxis are a must as nothing was in walking distance for me The hotel was extremely overpriced charging top rate hotel prices for their drinks etc I dont mind paying for quality quantity but sadly this was not the case here The sinks in our room did not hold water as the plugs didnt work We reported this someone came and had a look but nothing was done about it and it was extremely frustrating immediately opposite from us across the water was a 24hour nightclub and boy oh boy did you need the ear plugs that they supplied in the room Not only the music thuding but the language from some of the unsavoury characters This Hotel is suited to people on a business trip and only having to stay a night It is for the young and trendy and those who want to stay up all hours , The room we had had a lovely view over the water which was very busy and lots to watch The decor of the room although not to everyones taste bright oange fixtures walls ceiling soft furnishing bath sinks all BRIGHT orange we likeed it 
256619,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, The only thing that was a hassle would be that the taxi driver was unable to drop me off in front of the hotel so he dropped me off curb side on the street and I had to walk down the stairs with a hand full of luggage This would not deter me from coming back again though just get a cab driver that knows what he s doing, The staff were very friendly and accommodating helpful when asking how to get places or the best things to do around town The actual hotel is such a hotspot during my stay a movie was being filmed there which was quite riveting to watch It s very easy to travel by metro from this location seeing as the metro station is located directly across the street and the hotel can provide you with maps that are very informative I would recommend this hotel to others and I definitely will be back in the near future 
256620,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Lighting in room was very poor shower in room needs looking at we didn t book at disabled room so why the shower cant have a small lip step in order to stop the water running out is beyond me 19 euro s each for breakfast don t bother just head out to one of the many restaurants cafes around Lots of reviews mentioned noise from night club didn t really hear that much but the amount of young people hanging around outside the hotel until 3 4am is quite unnerving We came in late from a concert 1 30am and was surprised and a little intimidated by the groups Staff were ok efficient didn t encounter any of prior mentioned issues with rudeness or arrogant nature nor did we encounter a enthusiastic welcome or did you enjoy your stay departure all a little non plus You pay a 100 euro deposit on arrival which you are then told will be processed overnight on day of departure till no sign of this and no reply as yet to follow up email I have seen this mentioned before in reviews , Unique hotel with it being on the water beds very comfortable near to stations 
256621,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Not as cool or as big as the photos make it seem online Breakfast was not great not many choices staff was invisible I saw two guests walk out furious over the what was offered for breakfast at 10 am , The jar of gummies at reception 
256622,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, The bar area becomes a late night club which is just noticeable in the bedroom but the biggest problem was the boat on the opposite side of the river which had a rave every night we were there but the ear plugs provided by the hotel probably for their own noise did not get close to cutting out the noise so we had no sleep The answer is probably go and join in but it did not finish until 8 9am the next day , A well equipped but compact room in a fabulous setting overlooking the river but be aware of the noise 
256623,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Not many things happening around the property on land in the river is wonderful, Dinner at the bar with the view of the river boats passing by was great
256624,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Service was not at all up to standard slow or no service at all in the bar reception lots of dust in the room Breakfast until eleven but at ten half of buffet was empty , The concept and design of the boat good location
256625,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, It could be noisey in the evening although earplugs were provided It was expensive for drinks in the bar , The location was excellent and convenient for transport The rooms were modern and clean 
256626,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Other reviews have mentioned the rocking motion of the hotel with the river and that s accurate The bigger issue is noise from the nearby neighbors It s not a good sign when the check in staff offer earplugs to help you sleep , This is a very attractive hotel and in a very convenient location It is a very short walk to the Gare d Austerlitz which makes it easy to get around It is also a fairly short walk to Notre Dame and Ile Ste Louis If you want a morning run the river path is really great 
256627,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, It s not really a negative but the hotel is in a bustling fun area of the city with lots of people out drinking nearby on warm summer nights The rooms are also very intimate with glass fronted showers by the bedside so if you want an early night and don t like your travelling companion it s probably not the place , The perfect hotel for lovers Get a room with a river view the dock view rooms don t afford much privacy and the small clean and intimate rooms and showers are made for a passionate visit to Paris It s unique charm would be lost on solo travellers or friends This hotel is sexy and intimate and wonderfully sound proofed and cosy We never heard a peep from anyone else and it often felt like we were the only guests Good value for money you could spend a lot more money on somewhere with far less character We had read on trip advisor comments about poor service and difficulty finding hotel via uber but had no issues ourselves Will be the first place I look to book if back in Paris 
256628,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, The area outside the hotel seemed to be a drinking area for young people, Excellent concept Right across the road from the train station Great staff at the reception
256629,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, We stayed here as a special occasion For the price of the hotel we were disappointed The staff were not very helpful at explaining how the hotel and facilities worked The Air Con was broken and no alternative measures were taken to make the room less hot e g offering a fan or offering us a complimentary service for the inconvenience The staff didn t really apologise for this and only explained the issue when we arrived in the room The temp was 37 degrees on the night we stayed Also the shower temperature stat didn t work and the USB controls in our room didn t function A welcome sheet in the room explaining how the room facilities work and the opening hours of the bar and pool etc would have been appreciated We felt a bit lost and didn t feel very welcome The bar area is very chic but we waited a very long time to be served at the bar which is expensive and gave up on our second round of drinks as we waited over half an hour for them to arrive With some tweaks this could be a very good hotel but the customer care needs some attention , The room is stylish and compact The dip pool in the bar area is a good addition 
256630,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, We had no air con and had to be moved at midnight Waited for ages for someone to sort this about half an hr in reception with bags at midnight Check in not until 4pm although we were told we could check in early Staff rude and unfriendly No bar snacks not even olives Broken air con and no advice of this when checking in Hotel is packed with non resident guests having brunch so you can t get near the pool area even though you ve paid to stay at hotel Outside area is rough and noisy Many gangs sitting outside and so much broken glass outside from bottles really off putting Staff don t reply to emails as I have tried to contact them to get a refund on a taxi which they promise and no response Really unhappy customer ,No Positive
256631,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, 4 stars Hotel for the concept but 3 stars as an Hotel bacause the Staff Wasnt really kind and we had housekeeping walking in the room without knocking on the door So the service was poor for me They didnt really take care of their customers , The concept the view and the design of the Hotel 
256632,Hotel OFF Paris Seine,No Negative, 1h30 in the night when we try to check in There is a nightclub at ne side of the hotel and there was a party at the other side Party people were with their loud music under the bridge dancing and having a party outside the club Reception did not all police Visitors of hotel were at the reception complaining Airco in the hotel did not work People complaining of headache and could not open window because of the loud music Temperature was 30C in the day Not possible to stay Worst hotel we ever experienced and lots of others wanted to leave in the morning We left the hotel and had to look for other hotel Finally could go to sleep at 4 in the night Excellent stay in Pullman Hotel with excellent service 
256633,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, The room was a little hot I wouldn t recommend getting a standard room because they are pretty small But the suites are very big and a good price , Very clean and comfortable bed Location is good for younger adults 20 29 Beautiful location and nice small pool 
256634,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, They asked my mobile phone upon check in I guess for marketing purposes and with a cheap excuse I refused They shouldn t do it It s a bit isolated next restaurants are 15 min walk IMPORTANT most of the rooms have a problem with the windows They have double windows BUT they don t seal properly So it s very noisy inside with traffic noise I changed room just to find exactly the same problem in the new one They must fix it , Central location next to Gare de Lyon Great views if you take rooms with river view Nice deco Modern and comfortable 
256635,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Unfortunately there is a nightclub directly across the river It opens on Friday evening and goes 24 hours a day until Monday morning We stayed Friday and Saturday nights Windows very well insulated but you could feel the thump of the music bass line All Night Long The second night we didn t even notice it though If you stay Monday to Thursday no issues at all , Excellent property literally floating right on top of the Seine river Train station across the street and a short walk to the Batobus river taxi hop on hop off Close to all the major attractions Gorgeous hotel room design with an upscale chic ambiance Good lounge with wall to wall windows with views up and down the river A word of advice pay the extra and get a river view Absolutely fabulous experience 
256636,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Zgomotul de la trenuri The noise of trains , Priveli tea din camer de la etajul de sus cu privirea spre r ul Sena The view from the room upper deck river view 
256637,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, No oxygen in the room poor air quality , Nice place amazing view nice food sweet staff Location on the river that was amazing The location around was not amazing but it was OK we planned on walked a lot anyway 
256638,Hotel OFF Paris Seine,No Negative, A very clean and modern hotel located beautifully on the river with exceptionally helpful and polite staff Well connected with all public transport networks We stayed for 4 nights and were as happy as we could be with the accommodation 
256639,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, The location is really not amazing as there is not much around and it is quite a business area However you are in front of the train station and can go everywhere with metro bus train , The bed was amazingly comfy and the room very nice You get a smartphone to use during your stay at the Hotel with lot of information about Paris and unlimited call Amazing for foreigners The bar has some cool cocktail too
256640,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Room was too cold When we arrived there were countless electrical heaters in reception After few hours I realized why Heating isn t good enough for winter Don t go to this hotel in winter time , Nice interior design 
256641,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, They charged me extra money for the usage of the mini bar which I did not use at all I have contacted them many times but they did not give me any reaction There was no parking available for by car and I had pay extra money for the parking ,No Positive
256642,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, I thought the breakfast was very poor if I am honest You pay 19 EUROS to have such a limited selection i have paid 16 EUROS in much more expensive hotels and the breakfast was incredible You just didn t know what to have Was very disappointed in this if I am honest Also we had to wait ages for some warm cooked food as they had forgot to order some bits , The whole setting is lovely and so is the architecture just the entire concept to be honest Bed was very very comfortable and loved the changing lights in the shower 
256643,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Maybe chilly but we expected that because Chinese New Years is a damned chilly time of the year to travel in the Northern Hemisphere anyway , We live in China so we were really excited when the staff was so kind to us and smiled and helped us with our room and told us where the hairdryer was located We had read the earlier reviews and yes it was a bit chilly but we slept perfectly and we re really impressed by everything we experienced and since we Americans aren t your typical entitled yanks we were super polite to the staff and they in return let us enjoy some much needed coffee in the morning No Brainer A hotel in the river on a barge in January anywhere in Northern Europe just might be a bit nippy but that s what travel mates are for So if you re a whiner you might find some things to cry about but sleeping on the Seine about a five minute walk from the station and downtown Paris is a must on everyone s bucket list About the people who whined about the breakfast any breakfast over 10 Euro should be avoided at hotels when you can get great stuff in supermarkets and eat them on the privacy if your own room Thanks to the staff for such a wonderful stay and give this place a whirl because you won t regret it 
256644,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, The staff were rude and unhelpful The restaurant was closed but guests hadn t been notified in advance no food was on offer The boat is located on a dodgy road by the Seine that s hard to find by car , The rooms were well designed and comfortable It was great fun staying on a boat 
256645,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Breakfast was mediocre When you re in France you expect at least a decent croissant , Quirky location and a little bit different as it s actually on the river The views are amazing Comfortable beds amazing lighting and attention to detail ear plugs provided for example It was really quiet much quieter than other hotels I ve stayed in Lovely staff and very welcoming
256646,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, The heating in our room did not work the staff did not really make an effort to get this resolved We got a small underpowered portable heater to heat a room , Nice and modern great location on the Sine and close by the train metro station You get a smartphone you can use during your stay with unlimmited internet access ideal for helping you with google maps when you re out and about 
256647,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, It was very very cold The heating was not working In December And the staff did not had adequate professional training , The rooms have a great view to Siene 
256648,Hotel OFF Paris Seine,No Negative, I liked absolute everything The little swimming pool was definitely a bonus and the staff very nice and caring The food also amazing and the room cozy and beautiful decorated to the detail and very practical
256649,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Heating in the room did not work well Nightclub across the water goes on until late morning , Quirky interesting concept Welcoming and friendly staff who took time to interact with guests
256650,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Room was a little cold Quite small with not a lot of storage Wouldn t recommend staying for more than a couple nights , Cool hotel nice location Great for a couple nights stay 
256651,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, I can honestly say there wasn t anything I didn t like, The staff was amazing and we accidentally block are safe some one came down anduring sorted it out within minutes everything was clean warm welcoming Defo will be coming back
256652,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, We stayed on a Saturday and directly across the water is a disco boat the rave lasted from when we checked in at 5pm and was still ongoing when we left at 10am Sunday morning The train bridge next to the hotel is also quite noisey but you can t expect anymore from a city hotel , Location was good and nice views over river
256653,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, There was loud music on the Saturday night from a nightclub or party nearby It didn t bother me too much but just something to be aware of if you will stay here on the weekend , This is such a unique and lovely hotel The staff were so friendly and welcoming I will definitely stay here again next time I m in Paris 
256654,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, the temperature in the corridor was cold in the room to Once we came back from a night out the room warmed up , Nice decor different to other hotels I stayed in on the water opposite Concrete club so you can just cross the bridge to get there Allowed us to do a late check out for free Friendly staff They also provided ear plugs for any guest who doesn t venture out in the evening as the bass from the Funktion one sound system in Concrete crosses the river to the hotel 
256655,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, The hotel is surrounded by water which is the cause of many mosquitoes So don t open the window of your room too long , The room is plenty of nice little extra s like the lights of which you can change the colour The bed is great Also the staff was amazingly friendly We had some misfortune in Paris something the hotel had nothing to do with so they had no obligations to help us Yet they did everything they could and helped us out in an incredible way Not only did they try to find a solution for what we asked but they also thought of little things that could make it a little bit more bearable for us To the staff that was working on the night of the 18th of Oktober thank you so much for your kindness again 
256656,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, Personal visually looks frendly but professionally to be better Didn t return cash 100 which was paid as guaranty was trying to get to times payment due to misunderstanding between shifts Required taxi to airport was not booked again misunderstanding between shifts Small double room beds Limit of TV channels , Location wonderfull very original interior 
256657,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, This area is full of nightclubs and partying so if a good sleep is on your agenda bring ear plugs , It is a great location for a fun summer vacation in Paris It is not your normal Paris experience 
256658,Hotel OFF Paris Seine, The whole experience was amazing Nothing was amiss and the personnel is really friendly and reactive to your every need I arrived around midnight and asked for fresh water and they brought it to my room right away The next morning I had guests and they were able to share a delicious breakfast with me since the hotel has a non resident open policy I fully recommend this choice be it for business or leisure Worth the price , Heavenly comfy bed amazing views over the Seine beautiful bar lounge overlooking the pool silent surroundings no traffic since no roads while absolutely in the thick of Things Fashion museum gare de Lyon only 5 min on foot One of the best spots to stay now in Paris
