229326,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, n a, The staff were friendly and approachable and very helpful Rooms were lovely and area was central to most things Breakfast was great and lots of choice 
229327,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The safe deposit was broken and the district a bit dirty , Good location in terms of public transport access Nice breakfast Tasty coffee and croissant The room is clean and quiet AC works perfectly 
229328,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, We had to move rooms in the middle of the night on our first night because the shower was not draining and was flooding our room originally they tried to get us to stay in our own room and use staff facilities to shower which was obviously unacceptable In our second room there was no hot water so we all had cold showers The staff did not offer apologies or an alternative for this It is a bit of a rough area with ladies of the night outside the front door at night The wall outlets are old fashioned so we could not use our international adapters to charge our phones or use any electronics They did not provide shampoo or conditioner in the bathrooms and we had to call down for clean towels that they were reluctant to provide , Beds are comfy A couple of the staff gave us great recommendations for restaurants in the area 
229329,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Location is great but located in an area where at night it gets a bit interesting If you have kids with you and you are coming back to the hotel after dark you may have to answer a question or two about who those ladies are on the street and why they are so friendly to dad as you walk by Don t get me wrong we never felt unsafe though any time day or night in the hotel or around the area of the hotel and actually it made for a good laugh or two Folks it s Paris at night you know that going in so deal with it My only suggestion for the hotel itself is to add an ice machine and ice buckets to the hotel or put small fridge in each room From that one sentence you know I m American I can t help it I like an ice machine Bottom line is it is a great place to stay for the price and yes we would stay there again , Hotel was fine accommodating and comfortable Air conditioning excellent in room and common areas for our stay in hot July Free coffee at all hours in lobby Staff excellent friendly and very helpful I would stay there again with my family Good food all around the area for all budgets Right next door to a Carrefour so very easy to get groceries beer wine wine wine cheese cheese cheese baguettes baguettes baguettes to buy quickly for a relaxing happy hour of your own in your room before you go out again for dinner I cannot stress how important it is to be that close to a good Metro stop The photo is a view of across the street from our room 
229330,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The door to our hotel room had been kicked in at some time not a very welcoming sight The area not a place I would choose to stay in again The room size was ok but not what we expected for a Best Western Shabby in need a decor upgrade Two sachets of tea and milk not replenished on our second day Shower mat taken away and not replace Front door should have been locked after 23 00 this was not the case Street was noisey but we had ear plugs so that didn t matter to much All in all not to impressed shame I cancelled the other hotel and not this one Sadly didn t take photos, Bed was comfy shower worked and water pressure was good Breakfast was ok 
229331,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, I booked what they described as a family room picture showed what was described but when we got there holy crap far from what was shown This room looked like a storage room or some kind of utility room made up to look like a family room It was hideous There was a glass door with crash bar handle that led out to a stairwell at the back of the property Did not feel safe When I checked in there were light fixtures missing so the bulbs were exposed wallpaper peeling off the wall and the carpet was stained The air conditioning was not blowing well even though they swear it was a maximum shape I sent an email to the manager after the first night and she did respond back and talked to me at the property but did not off any discount or anything to compensate for the shoddy room The desk clerk I first made my complaint to was rude and very unconcerned about my issues The location is very busy and suspicious people hang out there I don t understand how this hotel can be rated 4 stars and have short comings like this The hotel blamed Booking for the pictures I informed them that the pictures were from the property not people who upload I paid way too much for this nasty room and would ask that Booking ensure the hotels are representing the properties accurately It doesn t make sense for people to travel far to enjoy themselves and be subjected to an uncomfortable room I want a refund , I did not like anything about the hotel The worst Best Western I ve ever stayed at 
229332,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The area was a tiny bit bit edgy but it was so close to the sacre coeur and the metro stations that it didn t matter too much, The free coffee tea ws a nice touch and the staff were super friendly 
229333,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Asked for an iron at reception was met with a shrug by receptionist who replied they didn t know where they were No offer to find one Couldn t care less attitude Room decor tired and in need of redecorating Cupboard doors right up against bed so wouldn t open properly , Location is great and the day receptionist was lovely but that it 
229334,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The room was not clean at all In the bathroom we did not have soap and the shower was very dirty There was dirt everywhere You cannot go outiside after 8 pm looks dangerous Not a four star hotel two stars maximum I would not recommed at all ,No Positive
229335,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, This hotel is in a dangerous area Our room was left open by cleaner luckily never had all our stuff stolen The community needle bus pulled up outside and all the local prostitutes got on to get their condoms needles and blood pressure Check There was a lot of dodgy activity and noise all night and we were nearly mugged avoid this property at all costs it s just not worth the risk ,No Positive
229336,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Shower drain blocked in first room so moved to another room shower drain also blocked in that room as well Need to review plumbing at the hotel, Friendly helpful staff
229337,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The shower did not drain and that basically ruined our morning as we needed to change rooms and eventually hotels The staff was extremely apologetic and did everything in their power to help us I don t blame them but the hotel needs to fix their drains , The location was decent as the Bascilica was nearby and many places to eat Metro was nearby as well Of course at night the prostitution does pick up but I believe it s important to see the poor areas too 
229338,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Location not central but taxi s readily available just costly, The staff Cedrick Vincent and Alessandra was very friendly and helpful at all times The breakfast was excellent an the afternoon ta macaroons as promised Simply the best 
229339,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, The best was the delicious pastries served free in the ounge from 2 6pm each day What a treat Staff very helpful and friendly Coveninet for trains to everywhere 
229340,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Cleanliness I m surprised this is called best western I m been to many best western around the world this wasn t even close to the others shame that best western put their name on this hotel Best western Is a hotel that I have always used and how this is one I have no clue false advertisement forsure,No Positive
229341,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, I didn t like the location a little rough Many late parties in the streets by the locals I booked quite a while ahead and was given a room at the front of the hotel where it is the noisiest The airconditioner didn t work either I was also lead to believe we would be picked up at the airport but we had to pay for a taxi twice , I appreciated the front desk They were very helpful and the breakfast was wonderful with many good choices 
229342,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, Location good but not if you are squeamish about diverse street life Friendly competent staff Small but perfectly adequate room Exactly what we wanted Excellent breakfast 
229343,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, i have been in many 4 stars hotels but this hotel is not even 2 star compared to the other 4 stars hotels that i staid before the room was too small and it is not like the photos they are showing plus the hotel in general is not really clean and the area where the hotel located is not clean at all so basically it is not suitable for families i have a lot to say about what i did not like but the space here will not be enough ,No Positive
229344,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, After pulling back my bed covers to get in bed I found dirty male and female underwear under the bed cover There was no toilet roll or shower gel in the bathroom When I complained I was put in a much smaller room until my previous room was cleaned this was then given to another guest as I was forgotten about I feel as though my complaint was just swept under the carpet and no one really cared I will never stay at this hotel again and before anyone books to stay at the Best western I d advice you to look at the surrounding area Bookings com shows you pictures of surrounding areas near to the Eiffel Tower which is completely different from where the hotel is actually situated , Not much to be honest 
229345,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, In a terrible loacation did not feel safe leaving or returning to the hotel at night Staff were very rude and we were woken up at 1am by staff thinking the room was empty Very unorganised and very rude , Cheap rooms had a nice lounge in reception with free cake and coffee in the evening 
229346,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Completely incorrectly described on Booking com There are no dining facilities with the exception of breakfast American There is no bar and the rooms are very small The area will be unsuitable for certain types of guests, Not a lot really Very basic hotel with no frills no meals and no bar 
229347,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Receptionist on arrival was not very welcoming but did help when we asked about the area Very warm room and we were unable to turn the temperature down Very bad area, Very clean room comfortable bed inexpensive
229348,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Lift was not operational for 2 days Wifi worked but was very slow Got stuck outside late one night and the desk was unattended , Hotel seems secure in spite of the neighborhood 
229349,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, First room which was given to us was not cleaned so we had to change the room The second room was a bit worse than the first one but at least it was clean , Staff were very friendly and helpfull Location is good not far from metro 
229350,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, A very minor thing but when I arrived the bed was made in a somewhat sloppy way When I woke in the morning I found a pair of socks in the bed that were not mine but looked as though they must have been laundered with the sheets , I booked this hotel very last minute when a flight delay required that I overnight in Paris Finding a hotel 1km away from the Gare du Nord train station at a reasonable price on a same day booking was lucky I did not expect the accommodations to be as nice as they were The room was average size for Paris and very smartly laid out It was comfortable with everything you would need The staff particularly Florian at the front desk were exceptionally helpful and welcoming 
229351,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The room was tiny Not too bad considering that we were always out and about but there was no space for a fridge or even a bin Nice view from the top floor tho we could get a glimpse of the sacre cour The bed didn t work for me and my partner It was a painful 3 nights of sleep The mattress was hard which I normally prefer but You could feel the springs which made it somehow uneven also the pillows were not great The Wifi was painfully slow , The Staff was very helpful especially one member in particular who showed very kind manners and he gave us some good tips I noticed that he was always busy helping other customers too I don t remember his name but he had a light brown quiff For me he is an asset for your business and he on his own deserves the full score on this category The free complimentary coffee and snacks were such a nice and unexpected surprise and I must had they were really high quality too The area around the hotel could be a bit rough at night with some colourful characters standing on the corner of the streets HOWEVER you need to consider that A we were really close to the transports and B the hotel is walking distance from both pigalle and Montmartre so you need to expect that 
229352,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The location isn t the best lot of prostitutes and suspicious looking arabs walking around , It was comfy the toilets were nice and they had a nice lobby room with free coffee and sweets which was cute Also the metro is close so you can reach anywhere in the matter of minutes 
229353,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Room was not ready at 21 00 very noisy elevator get it lubricated Hotel and area have not the best re cleanliness A few hooks in the room would make life easier , Room change not a problem very helpful staff with good recommendations e g L Atelier Ramey for dinner Close by Metro line 4 and of course to Sacr Coeur Free coffee in the lobby Area is safe Supermarket next door 
229354,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, A few hookers and pimps on the street but they don t give any problems or intimidate you City life and thats part of the charm in a big city , very comfortable rooms well equipped very helpful and friendly staff especially the very charming Cedric 
229355,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, Location was convenient very near metro station Area is a little dodgy at night but still alright Facilities were alright but room is very small also no toothpaste n toothbrush were provided Wouldn t rate this as a 4 star hotel 3 star is more like it 
229356,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, When we arrive very late at night around 00 30 am there was a prostitute in the next door building The area was not as insecure as we were said probably because we came from Argentina The man that received us was not that gentle but it was fine They first gave us a room in which the bed covered the closet so every time we needed to open the closet we had to move 50 cms the bed It was very uncomfortable Other bad thing was that the shower in the bathroom was without a curtain or a bath screen so everytime we wanted to have a shower the entire bathroom floor got wet and the toilet was so wet that we needed to dry it I found that very bad The next day we decided to ask for a change of room they did change us and the second room was fine everything we needed was there , The nice attention of the reception during all night specially for Cedric not the same was at night Also you get free tea and coffee all day long in the bar downstairs There is a supermarket with everything you may need less than one minute walk 
229357,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Wifi was very bad no access in rooms Air Conditioning was not working on some floors Very far from Eiffel Tower, Coffee machine at reception The young boy at reception was very cooperative Breakfast was OK but very tight sitting space
229358,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, They use an extremely strong perfume in the lobby while it smelled good it was too much for my taste , My room on the sixth floor opened onto a big garden so it was very quiet and restful in the midst of the hustle and bustle of this part of the city 
229359,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Wifi is a bit slow WE didn t have breakfast so can t comment , It s an old fashioned hotel that has been modernised with an impressive vestibule made of marble and a beautiful wooden railed stair case but you can take a lift Rooms were small but not cramped I was impressed by the cleanliness it was spotless The bed was comfortable and the pillows were good The shower gave lots of hot water The windows opened up When closed you can t hear the road traffic at all The boulevard is quite busy I like the feeling of being in an inner parisien urban area it s multi cultural very mixed But nonetheless a grand boulevard and not far at all from metro and 10 minute walk to Rue de Poteau if you want foodie stuff and not far from Montmartre The men on the front desk were friendly 
229360,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, the WC was smelly likely not had been cleaned properly no soap was available in the bathroom a part from shampoo shower gel in the shower the bedside tables were sticky and dirty an frequent annoying noise during all time probably coming from the elevator very limited breakfast, the comfortable bed the very kind and nice staff
229361,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Small rooms, Very quite as soon as you enter the hotel from a very busy steet The room was a bit on the small side and the bathroom was so small the shower was space was small but over all very clean quite excellent breakfast and good value for money yes I would go again
229362,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Maybe closer to the highlights of the city I felt safe but there seemed to be a few prostitutes down the street , The helpfulness of the staff was awesome I appreciated the hotel having a driver if needed The price was top notch Since getting there early I appreciated being able to check in early 
229363,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The area isn t great Keep your wits about you Although the hotel is well situated to Montmarte the particular street it is on can be quite unsavoury , The gentleman at the hotel reception was exceptional Helped us organise bike rental The map he provided us with led us to a wonderful area in Montmarte a place filled with wonderful cafes bars restraunts and boutique clothes shops 
229364,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, The staff members were very friendly and helpful The location was not exactly where I had imagined The impression is that the hotel is in the heart of Montmartre Not quite It was clean and comfortable for a few nights stay but not a place I would stay for a longer period of time The room was smaller than the pictures show It thought it was a little over priced considering what you get 
229365,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The room was not cleaned properly Every morning is scramble eggs for breakfast except one morning there is not even scramble eggs Breakfast is the same every morning ,No Positive
229366,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, It seems that there were no resources invested no kettle the bathroom had the silicone pealing no option to have the clothes ironed no much comfort around the room because there was no room SMAL it was like being on a bus No available advise on nearby restaurants breakfast every day totally the same and no kosher options either although asked for than why to ask , the staff was great and making great efforts to help an compensate for a 4 stars hotel with a quality of 3 stars
229367,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Location is alittle worrying at night But if you are careful all will be fine , Location was good we have the best time of our life there We promised to visit there again soon Food location was plentiful around many small restaurants and cafes are around walking distance from the hotel we had a the best and more romantic dinner at Le Grand 8 near Montmartre Staff was friendly and accommodating She loved every moment we had there Thank you for making us the most happy couple in Paris Merci Spasibo XieXie

229369,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Rooms a little small but scored room in the rear and was very quiet , Quality hotel in close proximity to the Gare du Nord and to the Sacr C ur Neighbour hood a little to be cautious about but fine The Wi Fi was down and I was offered a portable WIFI unit at a cheap price and it was super 
229370,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, the area had lots of prostitutes which was a bit disturbing hanging arround outside , really emjoyed the stay the welcome drink and biscuits cake between 2pm and 6pm was an added bonus 
229371,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, It s a small hotel but internet wasn t working the whole period and the hotel staff was telling us that someone would come to fix Never came Heating not working neither air conditioning, Staff friendly lady from the breakfast very nice person
229372,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The location This hotel is located on a very rough street and not exactly the Montmartre area you think you are paying to be staying in For the price for the night it ll do, The hotel staff were lovely friendly and helpful The hotel itself was nice and the room was great
229373,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Its situated in red light district at night there were prostitutes standing right outside the entrance of the hotel breakfast is extremely bad with hardly any options room is very small with a very tiny bathroom unfriendly staff and poor service, Its proximity to Montmartre Church
229374,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Tiny room location no fridge again tiny room When I arrived the air conditioner had been working for a few hours at least and it was freezing in the room And the air conditioner didn t work with warmer temperature There was an additional rubber sheet on the bed very uncomfortable , Mhhhh it was just bearable Definitely not 4 star hotel

229376,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, This hotel is not in a good area We were traveling with three children We thought it would be nice to be close to Montmartre and a short distance from Gare du Nord We did not feel safe walking around with children We ended up spending more money on Uber because of this We recommend staying on the other side of Sacr C ur The hotel wasn t great quality either The toilet leaked and flooded our room While all the rooms say non smoking our rooms had a strong smoke smell , Front desk was friendly

229378,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The shower was slow to drain and on the 2nd day we had to go and get the keys reactivated The area was slightly rougher than expected and I wouldn t recommend this hotel for young families or travelers who are likely to be out late at night , Hotel was clean and very well presented with very helpful staff There was both free wifi and a free safe to use which were both very useful The staff were friendly and welcoming and always willing to help with what was needed The room was comfy and came with aircon which was very welcome in the 34C heat Easy access to Metro stations which meant it was relatively easy to get into central Paris
229379,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Location Peanuts and corn being fried right outside the front door Prostitutes along the road Dirty roads paper plastics food rests to be stepped over Breakfast very basic , Location to Montmatre Easy walk up the back hill to the SacreCour Close to nice restaurants and all kinds of transport e g bus and train

229397,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, First of all Bed Sheets were not changed a single time in 4 days Secondly the coffee mugs that were located in the room itself were also not changed or cleaned since the day 1 To be honest it was my first time when I have had such a low quality customer service in the BEST WESTERN HOTEL Lastly the concierge guy tried to rip us off by forcing to drive with a taxi company suggested by him He wen t even for an extra mile saying that all other taxis will charge us much more than the one offered by him To be more specific he wanted us to pay 60 euros for a cab to the Orly airport Where as I showed him that Uber would charge only 40 euros and a local taxi asked us for 35 euros only Long story short he convinced us that the other taxis will force us to pay more than the taxi company of his choice So we were forced to pay 60 euros for a taxi that actually cost 35 40 euros I felt very disappointed in the bratnd value of Best Western Hotels Now I will always take my time to consider other hotel chains before applying for a Best Western Hotel P S in one of the days they even forgot to replace the toilet paper We actually had to call them and remind them to bring one roll If that is how Best Western imagines to treat their customers then I would recommend to downgrade them to a 3 star hotel , Location of the hotel was convenient 
229398,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Not the hotel s fault but the area was very run down and seedy Street outside was very noisy until the early hours , Bedroom was good with comfortable bed and excellent shower Staff were very friendly and helpful Situated very near to the Metro so easy to get around from there Some good restaurants in easy walking distance 
229399,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, I guess that the Bvd Barbes is not the coolest part of Paris though I like the exotic feel of the area around Chateau Rouge Metro If it makes you nervous get off the Metro at Marcadet Poissoniers and walk uphill It s not much further anyway , The hotel reception is smart and clean and the reception staff very helpful and friendly The hotel as a whole has a nice clean look to it The room was a decent size with a nice clean and well designed and made bathroom and tea coffee making facilities The curtains were almost total blackout and the soundproofing excellent The bed was very comfortable I have slept in a lot of Parisian hotel beds and this was one of the best I didn t have breakfast but the English lady I met in the lobby did and said that it was excellent I like this area Walk west and you arrive at a pleasant residential area with decent bars and eateries It s quiet and not touristy at all 
229400,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, We didn t feel safe in this neighbourhood and several of the locals approached us and were looking at us strangely If this were in a safer location the score would ve been higher , Close to an attraction Clean room Quiet room even though we were on a Main Street

229413,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, The hotel may not be in the best area But the hotel was great was and the staff made it even more so All very friendly and helpful If you are planning to spend time in Montmatre it is within walking distance but be warned you need to be fit Also a short walk from Gare Du Nord and on a direct metro line 12 to the museums Eiffel Tower etc There was a little mix up with our taxi on the last day but it was rectified and we arrived at the station with plenty of time to check in The breakfast was perfectly adequate Would certainly consider staying again The area may be a little rough around the edges but my friend and I enjoyed a walk around the market both at night and in the daytime and found the people very friendly and helpful with directions when we needed them 
229414,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff friendly rooms small but well equipped with tea coffee making facilities and bottled water and hairdryer in the bathroom
229415,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Rooms are not that nice and very small the bag hardly fits in it but the bathroom is good Breakfast is Ok but the dinning room is so tiny , The hotel is pretty basic Nothing trendy but it is OK and it is very close to the metro and to the Montmartre rea I would recommend it even if some people may find the neighborhood a little bit scary or uncomfortable 
229416,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Sadly the location leaves a lot to be desired You d better keep hold of your wallet or purse on the way to the Metro , The hotel is compact but quite adequate for a short stay The breakfast was nicely presented with plenty to suit all tastes The Metro is nearby and on Line 4 which serves many of the major tourist areas of the city 
229417,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Sadly the location leaves a lot to be desired It is a rough area where it is wise to pass through quickly with your hand on your wallet , The room was small but well equipped and maintained The breakfast was fine and the whole ambiance of the hotel friendly and inviting There are good connections on the nearby Metro

229419,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Not so clean breakfast wasn t good and the location is terrible a rough neighborhood very dirty street and rather unsafe , The room was comfortable but I booked a double just for myself The reception desk staff was very nice and helpfull Close to a metro station Chateau Rouge with access to the conference venue via RER B The price was fair considering the high demand for hotels close to Gare du Nord because of the COP21 conference 
229420,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The hotel was fine but the surroundings might not be to every bodies taste We encountered no problems though It is very close to Sacre Couer , The chap on reception was charming and really helpful

229426,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Not the best place to stay in Paris we did not like the neighbourhood at all Small room no fridge Rather a 3 stars hotel , Friendly staff free WiFi comfortable bed
229427,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The hotel is on a street which serves as an edge between a more French community and a North African community It is a gritty urban residential and commercial area but we never felt unsafe Didn t like having to pay for breakfast in the hotel but it was a decent spread , The staff was very helpful recommending and helping us find a restaurant a short walk away since we arrived in the evening Location was great short walk from Gare du Nord train Room was comfortable and clean though a bit warm Left window open since we could not properly adjust the heat 
229428,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Severe problems with bed bugs in my room It had nothing to do with cleanliness as the hotel is very clean I had welts on my face neck hands and back I have never experience such a problem My travel plans called for me to travel to other parts of France and then back to Paris I canceled my return stay because of the problem I am assuming this is an issue of a previous traveler depositing the nasty critters but there should be a routine check after every stay It is a shame since this is a fine hotel ,No Positive
229429,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The areas around the metro have a lot of people selling things They tend to pester you which is quite off putting as there are so many , The staff was very friendly and the hotel was clean 
229430,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, we stayed in front of the room door 2 times coz of stupid key kart system and we couldnt use wi fi the code that they gave us was not working , i was so sleepy so i couldnt notice much things just i can say room was looking clean 
229431,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Rooms on to street are noisy with traffic below but the air con was efficient and quiet so this wasn t a problem for us on a short stay , Great location very close to Montmartre and Le Sacre Coeur friendly staff and good breakfasts Room adequate clean and comfortable 
229432,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The location was a little sketchy In an international district sidewalks were dirty smelly , The hotel itself was fine clean comfortable Close to Metro and not too far from Gare du Nord which is why I booked it 
229433,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, The room was very comfortable especially the bed The room was nice the bathroom was spacious My room had a handicapped equiped room I had proplems using the computer and the man working at the front desk was very helpful
229434,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The street outside is really dirty Not particular welcoming quarter around the hotel but close to Montmartre , Close to Montmartre Friendly staff Clean and welcoming hotel 
229435,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, I didn t like the hotel policy of changing towels every two days and not changing the bed sheets even once in 4 days there was no fridge in the room the complimentary toiletries included only small bars of soap and nothing else I expected a supply of tooth paste and brush and shaving set at the price we paid I also expected breakfast to be included , I liked the helpfulness of the manager and other staff at the reception as well as the housekeepers The checking in was very smooth and done very quickly I specially liked the way the manager gladly offered to hold our three suitcases while we went to Luxembourg for three days 
229436,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The ghetto location Air conditioning barely worked On our last day there was no hot water , I like the cleanliness of the room and convenience of having a mini mart next to the hotel
229437,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Would appreciate better choice of tv channels , Helpful and friendly staff clean rooms fantastic value for money very close to good supermarket and metro The area is multicultural but in fairness very safe at all times even late at night 
229438,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The area outside felt unsafe Like on the wrong side of the tracks Pickpockets roaming the streets , The room view and bathroom was lovely Nice having free tea and coffee available Also nice having toiletrys supplied 
229439,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Fixed price for breakfast as we never have more than bread jam and coffee We ate elsewhere, The room was value for money and the facilities adequate for a one night stop over 
229440,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The breakfast was decent , Location in a dirty and dangerous part of Paris with obvious drug deals being conducted just outside the closest metro When we asked to be moved the man at the front desk refused and I was charged for a double room and only got a regular room 
229441,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The neighborhood is terrible My mistake I didn t pay more attention to the location when booking Even the taxi driver who drove us from the airport to the hotel warned us not go out at night At some times it left like in Africa Streets and nearby metro station filthy garbage everywhere , Hotel itself was more or less ok although room too small for a 4 hotel 
229442,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Don t go out after dark this is a poor area to stay in there are people sleeping rough right outside the hotel not just one but lots Also lady s of the night are everywhere in the area if you want that great I m streetwise but I felt intimidated , Stayed here for business trip for one night hotel itself is good it is the location that lets it down
229443,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The location was pure sheer horror Prostitutes in front of the hotel and dodgy people who gives you the creep and make you not want to venture out of the hotel The bedroom was good but the shower door was manky and let water out transforming it in a wet room The noise from the lift prevents a good night sleep and the walls are quite thin The air con stopped working and works on the block of flat opposite made it impossible to open the windows On leaving the receptionist did not know we did not consume the continental breakfast and wanted to charge us for four days at 10 Euros per head Think they need to review their system , The people at the reception especially the man who worked morning on the 2nd of September are friendly helpful and pleasant The bedroom is quite spacious and comfortable Transport to the center of Paris or Gare du Nord is of easy access 
229444,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Staff were unhelpful Location is in a filthy dirty and dangerous area filled with drug dealers Didn t get the room I paid for Wouldn t refund us or change us to a better and safer hotel , Breakfast was satisfactory
229445,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Unfortunately the hotel is situated in an area that is not good although we did not experience any problems , The hotel was good and the staff very helpful 
229446,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Hotel is not in a very nice location Didn t feel very safe walking down the road that it is located on and did not use the metro near the hotel as felt safer walking to the metro at the bottom of sacre coeur ,No Positive
229447,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The hotel staff are lovely but the location is in a terrible place Also no bar facilities and no parking They were changing the boiler the last day of our trip so no hot water after 9 in the morning which we were not advised of at first Also the air conditioning stopped working twice during our stay No drawers in rooms either and no plug sockets near mirror to allow us to dry hair straighten hair in front of them , Paris was great
229448,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The safe didn t work and was not repaired or replaced when there The Air Conditioning was very noisy The tea and coffee was not replaced when used Plastic cups in room seem a poor add on it would be better if glass The area was quite Intimidating especially at night for woman , The room d cor was nice and room and common area were clean and tidy
229449,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The neighbourhood could be a bit dodgy after late past 11pm You are advised to take a cab back to the hotel if returning late , Comfortable good sized room with a generous bathroom Great location between two major metro lines walkable distance from major attractions such as Montmartre Moulin Rouge etc 
229450,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Hotel is in a very rough neighborhood Hotel room was very dodgy and had was not a good room Breakfast charges were very high compared to the items provided There was no room service and the lighting was very bad In general did not have basic needs around , Staff did as much as they could They were very helpful but again they struggled to communicate in English 
229451,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, It was not at a nice location I did not feel safe walking around the area at night, Overall the hotel was nice and staffs were friendly and helpful I had Mosquito in the first room the staff offered to change to another room which was good 
229452,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, to name only a few access via fire escape only being locked out of room and elevator no firekey to emergencydoors door had to be forced down street cats in room treated like second hand guests reserved room was given away although checking early afternoon breakfast area not cleaned to standard no compensation received after 4 weeks no invoice no apologies not able to speak to manager the worst best western hotel ever shame on management , some helpfull receptionists who dared to help
229453,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Breakfast staff didn t speak English AT ALL, Reception staff speak top quality English Good location with good metro links to both city centre and CDG airport 
229454,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The hotel is not located in a very good neighborhood The poor man at the front desk was not well informed as it was only his second day and he was completely alone and didn t even have access to things like towels We reserved a twin room and when we got into the room it had one double bed When we went to the desk he said they had no other rooms but then he thought we could change with someone else who also had problems with their reservation We then had to wait to swap rooms with a couple who actually requested a double bed but they had already been in the room and there was no housekeeping to tidy the room or to provide fresh towels so we had to swap towels and toiletries ourselves The beds were very small which made for an uncomfortable night They claim to be a four star hotel but they are far below that , It was close to metro and bus stops It had a decent bathroom 
229455,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Stuck in the elevator a couple of times They comped our breakfasts to make up for the multiple inconveniences New clerk never booked my taxi Pretty stressed when I needed one at 4 30am They did get one there in time so it worked out , Very comfortable bed Breakfast was good and the clerks were very helpful 
229456,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, staff attitude not helpful nothing in English for us to understand when we were leaving was hit with a bill that we had no idea what it was for Man kept pointing to paper on wall with euro prices but was in bloody french no English and we are a deaf couple and asked him to write it down but kept pointing to wall so paid it and walked out not sure what we paid for , Nice hotel clean but rooms small 
229457,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Sketchy neighborhood at night , This was super affordable and in an ok location When we walked out of the train station it was not what we were expecting its different and we didn t feel safe late at night but once we got to the hotel it all changed The hotel is nice and comfortable During the day the streets are filled I mean filled by street vendors and fake purse sellers The room was a comfortable run on the mill room Breakfast was awesome 
229458,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, Requested two single beds and got one queen bed Asked to change but nothing available until the next night but that room was currently being disinfected for bedbugs Needless to say we opted to share the bed both nights instead of risk bed bugs
229459,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The location is not good it it 20 minute walk to Montmartre centre and sacre coeur so name of hotel quite misleading And we felt quite unsafe in this area , Nice clean helpful and friendly hotel 
229460,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The environment for newcomers to Paris could be a turn off lots of drunks and people begging C est la vie, Helpful staff pleasant enough room Breakfast great not over priced on the whole a good experience 
229461,Best Western Hotel Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The staff that was at the reception desk at 11pm when I checked in that evening was the rudest person I have ever met First when I arrived he asked me what do you want in a rude manner Then gave me a lecture about not smoking in the room because if you do we will find out about it when I said politely that if I wanted to smoke I would do so outside the hotel no problem Then went on to give me a lecture about letting the cleaners do my room the next day because they have children and husbands to go back to and no time to waste Finally when I asked where was my luggage which I had left in their secure store room that morning he pointed out at my bag which was left in the corridor out of their sight and there available for anyone to open it and take my belonging out of it Absolutely shocking Will never stay in this hotel again and would recommend the managers to get rid of this person at the desk , The room was small but confortable
