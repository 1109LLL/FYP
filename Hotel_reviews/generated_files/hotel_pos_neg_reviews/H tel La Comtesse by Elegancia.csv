132283,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The petite breakfast which I had once was fine croissants flaky and coffee fine nothing great I found these kinds of breakfasts to be overpriced in Paris including at this hotel A little noisy when I opened the window in my hotel room , This hotel is elegant intimate and very French The location is charming with Parisian cafes and restaurants around the corner but also access to practical things like the subway stops and a few grocery stores located within walking distance The hotel also has a nice staff and they did a good job overall My room was chic sunny and intimate not that small with a window opening out and a rather roomy bathroom Hotel restaurant appeared nice but I did not dine there much The petite breakfast which I had once was fine croissants flaky and coffee fine nothing great 
132284,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Can t think of anything I would change , Bed very comfortable Beautiful bathroom Staff so friendly Very clean Location perfect Will highly recommend it 
132285,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Maybe a bit expensive , The location is best and there are good restaurant and cafe around hotel also super market All staff are very kind feel relaxed and comfortable I could enjoyed Effel Tower from my room I booked double room And they have service to keep luggage after cheking out It takes less than 5 mins from station 
132286,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful no matter the question asked to them Just what you need The included breakfast was excellent and plenty of types of food to choose from 
132287,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, No bathrobes and slippers, The hotel was so cute so clean so nice designed We had an amazing view almost straight on Eiffel Tower from our balcony Greater location Supermarket cafes a lot of sightseeing public transport and tourist bus stops in walking distance Staff was extremely helpful and friendly Special thanks to Daniel the director for his advises help his attention care and kindness There was a good choice for breakfast Croissants We stayed in very small but cozy clean and bright room with comfortable bad and pillows Good hairdryer I was absolutely happy with our choice of this hotel 
132288,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Rooms on the small side so if you have much luggage you will be stepping over things , Excellent location with small but nice balconly and view of Eiffel Tower Proximity of public transport and places to eat 
132289,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, A bit noisy street noise at night , The property was conveniently located and within walking distance of many of the major attractions Our room had a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower 
132290,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Elevator was super small But I guess that s how it is in small hotels throughout Europe , The View of the Eiffel Tower was AMMAAAAAAZING Perfect Right from the bed Put the cherry on the top for a romantic honeymoon And the walk to Champ de Mars Eiffel Tower park was literally 5 mins walk 
132291,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Nothing , First class hotel with a stunning view of the Eifell tower from all rooms stated as such A modern chic hotel with incredibly accommodating customer service who were able to recommend eating places and activities A 
132292,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Bed king mattress was actually 2 mattresses put together and you could feel the gap Asked staff if they have different options apparently not Breakfast was just average , Stayed at Junior Suite 6th floor Nothing beats the view to Eiffel from the room You see the beautiful night tower and wake up with perfect Paris setting outside your room Just breathtaking Room itself was very spacious elegant modern extremely clean and super cozy attic ceiling and lighting Bathroom is superb the tub super comfy and could probably fit 3 people in it Despite the location on the intersection room was very quiet unless you decide to use the bluetooth speaker in the room Location is perfect for Eiffel and public transport connections to everything Staff was very friendly and helpful Will definitely come back 
132293,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, tiny room I know a lot of them are I would suggest though that hotels such as this get on board with how cruise ships provide storage for your suitcases under the bed We were tripping over each other and the suitcases There were also end tables but without drawers No where to put anything The shower was also strange as I am thinking there was not a holder on the wall to use the shower you had to hold it But other than that the bathroom was very big and light Hallways a bit dark and dreary , ok the view spectacular out of your window Bed very fluffy and comfy The breakfast area and provisions staff were very nice Close to the metro and so many restaurants of course the Tower lots of things to do in the area We walked to dinner every night 
132294,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Coffee shop closed early It did not stay open until 11pm as stated Not a big issue though it would have been nice to sit out in the evening looking directly at the Eiffel Tower , Location the views and rooms were excellent The staff were always available and very friendly 
132295,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The room size it was our first time in Paris so nothing to compare it to and the lack of storage in both the bedroom and bath , The bed was very comfy and the shower was amazing Loved having the coffee maker in the room The location was perfect and the staff was very friendly and helpful The hotel also was very clean 
132296,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, One of the staff in the restaurant serving breakfast wasn t very patient But there s two others very nice If the express breakfast includes oun yogurt that would be even nicer , Antique building Modern comfort Nice area Quiet but easy to get around 
132297,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Negative just a wee bit Could hear the footsteps from room above us a bit but overlooked it considering that the hotel was almost perfect , Positives Fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower from our room the wonderful interior design great bathroom and shower the great staff the cleanliness the great soundproofing the location Practically everything 
132298,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The room is small but you cannot ask more for this price in Paris , The location Simply this is the best hotel in Paris for me Beautiful view of Eiffle tower from the window close to metro close to a supermarket which is open till late good restaurants near by You really feel your day is beautiful After 2 nights I moved to a hotel highest rated by Tripadviser to find that the move was a mistake 
132299,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Bathroom shower lacked a holder for the shower head so you had to hold it with one hand to shower Room was a little on the small side but expected in Paris , Our room Marquise had a nice large and bright bathroom The views when you stick your head out the window were pretty amazing of the Eiffel Tower Location is nice quieter neighborhood more locals 
132300,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia,No Negative, We went to Paris to celebrate my wife s birthday booked this hotel s Comtesse room We had a front view of Eiffel Tower one of the wish which my wife had To top it all there was a small juliette balcony to step out to Friendly receptionist who gave good tips during the stay Didn t have breakfast as we are not a morning person 
132301,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia,No Negative, Hotel is located in the heart of Paris You can see Effel Tower from the window Nice restaurants near by Room was extremely clean Bathroom shower one of the best I ever had Thank you Paris
132302,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, My advise don t order taxi from the reception It was probably the taxi driver fault but we got charged twice the rate than taxi catched on the street , Fantastic location and outstanding cleanliness Staff very friendly and professional Walking distance to major atractions and very close to metro station 
132303,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The room could have been larger , Location e g 10 minutes from the Eiffel Tower 30 minute walk from the Louvre and Musee d Orsay View side view on the Eiffel Tower Breakfast many options delicious Staff polite and helpful Metro station right around the corner
132304,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia,No Negative, The staff at the front desk were incredibly nice and cooperative They provided us with more than one adapter when requested and allowed for a late checkout free of charge to compensate the first night we missed due to the bad weather conditions coming in to Paris Also our room was clean and ready upon the next day early in the morning Location was excellent just 10 minutes walk to the Eiffle Tower Supermarket and restaurants surrounding the area close by the hotel 
132305,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Alarm went off at 2am due to a person staying over Breakfast is limited buffet but eggs cooked in various ways available , Location easy great for metro aNd short walk to eifel tower 
132306,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The room was smaller than we expected I also emailed to inform the hotel we would be on our honeymoon but no extra special touches were provided or an acknowledgement , The location was perfect for using public transport The bed was comfy and the bathroom amenities were lovely 
132307,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Cost of the Hotel breakfast 19 ouch but this is the price most hotels charge you in Paris we found it cheaper to go out to a local cafe and eat , Excellent facilities very good location and easy to get to a lot of the main attractions of the city 
132308,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, We reserved a Baronne room with breakfast for two nights for 368 euro but unfortunately without explanation from the staff the hotel withdrew 453 92euro ,No Positive
132309,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia,No Negative, I ve stayed at this property 4 times with previous ownership as well I hope to stay more in the future The new updgrades in the bathroom were great The location and view is still my favorite in Paris Thank you for your hospitality 
132310,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, This hotel is just unreasonable pricey There s nothing special that may justify its price Breakfast was average Shower is quite tricky as well , Eiffel view in your room and close to Champ de Mars 
132311,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Breakfast was not included but was well worth paying for yummy omelettes , Incredible views spacious clean and airy rooms Great location just minutes from the Eiffel tower musee Rodin and Invalides 
132312,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Poor sound insulation in room led to a restless night I was easily disturb by neighbouring room guests arriving and departing during the night , Lovely decor ambience Super location and great view of Eiffel Tower
132313,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Everything was perfect , We were in Paris for our honeymoon and Hotel La Comtesse was just lovely The hotel is in a lovely neighborhood near the Eiffel Tower The staff was friendly the room was warm and amazingly quite amazing since it was on a rather big busy street It is also in very close proximity of the metro station so it was perfect for getting around in Paris It was never too far away from where you d like to see as first timers in Paris as we On our 3rd day I got sick and the staff at the reception got me a nice english speaking doctor very quick early in the morning Would definatelty stay again and recommend oh and we had a balcony and could sit across the Eiffel Tower 
132314,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The shower could do with a bracket in the bathroom , Excellent location and fantastic value for money Amazing view from the balcony Staff very helpful 
132315,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The hotel is rated 4 star hotel but it is more like a 3 star hotel , It was a nice size bedroom with comfortable bed a huge bed by the way The bathroom was very clean and I loved it as well The location was fantastic and ALL the staff very friendly and helpful 
132316,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, We went out in the morning and came back around 3 4pm however the room service has not finished yet , The location is excellent Close to Eiffle tower grocery stores and Metro The bed is very comfortable and amazing view from balcony I should have stayed longer 
132317,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The air conditioning for the room was tied to the rest of the building so we couldn t get the room to cool down without opening the door to the balcony , The room was lovely and the view was great Staff were friendly and the location was spot on 
132318,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The bed was quite hard but not too much of an issue Overall I was really impressed , Amazing location beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower excellent staff I will definitely stay here again AND recommend it to others
132319,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Breakfast was nice but the choice was rather limited considering the high price But probably this is normal in Paris, The location is excellent rooms are clean and nice staff is very friendly and helpful
132320,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia,No Negative, The location is incredible We upgraded our room to one with a Balcony for 40 euros per night and it was amazing We were on the 5th floor Room 505 and the view of the Eiffel tower was breathtaking Staff are really helpful too we will definitely return to this hotel 
132321,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Booked a smoking room and was told there were none when I arrived Booked a room with Eiffel Tower view but I could only see it when I stretched my head out the bathroom window Breakfast buffet was very poor Did not offer concierge or any other service usually found in a 4 star hotel, Very clean Many cafe s and restaurants around Eiffel tower is about 15 minutes walk Close to a supermarket Comfortable bed
132322,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Rooms were still small You get what you pay for in Paris Also another standard it seemed only four or five channels in English , Fantastic location Quiet part of town great for seeing the sights 
132323,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The continental breakfast was very good but not included in the room price and too expensive to indulge in every day Fortunately there was a mini fridge in the room and I could store items purchased from the nearby grocery store for breakfast on subsequent mornings Unfortunately there is only one sink in the bathroom but couples can take heart in that there are large shelves next to it , Surprisingly convient location in that public transportation is immediately at hand and certain of the must see locations are within walking distance The hotel is like a well run ship whose internal architecture condensed the hall space from the elevator in order to give the rooms much more space to hold a large bed and a large bathroom shower and bath tub Very nicely appointed room with sufficient electric sockets and wifi Breakfast was excellent Though not inexpensive for Paris it was still good value for what I paid I would stay here again and if it did not rain I d sit out on the tiny balcony and watch the Eiffel Tower at night 
132324,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Wish we researched better the bath shower options we got a room with tub so taking a shower was an interesting experience but we managed well , Great location vey close to E tower excelent breakfast facilities the lady that hosts breakfast is the best and very confortable bed 
132325,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Room size but then again its a common Parisienne pandemic, The convenience of the location is whet I like the most 7eme Arrondissement is my favorite area for its proximity to lively Paris
132326,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The breakfast seemed a little pricey but we never tried it so I can t tell if it was worth it , The hotel is in a perfect location Around the corner from the metro and plenty of lovely cafes restaurants and a supermarket Within walking distance of the Eiffel tower the army museum and several other attractions The room was perfect for our needs Plenty of storage super comfy beds air conditioning safe tea coffee and a mini bar The bathroom was beautiful and clean and came with all the necessities and loads of towels The Wi Fi was excellent too I really enjoyed my stay here and would without a doubt stay here again It was safe ideally located in the city but still quiet at night The staff were also extremely helpful and friendly We never tried the restaurant here but I image that was just as good as the rest of the hotel 
132327,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia,No Negative, The beds were comfory the rooms were small but to a high standard the view was amazing out the window looking at the Iffel tower the location was great too 
132328,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The ONLY down side was that the shower head wasn t mounted and had to be held when showering That is being very picky as well , The location was amazing being only 15 minutes walking distance from the Eiffel Tower The staff were very helpful letting us borrow an adapter after ours didn t fit They even let us get changed when leaving our bags early because we arrived 5 hours before check in They never said no to anything and were very friendly The room was beautiful clean and very modern 
132329,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, One member of staff was rude which meant that we didn t get to use the leisure facilities, The location of this hotel is excellent Near lots of nice bars and restaurants close to the Eiffel Tower and on a great bus route Two members of reception staff were exceptional and helped us find several places that we wanted to go to The rooms are beautiful and the A C works very well at this time of year 
132330,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, The wifi dropped out each time you went off it instead of having to log in each time it could be more easily accessible Paying that amount I feel breakfast should be included , The bed was comfy always freshly made The shower was clean with a big shower head 
132331,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia,No Negative, Recently refurnished building is very chic and the room is extremely comfortable with its bed and always very clean At the reception dear three gentlemen have been always very helpful and friendly special thanks to them The location of the hotel is awesome at a perfect corner of a well known square with metro station markets and cafes around just few minutes away from eiffel tower concorde square and ecole militaire by walking You should definitely prefer this hotel if you find available room When you come back to your room after a long day you have chance to relax with a perfect view of Eiffel Tower from your balcony of which the photo is attached Words are not enough to express this unforgettable experience you should try and live it Thank you Hotel La Comtesse for making my vacation unforgettable and marvellous See you next time 
132332,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Water leak in the shower room we stayed in room 201 The glass wall needs to be well sealed We had to wipe off the water which flew to the sink side every time An electric appliance near the ceiling was not neatly attached to the wall We would prefer a self service breakfast , It s a nicely decorated boutique hotel and the staff are helpful Very convenient location to go anywhere a self service laundry place is nearby too 
132333,H tel La Comtesse by Elegancia, Room size was not mentioned in the booking com site rooms are very small Hotel was good but it was very expensive i should not be more than 100 euros per night,No Positive
