500179,Hotel Atlanta,No Negative, This is an antique hotel The whole building was giving a nice feeling Many spaces to explore and relax We got a cozy attic room on the top floor The room was decorated by many interesting pictures 
500180,Hotel Atlanta, Could do with a little bit more professionalism from the staff, I loved the authentic atmosphere of faded glamour of Old Vienna drawing room spiral stairs with century old lift sadly out of service 
500181,Hotel Atlanta, Small and shabby bathroom , Good location Building is from the 19th century it shows in the rooms as well could receive a refurbishment but definitely has a special atmosphere

500184,Hotel Atlanta, It just beside the tram track It was 30 celsius around 90 fahrenheit Since there was no air condition we need to keep the window open It was very loud when train paasing by every 10 minutes until after mid night It was not possible to sleep until the train stop to run It start again in the morning around 5 30 am , None
500185,Hotel Atlanta, Breakfast was boring Not a good selection Nothing hot and eggs had to be paid for As did breakfast which I did not realise Must check my booking , The breakfast was a bit poor The staff were great Very accommodating and friendly Lovely old building Needs better air con but I saw new air con units ready to be tested Needs an overall but clean and functional 
500186,Hotel Atlanta, the only suggestion is to gradually introduce aircons as that is sometimes needed, The one staff member mr P was extremely helpful with a situation that needed special attention I cannot thank him enough for his intervention The room and bathroom was spacious and comfortable 
500187,Hotel Atlanta, Airconditioning we were there during a heatwave Opening the windows helped but since the hotel is at a busy road this lets in a lot of noise , Marvelous old building very spacious room that felt like a penthouse Good breakfast friendly staff 
500188,Hotel Atlanta, The floors creaked We requested lower level room because our children are small and like to run The signs in the room warned on theft but at 1am someone tried to break into our room Shook the door and was banging Thankfully we lock our doors at all times The downstairs smelled like smoke The desk people were outside when we got in The bathrooms had bodily hair for a lack of better words all over the shower and sink The carpets were disgusting and coming up The towels were small hand towels I highly regret staying here Such a waste of money , Nothing 
500189,Hotel Atlanta, Elevator was slow but this is a minor inconvenience , This is the second time we have stayed at Hotel Atlanta and we would stay there again It is not a fancy hotel but our room was quiet clean and comfortable The breakfast was reasonably priced and we found it delicious 
500190,Hotel Atlanta, Not clean and uncomfortable I specify that I prefer a queen size bed and even though I got a reply confirming this preference I got 3 solo beds and had to combine them In addition the cleaners did not took the trash from our room there is only on small trash bin at the bathroom and we had to take on our own Sorry but its not a 4 starts hotel Unfortunately I will not travel back there , Great location right next to the tram station 
500191,Hotel Atlanta, No air conditioning and rooms were very warm only a single standing fan which was noisy and didn t cool the room well Booked a twin room but when we arrived it was one double bed and one single converted sofa bed which was not very comfortable, Breakfast was nice the rooms were traditional and charming and the interior was lovely WiFi was free and speedy
500192,Hotel Atlanta, No air con room small airless Only one lift working If you wanted a cooked breakfast you had to pay extra and normal breakfast was not included either Facilities poor considering this is supposed to be a 4 Also no restaurant or bar How it got this rating I do not know , Breakfast area clean and tidy Food ok 
500193,Hotel Atlanta, No airconditioning and due to location next to busy street with tram line it was not possible to sleep with open window Bathroom was quite small but adequate a general renovation of hotel would not be amiss explains good price , Large room in charming old hotel located right next to the tram line to the city centre 
500194,Hotel Atlanta, The male receptionist send us on a wild goose chase to catch the airport bus We discovered that we could board in the centre , My room was very hot but vey quiet One of the cleaners kindly put a fan in without being asked 
500195,Hotel Atlanta, No air conditioning in the rooms and it was 25 degrees plus Breakfast not included in the price , Great location close to attractions and transport links Nice big rooms and big bathrooms Wifi wasn t too bad
500196,Hotel Atlanta, No Air conditioning and hard to leave the windows open because there Re some bugs , Beautiful old building from the turn of the century and nicely renovated The Breakfast was excellent 
500197,Hotel Atlanta, The fifth floor has no lift so you must go with your luggage There is no air conditioned in these rooms which is necessary for hot days since the ceiling of the room is directly the roof so if the day is warm be ready for sweating The WIFI connection didn t work in the four days I was hosted The technician was always coming but never arrived and I have the impression that he will never arrive Finally the staff is correct but far from nice up to few exceptions To sum up I have visited Vienna multiple times and my impression is that one can find better hotels for a similar price , Acceptable breakfast not much variety but the quality was good The bed was comfortable and the location is quite good 
500198,Hotel Atlanta, One of the staff on reception desk is not so customer oriented and made customer wait for a long time while he was chatting with other , Near to t tram station and volksoper It s convenient to get to the city center The room is big and very clean 
500199,Hotel Atlanta, If not in the weekend the parking is free till 9 o clock in the morning then you have to pay 2 20 for a couple of hours then you have to move the car to another parking Around the hotel only parkings over expensive It looks like no climatization was available Very noisy because of the trams passing till late in the night Very very very old hotel not 4 stars for sure they have to cut at least one Lock of the doors very old style vulnerable Smell of smoke in the room , Great position 15 minutes from the center by walk parking for free on the street on saturday and sunday
500200,Hotel Atlanta, Although it was rated as four star on booking com but it wasn t close to 3 star so Facilities and room was in very very poor condition , I only like the location other than that nothing was good in the hotel
500201,Hotel Atlanta, Only on last day were staff a bit friendly first day lost internet connection called reception to tell him told me what can I do about it room was dusty we had to ask them to be done again , Location of Hotel is very good and old rooms with high celling that s all I would rate it 3 star hotel not 4
500202,Hotel Atlanta, No tea or coffee making facility in the rooms one of 2 elevators out of order our room was facing the main street and it gets very noisy with the tram cars motorcycles passing by at night old room doors were not improving my feeling of unsafety the walking on floor make a noisy Overall feel not entirely matching the 4 stars on Booking com , Location was great Tram stop to downtown just a few meters from hotel entrance Downtown is around 10 minutes wallk 
500203,Hotel Atlanta, First impressions of any new city mean quite a lot as it plants the seed for the journey We were told a taxi from HBF would be approx EU15 00 There was some traffic so we did expect it would be slightly more However EU45 00 wasn t expected so immediately we were on the back foot We should have taken the train and then the street car Then we meet Ernie we gave him our own nickname at Atlanta reception who had as much personality as a wet biscuit Arriving at 12 30pm and our room wasn t available until 2 00pm He advised we should leave our bags and head left from the hotel and find some lunch Unfortunately we took his advice We later found turning right would have taken us into a fantastic food festival as well as a beer festival 5 minutes walk from the hotel Shame on you Ernie this is your job to know these things and give good local advice to your guests The room was large clean Breakfast was basic but the coffee was terrible The queue to the coffee machine was always 5 7 deep but no one backed up for seconds For EU8 50 I suggest the option of a 10 min walk to a local caf , First impressions of any new city mean quite a lot as it plants the seed for the journey We were told a taxi from HBF would be approx EU15 00 There was some traffic so we did expect it would be slightly more However EU45 00 wasn t expected so immediately we were on the back foot We should have taken the train and then the street car Then we meet Ernie we gave him our own nickname at Atlanta reception who had as much personality as a wet biscuit Arriving at 12 30pm and our room wasn t available until 2 00pm He advised we should leave our bags and head left from the hotel and find some lunch Unfortunately we took his advice We later found turning right would have taken us into a fantastic food festival as well as a beer festival 5 minutes walk from the hotel Shame on you Ernie this is your job to know these things and give good local advice to your guests The room was large clean Breakfast was basic but the coffee was terrible The queue to the coffee machine was always 5 7 deep but no one backed up for seconds For EU8 50 I suggest the option of a 10 min walk to a local caf Don t let this dissuade you from visiting Vienna as it is a truly beautiful city full of charm history wonderful architecture Bars restaurants wonderful people will all leave an indelible stamp in my memory 
500204,Hotel Atlanta, Slightly strange shower head situation but the bathrooms were otherwise fully functional , We had a corner room and it was unexpectedly huge and quite nicely furnished The breakfast was also decent Easy access to the main town via the tram network which links up to the metro system 
500205,Hotel Atlanta, Men at the reception very cold Every interaction was like a kind of matter of fact period , Huge room given for triple occupancy Refrigerator in the room
500206,Hotel Atlanta, Very old building some of the staff were impolite and not friendly except from one man who was very helpful and friendly When we arrived there was a problem with the mini bar but the next day it was fixed , Good location and good price Close to metro and center
500207,Hotel Atlanta, The curtains are transparent so there was problem in the mornings Also the insulation is poor so if you have noisy neighbours you will have problem , The hotel is near the underground and there is the option of tram 
500208,Hotel Atlanta, Nothing was bad everything was adequate Provision of tea and coffee facilities in the rooms would be nice Also some of the furniture needs to be repaired or replaced , The staff were friendly The location was good the tram stopped very near the hotel and it was a ten minute walk to the underground station and twenty minutes to the centre of the old city The hotel is old and needs renovation but the room was clean and comfortable 
500209,Hotel Atlanta, Nothing really bad, Good location near public transports and only a short walk 20 min from the city center Very quiet and confortable Staff always happy to help 
500210,Hotel Atlanta, The staff wasn t exactly chatty but they were helpful and accommodating , Very convenient to the university and the Votivkirche if you don t mind walking several blocks Quiet neighborhood Public transportation is excellent in Vienna so you re guaranteed a fairly short time to get anywhere Breakfast was convenient although crowded on the weekends 
500211,Hotel Atlanta, Didnt like the creaky noisy floor and small bathroom space The breakfast and house keeping could have been better Also the heater didnt work well and when we complained we were told that was the way heaters in Austria work The staff should be more friendly to their guests , The spacious room and proximity to the U station
500212,Hotel Atlanta, Only one iron in the whole hotel which had not been returned so had to go to my business meetings in a wrinkled shirt , Great location with tram stop directly outside Room large and beds comfortable would have been a grand hotel at one time but is tired and needs updating
500213,Hotel Atlanta, Despite quality 3 layered windows some street noise traffic due to windows not being able to close entirely tightly but problem only to sensitive people Try to book room facing inner yard they are scarce Bed blankets a bit dusty One of 2 elevators out of order prolonging waiting times Interior rather old but functioning Reception staff smoking in front of hotel door Overall feel not entirely matching the 4star on Booking com , Practical location close to the center near tram stop Reasonable breakfast Large room with plenty of space we booked standard room 3 persons Good beds Clean in general Character of ancient hotel Reception sells parking cards for street parking 2 1 EUR per hour excluding night 22h 9h which is for free and we could easily find place in the neighbouring street very near 
500214,Hotel Atlanta, One guy at reception was not very friendly and made find of us when we asked about a PIN code on the TV to watch external medias as it didn t seem to know you could watch movies from a USD on a TV Would have been nice to have at least a NEWS channel in English , We liked the size of the room and as Vienna was freezing it was nice to have a hot bath in the room in the evening The hotel is a bit old but clean they are careful of the environment it was easy to park in the street for 5 euros a day thanks to the hotel system Internet was good 
500215,Hotel Atlanta, No tea or coffee making facility Wi Fi on the 3rd floor front not great kept dropping signal Only a small bin in the bathroom none in the room itself Bathroom on the small size taking a shower was a bit cramped , Bed comfortable Location for Volksopera great Some nice restaurants nearby Franco s italian very good 20 25 minutes walk to city centre lots of shops and caf s to peruse Volksopera is worth a visit the performance of the Magic Flute we attended was superb Staff friendly and room clean 
500216,Hotel Atlanta, The hotel is very old which has its charm of course But the shower was very basic furniture extremely old The bed mattress seems to be very old and not comfortable at all Breakfast was very limited and fruit rotten , The location was perfect to reach all the touristy destinations 
500217,Hotel Atlanta, Small room good only for overnight Small bathroom Paid parking not in the hotel , Great bufet style breakfests Beautiful interiors Citybike station across the street Good WiFi connection Kind service 
500218,Hotel Atlanta, Nothing, Every 3 months since 4 years I am staying in this cosy romantic hotel quasi in the center of the city 10 minutes walk to the Ringstrasse The breakfast in the wonderful breakfast room is delicious and not expensive at all The rooms to the court are very quiet but not the rooms to the mainstreet I love that hotel and I am feeling there like at home 
500219,Hotel Atlanta, Missed having tea making facilities in room , Fabulous area Great little place at tram station for coffee cake sandwiches 5 mins walk down the hill Tour bus stop near voltive church 
500220,Hotel Atlanta,No Negative, The room was very spacious The hotel was lovely in its authentic historical style The bed was extremely comfortable We didnt take breakfast but we peaked inside and it seemed really awsome room to have breakfast or any meal 
500221,Hotel Atlanta, The bathroom is very small the box could be larger The single room is small too , The staff and also the fact of the build remains the old Vienna style what that is good It s a good place to stay in terms of costs 
500222,Hotel Atlanta,No Negative, I liked the building and the location of the building It is near a big public transportation hub A short walk or tram s bahn will bring you to Schottentor The breakfast is good Good Wifi The rooms are really spacy and high Despite the tram s bahn or hall way we did not notice any noise or loud sounds 
500223,Hotel Atlanta, Hotel is very basic and the pictures on the Booking com are misleading Parking is a few hundred meters away from the hotel Surroundings are pretty noisy, Free wifi was great Comfortable beds
500224,Hotel Atlanta, No tea or coffee making facility in the rooms and in order to use the hair dryer we would have needed an extra 24 hours to dry my wife s hair , Excellent transport system for getting around Good breakfast at Hotel Atlanta Fantastic city to walk and visit the museums and the historic buildings Great panoramic views from the Donauturm tower We stayed for two nights A visit to Vienna probably requires 4 or 5 nights to do it justice We enjoyed the riverside walks and park areas 
500225,Hotel Atlanta, The hotel it is much older then what it looks like from the pictures You won t feel this sense of freshness and brightness inside the pictures Instead curtains carpet and walls make it old and a bit claustrophobic Also there were not facilities such as toothpaste toothbrush cream I was expecting them in a 4 stars hotel , The hotel is well located and clean It is part of an historic building a really suggestive environment 
500226,Hotel Atlanta, One of the staff in the reception whs not welcoming at all didn t even bother to show us the way to the room and when I asked for number of the reception so I can call him If I need somthing he gave to me and told me to call only if somthing is very necessary am sure you will find this hard to believe but its the true and Also want to mention that the other to guys at the reception were absolutely great, Very clean the location is accepted and the price was great
500227,Hotel Atlanta, Hairdryer a little slow and no nice toiletries in bathroom , Breakfast lovely staff friendly and helpful Big room Good location close to trams to centre or easy walk 
500228,Hotel Atlanta, The pillows were a bit stiff , The room was very spacious comfortable and clean Bathroom was very organized and had all that one would need for a one night trip 
500229,Hotel Atlanta, The rooms were cold and the double bed was made by joining two single beds so effectively twin beds only and the Duvets were only single Duvets only with improperly fitting Duvet covers The heating was not adequate for the size of the rooms which were quite large We asked to be moved into another room the second day but was not much better Would not choose this Hotel again The only positive was the proximity to the city centre and attraction sites so that took away some of our bad feelings ,No Positive
500230,Hotel Atlanta, I think all hotels in Austria are supposed to be non smoking but there s quite a bit of smoking e g one of the guys on reception would smoke out of the window trouble is the smoke would waft all the way in , The rooms are large and nice The beds quite comfortable 
500231,Hotel Atlanta, Parking was offsite It was moderately priced but it could have been even better priced The hotel should negotiate a better deal with parking garage , Staff was helpful Large room for family was perfect Location good 
500232,Hotel Atlanta, Having a modern hotel in a part of an old building is always a challenge Although I ve noticed security cameras all over the hotel the fact that the visitors of other entities in the same building were leaving unpleasant feeling Old room doors were not improving my feeling of unsafety The windy weather outside was making the doors although locked twice to produce slamming noise as long as the windows were open Additional piece of paper on the inner side of the door was informing users of the room about the possibility of burglary and measures which should be taken to prevent material losses in that case I didn t have any problems that night but in general I would feel a little bit safer with a newer doors and door locks Apart from that furniture was very very old I liked it since it fits in to the atmosphere of the building but the beds were making super squicky noise on the slightest movement It didn t disturb my dream but it was not pleasant At the end not to forget that for the price paid room was more than ok , I needed a place to sleep over on my trans EU trip The hotel Atlanta offered the compromise I needed Price was extremely low and I didn t wanted to reis my hopes too high The hotel is as described in a part of a very old building which brings some advantages and disadvantages It has a little bit of charm from the past but on the other side disables functionality of a modern life style The room was on the last floor and roof windows didn t offer much of a view It was a quiet night and I slept well It was also not complicated to find a parking place on the street since it was during the weekend holiday 
500233,Hotel Atlanta, uncomfortable bed unpolitely staff at the reception problems with billing bill not isssued turned out that breakfast is going to be billed twice without any excuse from the recepcionist poor heating shower not clean, very nice waiter at breakfast
500234,Hotel Atlanta, The wifi was hopeless at least on the fourth floor Wifi at reception was much better The rooms have little more in them than beds and a TV No cutlery or jug for example The cleaning staff tended to begin their morning rounds at around 8 30 and walk in without knocking so beware a slower start to your morning , The rooms are large and the place has a delightful style as though you re living in a bygone era The location to the city is good so much so that we felt walking was preferable to public transport during our four night stay 
500235,Hotel Atlanta, Facilities look old and no free water in the room There is no luggage store room so we have to leave our luggages in the public area inside the reception room,No Positive
500236,Hotel Atlanta, No electric kettles in the room , The room was very spacious with a really nice sitting area The reception was very helpful and it was a very clean hotel Loved the traditional wallpaper It is an older boutique situation so it s not for someone looking for a modern setup Ten minute walk to the underground Nice early breakfast option to set you up for the day lots of variety and decent coffee pots 
500237,Hotel Atlanta, We booked two rooms and one was a little big smaller than the other , Very close to the city center The bed was very comfortable and the room was very warm 
500238,Hotel Atlanta,No Negative, The location is perfect Staff is very polite The rooms are more then comfortable and the breakfast was really nice Looking forward to coming back again 
500239,Hotel Atlanta, The hotel doesn t have its own parking space We had to park our car at public parking garage which is about 200m away from the hotel The bed was bit tough , Receptionist was funny and nice Tram is really close from hotel The room was clean and has character 
500240,Hotel Atlanta,No Negative, It was very clean and confortable near to restaurants bars and supermarkets Is not the proper centre but is a safe and nice area close to the University 
500241,Hotel Atlanta, It seems more like a 3 star but very nice , A great hotel with very helpful staff The ambiance and style of the hotel makes it very comfortable and a great choice for Vienna 
500242,Hotel Atlanta,No Negative, The staff and the service was great Mesut Bey at the reception was very helpful and positive In general we were happy with the overall quality and approach 
500243,Hotel Atlanta, No facility in room to make own tea coffee Shower room adequate but quite small , Bed was comfy but only 1 double and sofa used for the twin bed
500244,Hotel Atlanta, There is nothing I didn t like in there , It s my second time in this hotel and I absolutely love the location friendly stuff and nice comfortable rooms 10 minutes walk to Rathaus Parliament building etc I will definitely stay there whenever I go to Vienna 
500245,Hotel Atlanta, The pictures shown on booking com differed from the actual room we got the actual room was much smaller It took the heating about 5 hours to heat the room to a comfortable temperature , location near the city centre
500246,Hotel Atlanta, As an English man I am used to having the provisions supplied for making a hot drink This I missed , The interior of the building was impressive The room very spacious and clean The hotel stands on a busy road however I did not suffer with any noise pollution 
500247,Hotel Atlanta, The staff could be more friendly The building is old it needs maintenance , The room was immensely spacious The hotel itself is located a few minutes away from the city centre 
500248,Hotel Atlanta, Old building needs some maintenance The staff could be more friendly and welcome , The room was immensely spacious The hotel itself is located minutes from the city centre 
500249,Hotel Atlanta, Little things that might irritate some like phone in room not working nor the tv but we weren t fussed about those , Perfect location for the city centre without being right in it Easy public transport and very frequent 
500250,Hotel Atlanta, The reception staff are somewhat dour and could hone their people skills such as smiling once in a while , The hotel is pretty from the outside and quaintly old fashioned inside Previous reviewers have complained about its dated ambience but we found this charming The room was big had all we needed and was despite being on a busy road very quiet The breakfast room evokes a different age and we were perfectly satisfied with the food 
500251,Hotel Atlanta, Many changes now evident My room was freezing cold my complaint was not answered only got heat on the last night of a 5 night stay Paper slips needed for breakfast but not informed of this at reception frustrating , I have stayed here over 30 times in the last 25 years 
500252,Hotel Atlanta, the free wifi was unreliable, the room is very big and clean there is even a classical and beautiful reading room for public the location is good it s just in the middle of two metro stations 
500253,Hotel Atlanta, Carpets could have been more up to date but clean so Ok , The bed was very roomy and comfortable Breakfast food was good with a wide variety of things on offer Only muesli for adult cereal but fuit salad was welcome Staff worked hard Lovely dining room a hotel with period character 
500254,Hotel Atlanta, The room wasn t anything special Functional only no kettle No fan or air con We booked when the hotel was on special offer The full price would not be good value for money , The location was great Two trams to the station but easily walkable to the old town 
500255,Hotel Atlanta, I think the managers should really pay much more attention to cleanliness The ventilator in the bathroom hasn t been cleaned for ages The bath s drain was blocked by hair There are mold stains on the tiles ,No Positive
500256,Hotel Atlanta, Staff in breakfast room could be much more attentive How about a coffee machine My bed was comfy my moms bed had broken duckboard , Amazing location old but charming hotel Great for weekend trip tram station is right out front 1st district is within walking distance No air conditioning but fan was provided Friendly staff very helpful 
500257,Hotel Atlanta, The bathroom could have been bigger It was ultra tiny and it was actually difficult to move around there I am not sure what are the regulations in Austria and I can understand that it is not so easy to achieve in a late XIX century building but these four stars should oblige to something Not very good parking experience garage is external The garage card required at least 4 attempts before it finally got accepted by the machine with a German only user interface Imagine this while someone is already waiting behind , Nice original interiors and furniture Beautiful stained glass windows Quiet neighborhood Many tourist brochures and maps close to the reception
500258,Hotel Atlanta, No ac, Staff is very pleasant and helpful parking garage close clean and affordable rooms clean and spacious a walking distance from the city center 
500259,Hotel Atlanta, Our room was facing the main street and it gets very noisy with the tram cars motorcycles passing by at night Ask for a different room if you want to get a good night sleep , Location is convenient Many shops and restaurants nearby
500260,Hotel Atlanta, 0 AND THE LARGEST I asked them to change the shower gel at least twice when it became empty But it wasn t replaced until my check out This is not a 4 star hotel at all 1 Only one towel in the room when I checked in But it was solved when I asked a receptionist 2 The loud sound of trams near the hotel are extremely noisy 3 The Elevator in the hotel is very strange I click the button just to descend It stopped in the my floor but then it run upward 4 Wi fi is working but it periodically interrupted 5 There is no any sound insulation in the hotel I could to hear a snore of the neighbours in the adjacent room The ventilation in the bathroom is very noisy , This is an amazing house about a century old with a great environment inside I d like to stay here again but I mn t sure about it because of quality price ratio it s not a 4 star hotel The personal is affable but not all problems were solved 
500261,Hotel Atlanta, The wi fi signal is very weak In order to have access to internet it was necessary go to the hallway , Beautiful hotel very well located Tram stop to downtown just a few meters from hotel entrance Downtown is around 10 minutes wallk 
500262,Hotel Atlanta, Breakfast was decent But not worthy for 8 5 Euro per person Cost , 1 Hotel Location 2 Value for money I payed an offer price of 155 Euros for three night stay in a Double room 3 Very comfortable for couples 4 Trams to schottentorare are available very near approx 10 Meters to the hotel 
500263,Hotel Atlanta, Everything about it was old and dated starting from the carpets Room was smelling of tobacco and when I asked the receptionist to do something about it they brushed me off saying what do you want me to do about it They failed to inform me that they have a 24 hour parking facility by payment of 50 euro deposit and 5 euro per day luckily I had an email that mentioned the details that s when they agreed to give me the parking card No air condition or fans in the rooms so it gets stuffy And if the staff ask you to open up the windows dont bother you will end up having a sleepless night , the only good thing about this hotel is that is is located close to tourist attractions that s a walking distance Beds were done up everyday and the bathrooms were all clean so a few brownie points for cleanliness 
500264,Hotel Atlanta, The wifi signal was barely inexistent in our room They don t tell you that you have to pay for the parking of the car , It was clean and the location was ok The room was good enough for the price

500267,Hotel Atlanta, The room could be cleaner The bed was clean though The breakfast could be reacher , Location is good There many tram lines just in front of the hotel The staff is friendly It has some nice design You have plenty of space 
500268,Hotel Atlanta, Well to be without air condition accomodated under roof during hot summer days is quite a disaster This kind of old hotels maybe have its beauty but they should start inovating because if not they can be and they are beaten by new competitors I will next time for sure choose different hotel ,No Positive
500269,Hotel Atlanta, Like many hotels in Europe the beds could ve been a little softer Also bring your own washcloth if you are American because most EU hotels do not have them , Location was perfect for doing lectures at the University building next door Also I lived in this hotel when it was a pension back in 64 to 65 and got to see my old room Breakfast room is very lovely and large with friendly staff and lots of wonderful food The location is excellent for catching the Strassenbahn to go either up to the Volks Opera or down to Ring The university medical school is right behind it If you have problems with noise sleeping be sure to ask for a room on the backside of the hotel facing the University 
500270,Hotel Atlanta, very noisy outside because of the hot weather and lack of air conditioning we had to keep the windows open which made it difficult to sleep free parking on the street available nearby only after 10 pm otherwise you have to re park few streets further or pay for the underground parking, Good location in the city centre tasty breakfast

500276,Hotel Atlanta, One Very peculiar staff member at front desk Non apologetic unfriendly uncaring attitude towards guests who took it upon himself to charge my hubbie s card not once but twice without informing me whatsoever of his intentions during weeks 1 2 of my 4 week stay at this Hotel which was supposed to be be settled as a full CASH payment at the end of my stay , Very comfortable bed large rooms value for money breakfast very well presented in tableclothed oldy worldy elegant room with a very friendly smiley head of house lady of waiting

500340,Hotel Atlanta, This hotel is like a story from the Gogol s novel Dead souls There is an army of poor Russian women totally exploited by the local Austrian owners and they work like slaves Therefore the only thing which the hotel can sell apart the location is that the bed sheets are clean and well ironed thanks to the slaves The atmosphere is like if you enter late 17 sentry cast society Someone is making huge amount of money there out of nothing Hotel is advertised as a 4 star and this is a bad joke The shower in first room they put me in was at the level of my breasts I am 165 sm so if you need to wash your hair you have to bow In a 4 star hotel The bath tub was broken and overall there was a dust in the room in the air After I complained they put me in a second room which had a broken window and I could not sleep because I could hear the traffic I wanted to iron and they told me that the only place to iron is the entrance to the breakfast room where you iron and the people who have breakfast are looking at you and observing how you iron This could be with difficulties 2 5 star hotel maximum Apart from that they prefer payments in cash like everyone in Vienna , The only thing I liked about this hotel is the location
