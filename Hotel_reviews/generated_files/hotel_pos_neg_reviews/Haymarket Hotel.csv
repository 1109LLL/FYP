14708,Haymarket Hotel, nothing, The staff were excellent the location is spot on in theatre district the rooms were lovely the air con died in the unusually hot day in London so they moved us to another room and offered refreshments as compensation The best We will return hopefully 
14709,Haymarket Hotel, The evening service in Brummus the hotel restaurant was lacklustre compared to the excellent service at breakfast the following morning , Fabulous bed and linen The Haymarket is THE cleanest hotel I have stayed in Staff are lovely Decor exuberant and fun The breakfast is very good indeed For such a central location it feels very tranquil 
14710,Haymarket Hotel, Nothing Everything was amazing , Words cannot express the amazingness that is this hotel From the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out the service has been by far the best i have ever received at a hotel The room was beautiful bathroom is gorgeous the hotel is just breathtaking My husband and i were set to elope in the city but due to the rain they let us use the library for our vows and let us take professional pictures around the hotel They treated us like royalty and we cannot wait to return 
14711,Haymarket Hotel, I can t think of anything , The hotel found out it was my 60th Birthday and they upgraded our room We met our friends for cocktails in the Brumus bar which had a good range of cocktails They even arranged fantastic weather all blue sky 
14712,Haymarket Hotel, The pool was too cold even for the children and they said they could not turn it up which is such a shame and explains why it is not used The staff in restaurant were abrasive and slow with poor English, Food and reception and rooms were fabulous
14713,Haymarket Hotel, Check in information we were not provided information of serving times for breakfast where it was served or check out time A very minor issue , Beautiful decor and lovely touches with free gifts 
14714,Haymarket Hotel, on tv no german news programs swimming pool not enough heated and around the pool no possibility to lay after swimming on a deck chair or a lie there are only normal chairs and 2 sofas before the bar on breakfast grilled toast often black burnt but for all that not more hot, beautiful and very comfortable room on breakfast very good croissants fruits are very aromatic in optimal maturity
14715,Haymarket Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful hotel I would highly recommend Beautiful well appointed rooms fantastic staff and facilities Fantastic location and food Thanks for a great stay 
14716,Haymarket Hotel, I could have stayed longer , Everything this is my favourite London hotel with incredibly comfortable rooms staff that do everything to make your stay enjoyable and breakfasts that are varied and always enjoyable 
14717,Haymarket Hotel, I thought the breakfast could have done with some work We had room service and that was fine the timing was excellent but there could have been a little more attention to detail , The staff were attentive and thoughtful They were happy to answer questions and print off our theatre tickets etc a very pleasant stay with the thoughtful little touches you d expect Turning down the sheets in the evening giving a fragrance to the room my wife loved very good 
14718,Haymarket Hotel, It would have been nice to include tea coffee making facilities in the room and a pen or two along with the letter writing things rather than a pencil When we stayed in the Covent Garden Hotel we were all given a free scented candle A few more treats and trimmings for the price of the room would have been nice though we had a really good stay , Very comfy bed and lovely room Excellent shower and breakfast Very friendly and helpful staff and room service was quick We loved the decor and the relaxed atmosphere and we were in such a good location for theatre going and restaurants 
14719,Haymarket Hotel, Having to leave and not being able to stay longer, This hotel IS worth the money The room and the decor of the whole hotel is wonderful having been designed by Kit Kemp with an eclectic mix of items and furnishings which work so well together We ate at the Brumus restaurant and enjoyed excellent ambience service and food Breakfast was served here as well and again was excellently presented with good service The location is great being convenient for theatre land and areas such as china town and soho 
14720,Haymarket Hotel, Not all staff on front desk were attentive Lady was really nice younger man told us to take a seat whilst he checked our room was ready and then forgot about us, Hotel and room were nice and good location
14721,Haymarket Hotel, Because the room was so lovely and offered a comfy sitting area it would have been a plus to have had tea coffee making facilities This is not a complaint however , The whole experience for our special wedding anniversary was amazing A bottle of champagne on our arrival This is the place to visit for luxury without stuffiness Food in the restaurant was sublime and the breakfasts offered a huge choice from very healthy to full English The staff were amazing the room super comfy and even though we live only 45 minutes away will be using this gorgeous establishment often 
14722,Haymarket Hotel, Bed pillows not firm enough for me , Delicious breakfast Great lounging area Really comfortable bed Excellent shower Really helpful pleasant staff All extras needed in room 
14723,Haymarket Hotel, The lounge area in bedroom could have been a little larger, Excellent breakfast A special mention to all the members of reception inc concierge they were fantastic
14724,Haymarket Hotel,No Negative, The beds are exquisite food exemplary and staff exceptionally friendly and helpful at all times of the day They even sorted a little secret room decor for my other half s birthday which included helium balloons and champagne They went above and beyond to keep the our upgrade secret too Wonderful trip 
14725,Haymarket Hotel, Nothing could have been improved upon , The staff were very attentive The facilities were superb The decor and cleanliness were excellent The location perfect 
14726,Haymarket Hotel, The only criticism of the hotels is that you are unable to make a cup of coffee or tea and must always use room service It isn t a problem for a one night stay but for longer it becomes a nuisance and also expensive , Firmdale hotels always feel so welcoming and comfortable Nothing is too much trouble eg printing out tickets 
14727,Haymarket Hotel, I did mention this to the management on my departure regarding the unacceptable noise that emanated from the room above From about 5 pm onwards to well after 10 30 it sounded as if a group of acrobates were practicing their act Running and jumping One evening I rang up reception to the unacceptable noise from the above floor They had no explanation of the of what was happening It occurred every evening that I stayed at the hotel , Breakfast were really delicious with an excellent choice of temping offers Loved the spacious well appointed room
14728,Haymarket Hotel, Smell of drains in the bathroom when emptying the bath only one roll of toilet paper which meant we used tissues until the room was serviced then they gave us two Only tiny things though didn t really matter , All of the staff esp reception and bar people Paul and a lovely Soanish lady we didn t catch her name Also the lovely concierge staff who parked and returned our car and packed it so carefully for us Location was excellent Loved the furnishings and the laid back feel if the place 
14729,Haymarket Hotel, us not stopping long enough , On arrival my newly wed wife and i were upgraded to a better room The room was excellent and a nice surprise awaited us an ice cold bottle of Preseco and gorgeous strawberries with white chocolate The staff were all amazing thank you for making our stay memorable 
14730,Haymarket Hotel, It would be nice if the hotel could put up a more noticeable sign that we could see from the main road It wasn t fun for an 83 year old lady to have to walk back and forth just to find the entrance Also personally if the swimming pool isn t so functional please don t advertise about it To me it was like you re cheating the customers To have a proper pool you need to have a proper changing room with a shower for both sexes Guests should not be expected to change in the toilet , We liked the location right in the heart of everything whether it s Trafalgar Square National Gallery Soho or Piccadilly the cleanliness space of the room it was really BIG with big very comfortable beds the breakfast good the staff polite helpful My 83 year old mother especially liked the little services in the room e g the personal welcoming note the 6 pm tradition that the maid had to come to recheck the room get the bed ready for her sleep The interior ground floor was wonderfully designed to show a blend of the old world and the avant garde The library was cozy and fitting for a nice reading time 
14731,Haymarket Hotel, had to leave soon, Location hotel decor room decor and cleanliness bathroom breakfast swimming pool everything is comfortable and makes you want to stay longer Will definitely stay again 
14732,Haymarket Hotel, That we couldn t stay longer , The bath was so relaxing and having the television in the bathroom meant to didn t have to watch the cricket We enjoyed a wide selection of drinks in the bar and spent the following morning in the swimming pool which warmed up once we d been in a few minutes The staff were lovely and we felt spoilt from the moment we walked through the doors 
14733,Haymarket Hotel, Drinks were slow in arriving at dinner because the bar was very busy Wine arrived after we had finished our main course So 3 4 of a bottle was left behind , The beds were extra comfy Staff were very helpful and friendly Everywhere was spotlessly clean 
14734,Haymarket Hotel, Checkout wasn t good I found the lady that dealt with me was discourteous and abrupt Also the location wasn t as ideal for us as I thought it would be , Lovely comfy bed and quiet bedroom 
14735,Haymarket Hotel, Lack of tea coffee making facilities also the bath took an incredibly long time to fill, The friendliness of the staff and the quality of the products in the mini bar
14736,Haymarket Hotel, Only downside of an otherwise perfect stay was a slightly snooty member of staff in the bar but that was it and it didn t spoil the stay , Lovely hotel very comfortable quiet room everything I needed and breakfast was excellent 
14737,Haymarket Hotel, It would have been nice if tea and coffee making facilities had been provided We were brought cups and saucers and fresh milk and were offered a kettle we had brought our own but it would have been better to have had these already in the room with sachets of coffee and tea bags We were confused by the organisation at breakfast It seems we should have waited for our order for cooked dishes to be taken before we served ourselves from the buffet but this was not explained to us when we were shown to our table , We had a large newly refurbished room which had been elegantly decorated The bathroom was very large and spotlessly clean When we returned from an evening out the towels we had used had been replaced and the bins emptied Our pre theatre dinner was good with excellent service from our waiter who completely understood that we had only limited time 
14738,Haymarket Hotel, Nothing , Central location friendly and helpful staff great restaurant with excellent breakfast all areas are beautifully decorated the rooms a bright spacey and clean bathrooms are perfect good pool and gym facilities free high speed wifi All in all a great base to enjoy London 
14739,Haymarket Hotel, Literally nothing It is perfect , Everything about this hotel was top notch The hotel is perfectly located near key attractions but not too in the middle of the tourist mess The rooms are elegant and well appointed with luxurious modern amenities The staff is attentive as suits the level a luxury hotel demands they went over the top in every aspect While it is not for budget travelers the value of the hotel is well beyond what it costs I will never stay anywhere else 
14740,Haymarket Hotel, Flexible reading lights in the room would have been an improvement The pricing structure for breakfast is rather complicated , Delightful smiling staff high standard of decoration and furnishings very welcoming and comfortable convenient location What s not to like 
14741,Haymarket Hotel, Did not like the fact that when we arrived on Friday and checked out on the Monday morning at 11 30am that we could not use the lovely swimming pool area we purposely booked this hotel because it had a swimming pool there was a private function on there on Saturday Sunday very disappointing, hotel is a fantastic location literally within a few mins walking distance to everything very helpful staff extremely comfortable beds and the suites were excellent
14742,Haymarket Hotel, No Coffee Making Facilities in the room becoming increasingly common in hotels these days , Absolutely one of the best rooms ive stayed in gorgeous and clean 
14743,Haymarket Hotel, Renovation works being carried out in the room above very noisy had to ring and complain as it sounded like they were about to knock through into our room They stopped the work this was the afternoon we checked in However the next morning we could hear people going in and out of the room from 5 30am No in room tea or coffee facilities which is a shame as we didn t want to have to call down just for a cup of tea , Loved the location of the hotel Great sized bathroom and bedroom Very clean and bright 
14744,Haymarket Hotel, Upon arrival we were told the pool gym spa area were closed for a private party Not good enough at all You advertised a significant feature which you then failed to let us have benefit from , The room location beautiful lounges bar 
14745,Haymarket Hotel,No Negative, Stunning stunning stunning Hotel decor was room decor even swimming pool decor was beautifully designed Excellent and professional staff Attention to detail handwritten welcome note chocolates and gorgeous smelling Kit Kemp bathroom goodies
14746,Haymarket Hotel, The light levels in the room were not really adequate for reading a book the newspaper in the evening We find this is a problem common to most hotels what is required is a standard lamp behind the settee easy chairs However it is rare to find a room with one the assumption seems to be that guests look at a computer or watch the TV rather than read , The staff the location and having a quiet room
14747,Haymarket Hotel, No bad experiences, Friendly helpful efficient staff especially the bar restaurant workers the bellmen All went out of their way to make one feel relaxed welcome 
14748,Haymarket Hotel, we were not told in advance to going out for the evening that the bars were closed that evening for a private party so we went out for dinner and when we came back to have a drink in the bar we were told we could only go back to our room for a drink which was very disappointing if we had been warned of this we could of planned to stay out later , Loved the style of the hotel and personnel touches pool area was lovely and had 2 great massages The gym was impressive and mini bar was great 
14749,Haymarket Hotel,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful and friendly very accommodating for us being out at unsociable hours and holding our luggage whilst we were out after check out
14750,Haymarket Hotel, Pool was to die for but changing room not well signed and temperature of water was cool cold perhaps bracing best adjective , The friendly staff breakfast and afternoon tea were excellent very attentive without making you feel uncomfortable 
14751,Haymarket Hotel, Our shower had clogged drain of water so I think the room shouldn t be sold Bed mattress was a little hard, Location Reception noticed that during the stay I had my birthday and I got a little cake sweet 
14752,Haymarket Hotel, Nothing , We thoroughly enjoyed our stay The staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful and our room was very nice the bed the most comfortable we have had in all the hotels we have stayed in There is also every facility you may need We would most definitely stay here again Location also excellent 
14753,Haymarket Hotel,No Negative, We felt so well looked after there are only 50 rooms so you feel like you have the run of the place and the staff couldn t do enough to help We had a late Saturday night dinner in the Brumus restaurant which was also excellent The location is perfect very close to the theatres restaurants and bars but just tucked away in a quiet side street fantastic experience we have already booked again for December 
14754,Haymarket Hotel, Nothing, The hotel was excellent in every way and the service was second to none We particularly enjoyed the breakfast and the pool The location of the hotel could not be better
