214921,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was just too small to be comfortable we had to put the small chair into the hall to fit our 2 cases into the room , Location is excellent and staf friendly and attentive The bed was good
214922,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was absolutely tiny claustrophobic and oppressive there was one tiny high level skylight and on the event of a fire outside in the corridor this would have made for a very unlikely means of escape reception staff were extremely defensive when asked about the size of the room and if there were any others available and shunned the fact we had used booking dot com to make our reservation , The location was perfect the hotel was smart and clean
214923,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was a deluxe double The only light was a small velux roof light that you couldn t open The bed was up tight to walls on 3 sides it was a broom cupboard And it s twice as big as a standard double apparently , Going home Good bathroom It had less claustrophobia than the bed room 
214924,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Nothing , Despite the Central London location the hotel was very quiet and perfectly situated for anyone like me who requires somewhere decent to stay the night after attending the late show and the late late show at Ronnie Scott s which is just a few yards away Although a little small the single room in which I stayed was spotlessly clean had an extremely comfortable bed a large television on the wall at the foot of it which I didn t have time to use and a small adjoining washroom shower that can only be described as luxurious I didn t arrive at the hotel until 9 15pm and after having a quick drink at the bar I left for Ronnie Scott s at 10 00pm and didn t return until just after 3 00am when I crawled into bed and slept like a log until my pre arranged wake up call at 10 30am A thoroughly enjoyable experience as a result of which I have no hesitation in highly recommending this hotel to anyone who proposes to stay in this part of London either as a tourist or like me as someone whose function doesn t end until long after their last train has departed 
214925,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was incredibly small The smallest hotel room i have every stayed in No room for more than one person , Great location and good bar downstairs 
214926,Mimi s Hotel Soho, We booked a suite But this maybe the biggest room in Mimi s but not a suite by any definition It was a smallish room with a double bed and a tiny armless chair That is it We got to the hotel 1 hour before check in The room was ready but we were told that we would have to pay an extra 40 to go in the room What the I have never come across this before anywhere in the world Fair enough if it was a few hours before but It is really noisy outside the hotel so you will need their complimentary ear plugs , Very conveniently placed Nice staff Good quality furnishings Prosecco on check in 
214927,Mimi s Hotel Soho, the rooms are really really tiny no room for a suitcase or to move around no room in the cupboard like bathroom don t book if you re claustrophobic, The bar is really cosy with a wealth of nice drinks and cocktails great barman from France The location right off Soho square couldn t be better on Frith street nice boutique feel to it great beds
214928,Mimi s Hotel Soho, No windows at the room The room is extremely small there is no place for luggage or even to move , The staff was very friendly and very helpful with any question 
214929,Mimi s Hotel Soho, This is a hotel that focuses on location first The rooms are tiny but functional Based on where you are there is little reason to hang out in your room so mostly not an issue The main complaint I had was as a tall person the bed was a little snug , The location is absolutely amazing You walk out the door and right into a sea of pubs and restaurants Just a short few blocks away and you re at Seven Dials another block and you re in Covent Garden There are several tube stations within a short walk too 
214930,Mimi s Hotel Soho, If you have a room with a window and you don t sleep well you can find the rooms a bit noisy I love the sounds of a city so no probs for me There is very little room to put your stuff away so the room easily gets messy The rooms are small but very very comfortable Despite this I will always visit Mimi s when I want to visit Soho Covent Garden etc, Everything in Mimi s is beautiful and well decorated The staff is wonderful both reception cleaning and the guys from the bar I visited Mimi s both for business and for fun and I will definitely recommend it 
214931,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Bigger room, Room was well appointed and nicely decorated but really really small It would be too small for a lot of people and definitely only for one person 
214932,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room could have been bigger It being called a suite and the photos of it made it look a lot bigger than it actually was , Comfy bed Good shower 
214933,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room is quite small but has everything I need Soho area is quite noisy at night It s not the hotel s fault Hotel has provided the earplug however I didn t notice until next morning as I arrived late was too tired , I like the style of the hotel very high standard The room and shower is very clean Even the hand shower gels are Molton Brown Staff are friendly the bar is nice too 
214934,Mimi s Hotel Soho, We were in a Basement windowless room and so were woken up by deliveries in the morning The bed was squeezed between two walls so access was difficult There was no power point next to the bed or nightstand or bedside shelf for water things The room also had no wardrobe or any means to hang up clothes other than one hook behind the door The lighting in the bathroom was very dark and there was no magnifying mirror Applying make up as difficult , The staff were super friendly and attentive 
214935,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was tiny There was no wardrobe in the room only 2 legs with 2 hangers plus 2 legs in the bathroom There was no chair to sit just a little stool We stayed for 4 nights and I d asked for a room in the ground floor as I ve got a back problem I booked in February we stayed in July but they couldn t accommodate that one request The lack of amenities in the room made me think that it was a room that they should allocate for single day night bookings certainly not 4 nights Most of our clothes had to stay in our suitcase as there were only 2 hangers and 2 hanging pegs There was no iron to use and because the room was so small we had to keep the suitcases on top of a dressing table a dressing table that had no mirror to use while I did my makeup so I used the bathroom for that which meant my hubby my hubby had to wait until I was finished to have a shower because you can t do makeup using a steamed up mirror There is a full length mirror in the room but the lighting in the room was very dim to add a sexy vibe to the room I suppose but it would ve been nice to have the option of having a bright light too esp as the one window we had was tiny The light dimmers by the bed were very temperamental There s only one bedside table This is because although the bed is very comfortable and a great size it was pushed against the wall with the window great fun trying to open and close the curtains so one person always has to climb over the other to get out We ended up moving the pillows to the wall so that we could get out easier but the bed is also very high and both my husband and I found it a challenge to climb into and get off of We both left with sore backs One more thing We decided to have a drink at a table outside so we ordered 2 rhubarb gin and tonics We were charged 29 This is daylight robbery , I love the location and the way that the place is designed and decorated The mattress was very comfortable and the size was excellent The TV was fab very big and a huge choice of channels The WiFi is free too which is a nice bonus The molten brown items in the bathroom are a nice touch and the scent used in the hallways is beautiful I loved that The staff were very amenable too 
214936,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Phenomenal location well appointed rooms with top of the line sheets and towels Rooms were also very quiet which is nice for being in the heart of things four doors down from Soho Square 
214937,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The size of the room came as a bit of a shock we knew we had booked one without a window but snug was putting it mildly Okay for one night but not for longer , The quality of the contents of the room were of the highest standard We were not happy with our initial room below ground but it was altered to a 3rd floor one with no fuss 
214938,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The rooms are not over big but it s clearly stated in the booking process As you are staying in Soho there can be some noise from the streets from late night revellers , Very cool and stylish boutique hotel excellent location Incredibly friendly helpful and accommodating staff Very comfortable beds 
214939,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Maybe another pillow would have been good, Bed was very comfy although just one pillow My room didnt have a view and was very small but i knew that just be aware no where to store more than one small bag 
214940,Mimi s Hotel Soho, the roqomwaqs tiny and had no tea or coffee making facilities within the room, the decor was excellent and overall the the hotel a elegant boutique feel
214941,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Paid 145 for one midweek night but no breakfast included , Location ambience decor shower pressure high quality of everything Room size was small but very well designed and finished Did not have much luggage so small size did not bother me 
214942,Mimi s Hotel Soho, I can t think of anything I didn t like , Despite the Central London location the hotel was very quiet and perfectly situated for anyone like me who requires somewhere decent to stay the night after attending the late show and the late late show at Ronnie Scott s which is just a few yards away Although a little small the single room in which I stayed was spotlessly clean had an extremely comfortable bed a large television on the wall at the foot of it which I didn t have time to use and a small adjoining washroom shower that can only be described as luxurious I didn t arrive at the hotel until 9 15pm and after having a quick drink at the bar I left for Ronnie Scott s at 10 00pm and didn t return until just after 3 00am when I crawled into bed and slept like a log until my pre arranged wake up call at 10 30am A thoroughly enjoyable experience and one I will be repeating in a couple of weeks when I m staying there again to attend a further late show and late late show at Ronnie Scott s I have no hesitation in highly recommending this hotel to anyone who proposes to stay in this part of London either as a tourist or like me as someone whose function doesn t end until long after their last train has departed 
214943,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The small rooms We booked a window room but were told that none were available on check in, VERY small rooms you dont want to spend much time in room but in the middle of SOHO why would you Good place to rest your head for the night
214944,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Our room was good beautiful deco but it had no windows , Staff was particularly helpful the room was ok with a great bathroom The location is just perfect 
214945,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Room was very very small despite being the lux suite having no windows and been that small it was rather claustrophobic to say the least , staff were friendly
214946,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, The position in soho was brilliant Easy walking distance to everything Great coffee at flat white which is just around the corner Staff were absolutely brilliant couldn t be more helpful and charming Room was so cozy and the shower was the best rainfall shower ever 
214947,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Everything is small not just the room bathroom but the bar eating area reception etc No pastries available at breakfast they hadn t arrived yet , Great location Good quality finishes to everything Room temperature control appeared to work brilliantly with no noise Comfortable bed 
214948,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms a little small but not a problem also paint is quite dark red so visually makes the rooms smaller but again not a problem we will be back, Very comfy beds nice bar quiet room
214949,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Not that they could change it but the rooms were small Apparently our room was one of the bigger ones Not a bother at all though we found it to be very cosy The room was more of a place for us to store our luggage and sleep , The staff was remarkably helpful and so courteous We ended up knowing them on first name basis Great location that was centralized to everything we were looking to see and do 
214950,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Bit more room but given the brilliant location I was happy to swap size for place after all Size is nt everything o , fabulous location and quirky cabin like room I loved it 
214951,Mimi s Hotel Soho, There weren t any tea and coffee facilities in the room which is a bit bizzare for a hotel in my opinion The immediate area around the hotel needs some regenerating and the local bars attracted some loud characters making sleeping at night a little bit difficult However these are minor faults seeing as though I only really used the room to sleep and nothing more, The cleanliness of the room was top notch as well as the comfort of the bed Staff were friendly and always happy to help and advise with any queries Soho town centre is a 2 minute walk away as well as Tottenham Court Road tune stop making it easy to get around 
214952,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Lovely hotel and usefully has aircon it was very hot when I stayed Had a windowless room which was great for sleep very dark and quiet Probably too small for 2 people but great for me 
214953,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Unacceptable room size Unacceptable service a hostel charged as 4 , Worst place in London Unacceptable Don t be misled to go there it has no star and is worse than a hostel You are charged to a deluxe double room which is 7 sq m and not 14 Complains are not taken as the manager is always busy Off course you are duly charged in advance so that you cannot opt out without waiting for a refund Again never go there unless you are looking for a bed and not for a room 
214954,Mimi s Hotel Soho, No tea coffee making facilities in room, After an initial cock up with the booking on the hotels part and having to stay in a cabin room the first night the whole staff went out their way to sort the problem especially a young lady called malle who went out her way to make sure the rest of the weekend was perfect
214955,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Very heavy fire doors to open we had to help my mum out of her room as the door was too heavy for her to pull open Also be aware that a skylight is classed as a window and the rooms are small Small cock up with the rooms I had booked as 2 of them were not available despite having booked and confirmed with Booking com 2 months previously Next time I will book directly This matter was eventually cleared up by the lovely manageress including a refund for the difference in the rooms , Excellent accommodation brilliant location very friendly and helpful staff bar 1 individual receptionist who could do with a little more training 
214956,Mimi s Hotel Soho, the room is ridiculously small 207 even though I normally don t mind the size of the room but this one was basically the bed with ca 1 1 5 metres of space on two sides of it with two sides limited to the wall No place to put your things luckily we had only 1 suit case as two would have simply not fit No cupboards no shelves just two small cloaks on the wall for hanging something No space to lay down anything from hands in the bathroom either even if there would be space there to put somekind of a counter next to the sink , The location is superb The bed was great but the pillows were very very bad with litterally no filling and support even asking for a second pillow did not help they were full of air and collapsed into thin pads as you put your head on them no support 
214957,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms very small smaller than advertised and no window very dissapointed as booked and paid for window 2 glasses of prosecco didn t help could have least offered a discount and a bottle , Location good and high quality fit out 
214958,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, The room was small but had everything I needed for one night I booked the room while I attended a party and was perfect There was no window but there was aircon so the room felt fresh and they give you free bottles of water 
214959,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Room in basement with no window approx 5 sq m small There are seven of such rooms Was not mentioned on website and or confirmation No mobile reception and no full available WLAN Cut off from the world Some may like this , Design Molton Brown soaps friendly staff fairly new six months 
214960,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The man in the office block seen my half naked body through the window while I was sleeping through the window which is at bed level , Small room but awesome experience Who needs big rooms when you have free movies lol
214961,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The complimentary water needs refrigeration on saying that perhaps pre refrigeration and a small cool bag in the room as space is at a premium , The staff were welcoming friendly and super efficient The coffee was delicious as was my breakfast The room was compact but perfect clean comfortable great free movie selection Miami s hotel is a nugget of gold and the staff are the sparkly jewels that adorn it making you me feel a million dollars I will most definitely recommend this hotel and booking com to friends 
214962,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The rooms are tiny but very well appointed They could do with a little more storage space e g shelving , The room had great sound proofing While the hotel is in a vibrant central location the room was extremely quiet 
214963,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Not suitable for travellers with big suitcases there is no place to put it in , The hotel for those who visit London for not sitting at the hotel The room is pretty small but have all necessary for good journey good bed and very good and modern bathroom The location is also perfect for walking 
214964,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Nothing , What an absolute gem of a hotel smack in the centre of London We had a suite Thank you Mimi s which was perfect in every way This quirky boutique style hotel oozes character and style The staff are fabulous and the room was great from the d cor to the comfy mattress to the dimmable mood lights The bathroom was well equipped even had underfloor heating and heated mirror We were a little worried why they supplied earplugs on the bedside tables nice touch btw but we didn t need them We didn t eat or drink here just didn t have time but we re sure it would have been great I believe some of the rooms are a little compact but how much time do you really spend in the room when in London We can guarantee they are all spotlessly clean and well appointed Besides look at the price then look at the location You couldn t get any better 
214965,Mimi s Hotel Soho, We had a skylight in our room that caused the room to be flooded with sunlight from 5am This was not really a problem for us but some lighter sleepers might have found it annoying , The location of this hotel was perfect We had tickets to Harry Potter on Shaftesbury Avenue and it was less than 5 mins walk So many restaurants and bars to go to before and after the theatre Really handy for the shops transport links Loved it 
214966,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Poky poky room they call it compact My wife had to climb over me in bed to get to the toilet and you could not pass one another in the room No coffee making facilities no wardrobe just two hangers for two people for two nights We left after one night , The ambience was great 
214967,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was absolutely tiny and there was nowhere to unpack or hang your clothes I had two suitcases with me and had to move one in and out of the shower each time as there was nowhere else to store it There was literally about one square metre of standing space in the bedroom aside from the bed , Great location surrounded by loads of restaurants and bars and very friendly staff The power shower was fantastic and free Molton Brown shower gels an added bonus Initially I worried about the street noise greeted by what I thought was free mints but turned out to be free earplugs in the room although actually most street noise died down by 11 15 or so I had a room with a window but in rooms this tiny with no window think I might have felt a bit claustrophobic 
214968,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Lighting is too dim in the bedrooms and bathroom Difficult to apply makeup Dislike service charge included in the bill , Ambience location cleanliness and service 
214969,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Underground windowless room was little strange bed felt like sleeping in a ship berth Didnt like the metal bar details on ceiling strange austere interior design feature Room was however very comfy for a nights sleep just no room to relax other than just for an overnight stay Perfect for business though Good value for location , Location superb right in heart of soho The bar was lovely particularly for lone female traveller Bed fantastic comfy like clever attention to detail in room Great bathroom Sound proofing fantastic 
214970,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Continental breakfast could have been better coffee wasn t hot and croissant came without butter or marmalade, Bed was comfy and shower brilliant everything was first class quality Space was small but adequate 
214971,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Room was sooooooooooooo small like being in a coffin No window and felt really claustrophobic Would not stay again , Bed was comfy air con good and free wifi 
214972,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room is tiny which we knew when booking so not a problem but slightly difficult for 2 people to get ready given lack of floor space We thought this room was pay on arrival as all other hotels through booking com have been so were a little disconcerted to find we had been sent an e mail stating that payment had been attempted from the card given and that the room would be cancelled if we did not reply by 2pm Luckily we checked in before 2pm as had not checked emails but we thought this was very harsh and we would have been stranded with no accommodation , The room and bathroom was lovely and the quality of towels and toiletries high The large TV and free movies were also fantastic and the location amazing Air conditioning was very good 
214973,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, The AC works very well we were thankful for that having a top floor room with only a skylight We thought that the skylight only room was a bummer at first but it ended up that it was quieter than the other rooms would have been Soho is alive 
214974,Mimi s Hotel Soho, the room was too small I couldn t even take two steps it was ridiculously small to the point that it made me want to move to another hotel Not worth the price , location
214975,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, The staffs were all friendly and helpful that makes people feel relaxed especially after a long business day The only problem would be the bed cause it was so cozy that I didnt want to get up for work 
214976,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The rooms are beyond tiny Some don t even have windows This is like sleeping in a tiny box The staff is not very well trained they don t know how to answer most of the requests Breakfast service is not efficient only one person to order prepare and serve so the wait is very long The food is very basic frozen croissant and expensive and they didn t have 2 of my choices , Perfect location in the center of SoHo
214977,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Leave the breakfast 50 paces down the road is better coffee and fresh not stale pastries at Bar Italia , Location Linen Molton Brown toiletries Free movies And the bar downstairs is the best who cares about windows anyway 
214978,Mimi s Hotel Soho, bedroom size of cupboard with only a roof window that you can t open 40 extra charge for an early check in although the room was already done , great location
214979,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was literally a large cupboard no window so very claustrophobic Bar staff nice Reception staff grumpy and mumbled Think Harry Potter under the stairs or the Emperor s New Clothes ie they tell you it s a hotel room but the reality is it is a cupboard , Good location
214980,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, The hotel was in the best location the staff was amazing and extremely helpful the rooms was quite and all movies was free beds where comfortable and the room had air conditioning the bathroom was all marble and the walk in shower was very big I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in central London I have booked again for my next visit already 
214981,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Mimis Hotel is the ideal place to stay for a London Trip The hotel has just opened a couple of month ago so everything is shiny and new all important Sightseeing hot spots are either in walking distance or quick to reach via public transport and the staff is welcoming friendly and happy to help with everything My room was clean cozy and I had an incredibly comfy bed definitely great value for your money 
214982,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Very small room No wardrobe No surface in the bathroom shower to put personal bath items or shower bag , The bed was big and comfortable Free movies in the TV Friendly staff Good shower with heated mirror No noise from other rooms and corridor 
214983,Mimi s Hotel Soho, payment taken before I arrived my booked room had been taken the room they offered in exchange was dirty the room they finally found for me was in the basement with no windows hot tiny 2m x 3m including the ensuite claustrophobic and barely had room to open the door The essential air con was noisy I woke with a headache The double bed was short enough that I had to sleep diagonally The ensuite was so small that it was hard to bathe and dry without banging elbows and knees 0 6m 1 5m for miniscule loo miniscule sink and miniscule shower , They didn t charge me extra for finding me an alternative room after giving someone else me the room I had originally booked Apparently the room I ended up with was larger than the one originally booked though given the size of the room I was given I find that virtually impossible to believe I did eventually get to sleep The bed was reasonably comfortable The bathroom had hot and cold water available 
214984,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room we stayed in was painted a plumb Colour with the ambient lighting I found it hard to put my makeup on I spoke to the reception staff about this minor issue and they were most helpful giving advice on how to control the lighting They also gave me the numbers of rooms which were painted lighter so that when I came to stay again I could choose another room , Mimis Hotel was wonderful A little piece of Heaven in the heart of bustling Soho All the staff were friendly inviting and warm they were so helpful They accommodation was Five Stars The bed was comfortable and the towels plentiful and soft The sound proofing was also great My Daughter and I stayed for four nights and would highly recommend Mimis Hotel we will return The Hotel also makes great cocktails in the bar 
214985,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, The room was very clean and tidy and the bed was really comfortable Excellent location extremely central The housekeepers were very friendly and the reception staff was great helpful and always ready to answer any question 
214986,Mimi s Hotel Soho, I love the idea of this tiny room There are a few things that would have made it better A shelf of the bathroom makes sense And another hook or shelf by the bed would also be great Also some conditioner in the shower there was body wash and shampoo only But these are just small things , Cute and very tiny room Good for a solo traveler not planning to spend a lot of time at the hotel 5 pastry and coffee breakfast deal is great 
214987,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Cosy rooms equals tiny rooms Fantstic Bed linen etc but room not much bigger than the bed Would probably suit younger people better Don t like having to climb over my partner in the middle of the night to get to the loo , Great location and friendly staff
214988,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Neighbourhood is kinda noisy and there s a pub downstairs but rooms are soundproofed and hotel provides complimentary earplugs Bathroom didn t have a vanity no table to place your toiletries so we had to keep them on the floor otherwise very nice , Very central location in the heart of soho easy access by three different tube stations and great restaurants in immediate vicinity Comfy bed and great bathroom 
214989,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was smaller than my garden shed It would have been too small for me on my own and I am petit but was ridiculous for two of us The bathroom was no better You could sit on the toilet wash your feet in the shower and wash your hands in the sink all at the same time We were offered the option to upgrade to a suite albeit more money but it was like being in a cellar okay a bit moe room but no natural daylight So we stuck with the shoe box room , The hotel is within walking distance of Tottenham Court Rd tube Oxford Street and the Palladium Fabulous location in the heart of Soho and surprisingly the room was quiet with bars and restaurants in abundance 
214990,Mimi s Hotel Soho, No complaints Some may say very small room and bathroom but fine if just wanting a good nights sleep, The small basement room with no window concerned me but the bed was extremely comfortable and suited my needs Would go back
214991,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Size of the room, I know I paid a low price but the room was so tiny luckily I didn t share otherwise my partner would not have been able to get ready
214992,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Perfect in the heart of London Perfect ambiance with dimmed lighting all round And able to control the room temperature TV and movies are available bonus Bed super comfy great quality 
214993,Mimi s Hotel Soho, It s very compact and despite them describing it as such it doesn t really sink in until you re there , Wide selection of movies wonderful bathroom shower 
214994,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The location is smack bang in Soho I can imagine it can get a bit noisy The breakfast choice was limited and individually priced which pushed us to eat elsewhere Eggs florentine would have been nice , The bedroom we stayed in was perfect It was a suite room which really is a small standard sized bedroom but totally adequate I thankfully chose this room after reading many comments about how small the other rooms are Thank God I did It was only about 25 pounds more Well worth it as the price for staying at this hotel is a real bargain compared to others in London The communal areas of the hotel were beautifully decorated with luxurious marble flooring throughout I cannot emphasise how much we loved our bathroom amazing They provided plenty high end toiletries and towels You really couldn t believe you were getting all this luxury for the price you were paying We will definitely be staying here again as it is in the heart of Soho The staff were very polite and friendly 
214995,Mimi s Hotel Soho, I booked a double room with window as per people s comments The rooms are very small Unfortunately the window was not accessible because it was on top of the ceiling It was great for during the day but woke me up in the morning since there were no curtains to cover the window Also a bit difficult to breathe at night because there was no fresh air , Hotel staff were very friendly And helpful Very central location with loads of restaurants and pubs nearby Short walk to the station and main attractions 
214996,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Although I booked the largest room they can be a bit small and slightly dark, The staff at this Hotel were fabulous courteous and took the time to get to know you The location is amazing and the hotel is tailored towards a niche market boutique style hotel with lots of charm 
214997,Mimi s Hotel Soho, For us nothing to really dislike fantastic and would definitely stay again , Fantastic location and very friendly attentive staff throughly recommend it however pls consider room size if you are of larger stature as they are quite snug in dimensions albeit cozy nonetheless 
214998,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The staff were rude upon arrival the room was the size of a shoe box with absolutely no lighting no tea or coffee available and it stated it was sound proofed however it was very noisy outside the room and you heard everything going on in the hotel right down to the hotel corridor music through the doors , The cleanliness
214999,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Had to wait 15min for the greek receptionist to finally allow me to check in Really tiny room but the price was very low too , Amazing location Nice hotel 
215000,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Very small rooms Booked DELUXE double room and what we got was a matchbox No larger than 2x2 with our bed going from wall to wall so you had to climb from the bottom No window which I understand it is normal at this hotel but the room was not suitable for 2 persons and no vent in the bathroom I would not usually accept this but luckily we were knackered after 3 weeks of traveling and stayed what a mistake Very thin walls and i assume next doors bed was very close ours as until 3am our neighbours were having fun but privacy was 0 for them and probably the whole floor could hear Unfortunately I would not recommend ,No Positive
215001,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Breakfast was inadequate and overpriced but there are plenty of other options in the vicinity so don t let this put you off , Great location Room very small but perfect for my needs Soundproof so although it may be a busy street it is very peaceful in the room Bed comfortable All very small but very clean and has a boutique feel The Molten Brown products a nice touch Would book again 
215002,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Only downside is the size of the rooms but for the price and central location this can be over looked , Furnishings throughout the hotel are excellent and the staff are very friendly and helpful The beds re really comfortable with nice little touches 
215003,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Mimi s is so well located in the centre of Soho Quiet and Peaceful Warmly welcome and care by the staff I highly recommend Mimi for your Monday stay 
215004,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Room was quite small but I understood this when booking Window only opened a crack as would have opened up onto a flat roof so had to put the air conditioning on to cool the room Bathroom was hot as there was a heated mirror that you couldn t turn off , Bed was really comfortable and sheets were high quality Rain shower and free toiletries were brilliant Room was clean and quiet even though it was a busy area you wouldn t have known Lovely staff Place to store your luggage before and after check in Was great 
215005,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The website tells you that the rooms are small I was still not prepared for just how small They do have everything you need though and for the size are well equipped It would be really useful for have a proper hanging rail rather than a double hook and a single hanger The rail could go across the back of the door with a couple of hangers on it It would be great to have a little shelf in the bathroom too I had to balance everything on the loo seat when applying make up , The staff were very helpful and friendly our rooms were ready early that was bonus we hadn t asked for early check in so that was really useful The decor is fabulous and the bar is excellent a lovely atmosphere I could have sat there for hours and people watched The location is excellent for Soho Covent Garden Leicester Square etc It s slap bang in the centre and walking distance to all of it The wifi is good The bar is well stocked and comfortable 
215006,Mimi s Hotel Soho, I know they say so on the website but the rooms are incredibly small There is no room for anything other than bed and a very small bathroom Would be very uncomfortable if you had to spend an evening in your room to work or whatever Breakfast just a pastry and tea coffee , Friendly staff good location
215007,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, The rooms were exactly as advertised compact but incredibly cosy There was a great choice of channels on the television including complimentary movies the room was clean and staff were very helpful and friendly 
215008,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms are minuscule despite room upgrade my bathroom was so small I had to sit on the toilet at an angle The windowless rooms are also very dark and a bit tomb like Don t understand why music is played in corridors at all hours all of us were woken up by it at 7am , Bar and reception area are lovely Location is perfect for wandering around Soho Staff very friendly and fun 
215009,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Hallway music sometimes was a little loud , Location is the best And if you re traveling alone the small yet extremely comfortable rooms are wonderful 
215010,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Very little the breakfast offering could have been a little broader and was somewhat overpriced , A great location and I liked that there was a pleasant bar as part of the hotel Would go back if I was planning a show in London 
215011,Mimi s Hotel Soho, No privacy at this hotel While we were out all of our belongings were packed up without our permission or knowledge and moved to a room the size of a broom closet I m not joking on another floor Appaently they had some issue with the water in our room so decided to downgrade us to a smaller room I complained and they refunded just 20 pounds Considering we paid over 320 pounds that I would have preferred it if they left our stuff alone in the room that I originally booked and kept the 20 quid Also the first morning the cleaning staff unlocked and walked in our room while my partner was getting dressed she quickly grabbed a towel to cover herself Not even a knock on the door first , Good atmosphere stylish and good location 
215012,Mimi s Hotel Soho, You can t change the fact that these rooms are tiny We were told we were upgraded to a room that was double the size but had no window I don t think it was possible to half the room size as it was stil only 3m square including the bathroom Would have rather they were honest and said that out room is cosy and on the small side I don t mind the size of the room though For us it was just a place to lay out heads , Very clean room Lovely products Very new and well decorated Cosy Well sound proofed Didn t hear a peep from anyone Slept from midnight till 8am on a lovely comfy bed 
215013,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms with out windows are a no go but if on budget then ideal for one night , The hotel is centrally located and ideal for a city break or business Loads of bars and restaurants on the door step Trendy and up to date with great decor 
215014,Mimi s Hotel Soho, We knew from other reviews that the rooms were small and ours was fine for one night but we would have found it claustrophobic for any longer , Excellent location welcoming staff comfortable bed 
215015,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Tiny claustrophobic minute floor space could not walk round bed no window nowhere to put anything easily the worst place I have ever spent a night Hated it I have had more floor space in a public convenience Oh yes the price was extortionate too , Being outside the room checking out
215016,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The hotel was quite nice I suppose but they would do well to open a window Not everyone appreciates the stuffy smell of old roses The room was TINY even though I expected it to be quite small from having carefully read the website For example unless you are a contortionist you cannot open the door to the hallway without standing in the bathroom and there is no place to put a room service tray but on the floor The bed was the biggest disappointment It represented nearly half of the room s space and the hotel describes it as 5 model What a total disappointment being stiff and uncomfortable to say the least They should offer a thicker mattress pad for those guests who like a soft bed We did get extra pillows from the helpful staff and the bedding was of good quality so they did try to please but everything would have been better had we slept well , The staff was lovely They were without a doubt the highlight of our stay at Mimi s The hotel was neat and tidy The rooms were also sound proofed as advertised 
215017,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Absolutely tiny room Literally the size of the bed squeezed in between walls on all four sides with just enough space to open the door and either wedge a case behind the door or put it into the tiny shower room toilet The air freshener used throughout the corridor lifts and stairwell was overpowering almost as if it was covering up something worse Absolutely no where to work I wonder why booking com recommended it as a business hotel , Good location Reasonable price Nice decor in the room and comfortable bed Friendly staff 
215018,Mimi s Hotel Soho, When i arrived they had almost given my room away they said they called me but there was no missed call on my phone wet paint on the walls and it does not wash off your cloths Shower room was humid and smelt of mould when i looked up i saw the paint starting to come off the ceiling thankfully i do not have allergies to mould like my other half exposed nail sharp side by side lamp switch nice little shock before attempting going to sleep TINY ROOM no table no safe Slow Wifi Parking was not in the building but at the nearest Q park i did get a 20 discount Aircon slow nearly not working No window I asked for a quiet room but i could hear music from the hall way and people walking on the floor above It was a long and stressful night before an important meeting the next day Not a good place for work related short stays , Proximity to next days meeting 
215019,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The rooms are tiny and although they have done their best to try and manoeuvre around that s it s just way to claustrophobic There is no where to hang clothes or put bags no where to sit and relax and absolutely no window in the room or the bathroom Moreover the bedding was not up to a good standard All that was provided was a very thin 1 pills and sheets that felt plasticy Furthermore the bar closes very early i believe 10 30 pm for soho so if you want any tea coffee or alcoholic beverage you have to go to soho to get it Just not good enough, I thought the hallways where beautifully decorated and smelled lovely
215020,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Mimi s is in the perfect location in Soho Literally a stone s throw from Ronnie Scott s The bar is friendly and stylish In the same area they serve a great breakfast The room I had was tiny but comfy clean and everything worked well All one needs for a one night stop If you chose to stay for a period the lack of wardrobe may prove challenging 
215021,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Some people might say the rooms are too small It was ok though , All the staff were excellent They were really friendly and approachable and willing to help Downstairs bar area small but vwry stylish Really liked it The bedroom was dark and comfy with effective air condition Rooms are small but the comfort made up for it 
215022,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Room was small but comfortable I did book a single room but it was perfect for just me I couldn t ask for a better location for exploring London In the middle of Soho surrounded by cafes nightlife but the soundproofing in the rooms keeps that out when you need to sleep Close to Oxford St also if shopping is more your thing Will definitely return 
215023,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Didn t like pillows too flat could have been more of them Although I knew the room would be small there was no wardrobe I felt I do need more room some where to hang my clothes pretty much room to spred out , Location fabulous fabulous fabulous Bed big comfy Bathroom hand wash etc lovely
215024,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Room was a little smaller than expected but perfect for the one night we were there , Amazing location right in the heart of the city Nice bar with a great fireplace 
215025,Mimi s Hotel Soho, VERY heavy doors noisy street The soundproofing was excellent except that the windows negated it it was really noisy because of the street Would probably be better to have a room without a window, Bed was comfy nice clean bathroom with nice hand wash body wash and shampoo
215026,Mimi s Hotel Soho, We had a room without a window we found it a little disorientating and the room we decided was too small In fairness we chose the room so not the hotels fault A little disappointed the bar closed at 10pm on Sunday too The hotel does not make it clear on their website the nearest Q Parking which is China town so we did not manage to get the discount on the parking we should have had , The bed was very comfortable The coffee lovely and a real bonus it was hot how we like it The crossiants were lovely fresh and flaky too The free wifi and film also went down extremely well thank you 
215027,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Absolutely loved this place Staff is very polite neat and educated They were listening to the customer s needs and tried to help by thinking outside the box Bar area is cosy Despite small room small double room we had everything we needed Beds are the most comfortable I ever slept on I think I found my place in London to stay See you soon Guys 
215028,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Strange set up for reception almost abutting bar Dark fire going Check out time 11 am too early, Location good always going to be noisy but soundproofing and earplugs seemed to work Great shower and bed Booked room with window bigger but more expensive Reception staff excellent
215029,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Breakfast menu The size of the room OK for me and my 10 years old daughter as she felt like in Harry Potter s room But can t imagine beeing there two adults , Excellent reception team Very helpful very nice and very professional Cosy bar 
215030,Mimi s Hotel Soho, All good but when it says single rooms have no room for large case they are not joking so be aware , Great location very comfortable bed good shower and Milton Brown toiletries and staff were very nice 
215031,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Really modern clean hotel Staff very friendly bed was comfy and the location was perfect Bar are with fire was so relaxing as was the chilled music playing in the background Room was small but it was a bed for the night which is only what I needed The bathroom is excellent Great price for the single traveller Deffo returning 
215032,Mimi s Hotel Soho, small room really is very small , Hotel was clean in very good condition and staff were very pleasant Good value for London and good location too 
215033,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was small but so comfortable and warm Perfect for what we wanted , We thought the rooms were great for a stay of a couple of nights and the staff were very helpful and friendly 
215034,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Did not realise how small the room would be It was as wide as the bed was long and when you are 6 4 head and feet can touch opposite walls at same time Could have done with 2 pillows each , Bed was very wide and nice and firm Really pleased with location Very very clean Sound proof room Easily controllable air con Molton Brown toiletries Friendly staff 
215035,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room is very tiny There s basically no space to move As a consequence the temperature of the room gets very hot at night and makes it difficult to sleep, The hotel looks new or renovated Bathroom is great compared to London s standars 
215036,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Not a dislike but the bar prices are seriously expensive even by London standards However the ambience and attentiveness of staff is superb so it felt like a treat There is a pub right next door if you want a more traditional pub and pay pub prices , The hotel is perfectly situated close to Oxford Street Leicester Square Soho and dozens of superb bars and restaurants The rooms are small but luxurious with high spec bed linen comfy large beds and excellent showers It s also quiet for a good sleep The staff are some of the friendliest and happiest I ve come across nothing is too much trouble and they genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs 
215037,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Only quibbles are lack of tea and coffee in the room and the limitations of the air circulation in the space which made the head of the bed warm and the bottom a bit chilly but only a minor gripe You could only really stay a night or two unless accustomed to living in a very small place or prison , Rooms are small VERY SMALL but opulent in terms of style quality and comfort Think miniature boudoir Bathrooms are a masterpiece of design with Molton Brown toiletries a nice bonus Free water and earplugs a welcome touch The staff were friendly helpful and welcoming on check in and check out Breakfast was really good just fresh coffee and a pastry but in lovely surroundings watching Soho come to life The location is amazing bang in the heart of all that Soho has to offer Looking forward to staying again 
215038,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The size of the room was extremely small The bed took up the whole room Barely any space to move around I booked a deluxe room for two as I was due to have a friend stay with me Unfortunately I got notified while I was in route to the hotel the day of saying the room I booked was not available They offered me a room the same size as another friend whom paid 115gbp for 155gbp as if it was a great deal when it wasn t I reserved a larger room for two at 165gbp so can you imagine how upset I was The woman at the front desk says to me You can take this room or go somewhere else In a really rude tone I had just gotten off work and did not want to deal with it anymore Mind you I was not yelling and just inquired about why the prices varied so much for the same type of room She said it s because it s the last room I was baffled and couldn t believe it I had to suck it up and pay but honestly it sucked I would have loved it if the room I reserved was available or if they offered me the same price they had for the room of or even a discounted rate for the inconvenience My other guest didn t even come as we were not going to squeeze into that tiny room and try to maneuver , I appreciated how they kept the dress I left in the room at the front desk until I was able to have a friend pick it up for me The evening staff were superb Wish I could say the same about when I checked in The bar attendee was wonderful and the cleaning ladies were so sweet The room itself was okay Just small The tv was a good addition Location was ideal as it was in the middle of soho 
215039,Mimi s Hotel Soho, A need for some improvement in the morning bar service during breakfast hours , Whats not to like great location friendly and helpful staff bathroom and beds to die for and all at what is for central London a great price 
215040,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Ambient music was too loud in public areas Soundproof doors were very very heavy to open , Great beds tiny rooms no frills but outstanding location for a good night s sleep which is what I wanted Lovely staff 
215041,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, One would enter the cabin size small room and find the bed very comfortable and clean with space beneath for belongings and a flatscreen TV on the wall at the end of the bed giving quite adequate essentials for someone spending most of his time outside The bar was excellent The restroom and bath are spacious and are basically the size of the room so one could use those facilities comfortably without constantly bumping into things The water pressure is good 
215042,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Although we had a room with no windows which was fine We could have done without 5 50 am morning call of the pub next doors dropping in about 20 barrels with an electric lift The lighting in the bathroom was appalling Neither could my wife put her make up on properly or could I have a proper shave The dim able lights in the room also had a complete life of their own Shame, Excellent location 
215043,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Although the room was lovely I did feel as if I was sleeping in a cupboard I missed not having a window but the location made up for it and it was ok for just a one night stay , The bed was really comfy and the staff very helpful 
215044,Mimi s Hotel Soho, size of the room and no where to hang clothes, did not include breakfast we had a king size bed for me and my adult daughter we had to sleep across the bed so we wouldn t have to climb over the other one when we got up 
215045,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The double room in the basement without windows is the tiniest room I ve ever stayed in The small cave carved for the bed and the steel frame that supported it was puzzling But the bed was comfortable and the room was dark so I slept well after all ,No Positive
215046,Mimi s Hotel Soho, one thing and one thing only the room we were in was very small and had no windows, everything about this hotel was very good the location the decor the service everything could not be faulted
215047,Mimi s Hotel Soho, This Hotel charged 200 pounds to my bank account after checkout without consent authorizing my payment Hotel claims these are smoking charges in the room when I don t even smoke In return the hotel is now trying to push me from fighting the charge by claiming they are talking to their lawyers I told them they can t do this since I am not responsible for anything that happens in my room after my checkout If there was an issue they should ve informed me while I was at the hotel Instead they debited my card without speaking with me What if I didn t notice this on my statement I have contacted the hotel several times sent three emails to them out of which they have replied to just one email I don t understand how they are dealing with their customers BEWARE I would recommend all other guests to be very careful with the card details they provide to this hotel they are misusing these details I have already taken action from my end but I am really shocked and surprised by their behavior extremely unprofessional , Nothing Overpriced for room size quality of staff was bizzare 
215048,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Could not find any faults with my stay however i contact the hotel after my stay and 2 weeks on i am still waiting for a response to my email therefore there customer service could be better , The hotel was easy to find and immaculate inside and out Rooms were very compact however perfect for a quick business trip
215049,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, It was very clean very well decorated and furnished to a high 5 quality Staff are very welcoming friendly and helpful You couldn t ask for a better location turn left out of the hotel and you are a 2 minute walk to oxford street shopping Turn right out of the hotel and you are a 2 minute walk from the soho bars and restaurants Staying here made our trip so much easier for what we wanted to achieve 
215050,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was not of 4 star standard very small more like a trains cabin no room to sit no mini bar and no tea and coffee making facilities we were offered another room for 70 more but it was only a little bigger also it was windowless which made it very claustrophobic, The staff and the bar were excellent
215051,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The bedroom was a box room the person sleeping next to the wall has to climb over the other person to get in and out of bed There was no window in the room which made it extremely claustrophobic The bathroom was tiny with very little ventilation , The hotel is in an excellent location and very central 
215052,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The pillows were flat and hard and they should have been more Also the bed could have been softer especially when it was praised so much in advertisement , The bathroom was beautiful and the toiletries were of good quality 
215053,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms are small but we knew that Lack of storage drawers wardrobes is an issue but not a big one The worst fault is that the rooms at the front are very poorly insulated against noise Not much traffic in mid Soho but large numbers of very noisy people emerging from next door bars until the small hours Then dustcarts collecting rubbish and reversing noisily at 6 30 A modern 4 hotel in London shouldn t have these issues which would deter future visits , Cheerful staff Efficient response to queries Large comfy bed 
215054,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Pillows deflated so needed extra My room did not have a window I knew this beforehand but it was weird , Bed was great and room was super clean Staff went above and beyond to help me with any question or request 
215055,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The small bedrooms are very small but this is a minor criticism as they really do focus on doing the important things well bed comfort excellent shower Molton Brown toiletries and let s face it you don t book a hotel in Soho to sit in your room , This has become my hotel of choice for doing business in London The staff are amazing the location is as good as you can possibly get right in the heart of Soho and minutes from theatre land and fantastic bars and restaurants Despite the central location the rooms are incredibly quiet and the beds among the most comfortable I have found anywhere To top it off the bar on the ground level is an absolute gem really cosy particularly if you get seated next to the fire with a great drinks list Highly recommended 
215056,Mimi s Hotel Soho, no windows felt slightly claustrophobic no room to move in the bedroom lights were too dim even on full so small things like putting on make up was a challenge , location was great and hotel was very clean
215057,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room is tooooooooo small which makes you feel like you are in cell and my room has no window you must have the light on when you do anything Besides it is underground it is not very good to have some fresh air But the caffe besides the hotel is very good, The lady in the reception is very nice and kind The place is in the China town which is very good and you can enjoy a lot of food BTW it is quite near to any famous interests and it is very convinenct to go anywhere
215058,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The size of the rooms are misleading Any person booking into this hotel needs to look at the hotel nwebsite rather than just booking based on these reviews Our room had no window and was 6ft by 10 ,No Positive
215059,Mimi s Hotel Soho, There was no window in our room and was quite noisy right next to the kitchen , very comfortable and clean room lovely Molton brown products in the room 
215060,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Very small room with no window as we were located in the basement No tea or coffee in the room either which is very disappointing considering paying 189 for the night and travelling from Isle of Wight to get here This was a deluxe room , Location was great as we were going to Ronnie Scott s Lots of cafes and bars near hotel Tube stations nearby also 
215061,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The hotel in general Rooms were very small my partner and I could hardly move in the room very Claustrophobic luckily our room had windows but this did stop us feeling stuffy , The free movies
215062,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Location Is on a busy street with bars restaurants so you have late night activity and associated noise till 2am Then you will have the Ryan bush collection of glass bottles at 4am so noise could be an issue for sensitive sleepers The hotel provide ear plugs,No Positive
215063,Mimi s Hotel Soho, No tea and coffee making facilities in the room Called down to reception be told that room service was not offered Had to make the trip to the bar at 06 30 in the morning to get coffee o lunch to be told by the man he would bring it to my room Was not impressed and very unhappy with the attitude of the reception staff At the mint charged for the room I would have expected room service , The location was perfect and the cocktails were good Bathroom was amazing 
215064,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Design won out over function drinks list gold lettering on black low level lighting an iPhone torch moment, Luxury on a small scale with hugely comfortable bed spacious shower room peace quiet in the heart of Soho a cocktail called London Calling friendly efficient staff what s not to like 
215065,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Location is definitely the biggest plus of this place We could go by foot to most of the places we wanted Very friendly and helpful staff is a great asset as well 
215066,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Limited breakfast no hot food The room we had was underground and must have been their smallest The sides of the very comfortable bed were in contact with the walls of the room No wardrobe no cupboard or kettle , Very clean friendly staff and a great location Great bar too 
215067,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, The bed was gorgeous like being on an Egyptian cotton cloud the room was pretty and the bathroom was a vast expanse of marble and Molton Brown We would come again 
215068,Mimi s Hotel Soho, These is nothing not to like this hotel was amazing From the moment we checked in I was treated like a king the hotel is beautiful the staff are truly amazing and the suite we stayed in extremely clean and well presented we will be back , These is nothing not to like this hotel was amazing From the moment we checked in I was treated like a king the hotel is beautiful the staff are truly amazing and the suite we stayed in extremely clean and well presented we will be back 
215069,Mimi s Hotel Soho, It s an up and coming trend that boutique hotels have small rooms with high end finishes The rooms are very small but if you can get over this then everything else is top notch No kettle no minibar and no iron due to space restrictions , High end finish in a very new hotel Nice Bar Helpful staff Nice bathroom Great TV in bedroom Free still water 
215070,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The size of the room was so small no windows felt like sleeping in a tomb no wardrobe no space to move Had to climb on the bed to switch light on never been in such a small hotel room dark dismal , Staff location
215071,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Size of the room is too small It is noisy at night since it is in the bar area , The location There are so many restaurants around And it is close to several train stations The bathroom is awesome 
215072,Mimi s Hotel Soho, No tea and coffee and not even able to get a drink at the bar at 11 15 most hotels will serve residents Breakfast should be explained it s only 2 options Granola or bread a bit pricey for 15 We stayed in an easy jet room in Victoria which was the same style as Mimi for 40 a night which served the same purpose, Location
215073,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room we booked was a little on the snug side , The location was amazing staff were very friendly and the room was sound proofed which meant a fab nights sleep 
215074,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was so tiny it was hard work two friends trying to get ready to go out, Great location and lovely bar area for pre drinks Really modern decor and the staff were so friendly
215075,Mimi s Hotel Soho, only very minor things but the lighting switches were a challenge and the piped music in the communal areas was audible during the night , Nice boutique hotel the staff were fantastic really welcoming attentive particularly to a youngster in the party Fantastic bed 
215076,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Deluxe Double bedroom was very small for normal hotel bedrooms king size bed but no space for wardrobes had to climb into bed from one end only and live out of suitcase for the week Great for 2 3 night but NOT for a week was informed by booking com that room was 14sqm however that included the bathroom Disappointed with room as a whole Not worth the money will need a suite next time, very well decorated with marble flooring and solid doors etc staff excellent requested large shower and was happy with this Fresh towels and bed made everyday with complementary water 
215077,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Well on first arrival the first room we were shown was a cupboard with a double bed in the basement which was far from the suite that we booked went back to reception for them to say the suite wasn t ready as it was still being cleaned this was about an hour after check in time so it should have been ready When we came back later to get ready for our night out we entered the room to find a very strong odour of paint then I found wet paint on the door The room itself a suite well im not sure how they can call it a suite as it was tiny i booked a suite as i thought it would be a nice birthday treat but it was just a disappointment There was also a hole in the front door where there once was a spy hole which means any lucky person that looked through it would see us in our room There were no bulbs in the bedside lamps The air conditioning did not work so with no windows and air conditioning the room was very hot and smelly with the paint My partner requested to use an iron to iron his shirt we were told 20 minutes an hour later he had to go back to reception to ask again We conplained to reception and got moved to a dulux double which was pretty much the same as a suite so i wouldnt waste your money on an upgrade shower toilet was exactly the same but at least this room we had space to get dressed without touching the walls After our stay I spoke with management to express my disappointment to them to be told that I would not be welcome at the hotel again , Good location
215078,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The rainfall shower in the room 311 was lovely but it leaked water under the screen to the rest of the bathroom Being really picky though as everything else was great You can tell it s relatively new so they re bound to have a few teething problems , Location for the price Compact single room provided everything that I needed for a two night stay Surprisingly quiet given the location Perfect base for a city break Friendly professional management and staff Recommended 
215079,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Arrived rather late to a mix up with the rooms However staff resolved the issue quickly and updated me to the available suit Wifi was a bit weak , Wonderful style very comfortable bed fabulous location about 3 min from the Toucan that serves some of the cheapest oysters in London Larger rooms without windows are splendid Very helpful staff 
215080,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Tiny rooms Especially lack of a proper window made it feel claustrophobic, Lobby bar was lovely However the rooms are the smallest I ve seen 
215081,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Like all other comments the room was the size of the room was the only problem I booked a delux double room It had no window and the bed filled two thirds of the room I had a three night stay There was not room for a wardrobe or no draws to put clothes There was only two coat hangers provided As a result I was literally living out of a suitcase fortunately it did fit under the bed , Location was excellent Staff friendly and helpful Bathroom top quality and bed top quality and comfortable
215082,Mimi s Hotel Soho, We were given room 1 off reception and it is tiny tiny which we kind of expected what we did not expect is that there are no windows and it is like sleeping in a dark box Very uncomfortable The staff apologised but were full so we couldnt be moved If you are are claustrophobic avoid this room , Super bed and bedding a lovely bar and great staff The location of this hotel could not be better Not much in the way of breakfast but there are endless cafes right on the doorstep so no shortage of food 
215083,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Panelling at head of bed not comfortable to sit upright against Could do with more pillows in room , location ambience in reception and bar staff bathroom to and access to films 
215084,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was booked as a deluxe as the small room looked tiny However the room was extremely small with no wardrobe to hang clothes no fridge for drinks and no window It did feel like a shoebox , I loved the hotel as it was so new and luxurious
215085,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Not sure if we had the right rooms One room had no windows although fairly roomy The other had no wardrobe and the bed could only be accessed from one side and both rooms were called de luxe , Staff very friendly helpful Decor great 
215086,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The rooms are much so small you can hardly turn around We had to climb into our bed and climb out again There was no window in our room , The hotel was in a good position 
215087,Mimi s Hotel Soho, I m glad I booked a suite as it was no larger than a standard room in most hotels I would imagine the other rooms are very small , Great location and true value for money
215088,Mimi s Hotel Soho, In fairness the description was small room and I was just surprised how small However the room was kitted out well the bed comfortable and a very nice bathroom , Very nice and very classy boutique hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff
215089,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms on the small side , Great central location perfect for eating drinking theatre and tourist attractions Clean comfortable modern rooms Very friendly staff 
215090,Mimi s Hotel Soho, , Really nice Hotel in a perfect location middle of London Easy to go everywhere all over the city The nearest tube station is just 5minutes walk Helpful staff easy check in and out The Hotel has a really nice bar as well My room was perfect everything was new into the room and it looked like just I saw on the picture and I could not be more happier with that I definitely will return soon Highly recommended 
215091,Mimi s Hotel Soho, This dark basement room was literally the size of the double bed see photos and is the smallest I have stayed in that s saying something as hotel rooms are usually small in the city There was no window only one power socket no wardrobe or place to store clothes or bag Luckily I was alone as it was a business trip I can t imagine having two people in that room Music played in the corridor outside my room all night They provide earplugs which don t really help I hardly slept as it felt really claustrophobic and was noisy I was notified of no window on booking but had little choice as I was stranded due to Storm Doris Never again , Location
215092,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was unacceptably tiny there wasn t even space to open the luggage The only window in the room was in the ceiling when we complained the receptionist replied very rudly that this is considered a room with a window in this hotel My advise DON T GO THERE ,No Positive
215093,Mimi s Hotel Soho, It s brand new and the staff are obviously still coming to terms with it all No kettle Very noisy , Clean and luxurious fittings Nice sheets towels and molten brown products Ear plugs 
215094,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Loved the Molton Brown toiletries the room is a cute size some may describe it as small but great comfy bed and quality linen all details from hairdryer controllable air con TV phone to complimentary water but disappointedly no tea or coffee perhaps for H S reasons Despite the size the finish of the room feels luxurious with lots of wooden panels very heavy doors marble and wood finish great rain forest shower The room was quiet and comfortable Staff were welcoming and greeted us with a smile and a warm welcome 
215095,Mimi s Hotel Soho, My wife being told she looked tired upon check in way to burst our bubble , The room although very small which we expected was nicely decorated and finished and the bathroom was excellent WeI especially liked the heated mirror 
215096,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was very small and there was a safe only in the ground floor near the lobby Too bad the hotel dosen t supply city maps other then the ones used for specific directions , The location was perfect for us right in the middle of young and full of interest Soho neighborhood Dozens of places to eat all around Korean Italian pubs you name it just wonder around and find them or ask the hotel staff for great recommendations and directions Close to the tube and to many turistic activities Greate and big shower 
215097,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The tiny room was a bit clostrophobic with no window but it was ok , The hotel was very quiet and tv was very easy to use Staff very friendly and helpful 
215098,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Mimi s hotel has an excellent location in the middle of Soho at only 5 to 15 minute walk from most of London attractions The room was small but clean and cozy The personnel was very helpful and nice behavior The bar was also excellent as ambiance and drinks 
215099,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Pillows were an issue and people could find the room claustrophobic I did wake up in the night with a bit of a panic , We had a small double in the basement which we both agreed had been designed amazingly Everything you need The details like the light dimmers mirrors that dont steam up and having the plug sockets for chargers were really impressive Best hotel I ve stayed in Should also add the bed was so comfortable 
215100,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, The beds were extremely comfortable and the staff were friendly and attentive We were upgraded to a suite for free as there had been a cancellation earlier in the day I would highly recommend this hotel 
215101,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms are tiny very tiny The bed is very very comfortable but the size of the room hardly allows you to have 2 suit cases in it We had to take turns into the room to pack before checking out , The hotel benefits from a perfect location and the staff is very engaged in giving you a unique experience The bar lounge area is very comfortable stayed all day working and the quality of products tea coffee is excellent
215102,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms are absolutely tiny with no storage space Booked Deluxe Double but was offered two microscopic rooms before settling on what was still a very small room all windowless Even this wasn t the 14m2 advertised had a tiny 3 hanger cupboard as a wardrobe for 2 people and more of a cloakroom than a bathroom Bear in mind that the bed takes up about 5m2 in the smaller 7m2 room and you get the idea This makes it very claustrophobic especially as as mentioned by another reviewer the escape signage is severely lacking , Great location staff excellent bar really good bed superb Very clean and tidy everywhere just as well as it s so cramped 
215103,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Perfect location The small room is actually a tiny room Lovely bathroom and soaps perfect if you plan to be out anyway Bar downstairs fab great music and staff Ladies at the reception very friendly and helpful 
215104,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Was originally given a room with no windows Which was a surprise The bed filled 90 of the room Suggest making sure you get a window room booked , Staff did manage to change our room after being asked by us 
215105,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Nothing I didn t like the rooms are on the small side but this is advertised throughout it is bang in the middle of Soho yet quite once inside I ve stayed in smaller rooms , Fab hotel great location and excellent staff throughout The beds are super comfy and bedding and duvet lovely quality cotton Loved the choice of Molton Brown products in the bathroom shower was amazing The bar was super relaxed and beautifully decorated and although I spent some of my stay on my own I was happy sat at the bar discussing cocktails and Italy with Francesco the bar man who makes great cocktails btw I got a lovely friendly welcome from Ra who upgraded my room as a room was available I have already booked to return in March 
215106,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The receptionist was a little nervous insecure but friendly I wasn t sure whether breakfast was included in the price or not Room was VERY small for the price , Bed was very comfortable TV with films was great bonus bathroom nice and clean good soaps etc Good style
215107,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Even saying that the rooms are small and I was aware of this having no window in my room and the bed enclosed on 3 sides by walls was a touch claustrophobic With only me in a double room it was fine but couples would be very intimate It would also be good to have more cushions in the room as the bed is going to serve as your sofa for watching TV As a one night stop while visiting a client with offices in Soho the location made this perfect but wouldn t be on my list for a longer stay , This hotel delivers exactly what it says the rooms are compact read small but this is central London and it makes that clear in the hotel advertising so shouldn t be a surprise to anyone The fixtures and fittings are very high quality and everything in the room worked The layout of the room was functional and although comfortable for a one night stay I wouldn t want to be spending a huge length of time in the room but who would with Soho on your doorstep The TV was a good quality Samsung with all the channels free films and excellent free WiFi available so even a bit of NetFlix was possible using a phone tablet or laptop The staff were very polite and the barman took great pride in his job with his quirky outfit and all Up North we take our flat caps off indoors The bathroom was spotless with lovely Molton Brown products and the rain shower had plenty of pressure and hot water Finally I ve gotta say this hotel was quiet The corridor doors are thick sound proofed affairs and the rooms appear to be heavily insulated temperature was comfortable and I got a great nights sleep even though the bustle of Soho was right outside I will be doing this same trip every fortnight for the foreseeable future and I will be using Mimi s again for my 1 nighters 
215108,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Room was very small only accessible from one side No storage Worst thing was 30 for continental breakfast which consisted of either granola or croissant and coffee way overpriced , Location 
215109,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Just one pillow each would of been perfect with a few more , Very stylish hotel Fantastic en suite Nice staff and fantastic location Good selection of free movies on the TV 
215110,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms are very small and mine had no natural light Don t expect a wardrobe or draws for clothes Travel light and probably stay for 1 or 2 nights only As a place simply to sleep it s fine , Great location in the heart of Soho Nice feel in the hotel You enter into the bar and it had a really great buzzy atmosphere all evening 
215111,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Staff went above and beyond and were really helpful as we were celebrating my sisters 18th was a really friendly welcoming place with a great vibe will definitely be visiting again
215112,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The first room was so small and had no window so felt like a cupboard bit claustrophobic However we spoke to reception and they kindly gave us a room with a window which was perfect , Location amazing central Soho and a quick walk to Oxford St Staff excellent Whole place was immaculate 
215113,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The rooms were far too small for us The first room we were shown didn t even have a window The second room did but that let in noise from outside which went on well into the early hours of the morning The only respite from the noise were earplugs left by the hotel , Helpful staff and hotel in a great location for theaters and restaurants Everywhere seemed nice and clean 
215114,Mimi s Hotel Soho, I was given a room in basement with no window and fresh paint smell so strong it made me feel ill I asked to move and only rooms also had no window and even smaller but no paint smell so had to accept The staff person in charge at the time was horrible but the assistant and cleaner who replaced the remote that didn t work were very nice and tried to do their best for me Overall a very claustrophobic and upsetting experience though Music in bar too loud one beer cost me 6 and hotel very over heated In my windowless room I was using air conditioning all night so stupid ,No Positive
215115,Mimi s Hotel Soho, My basement room had no phone signal and no wifi signal Also the air conditioning was inadequate and noisy and had a continual bright flashing green light all night , Location and general feel of communal areas
215116,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Although a valid point at the expense of sounding like a pain there weren t any fire procedures on the back of the door nor were any explained There was only one exit sign on our corridor pointing to the fire door which looked like a door to a room With no windows in the room this concerned us as what to do in an emergency and made us feel a little uncomfortable This was exacerbated by the small nature of rooms here If its apparent to us then surely staff would be able to recognise this issue prior to people arriving and give some sort of information about it The rooms were a little pricey for the size of them There is no justification from a customers perspective other than the experience of a quirky night stay , The boutique decor was lovely and clearly there was a lot of effort in designing the ascetics of this hotel The staff were incredibly welcoming too and more than happy to help The bar was really well run by informative helpful and really polite staff The majority of the staff here are a credit to hotel and should be commended 
215117,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms a little cosy but that s fine for a night or two , Perfect location Super little find in the heart of Soho ideal for exploring this area and central London 
215118,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Traveller beware I booked the small room rate because oh well it was just for one night Well I got what I asked for a room at the end of a corridor in the basement 1 with no window and 7 m2 of room No space to hang your clothes and your head bumps the wall if you need to wipe your bum on the toilet But that was not the worst remember it s a small price for a small room so you get what you book The worst was that I was wondering what would happen in case of a fire I honestly don t want to play out that scenario in that room I m sure there are better rooms that feel safer at this hotel SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY so you re on the ground floor or upper floors with a window Trust me it ll do wonders for your peace of mind , The location in central soho the friendly staff the new decor
215119,Mimi s Hotel Soho, For a standard double room there was literally just enough room for the bed and nothing else which was disappointing Not suitable for 2 people but fine if you re on your own and not claustrophobic , The staff are really lovely and the hotel is very modern 
215120,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Teeny tiny rooms no coffee tea making facilities in rooms, Awesome location brand new hotel super friendly professional staff Zak especially on the bar was a true asset to this new venture he was polite informative helpful a credit to your team 
215121,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Do not stay here unless you want to know what sleeping in a coffin is like with really unhelpful hotel management The hotel was in a unfinished state when we arrived with unfinished paint work and dust sheets and with notices to watch your clothes for wet paint There were no signs to help you allocate your room so we ended up going down a wrong corridor I don t recall seeing any fire exit signs or emergency lighting to help you find the way back out either which I thought was actually illegal They appear to be in a rush to take as much money as possible regardless of standard health and safety requirements to their guests The Deluxe double room we were given was basically a padded coffin It was so small that it was impossible to close the door when my husband and I entered the room due to us being in the way There were no windows to this coffin and the only access to the bed was an opening of about 60cm so unlucky for you if you re the one unfortunate to be sleeping furthest away We both felt instantly claustrophobic We told reception it was way too small and that a room with windows was at least the very minimum one would expect for a expensive deluxe We were offered an identical room of the same microscopic size next to this one which was still being cleaned but with 1 window The housemaid showed us another room that she said was free but we needed to check with reception which was a small but normal room by normal I mean you could actually get to the bed We told reception the second room they offered it was still too small for us They refused to offer us the bigger room and basically blamed us for not looking at the pictures of their hotel prior to booking which I had and they were nothing like the room we were given , Nothing 
215122,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Breakfast was lovely but not very much choice We were quoted 15 a head but then only offered a croissant or a muffin Waiter told us they didn t do cooked breakfasts or cereals but it was something they were hoping to offer in the future Luckily the price was not 15 a head That s my only niggle other than that it was perfect , Location was perfect and decor was fabulous Staff very friendly and helpful also Lovely relaxing bar and great atmosphere I would definitely stay again 
215123,Mimi s Hotel Soho, We got a room which was a bit small and unhandy but the staff handled it straight away and gave us a different one which was great , The staff was amazing especially the manager and the bar people My boyfriend and I had an amazing time and felt welcome and very comfortable The location is perfect The rooms itself are cosy and cute Not the biggest but still great I would recommend it to everybody 
215124,Mimi s Hotel Soho, I searched free breakfast and parking on purpose because I wanted a property with both Mimi s came up but I had to sort my own parking and breakfast was a coffee and a pan chocolate and it wasn t free , The room was amazing and the shower was incredible 
215125,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Pictures of the room was not accurate it was extremely small with just enough room for a double bed no way you can move around with two people one would have to sit on bed while the other could stand up and for the price I paid was pretty dear for so little, The decor was lovely And the bathroom was beautiful
215126,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Room was WAY too small barely a cupboard with no clothes storage space Not a comfortable place to spend two nights Bed too short for me 6ft to stretch fully , Staff were friendly and efficient 
215127,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The bath was great I stayed in the suite but it doesn t really qualify for that title , It is a great location if you are going to head out on the town for the night not so great if you have work in the morning 
215128,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Rooms are fine for a one night stay for solo travellers Breakfast although beautifully served 12 50 for a croissant and a tea was steep , Beautiful boutique hotel great location spotless Staff amazing 
215129,Mimi s Hotel Soho,No Negative, Bed was comfortable and friendly staff but room was noisy we had to move rooms no room service available either not even for a cup of tea Expensive for what you get for your money
215130,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Should be clear that the breakfast you buy is not a cooked breakfast Not worth 15 per person The water tank in our room makes too much noise and consequently we could not sleep may just be an issue in the small double room , The staff were great The decor in the hotel is lovely Small rooms but not a problem
215131,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The room was smaller than indicated on booking com which I found quite misleading But this was not a fault with the hotel at all just be aware that if you want to have enough space to comfortably move around each other a suite would be needed , The staff and facilities were excellent everything was of superb quality The bar was well stocked and the staff friendly and knowledgeable The bed was lovely very large and incredibly comfortable The location as well is fantastic for Soho and the West End everything is in walking distance
215132,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The mini rooms are truly mini and therefore book a larger room if you are even slightly claustrophobic The mini double does not have any windows , Staff were very helpful Excellent quality 
215133,Mimi s Hotel Soho, Sold as standard double with city view Did not even have a window Tiniest room I have ever seen If my husband was getting dressed I had to get back into bed to make room No bed side table bed was surrounded by wall , good location pleasant staff Large television 
215134,Mimi s Hotel Soho, The rooms are very small we paid extra for the suite and I don t know how they can call It a suite there wasn t even anywhere to put a bottle of wine down and 2 glasses the water pressure is shocking tried to run a bath and after 15 minutes gave up We paid 30 for breakfast and all we were offered was granola and a cossaitnt and tea of coffee, The hotel was very clean and was in a good location
