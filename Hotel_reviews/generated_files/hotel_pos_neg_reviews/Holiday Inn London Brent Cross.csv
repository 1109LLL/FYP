467008,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Breakfast could have been better a really good selection both cooked and continental but not cooked to how I like, The location was only a short walk from the train station an ideally located for a concert at Wembley The bus station was just out side the car park

467021,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Didn t like how blunt the receptionist was she didn t smile or greet us politely Seemed as if we weren t people but just a name on the computer screen She wasn t rude just quite blunt Would have ordered room service for food but on the menu it seemed overly priced for a burger and chips Hated the view Could see land fills rubbish everywhere The fridge didn t work didn t get cold at all Spent some time trying to work it out gave up in the end just got some ice from the bar Despite how the room was already at a discounted rate it was still a bit too much for our personal preference , The bedroom was elegant well presented plenty of towels extra pillows Robe and slippers provided toiletries had added thought shoe shiner sewing kit shower cap etc as well as shower gel etc loved how easy it was to operate the AC and heating basic tv channels so watching footy was great Wine glasses provided so no need to keep going to the bar downstairs Can bring your own food and wine in from outside Loved how helpful the staff were how well laid out the lobby is Bed sheets and surfaces were clean not a trace of dirt dust or hair The bathroom lighting is lovely great for a woman who uses makeup Location of hotel was perfect 15 min walk from underground station 15 min walk from the shopping center

467026,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Restaurant was closed on the Saturday evening I guess due to staff shortage I had to sit in the bar area to eat Although this wasn t necessarily the fault of the hotel but there were alot of young football supporters putting their feet on tables and making alot of noise right next to me when eating my evening dinner and my morning breakfast The staff available seemed really busy but were still pleasant Need more staff to cope at weekends , Rooms clean and tidy Comfortable bed Able to open the window

467028,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Well you wouldn t book the hotel for the views, Staff friendly accommodating Organised taxis for a large group of us who were staying Hotel bar area nice place to relax The location just off the m1 is a major factor which means I d certainly stay again 
467029,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, For a supposed 4 star hotel or indeed any hotel I find it amazing that as an older woman with a lot of luggage when I requested a porter to help I was told that we don t have porters you will have to do it yourself Had it not been for a very helpful taxi driver I would have been stranded outside the hotel in the rain After my insisting someone did help me and the same scenario was repeated as I was leaving Eventually someone with a very bad grace helped me get luggage into the lobby but I was left to get it all outside myself I will never stay here again I had to point out the sign in the lobby which said if anyone needed assistance they would be happy to help blatantly not true Dreadful customer service And when I checked in I was not told anything just handed a key card and dismissed , It was very quiet 
467030,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Basic food but good No espresso , Staff was very helpful and polite many thanks to Mr W from reception who helped us to change the rooms due to a Bookings com error Quick check in check out We really enjoyed the free shuttle bus to from Brent Cross U station and to from the nearby shopping mall

467033,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, We arrived at 3 pm but were not going to be able to return from work in London to collect the car the following day until 5 pm There seemed to be some confusion at reception about the car parking charge It is a bit disappointing to have to pay a car parking charge at all If however having spent nearly 300 for two rooms B B the car parking charge for 24 hours did not afford some flexibility I would have been really disappointed One of the main reasons for choosing the hotel was the shuttle bus to and from the local underground station The drivers were lovely but the service was only available from 07 00 11 00 and from 17 00 21 00 Therefore I had two 15 minute long walks to and from Brent Cross Station I would probably have stayed there anyway but the absence of this service from 11 00 to 17 00 should have been clear at booking , Staff were friendly and helpful 
467034,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, I had to pay for two cars to park onsite and there was no concessions for disabled parking I think the parking should be free for guest especially as the general public do not use their car park because of its location The staff was unsympathetic and came across as rude,No Positive

467039,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Where do I start Stayed here on several occasions but service and facilities deteriorated Revolving door not working Bad enough that you have to lug your own luggage in with no extra hands to push door at the same time Restricted shuttle service Doesn t make sense unless driver has other duties One lift out for servicing during busy period Front desk staff complained he was on his own so easily got irritated Pancakes missing for breakfast , Self service tea with hot water Clean bathrooms Cheerful shuttle driver 
467040,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, The parking is a bit expensive well especially when we found out that we can actually dump our car in the Brent Cross shopping centre opposite for no charge at all , It is one of the nicest hotels I ve stayed in London The room was clean and staff was nice the view from the room is just majestic so do recommend to book rooms on the higher levels 
467041,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, I think the car parking spaces should be improved they need too be wider as the width of the parking space is very limited That s the only thing that would put me off staying there again Thankyou, I very much enjoyed my stay was perfect The lady at reception beatta was lovely and very professional she does a great job THANKYOU

467072,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, How can parking be charged 10 when the hotel is in a remote place relative to central London There isn t a way to get to the hotel except by car and the land is huge so parking isn t usually a problem and isn t charged at such hotel locations Furthermore I stayed here before and wasn t charged previously so it seems like it s charge on discretion Wasn t happy about this You re a traveller s hotel as you re located on the M1 so how can you expect people to avoid having their cars Just man up and reflect the parking in your prices rather than charging it as extra once the guest arrives Or make sure it s clear when the customer is booking that he ll pay extra for parking,No Positive

467103,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, The evening meal was awful I chose lasagne which was very dry as there was no sauce In between the layers of pasta This was an Executive room for which I paid more than the previous room we stayed in last June on 9th floor I would therefore have expected it to be bigger but in actual fact the cheaper room from our previous stay had far more room so this was very disappointing given that I d taken up the option to upgrade this time , Huge bed Very comfy too

467105,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, I was waiting for a table at the restaurant in the evening The lady at the counter told me to wait whilst she appeared to attend to some other tasks that were clearly more important than showing me to a table , Right next to the M1 motorwar and a free shuttle service that runs to Brent Cross Station 
467106,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Distance from tube station and shuttle didn t run in the afternoon No cell phone t call for it so a lot of walking once with heavy cases , Quiet Affordable 
467107,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross,No Negative, Free and highly efficient shuttle from hotel entrance to the small Brent cross tube station just a few meters of walking to the train itself A shopping mall with a grocery store across the street We could store basic food items in the room fridge very useful for a family of five Very polite and helpful staff Good value for money Very nice experience overall 
467108,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, My room had hairs all over the bath and the floor The bed had hairs on and was not very neat The teabags in the tea and coffee facilities were opened so I didn t trust those Luckily there s a costa 2 minutes away Also I got charged twice on my card The authorisation when you first put your card in to book doesn t get used for the actual payment they took a further payment from me so my bank account was wiped out The phone in the room didn t work the tv barely worked properly The breakfast was mediocre price was included in our room so I wouldn t complain too much but the food quality is not the greatest Our key stopped working the night before we were due to check out so had to get a new one issued and also the bath and shower were diabolical The bath took 30 minutes to fill up to a decent level and the shower went so slow and not very powerful at all , The location was good just in the right place for us with the shopping center a 10 minute walk and the tube station a 15 minute walk The staff were nice too The room was comfortable bed very comfy Our room was on the top floor and there was no noise at all 
467109,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and helpful The complimentary shuttle to and from Brent Cross station was the icing on the cake Very nice hotel definitely recommend and will stay again in the future 
467110,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Dust coming from the heater and fulling onto the bed and one coffee in room and if you go to put the tv on you have to pay more money and that s not on nice barthroom tho, Bed was comfortable
467111,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, 1 Staff was very unpatione 2 Room lights went off between 3pm and 8 am until we ask them to fix it 3 Room was very very cold they couldn t fix it until morning 4 food at the restaurant was cold 5 overall it was really bad I used holiday in every time I went on holiday or business but I think the one in London Brent Cross needs a complete change over , Nothing
467112,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Just need to clean under the beds as there was rubbish left from the last guests under the beds , Clean two double beds friendly staff great location Free shuttle service was fantastic didn t have to wait at all special thank you to Kristian Driver he was so welcoming and he even gave chocolates to my nephew which made him a happy boy Thank You Highly recommend this hotel 
467113,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Location when you re gaving a short stay the trips back and forth to London city centre eat away your time, Price quality Londonwise was good location not that good except if you plan on going to Wembley Stadium
467114,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Was given a room key of which entered a room where a lady was taking a shower , The Starbucks in the lounge is a massive plus 24hr bar useful great location 
467115,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, The shuttle car from hotel has been reduced in time from 12 midnight to 11pm only just made it back from show tube in time 3mins later we would have to get taxi Drinks were a tad pricey too, My wife packed everything apart from toothpaste reception staff were great off they went returned with 2 small tubes complete with brushes well done you two 
467116,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Shuttle service is limited in time not for 24 hours 2 miles from nearest tube station I paid for car park for two days at check in time and at check out the receptionist ask me to pay again because the receptionist didn t recorded it in the computer they didn t believe me when I said I am completely sure I paid at check in until I show them the payment in my online mobile bank application really it is too shame on them , Location near to M1 road very clean shuttle services to nearest tube station car parking 
467117,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Can think of anything , 10 Parking good value in London was excellent even arriving later great and I mean grate customer service quality breakfast super comfy bed in good size room good price deal 
467118,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, When I arrived around 11pm the member of staff at the desk was unfriendly and his manner was abrupt He wasn t able to manage a smile or a good evening I am unsure if that was his general way but it wasn t what you expect when checking into a well known hotel chain after travelling from far and a long day I used to work for a hotel chain and we were advised to be welcoming and accommodating When I entered my room there was such an awful smell possibly drains or possibly someone had used the bathroom before I checked in This was quite off putting and made the room seem less clean , The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable The morning staff were very helpful and pleasant In the morning I noticed that a part of the shower was broken so I rang reception A gentleman came promptly and resolved the issue He was really polite and pleasant as was the lady at the desk when I checked out They were both friendly and well mannered 
467119,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Poor bathroom lights Tried a sandwich from the bar definitely below average, Good sized room nice beds clineliness polite and helpful staff There is also a direct free shutle bus service from the tube station to the hotel and backwards 
467120,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Clean but now tired Could do with refurbishment , Excellent location close to major motorways Despite location next to the road noise was non existent Brent cross shopping mall just across the foot walk Welcoming staff Ample parking Had discounted rate hence excellent value for money 
467121,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross,No Negative, Friendly staff and the shuttle service to the nearby train station was superb and the hotel is only a very short walk away from the Brent Cross shopping complex Definitely stay here again when next visiting London 
467122,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Room was poorly built and shabby What you would call half a 3d attempt at decoration and building Usual cowboy builder stuff , Excellent service in restaurant and in reception

467126,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Car park access is rubbish loads of spaces coned off for building works and loads of spaces filled with vans and the traffic in the morning even at 645 AM was horrendous,No Positive
467127,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, The staff were almost completely terrible The receptionist didn t even say hello or smile they took 15 minutes to take each food order the food then took 30 minutes to arrive AND they got one of our orders wrong Nobody smiled everyone seemed miserable , The room was great Spacious clean and comfortable 
467128,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, We were a little disappointed as the hotel facilities listed a cocktail lounge however the bar staff informed us that they do not serve cocktails , The shuttle service that the hotel provided was invaluable Loved the choice of pillows too and really comfy beds best sleep I ve had in a long time 
467129,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, When the driver said i needed to be down in ten seconds or he is going little rude and when he told me i had 10 minutes or hes not coming back although it was only quarter past 11 but he did come back just unnessecary to speak in a rude term , Free shuttle bus as i needed to go shop
467130,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross,No Negative, I liked the helpfulness of the staff to ensure that we got to where we wanted to be when we were meant to be there The shuttle to the underground is excellent 
467131,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Nothing at all , The free shuttle bus to the tube and fact I could leave the car all day and travel into centre London without any hassle was a definite bonus The breakfast was fab with a pancake maker for my daughter which kept her entertained Staff all very friendly

467135,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, The food at the breakfast buffet is varied and abundant but not everything is very good the eggs are dry the granola is rancid and the grapefruit bitter And the worst the plates and the serving utensils were burning hot from being under the bright spotlights but every day someone gave me a fresh one which hadn t been heated after I complained The hair dryer in the room was encased in a drawer and had a cord which didn t allow me to reach any mirror but they gave me another one , I got a quiet room away from the elevator just as I asked The shuttle service to the underground station and the shopping center is very practical The porridge you have to order it especially at the breakfast buffet was delicious 
467136,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, having to pay for parking when resident, reception staff were excellent shuttle facility to tube was very convenient breakfast was good value for money

467138,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Obtaining the chit system for Breakfast could be modified such that one need not line up to obtain it at the reception alongside the people checking in the morning I should imagine that travellers indicate their breakfast preferences and this could be captured in the master list from where the people going for breakfast can be ticked as they enter the dining room , The meals are excellent 
467139,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Paying 10 per night for parking Paying for fast broadband Had to make do with own MiFi When sofa bed was down room was small , Location great as next to Brent Cross Shopping Centre Also right next to North Circular so easy to go to rest of London 
467140,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, Current price of hotel room was really overpriced I was a little disappointed There was an empty fridge freezer in the room which I feel should have had at least a couple of bottles of water in it Apparently this was only available to executives in an executive room suite , Welcome I received from Receptionist was very warm and informative The use of computers in the lobby was a great aspect so I had great expectations for the room I had been given 
467141,Holiday Inn London Brent Cross, your web site is misleading I was charged for car parking at a higher rate than local overnight car parks I was charged for internet both of these additional costs are not obvious on your web site so naturally I was dissapointed, Large bed good tv chanels
