313776,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The breakfast was not good but there was a cheaper better place just next door The bed was surprisingly uncomfortable No mattress cover so you feel every bump on the mattress I have the name of the mattress manufacturer permanently engraved on my butt We had to kick the door to get it open If you would like to know what the people in the next room thought about their vacation no problem The walls are paper thin The A C was sometimes cold sometimes not always musty The WIFI was a disaster Spotty and slow I had to go downstairs to the office and plug in ethernet just to load a webpage The staff was great they tried everything to help , The neighborhood is perfect You are right off La Rambla so it is a 30 second walk there without the noise of people all around your hotel at night The staff was very helpful We had a medical issue and they were great 
313777,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The airconditioner was not working properly It was very hot and uncomfortable We informed the front desk the sent a technician but they didnt do anything other than check the vent They said it would cool in a few minutes It never did We had four rooms because we were a family of 11 in our group and all our rooms were HOT ,No Positive
313778,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Someone smoking in one of the rooms got smell through airconditioner on day 3 of our stay , Location is good for walking to most of the sites in Barcelona and shopping 
313779,Eurostars Cristal Palace, the cleanliness of the room was bad the toilet were mouldy the room was too dim and dark the aircon was not cold enough despite we made a complaint to the management no kettle no mugs and spoon for drinking no toothbrush despite being a 4 stars hotel no room slippers blankets were just bed sheet which was not comfotable at all , The staffs were nice and breakfast was OK
313780,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Everything this must be the worst hotel in Barcelona The online pictures are not true to life Poor quality hotel, We liked nothing about this hotel Staff was not very helpful the hotel does not deserve 4 star bed sheets smelled bathroom had mould furniture old and stained we had to check out next day to alternative hotel and suffered cancellation fee The hotel should refund the fee and breakfast was awful too
313781,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The rooms where not exactly clean I asked once to the cleaning person to come back and hover the floor It was not being cleaned and under the beds it was quite dirty The beds were quite confortable tough , The staff there is really friendly and helpful 
313782,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The bathroom was not well maintained It was clean but the flush kept on leaking The bath had rusty fittings No issues with water pressure or use of bathroom , The location Reception has helpful people Rooms are good sized
313783,Eurostars Cristal Palace, i specifically asked for a hotel with airconditoning and unfortunately the weather was hot during the afternoon and some evenings and when I requested the use of the A C they said that it wasn t possible and it would take a technician a week to have it turned on This was a very strange answer and not acceptable in fact if it wasnt for the fact that we had paid for the whole vacation I was seriously considering moving the hotel in front of your hotel because they had a room with a terrace and their a c was working , The beds and pillows were comfy The terrace was wide and great for relaxing on 
313784,Eurostars Cristal Palace, See above , Did not clean room 2 of 6 days Hard to use electronics since normal 220 vollt to 110 volt transformers didn t fit their one outlet in the room which wasn t near the desk the bed was merely two twin beds next to one another 
313785,Eurostars Cristal Palace, It is small detail however better to mention that the bathroom was tired and it should be renovated , Staff at the reception is so kind and helpful that they corrected their minor mistake in my first day with a room upgrade following day The location is at the heart of the downtown and the most popular restaurants are nearby the hotel Similarly it takes 5 minutes walk to the metro which goes to the famous touristic attractions 
313786,Eurostars Cristal Palace, SOME breakfast were inattentive and DID NOT serve our basic requests in spite of several reminders ketchup knife and warm up the grilled vegetables Duty manager was hopeless Very disappointed with the breakfast service no tea and coffee in room, hotel location reception service hot showers
313787,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Our room was on the front of the hotel with no air conditioner so we had to have the windows open and the road was so loud we could barely sleep , Rooms were a good size clean and comfortable Staff was great 
313788,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The room was not clean noisy from inside and outside Furniture need to be renvated The garage is very small and look more like a storage room Except for the location the hotel is overpriced and overrated , Fantastic location
313789,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Room was very small This is just a statement of fact not a complaint I needed a bed to sleep in and they gave a clean modern place to do so Just in a very tiny room D, Thoroughly modern hotel Very clean Very good price for right downtown They upgraded me to a room with a veranda 
313790,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Don t be fooled by the 4 stars this hotel does not live up to it The hotel is ok but not a 4 star The room was pretty worn The slide doors to the terrace had broken handles and one of the doors didn t close Lack of information We didn t receive any information about time and location of breakfast etc at check in We arrived a little early and our room was not ready so we left our luggage and went out to come back an hour later Maybe this is the reason why the information was lost Problems with toilet We had problems with the flush on the toilet We first had to use the toilet bin and fill it with water to flush the toilet They sent a guy to fix it and it got a little better but not really good Also there were no toilet brush which is just horrible No cattle to cook water No AC or fan so the temperature was a bit high during night It was over all cleaned properly in the room but there was a thick layer of dust under the bed The glass doors were really dirty The bed sheets had raptures , The location is great Very close to the airbus stop and the metro La Rambla is just 50 meters from the entrance We booked a room with terrace on the 9th highest floor which was nice The terrace is big and had a table with two chairs and one sun bed Since we stayed on the 9th floor we had sun on the terrace most of the day Bed was comfortable They had a pillow menu but we didn t see that until the last day so we missed out the opportunity to choose pillows I wish they would have told us about the pillow menu when checking in The pillows we got was not bad so it was ok Breakfast was really priceworthy a lot to choose from both hot and cold Espresso machine Personal was friendly Fast elevator The wi if was fast and stable Not something you can take for granted when staying at hotels but this wi if was great 
313791,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Rooms too small house keeping needs to be upgraded and more control of lobby in terms of security as a friend got robbed passport and money , Location and friendliness of staff also very helpful
313792,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Mattress was very firm and felt the springs The staff were extremely unhelpful On a double bed one mattress was about 8 inches higher than the other , Good breakfast and ambience 
313793,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The walls between each room were a bit thin so we had to hear the noises of next room while we were at bed , Very nice and friendly staffs Rooms were wide enough traveling with 2kids and me for the price 
313794,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The room was like a greenhouse with a large wall size windows The cleanness of the room wasn t for a 4 star hotel , The location was really nice if you like just hanging around the city center 
313795,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The room is quite small , Very well placed everything is close while no marginal public like at La Rambla Comfortable room Good breakfast Overall good value for money 
313796,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, Staff and facilities were amazing There was also a little tapas and bar brand new just opended attached to the hotel which is also amazing for a quick drink or tapas hotel was so clean and bedroom was perfect Could not fault this hotel at all definitely be staying here again and will also recommend to friends
313797,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Cockroach in the bath tub on second last night made me question cleanliness of the hole room No double beds just 2 single beds pusher together and kept sliding apart during the night , Location is everything with this hotel It s right were you want to be lots of bars and restaurants only around the corner
313798,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The view from the window wasn t great But hey no one is there for the view of the window , Liked the set up in the room Nice comfortable beds with very helpful staff
313799,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The rooms has no light You can t see you luggage let alone read a book our first room had 2 broken light bulbs and we had to call the reception three times until someone came to check it out Plus the chair in the room was broken The other room that they moved us to also had broken light bulb Some of the spoons and plates were quite dirty and one time there wasn t any hot water which was a bit bummer and we were told to wait , The location is excellent This is the main advantage of the hotel It s also very quite and the street is safe at night The breakfast was good and most of the stuff was very nice while there were few disavantages if the price is good you should stay here
313800,Eurostars Cristal Palace, my room was not cleaned on time no satellite TV working only 50 spanish channels staff has great objection handling however helping to solve an issue is another matter, location
313801,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, Amazing location everything is super near Breakfast is great The best thing are free bottles of water you recieve each day beautiful gesture We had terrace which had stunning view 
313802,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Four star might be a reach Room was cold and radiator in bathroom didnt help much phone directory was unclear and i was unable to connect to free wifi kept saying i was an invalid guest Scratches and cracks here and there but overall a nice neat room , I liked the view from the floor to ceiling windows location was great bed was comfortable and bathroom clean which is always important 
313803,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Could have been great if facility for coffe tea were there No support for small things like an adapter borrow , Nice staff good breakfast closer to main city
313804,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Not soundproof at all Breakfast was not bad But not as good as another Eurostar I stayed in Madrid No vegitables in the breakfast All meat or bread, Location Room cozy clean
313805,Eurostars Cristal Palace, No kettle to boil water No complimentary coffee tea Was not considered for early checked in eventhough I checked out at 3 am morning It should be factored in considering for early cyeck in ,No Positive
313806,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, The staff were very nice we came early were able to leave our bags and go look around and also after we checked out We got a bit lost but we re able to get back from all different places and the room was great Would definitely be staying there again when we come back in the summer 
313807,Eurostars Cristal Palace, No heating no condition on December Breakfast was ok Problems with lifts Often only one lift works Problems with electronic keys , Good location Calm place 
313808,Eurostars Cristal Palace, We stayed three to a room as they had an option to add a bed to the room and it was MUCH cheaper than anything else in Barcelona for two rooms This was a mistake Saving the money was good but I had a horrible time I was on the roll away bed which they had stuck next to the window which took up the whole wall Who the heck wants to sleep against a wall of windows on a incredibly busy street with the cold right against you Also I was on the fourth floor and I really do not like heights could have been higher but still It was horrible they should only offer that option in rooms without a floor to ceiling window Terrifying Furthermore paneling was coming off the molding was gone in many places Furniture was broken and splintering Bath tub looked like it had permanent stains on it They advertise that they have air conditioning but apparently not in winter We tried to turn the fan on to sleep as it was incredibly noisy only to find out that our only option was fan and heat or no fan at all No where to even change the temperature just had a switch for the fan We weren t expecting the best as we knew it would be a tight fit but the room was in terrible shape Not worth saving the money , The breakfast was good and the location is great That is about it Would have gotten a much worse review if not for these aspects Front desk did help us book tickets so we really appreciated that Staff was friendly 
313809,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Smiling staff, Fantastic position only few minutes walking from Plaza Catalunya and Rambla Fantastic cakes for breakfast Big and silent room very comfortable bed
313810,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The hotel is a little dated and could do with being a bit more modenised to keep up to date with other hotels in the area , Location excellent staff very helpful and pleasant and the room was very comfortable and quiet 
313811,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, The staff were very accommodating for an early morning checkout with good advice and assistance The hotel was very close to the old town area with its maze of streets and close to restaurants The bus to the airport picks up for the town square only a few blocks away 
313812,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The basement parking is tight for bigger cars we maneuvered our 7 seater in and out of it with difficulty Lifts are small and slow this means more time and effort for luggage if you are in a group And like some others have said the food was not hot which leaves not a pleasant feeling on a winter morning The hotel should consider using heating lamps or hot water trays on the counter to keep the food warm and delicious , Great location in the city center just a stone s throw away from the tourist hotspots of Placa da Catalunya and La Ramblas We were able to walk around to almost all important destinations A taxi to Sagrada Familia cost us under EUR 6 The hotel has a large lobby where guests can wait and have a free welcome drink Private parking is a blessing in this busy area The rooms are comfortable and clean The front desk esp Alvarez and Jorge won us over with their special service We arrived early so they kept our luggage for the best part of the day while we toured the city We had booked one room with terrace and they upgraded the other to a terrace room for free It doesn t end here they waived the full parking fee of EUR 23 and even let us use the parking for several hours after we checked out And on our request they also called up a Eurostars hotel in Valencia and got us the best deal I m definitely coming back 
313813,Eurostars Cristal Palace, 1 The breakfast was awful 2 The front desk staff weren t great They seemed to only able to do one thing at a time and was not aware when there was a queue and would continue long conversations with the people they were serving They did not display any sense of urgency or attention At the very least they could have addressed the people in the line to say that they would be attended to shortly attention is part of the service An exception was Frank whom I found quite attentive and helpful , 1 The room was very modern and clean with a huge bed very comfortable even if the hotel in general looking a little old 2 GREAT location 
313814,Eurostars Cristal Palace, staff was not really nice they had to change our room because it was not big enough for one extra bed and baby bad what we have asked before coming so it was disaster we had to wait too much to come in our room room service is external so is just available until 23 hours and they didn t warn us , location was super
313815,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Nothing to carry lugged We didn t get the room we booked twin room with a terrace they gave as a 1 BR where the bed is only 1 40 m wide with a terrace because they where over booked so I was glad when the 7 days where over and I was able to sleep again in a big and comfortable bed That there was no real lobby only 2 sofas for 2 people to sit on no place for drinking coffee or a soft drink because the cafe was closed The breakfast is nothing to write home about the scrambled eggs on the counter where always cold and I order 2 eggs sunny side up I got two totally over fried brown color eggs that we gave back and they even ask what was wrong with the eggs they said they were perfectly cook , The Hotel location is very central to go the the metro or bus taxi stand right outside the hotel 
313816,Eurostars Cristal Palace, It would be nice if the hotel had a second coffee machine in the bar lounge area so that guests could at least have a cup of coffee later in the day Also the breakfast hot foods were always cold and I was there early but for 11 the fresh fruit pastries coffee and cheese were enough for me , The staff was extremely helpful in offering directions to get around the city and very accommodating with a smile For those that say the staff was rude I can only think that these reviewers approached the staff with an attitude I received nothing but great assistance The location CANNOT BE BEAT convenient to everything 
313817,Eurostars Cristal Palace, the hotel score is really high and honestly we dont understand why we had to wit in the lobby for an hour later until 15 00 becaue it wasnt ready Moreover the room wasnt clean and there was always noise from the plumbing system of the next door room when they got shower In conclusion really dissapointing hotel , close to the center
313818,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The staff was not quite friendly When I asked something about the direction to the staff they were only answering with poker face no smiling nor showing any hospitality, The comfortness of the room is great it is quiet warm and homy The hotel is also located in the center of barcelona it is near the popular street la ramblas just need to walk for few minutes to get there 
313819,Eurostars Cristal Palace, the standard double room view against a wall No coffee or tea making facilities in room , Location 2 blocks away from Plaza Catalunya only Many eateries around hotel 
313820,Eurostars Cristal Palace, There are no sleepers in the rooms even if we request them didnt given us the wc is dirty our room was cold and the air condition was not working one of the worst hotel experience except the location, Location
313821,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Wish it had power outlets near the bed , Location was excellent just a few blocks away from main metro train station and Plaza Catalunya where La Rambla starts ends Nice restaurants and bars around Breakfast was not included but we paid for it and it was super good Very clean quiet and comfortable rooms 
313822,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, I really liked the location What was a pleasant surprise was that the waiting area for the taxi was just at the corner so when I had to ask for a taxi for 5 30 in the morning there was no problem 
313823,Eurostars Cristal Palace, We felt the hotel could be updated , The staff we very great we arrived early and they kept our bags for us until our room was ready They were very helpful with explaining must sees in Barcelona
313824,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Staff unhelpful and showed no desire to provide a friendly service Room with a terrace was good but over priced Paid a different rate for each of 3 nights 260 180 160 Certainly not worth 260 Great location Would not stay there again or any Eurostars hotel based on this experience Much better hotels to choose from with great service , Location Clean Near a fantastic restaurant called Cachitos which is not to be missed 
313825,Eurostars Cristal Palace, overprized however we booked short in advance and it was a festival weekend with shows and performances in town and most hotels were already booked out, Great buffet for the morning plenty of food in two ident buffets no queing in peak times Great variety of hot and cold food Friendly staff 
313826,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Having travelled for a number of years we had the worst experience of noisy inconsiderate men in rooms next to an adjacent to ours Noise continued until after 4 am First night we rang to complain Second night no sleep Spoke with manager he refunded one nights Accomodation Eurostars is usually a great chain I was quite disappointed , Position and parking for our car excellent 
313827,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The expected queen bed turned out to be twin beds put together , Room was very clean and comfortable Breakfast was included and had good selection and nice breakfast room Great location two blocks from Catalunya Sq and Las Ramblas Good value for money Would stay again 
313828,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Hotel needed decorated and updated Bar was no longer in use Foyer was grubby and lacked atmosphere Jacuzzi bath didn t work , Excellent location 
313829,Eurostars Cristal Palace, We could not get our shower head to work but did 1 2 way thru our stay Also someone needs to look into removing the small areas of black stuff in the bathtub grout area for future guests , The location was great access to the city where walking and safety were paramount Jorge was our main superstar Always with a smile and willing to make your stay uncomplicated And when he was not there whoever was there carried on to do the same Jorge we hope your dream comes true Breakfasts were great too to start our day 
313830,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Air con was fierce But sometimes welcome Room service menu not available in room almost as if they were trying to discourage ppl from using it perhaps as the restaurant wasn t open Didn t need it anyway Price was steep without some of the facilities I was expecting it felt expensive , Great location helpful staff nor always around when you needed them though Hotel details talked about a restaurant and snack bar but in my 3 night midweek stay I didn t see either of these open or being used by anyone But there was no need for them there is such a huge number of other options a simple few steps away The hotel is literally 5 mins from Plaza de Las Catalunya and the mega shopping paradise of Las Ramblas Breakfast buffet was amazing 
313831,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Breakfast wasn t worth the money Room was okay nothing great The shower leaked and there was mold around the glass gross , Great location Plenty of places to eat and shop around and easy to walk to the bus stops 
313832,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The facilities look like they haven t been updated since the 90s or so the shower was almost broken No kettle for tea or coffee in the room and the room service was extremely bad I had to call the front desk to order since i had no room service menu in my room the receptionist spoke very rudely saying that there s a menu next to the tv which i told her there wasn t she didn t even apologise I seriously don t know why this is a four stars hotel I ve stayed in many three stars hotel around the world and they re much much better , The location was perfect The housekeeping staff was very friendly and professional 
313833,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Wish all the stuff be like the lady who gives me advice to leave early at Barcelona match to find a taxi and she fixed the safety box for us and she was in the reception in the day I left in 20 8 At almost 8 am thanks a lot and I wish that all the stuff not be the one in the reception who I told him that the air conditioning is not working and he tell you must wait for tomorrow and that was before the match of Barcelona and sevilla, It s comfy but without covering for the children
313834,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The rooms are tiny Barely 1 meter space left and right from the bed but very very clean Staff was weird and very very slow Value for money was absolutely a failure 200 a night and barely facilities available shower gym or anything close to that breakfast was ok but not really a lot of choice It s a hotel that should cost more than 100 120 a night regardless of high season or low , Location was quite good and close to a shopping street metro station or subway was very close and easy accessible 
313835,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, The city is beautiful with old and new architecture blending together Shopping and restaurants plenty and within easy access People where friendly and helpful and It did not have the big city hurry hurry syndrom 
313836,Eurostars Cristal Palace, no bell hop service furniture was scuffed room was not worth the rate paid similar rate for hotel Spadai in Florence which was 100 times better poor communication from staff regarding simple things like where is the mini bar and are charges incurred water in the room is it complimentary etc overall not worth the rate, I liked the location 
313837,Eurostars Cristal Palace, You may be surprised that there is a brick wall instead of any view out of the window but who cares about that in Barcelona Breakfast could be warmer , Location was excellent Staff very friendly and helpful 
313838,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Nothing , This hotel was a true find Everything was excellent the staff was friendly the room clean and spacious the terrace was large and had great views the showers had great water pressure the breakfast was full of many options My girlfriend and I booked for one night and stayed for two because we liked it so much And best of all it was really affordable for Barcelona 
313839,Eurostars Cristal Palace, AC in the room was not so efficient, The hotel is located in the center of Barcelona Metro access is just around the corner So is a taxi stop Lots of restaurants on the next by street Ramblas de Catalonia Breasfast is simple Rooms are ok 
313840,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The breakfast must improve English language was poor No bar and no restaurant facilities These would have been welcome especially for those like us who were waiting for a late departure flight, The bedrooms were clean and the double bed a great size
313841,Eurostars Cristal Palace, When we stayed the prices were rather high Difficult to see what facilities the hotel had as entrance hall was very narrow and unwelcoming although the staff were very helpful, Excellent position for much of interest in Barcelona Very quiet in room we were on the top floor with a large terrace with sun loungers and a table which we could have used more if we had stayed longer than 2 nights The bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in The parking was one of the reasons we booked the hotel which was good as there were few cars in it I have a large car so no need to worry about access although the entrance exit is steep but you have to expect that We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there were plenty of little cafes where you could eat more cheaply
313842,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The staff was rude and useless We arrived at 12am and they dont allowed us to do checkin We left for tourism and went back to hotel at 11pm As our checkout would be at 4am we wouldnt stay only 5 hours in the hotel we asked for charge only half room rate and it was denied We asked in reception for a taxi and he denied to call Said to us to walk by ourselves in the dark of 4am with heavy luggage Too much expensive for what it offers , Great location close to plaza catalunya subway Batl house and the night life area Good wifi included
313843,Eurostars Cristal Palace, I didn t quite like the room and I felt like the price I paid was too high for the conditions we had , Location is great right in the hearth of Barcelona and people at the reception are friendly Breakfast was excellent with a lot of food to choose from 
313844,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The Breakfast was very poor above all the service at the Breakfast pathetic to the extent that there was no replenishment for certain items Must improve on the Breakfast menu and most important the service , The Location the room and cleanliness
313845,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, Great location walking distance from city center great breakfast including lactose free options friendly staff parking available and didn t charge for moto 
313846,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The first night it sounded like a party was going on outside it was hard to sleep But the next night was great and quite , Very close to attractions and sight seeing bus lines 
313847,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Not soundproof you can hear the people from near rooms when they flush their toilet using bath , Great location Huge comfort bed nice room quiet area no noise from the street at night free safe at room we took the 25m room and it was very good for us in terms of space 2 adults and 2 years old baby 
313848,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Not that much just waiting long time to check in only one person handled all check in , bed was very comfy and this hotel located in the middle of downtown good for shopping and sightseeing
313849,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The room is not soundproof if you get connecting room you can hear what other room sound noise And no staff could help you with your bag they move slowly,No Positive
313850,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Breakfast was disappointing hot food options were cold not much choice and not very appealing We were not aware until after we arrived that the hotel restaurant does not open in the evening at weekends and there is no bar at any time We would have liked to go back to the hotel at the end of the night for a drink but couldn t do this , The location
313851,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Just one thing Our room had an adjoining door which had a one inch gap between the bottom of the door and the floor To say the least I will avoid this next time though I will return to the Hotel , The staff were superb All very friendly and accommodating Breakfast was top grade 
313852,Eurostars Cristal Palace, NO TEA COFFEE FACILITY SUPPLIED IN ROOM, LOT OF VARIETY AT BREAKFAST TERRACE COMFORTABLE BED VERY CLEAN BEDDING TOWELS 2ND TIME TO STAY HERE WILL ALWAYS USE THIS HOTEL IN BARCELONA
313853,Eurostars Cristal Palace, A basic kettle and instant coffee would have been appreciated and are expected in a four star hotel Additionally toiletries are offered in low consumptions i e one small bottle of shampoo and one small bottle of shower gel daily , Well located nicely furnished hotel having a very good breakfast served in a large dining room Staff are very nice and cleanliness throughout Two bottles of fresh drinking water are offered apparently free of charge on a daily basis 
313854,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The Room the room Both room we staid in where very poorly maintained both the shower glass patrician had mold on the bottom of the glass and on the corners of the bath tub the towel dispenser in the bidet was broken would not hold towels and toilet paper dispenser was also broken would not hold the rolls an that room was to be an upgrade from the previos stay The beds where hard as a rock I like firm but that is overboard , The location was excellent the staff was very helpful in every aspect The breakfast was a very good value 
313855,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Noticed a few posts saying it was shabby and worn I agree For example a bit of floor board had chipped off in our room which was noticeable however apart from some minor touch ups that need seeing too it was fine , Perfect location 10 minute walk from pla a de catalunya which is the main square situated pretty much on la rambles so close to restaurants shops bars about 20 minutes walk to the port and also la sagrada familiar Staff were welcoming and very helpful The rooms were big airy and comfortable and came equipped with a power shower and bath Even though it is very central very quiet in the hotel at night to catch some much needed sleep Pla a de catalunya is a main stop for the aerobus 6 euros single a lot cheaper than taxis as well the open bus tours Personally I preferred the metro to the open bus tours as it was much quicker cheaper however if you want the experience of a guide telling you background to the attractions etc it is worth it Overall great location staff and clean Would 100 stay here again 
313856,Eurostars Cristal Palace, No tea coffee making facilities in room, Perfect location in central Barcelona Rooms were good size and bathrooms of a good standard Breakfast was good with varied choice Balcony room was unexpected bonus All staff friendly and helpful
313857,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The room was very small and the air conditioning is not adjustable from each room It was inevitably hot , He Location is great Convenient Parking 
313858,Eurostars Cristal Palace, There was no bar where you could sit down and have a relaxing drink after a long day sightseeing There are plenty of bars in the area but it would have been a perfect finish to the day to be able to sit down and relax with a drink and then upstairs to bed , The staff were courteous friendly and spoke several laguages including english The location was good and the rooms very nice with comfortable beds Would definitely stay there again 
313859,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Dirty floors mold in the bathroom tub not in very good shape , Staff is freindly and helpful the Hotel is not well kept dirty floors mold in the bath tub not a place that I will recommend to a friend 
313860,Eurostars Cristal Palace, No security and as everybody knows a lot thieves in Barcelona I was stolen mobile inside the hotel and so that is not acceptable Also the fact that hotell staff didnt even make an effort to find solution Terrible , Location
313861,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Not super clean unhelpful staff member when I checked in late at night Incorrect timing listed on their room service menu Room had a weird smell ,No Positive
313862,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Both mornings when coming to the breakfast food was basically gone took a long time before the staff refilled Also the coffee machine was broken and all available tables were covered with dishes Felt like they were understaffed Also it was terribly hot in the room When asking about the air condition we were told that there was only heating at the moment april and that the AC was only used in july and august Being a 4 star hotel this is NOT acceptable with 25 degrees outside in april you must be able to get cool air wonder how it will feel in june or september then We kept the window open for a while before going to bed but couldn t have it open all night due to the noise from the street , Spacious rooms even with an extra bed Very friendly and helpful staff in the reception Well assorted breakfast 
313863,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Our room was separated with a door from the room beside Sound isolation was very bad Therefore it was an unsettling situation I advise you to share this concern with the staff before you stay there , We stayed 3 night in this hotel Hotel staff was very helpful and rooms was clean Location was perfect 
313864,Eurostars Cristal Palace, No tea and coffee making facilities in room Poor television reception awful picture Shower enclosure no matter how careful couldn t avoid the water getting on to the floor making it very slippy , Room cleanliness and buffet breakfast Friendly and helpful staff Close to public transport Good night s sleep 
313865,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The bed should be double and not 2 single beds joined together This makes it little difficult to sleep , The location is near the major roads The wifi is good 
313866,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Our next door guests were extremely noisy the first night We found out later that they were part of a large young group of travelers We would have preferred being separated however the staff was kind enough to ask them to consider other guests and be more quiet and the rest of our stay was wonderful , The staff was extremely helpful in giving directions the breakfast was extensive and the staff even had a separate buffet set up for a large group so that the other guests weren t inconvenienced at all They were able to help with the language barriers as well 
313867,Eurostars Cristal Palace, While booking through booking com it only showed the 1st day of booking but it appeared that there was price fluctuation that wasn t clear in the confirmation sheet ,No Positive
313868,Eurostars Cristal Palace, When booking I asked for double bed but we got two separate beds It is not really 4 stars rather 3 5 Hotel needs to be refurbished It should be a coffee tea set in the room , Breakfast is very nice big choice 
313869,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The bath set was for one person We 2 persons stayed for 4 nights and every time we wanted to take a shower we had to phone the reception for second bath set shampoo and shower gel , Perfect location Large beds and windows kind personal at the reception You have to give a deposit for the safety box but they return it at check out We payed 50 EUR for late check out 17 00 that was quite convenient for us 
313870,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, The hotel was very central and easy to find The staff were so helpful The metro wasn t far away The room was fantastic it was so clean had everything we needed The bathroom was big and everything was perfect for a weekend break We will definitely return to this hotel on our next break 
313871,Eurostars Cristal Palace, This is NOT a 4 star hotel 2 star in best case The view is on next building s wall You cannot open window because of smell from the outside First they cancelled our reservation with 30 minutes notice for no real reason they didn t think that maybe we re travelling and don t have access to e mails At check out they tried to charge us telephone costs we never made They didn t know how to make 2 separate invoices for 2 persons And they didn t even try to apologize but kept convincing us where this costs might be from until I didn t ask for boss , Position
313872,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The bathroom and shower need some improvements The heating system didn t worked but the staff provided us with an external heater , Location staff clean rooms and comfortable beds 
313873,Eurostars Cristal Palace, We were unlucky to have noisy people in adjoining rooms but we decided not to change rooms as the hotel was clearly almost full , Staff were very helpful and the hotel is in an excellent central location Rooms we had were modern and clean 
313874,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Not so great but still acceptable Breakfast was basic limited variety not great tasting but edible Pastries bread juices sausages and eggs Some of party felt the meat was a little under cooked And the powdered eggs weren t a big hit Refills were available but slow Hotel was busy during our stay but staff did their best which is what matters The key safe but that s a personal preference Lighting in room lobby by full mirror a little dull for us ladies but the bathroom mirror was well lit Sound proofing ok couldn t hear outside but might hear loud TV if your really bothered quiet We came to enjoy the city Rooms were clean but looked a little worn in some rooms But still good to stay in Especially for cost , Perks Free wifi Great location Great value Helpful pleasant reception staff Good service from all staff Good generous sized rooms Toiletries and towels Good Heating and cooling in room Beds comfortable Good hot water Rooms cleaned daily Generous wardrobe spaces Easy access to airport metro and many tourist locations Within 5 7 mins walk to la rambla and placa de catalunya main square Perfect to explore both on foot or transport Feedback from entire party of 9 5 rooms Tips Maps from reception Free tickets to some clubs from reception Free personal travel guide from booking com or visit trip advisor Travel to airport by metro quick cheap easy Hire segways for really good value deals and see parts of city inc beach in style www w4nted com great service 17 passeig de colom Barceloneta metro Go off beaten path visit various bars and eateries inc ice cream parlour off the la rambla pl ferran rd by KFC More positive than negative We would stay again and would recommend 
313875,Eurostars Cristal Palace, That vacation was very special for us because of my pregnancy and before our arrival we booked for a king size bed and send a comment through booking com please do not combine two seperate beds to make a queen bed but they had done just exactly the opposite After that we called the reception to change the room the did not follow up their answer was NO Personel also needs to learn english they can not understand you when you ask something Room was not clean housekeeping service did not clean the dust on the floor and somedays they forgot to refresh the towels , Location was amazing Room was confortable and big enough Breakfast open buffet was also very nice and rich 
313876,Eurostars Cristal Palace, I paid for bb fair I ask for early brekfast because i had to go to airport but the hotel bib not arrenge it or pay me my mony back, Nice hotel overall
313877,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The Hotel said it had a bar but it did not have one The only English speaking programmes on the hotel room t v was CNN and Aljazeera on holiday we do not watch t v but this was a break were we wanted to chill in the evening and as there was no bar etc and we just wanted to relax in our hotel we could not even stay in our room to watch t v We also asked for a double bed and was given a twin , It was just near the Bus stop modern and near the main shopping centres
313878,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Room was small No sleepers in the washroom , Location was excellent Near to taxi stand and grand shopping areas Staff was supportive we wanted to see FCB match and the guy on reception arranged tickets for us Easy and quick Checkin and out 
313879,Eurostars Cristal Palace, No balcony to the room though one was available at extra cost , Great location close to Metro station and train from airport All amenities in close proximity Friendly staff and large and comfortable room massive bed Good breakfast 
313880,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The AC wasn t functioning properly which left my room hotter than the hallways The view isn t the best , Location is wonderful Very close to great restaurants and shopping places and right in the center between Pla a Catalunya and Passeig de Gracia The bed is super comfortable and the bathroom is really nice The room is wonderful 
313881,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Terrible wifi At the year 2015 a 4 stars hotel with a wifi like this is horrible When you are a tourist far away from your country the Internet is your guide for traveling The hotels must understand at last that the wifi is a must Also our reservation was for a smoking room and when we was there they said to us that is a not smoking hotel They still didn t change that option at the booking com site The women that they clean the rooms they smell awful from their sweat and that smell stays when they live the room Terrible smell for us , Perfect location 
313882,Eurostars Cristal Palace, A receptionist man wasnt very welcoming when we first arrived midnight he kept talking on the phone the minute we arrived however there is a girl on the reception thats very good she stays in the after noon I did not like the food served during breakfast, I liked the location it is close to the tourist attractions Close to placa de catalunia and las ramblas Wifi is very good The hotel is very clean as well
313883,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The cleanliness should be improved Smoking stench in the room , Great personnel Very nice and helpful Great bathroom great wi fi very comfortable beds fantastic localization Free left luggage 
313884,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Although the rooms looked nice at first sight there were some maintenance issues here and there Like a damaged chair damaged floorplint, The hotel is perfectly situated Close to La Rambla the subway station and taxi stands Passeig de Garcia Friendly staff members and an excellent breakfast
313885,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Not great that I had to pay to use the safe And they changed my towels and soap every day unnecessarily which doesn t help the environment , Spacious and clean bedroom and bathroom Great location Receptionist when I checked in was really friendly and helpful 
313886,Eurostars Cristal Palace, It was a bad bad experience This was my and my husbands first trip together When I booked it was an option about choosing 2 single beds or 1 double bed I chose doublebed of course At the areival in the room it was 2 singlebeds in the room which they had made into a doublebed When we asked about this in the reception they denied to do anything avout it Maybe the reason also was that I had prepaid I slept on this doublebed for 2 days and it was bad and terrible sleeping The staff had this rude and arrogant behaviour about this bed and simply denied to help us at all So dont trust this hotel ,No Positive
313887,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Wished they had some gluten free cakes , Great location friendly staff good breakfast menu the street is not too noisy for such a central location Also suitable for single women traveling alone due to the location in safe surroundings with everything close by shopping restaurants transportation 
313888,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Not the most pleasant and welcoming staff we are uaually used to in similar hotel set ups The lift was not working when we arrived Breakfast was not included but thats fine you could still have break which is a good variety one for the wxtra fee per head except that the quoted charge for breakfast is higher than everywhere else adveerised through out the hotel like the lifts and and hall If they changed their prices recently which I can understand they really ought to get rid of all the old brochures and aigba that suggest a cheaper meal otherwise it would appear dodgy really When I asked the receptionist about a taxi he quite sarcastically pointed me in the direction of the street where there is a taxi station which i didnt know there was and usually i order my taxi from reception in other hotels countries His facial expression and body habitus made me avoid talking to him further I was asking for help i got it but wasn t professional , Great location
313889,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Old style safe that required a key and returnable deposit but the staff did say that they will be upgrading their safes to electronic ones in the near future , The location of the hotel was excellent Very close to the main shopping area and walking distance to Las Rambas and 25 min walk to the Sagrada Familia if you like walking Staff were very friendly and helped with every request Would stay here again 
313890,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, The location is perfect This is my second stay in this hotel in the last 3 5 years coming from Indonesia I recomend this hotel to all my friends and they were happy as well 
313891,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Parking amounts to only a few spaces in a congested basement area and suitable only for VERY small cars and two wheelers Seriously if you drive in DON T park here There are several public garages in the area that will be much better whatever the cost , After a miserable time parking the car I was all set to dislike this hotel but the location couldn t be better in the vibrant L Eixample section of Barcelona the staff is very accommodating and the facility is well worn but functional with a comfortable room 
313892,Eurostars Cristal Palace, I couldn t open my ranchslider door to get onto the patio off my room , Loved the location 7 minutes walking to get to Las Ramblas and so many sightseeing buildings were walking distance too and the breakfast had a good selection of food to choose from 
313893,Eurostars Cristal Palace, It s a little dated decor wise The air conditioning was ancient and didn t work properly The windows could be opened into the street but that s noisy Foyer is old and tired looking , Brilliant location 5 minutes from Place Catalunya where airport bus and tour buses all terminate Between Paseig de Gracia and Ramblas de Catalunya so extensive shopping facilities and eating options on doorstep We had very little interaction with the staff but they seemed pleasant No need to book breakfast as endless caf s around Dining area looked functional and uninspiring anyway 
313894,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The bed was very hard and it would have been nice to have had tea coffee making facilities in the room, The location was excellent very central even though we were right in the center it was quite at night
313895,Eurostars Cristal Palace, We didn t like breakfast but everywhere around have bakeries , The hotel is wonderful not noisy Every day our room was clean and towels were change The location is the best staff is friendly they keep our luggage until we have to fly out 
313896,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Rather modest facilities needed to request an iron 3 times before I could get it after a few hours no ironing board Bathroom door needed maintenance Warm air conditioning only while it was still warm and I had to open the window to get cool air Breakfast is fixed everyday no variety nothing much for vegetarians , Hotel is near a metro station and there is a taxi stand round the corner It is also in the heart of one of the city s shopping areas 
313897,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Clearing up breakfast buffet 30 45 mins prior to end of allocated time , Great city centre location Access to public transport including airport transfer by bus

313901,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The Noise from the street and the hallway carpets are very very OLD and needs change as well as Mattress , The LOCATION AND STAFF are Great and Couldnt be better
313902,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The hotel gives off an overall impersonal bland corporate vibe And the breakfast is completely a waste DON T pay extra for it unless you like bad coffee Go to the cafe at the corner and get really good coffee and a croissant for 1 5 the price , Awesome location close walkable to everything The staff was also fine they tried to be helpful and were friendly It s an easy place to stay in 
313903,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Tiny rooms Noisy venue you can hear other guests pooping upstairs and downstairs having sex or snoring The parking lot is ridiculous For that price it s not worth it , Nothing
313904,Eurostars Cristal Palace, No bar open late evenings for a late night drink and not much interest in the restaurant at all , Location is excellent hotel is clean and rooms are kept in good order by the cleaners Fresh towels every day and plenty of bathroom requisites also 
313905,Eurostars Cristal Palace, Hard bed I m just prefer soft Can t win em all , Location and the breakfast put this already great hotel ahead of alot of others Bed was firm so if you enjoy that then great Really though no complaints 
313906,Eurostars Cristal Palace, in the last day the aircon of our room was cut off making it very warm inside my room particularly difficult for my parents to stay any longer , Laura at the reception was very helpful and took immediate corrective action to our satisfaction She extended our check out time to 2pm as I was traveling with my elderly parents 
313907,Eurostars Cristal Palace, It was really difficult to print boarding passes I sent them to the same address three times before the staff could find and print them , Location comfort and cleanliness of the room
313908,Eurostars Cristal Palace, My Shower tap was broken and they didn t fix it or offered me an alternative room Many of the staff are young and not professional bad english they say they will take care of something and forget about it , The location is perfect Right in the center however the street is quiet relatively The price was attractive 
313909,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The bed we had consisted of two twins pushed together It was not very comfortable for my husband and I The towels were old and worn , Location location location In the middle of everything The staff gave great suggestions for things to do and everything was conveniently located

313912,Eurostars Cristal Palace,No Negative, Great location nice staff The room was clean and fairly equipped The free wifi kept going down perhaps our room didn t get a good reception We didn t take the breakfast so nothing to say about that We would love to go back again sometime 
313913,Eurostars Cristal Palace, The glass on the bath tub is too short It is almost impossible not to get the floor of the bath room wet when taking a shower Another minor thing is that there is basically no blanket when you sleep We did not bother to ask for a full size blanket and sometimes we fell cold in midnight , location location location The service is excellent Everyone I Met is very pleasant and helpful especially one of the receptionist called Laura Aguirrebengoa
