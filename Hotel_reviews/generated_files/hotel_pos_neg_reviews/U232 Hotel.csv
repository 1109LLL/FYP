299996,U232 Hotel, Location a bit far from the centre of town and subway although the walk was interesting , The roof top bar was fantastic Top spot for a beer and watch the skyscape 
299997,U232 Hotel, Only down sides shower can be dufficuky to exit due to shelf And no view from room only brick wall and wi dows nstural light is good or to see the outside world at world more pleasant, Breakfast excellent location is good explore the local area not just main areas Lovely local restaurants cafes supermarket Roof terrace was a bonus a very clean lovely decorated hotel will revist
299998,U232 Hotel, Roads nearby very busy, Breakfast was really good Staff were friendly and helpful Room was clean and adequate bed was very comfortable Roof terrace was nice but it was too hot when we stayed to use The hotel is near a metro stop and getting about is easy but next time I would chose something more central
299999,U232 Hotel, Difficult to adjust hot water in the bathroom also air conditioner in the room cannot be adjusted , All the staffs are very helpful and friendly Nice to have a business centre where you can print out for free especially useful when you purchase museum tickets online to avoid the long queue 
300000,U232 Hotel, The only negative point if I have to mention something is the noisy avenue in front of the hotel I did not mind but somebody might , The staff was extremely polite can t remember the name of the guy and his colleague who received us but I would like to make a point of their politeness and excellent professionalism Their shift was Friday 19th of may 2017 at 17 30 they were at the reception 
300001,U232 Hotel, We could ve used a pair of house slippers a 4 hotel should provide those in my opinion , The hotel is really close to the Hospital Clinic metro station so that helps a lot to get around Breakfast was good with a lot of options As for the room it was the first time I requested a double bed and actually received it not 2 separate beds covered in 1 sheet We really enjoyed the bed pillows those were comfortable All in all everything was nice and clean 
300002,U232 Hotel, nothing , Excellent hotel walking time to Camp Nou about 35 mins Walking time to La Rambla about 30 mins or grab a taxi they drive past the hotel all the time and you won t wait any longer than 2 minutes cost wil be anything from 8 to 12 depending on where in the city you want to go Great breakfast 
300003,U232 Hotel, We had a premium double room with balcony hotel asks if you want a double bed OR two singles but even after selecting there double bed is just two single beds stuck together weren t comfy didn t get good sleep considering the money we paid, Staff were friendly it was clean 
300004,U232 Hotel,No Negative, It is very easy to park safely in the underground parking just under the hotel and there is a discount price for the hotel customers Excellent breakfast buffet Safe a concern in Barcelona 
300005,U232 Hotel, Nothing to dislike a little far from centre but even then it was easy to grab a taxi and affordable, The hotel itself and rooms were great The balconies were an added bonus and the staff were very friendly and helpful
300006,U232 Hotel, The breakfast which cost 14 euros wasn t the great value for money, Very friendly and helpful staff Location was fantastic right near the Metro Station 
300007,U232 Hotel, Balcony rooms do not turn on Air Conditioning in February at least so no matter how hot your room gets can t ventilate it with A C , Metro Proximity Calm neighborhood
300008,U232 Hotel, No restaurant for evening meals But not a game changer as there are loads of restaurants within walking distance, Very clean central for site seeing and staff where very friendly Would recommend this hotel highly
300009,U232 Hotel,No Negative, My husband and I had a great experience at the U232 Staff was courteous helpful and friendly We had a very pleasant 9 day stay The hotel is not close to Las Ramblas and Barcelona downtown We rested well every day Rooms are quiet Strongly recommended

300011,U232 Hotel, The down side of this hotel are 1 There was no window to outside the room was extremely dark and gloomy like a prison I gave 3 stars to this hotel because of this reason I should add it wasn t the best prices and we paid high price for this room 2 One of the blanket was not clean there was dirty spots on it 3 There was no English channel like BBC or CNN on TV , We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights during 2015 x mas holidays We were 3 persons The positive points are 1 The room size was nice for 3 persons 2 The location of hotel was great lots of restaurant and cafes were around close to the metro station we walked from hotel to almost most of places like Avinguda Diagonal Passeig de Gr cia La Rambla and etc 3 The staffs were very helpful and most of them speak English fluently 4 Check in and check out process was so fast and smooth 5 The internet connection was great 6 The room had air conditioner 7 There was free coffee tea services in the room 8 There was mini bar in the room though we didn t use it 9 The room was very quite and we didn t heard any noise from outside 
300012,U232 Hotel,No Negative, The staff of the Hotel was very friendly and provided us with all the necessary information about where to eat and how to move in the town of Barcelona Our room was very comfortable and the hotel facilities quite adequate for our taste We would recommend U232 hotel for anyone who would like to travel to Barcelona 
300013,U232 Hotel, The room had merely windows and it was too hot The air conditioner was not working properly to cool down the room , Location was nice and quite convenient but not as other hotels in the next station Diagonal

300016,U232 Hotel, Beds a little hard Room always seemed dark Self closers on doors made it quite noisy as others allowed their doors to slam , Pretty good location Lots of places to eat If you don t mind walking Its a pleasant walk to tourist spots Otherwise a taxi or train Train station is very close Lovely breakfast Supermarket around the corner 
300017,U232 Hotel, It s not fully sound proof we can hear the movements upstairs The room cleaning is not done till the late afternoon when we came back for a short rest , A bit away from the crowd close to metro and bus Good restaurant nearby 
300018,U232 Hotel, The weather was bad the first two days D Kidding actually the elevators worried us a bit but that s a minor inconvenience The shower heads in the upper floors could have a bit more pressure I am really looking hard for stuff now , The staff is very friendly and helpful and the hotel bar was a delight thanks to Rui The location close to the Hospital Clinic Metro stop is very convenient we were everywhere in the City with 1 change within 15 minutes The breakfast buffet is above average and 7 11 o clock leaver a lot of room for flexible travelling 
300019,U232 Hotel, More vegetables at breakfast Toilet brush would be nice , Great location 2 min walk from Hospital clinic metro 10 minutes walk from Diagonal Wonderful staff especially Luis at the reception Great specious room nice shower Wonderful view from our room at 8 floor 
300020,U232 Hotel, There was one member of staff who was quite unhelpful and came across a little rude however the other members of staff made up for it as they were really helpful and couldn t do enough for us , The hotel was very chic clean and comfortable and the staff were really helpful It was in easy access to the tube station which made it really easy to get around I would certainly stay there again and would highly recommend it to my friends 
300021,U232 Hotel, The balcony looked on to residential apartments not a particularly pleasant view but not a deal breaker , The staff were welcoming good location and well priced
300022,U232 Hotel, There were items of maintenance that needed some attention , Very large comfortable bed About 20 30 minute walk from Las Ramblas and also close to Metro stations The room was a good size 
300023,U232 Hotel, Nothing to complain about sorry , It was convenient for hop on busses and metro line A good selection of bars and restaurants which are frequented by locals so you know that food is good and value for money the hotel was not noisy at night and the beds were very comfortable Staff were very helpful and spoke good English I would stay there again 
300024,U232 Hotel, We left our luggage to the reception staff to be stored until being able to enter the room and our backpack was stolen with all our personal items in it I luckily saved my ID and a credit card but everything else was stolen by another guest at the hotel we assume cause they haven t told us anything else so far First reaction from people at the reception was to tell us that we did not leave the backpack to be stored in the luggage room with them and that we never entered it to the hotel later they checked the camera in the reception and they could confirm that we indeed had the backpack with our other luggage in the reception and that we left it there to be put in the luggage room Even though we were reimbursed the full price of our booking the trouble that we went through and all the things that we lost can t be compensated , The facilitites of the hotel were nice Room was clean the bed comfortable and the furniture nice 
300025,U232 Hotel, Better bed Bathroom faucet and shower controls need work , Location staff all spoke English and were helpful in dealing with a problem English language tv 
300026,U232 Hotel,No Negative, Lovely hotel near the city centre Staff is very friendly The hotel has a great design and bedrooms are very spacious And loved to have my own balcony
300027,U232 Hotel, The lack of natural light in the triple rooms these are interior rooms they have a window but this faces a wall , The staff were extremely friendly and the hotel was well located the city attractions were easily accessible via a short walk to sightseeing bus but we were not in the very middle of the action 
300028,U232 Hotel, Photo on booking com showed the view on the balcony was of the city view We paid extra for this and got a view looking into back of apartments that was very disappointing and not true to the photo , Bed was huge and very comfy Staff were friendly 
300029,U232 Hotel, Wifi signal was very weak much of the time which is often the case when travelling but slightly frustrating in this day and age , Smallish characturful hotel very good location out of the mass tourist areas but close to Metro and restaurants and cafes Room was good size we had a balcony and quiet Rooftop terrace great to come back and relax after a hot day around the city Staff extremely friendly and helpful especially Antonio who made our stay a pleasure 
300030,U232 Hotel,No Negative, The bed was really huge comfy the staff was very friendly and the breakfast was offering something different every day Also the hotel is located by 30 min walking distance of any major objective La Pedrera Casa Batllo Camp nou etc 
300031,U232 Hotel, The bath gel and the shampoo was not really universal rather men s fragrance but beside that everything was perfect , The receptionist at our arrival was so friendly helpful and full of joy we felt very welcome We were satisfied with the room it was clean and spacious the bed was comfortable and quite big The breakfast was also great there was wide selection and the food was delicious the staff was very helpful and nice We very much liked the design and atmosphere of the whole hotel It was especially nice and relaxing to sit in the terrasse in the evening we really appreciated that it is open till 23 00 during summer 
300032,U232 Hotel,No Negative, We had a triple room and there were two bathrooms The beds were extremely comfortable The staff were very helpful and always had a smile The hotel is literally 2 minutes walk from the nearest Metro station 
300033,U232 Hotel,No Negative, The rooms were GIANT We had two bathrooms in our room The rooftop deck was nice and the gym was big enough to workout in The front desk staff were extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations The location is a short walk from the Hospital Clinic metro stop 
300034,U232 Hotel,No Negative, The breakfast was excellent with significant variety and high quality The staff was friendly and very helpful Rooms and amenities were well thought out The design theme was very upscale 
300035,U232 Hotel, It s all good but the price equals to the service not cheap It worth paying though , The staff were professional They were also helpful and friendly when I asked some questions The location and the atmosphere were great too 
300036,U232 Hotel, The bathroom had a little unpleasant smell and the overhead shower wasn t working the handset was ok , Very friendly staff The hotel is nice and is situated really close to the metro station 
300037,U232 Hotel, Nil, Nothing to not like hotel was excellent staff were very polite breakfast was lovely room was spacious Overall a fab City break in a great City 
300038,U232 Hotel, Unfortunately the roof terrace was closed I know it was a weekend with an extremely nasty weather and we had not been able to see the panorama of the city and it has been advertised as one of the main advantages of the hotel , Staff at the reception very polite the location great as right next to the subway 
300039,U232 Hotel,No Negative, Good base to explore the city really close to the metro Rooms were clean bed was massive shower top notch Nice little bar to kick start the evening in and some really nice inexpensive restaurants nearby try Maitea for tapas and Bosque Palermo about a 10 min walk for paella 
300040,U232 Hotel, The location was a bit further out than what I was expecting But once I worked out the trains etc it was fine , The beds were comfortable and the decor of the hotel was very nice The bathroom was nice and spacious 
300041,U232 Hotel, There was no coffee machine and no slippers and no tissues in the room also the mirrors was not enough and the light reflection was bad, The location was perfect and the room was good
300042,U232 Hotel, The sink in the bathroom was blocked the water drained very slowly There was no tea or coffee facilities in the room and as we arrived after 11pm with no room service or open bar we only had the drinks and few snack in the mini bar which were not appropriate adiquate, The rooms was well presented and the beds were comfortable and it was great to have air conditioning too The location was excellent very near the metro and in easy reach of places to visit Staff were very friendly and spoke good english
300043,U232 Hotel, A little noisy facing the street Nice balcony by though , Beautiful Hotel and excellent staff I would definitely stay again Short walk to the Metro The staff helped accommodate our various needs Airport shuttle packed a breakfast since we had to leave early and even accommodated my special diet Great all around 
300044,U232 Hotel, It was a little farther from the main points of interest than we would have liked but we rented some bikes from a nearby bike shop and had an amazing time touring the city that way , Beautiful hotel Very clean and comfortable with very nice staff 
300045,U232 Hotel, Wifi signal was dodgy however that is my only complaint about the hotel , Great central location relatively quiet part of town was able to leave the window open for fresh air at night very nice rooms and lovely hotel 
300046,U232 Hotel, It was very dark inside Not the best view but I suppose to be expected for a city Upon booking I made some requests for some champagne prosecco to be placed in our room as it was a special occasion This was not even acknowledged No swimming pool but I knew this upon booking Small towels Not a great selection of toiletries twin beds pushed together when I had requested a double , The linen was really really lovely The sweets at the reception were super scrumptious Upgraded on arrival as apparently they had given our room away but only to the same kind of room as we had booked but it had a balcony 
300047,U232 Hotel, I like everything , Perfect breakfast very nice interier good loby bar with lot of drinks and very nice and helpful stuff For sure best hotel for this money 
300048,U232 Hotel, Nothing , Breakfast was great start to the day Ideal location only 2 minutes from Metro and 5 minutes from Hop on Hop off bus stops Arranged pick up from to airport excellent value recommend this particularly if arriving late at night as we did Biggest strength the staff who work there So helpful friendly and knowledgeable They were just brilliant 
300049,U232 Hotel,No Negative, The room was fantastic and they even upgraded us to a room with a Balcony for free Great position in the city to get to all sights and the staff are very friendly and are happy to help with any questions Would definitely stay here again 
300050,U232 Hotel, No plug sockets next to the bed, Gorgeous room staff amazing stunning rooftop Fab location right next to a metro station so can easily get to anywhere in the city 
300051,U232 Hotel, 3 person interior room was very dark and stuffy bathroom was too small to navigate with small child, location was great staff was excellent breakfast was great
300052,U232 Hotel, shower not powerful enough If you are using a large rain shower shower head the water flow has to be very high It was inadequate for the shower head This is the only fault but is one of my key criteria for assessing as excellent rather than good , great location comfortable bed freshly squeezed orange juice and good coffee at breakfast helpful friendly staff 
300053,U232 Hotel,No Negative, We were upgraded to a suite on the 9th floor from our original choice of room with a balcony This suite was superb with great views a large terrace and top class facilities At Reception I think his name was Pedro or Pascal but he recommended 3 local restaurants We visited each one during our 3 day stay and they were all excellant 
300054,U232 Hotel, Hotel was bit far from the old quarter You have to use either the Metro or taxis to get around , Staff were very helpful and considerate The room we were given was too hot and we could not adjust the temperate Cyril provided us with another room without question which was much cooler and more comfortable thank you 
300055,U232 Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was stylish and comfortable and the staff were very helpful and friendly There are also some great local restaurants Also with the metro being within 3 minutes walk it was so easy to get around the city 
300056,U232 Hotel, Temperature settings went crazy One night was really cold another really hot etc One sink was blocked bit of bother but it sounded like bad luck Food options were limited to room service other than for breakfast a restaurant or two would have been very helpful , The rooms were nice overall good amount of space and comfort The staff were really friendly and were on hand to give travel advice and tips The location is as described by so many others really really good The metro station is only a minute s walk away and there are some supermarkets and cafes very nearby too 
300057,U232 Hotel, Bed was a bit squeaky and they had no toilet brushes in the rooms and in the bathrooms at the reception which we found weird Beside that we had a great stay , Great location Only 3 minutes walk from one of the main metro lines very clean and good room size
300058,U232 Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and friendly very good selection for breakfast and lovely coffee Handy enough location abt 15mims walk from main shopping area but another El Corte Ingles just a few mins walk from hotel
300059,U232 Hotel, I disliked how some rooms do not have Windows but that s a minor issue, Brilliant stay travelled with a group of friends great value for money and room service was excellent Good location and easy to find from the airport if you just ask at the information desk there
300060,U232 Hotel, Our room has been a bit dark should be specific to that particular room though , Excellent breakfast helpful staff location one could rent a personal hotspot for Internet on the go convenient 
300061,U232 Hotel, We were in a triple room facing the inside of the building with very small windows and almost no sunlight Apparently all the triple rooms are like that Not very nice , Good position easy access to the tube and nice walking distance to many places 
300062,U232 Hotel, Room was comfortable however beds were just okay and the windows looked out into other guests rooms so we could never open shades thus felt boxed in While Manuel was very helpful not all staff were one refused to change a large bill some places in Barcelona will only take small bills , Manuel was particularly friendly and helpful Our college age daughter was with us so the 2 bathrooms were great And the water pressure was excellent 
300063,U232 Hotel, Nothing, The Hotel was well located Metro was just down the road and it was very easy to get around Hotel room was very comfortable and a good size Loved the bathroom We had a balcony overlooking the street Decor was very nice Hotel staff were really friendly and very helpful Breakfast was plentiful with a good selection of hot and cold food Would highly recommend and would stay here again 
300064,U232 Hotel, Should include breakfast in room rate, Room was amazing Staf were so helpful and made sure to make recommendations as to where to eat bus routes metro and arranged our shuttle to airport Location was good
300065,U232 Hotel, We have been given the first night a very small room even without a window The reason given was that the hotel was fully booked As a matter of fact the next day thanks they changed it with a good one , The American Breakfast served by the Hotel was extremely good However they do not serve neither lunch nor dinner In my view this is an important lacuna for an hotel rated as a four stars 
300066,U232 Hotel, Nothing bad at all , The staff were friendly and very helpful The metro was extremely close and made getting around Barcelona very easy Our room was on the 5th floor and had its own patio to sit out on The room was very quiet and had curtains that blocked the light makin sure we got a good night s sleep after all our exploring 
300067,U232 Hotel, There was a hairdryer in the bathroom with a bit missing from the socket and exposed wiring No extractor fan in the bathroom , Just a short walk from the hospital clinic metro station Comfortable king size bed Breakfast was until about 11am great for when you ve had a late night and fancy a lie in 
300068,U232 Hotel,No Negative, We stayed here for 2 nights prior to cruising with RCI for 12 days We loved the location close to many restaurants and to the metro There is a nice little cafe next door that has wonderful muffins and sandwiches that my husband and I enjoyed We found the bed very comfortable and we enjoyed the balcony too The front desk staff were wonderful They were always friendly greeting us when we left and returned to our room and they were more than happy to give directions 
300069,U232 Hotel, Nothing , The best thing about my stay at this hotel is the food very good one of the best breakfasts I ve had in all hotels I ve stayed in Europe The room is of good size big by European standards I think and the bathroom was modern It was too bad I didn t get to check out their rooftop pool area so I can t comment about that The area is safe and just a short 2 blocks walk to the metro There was a also a bus stop nearby which we took to go to Barceloneta All in all I had a good stay 
300070,U232 Hotel, Staff don t like you walking around barefoot which is understandable I guess , Great hotel great staff lovely room Perfect location easy to get anywhere in the city but in a nice and peaceful spot Loads of great caf s around the hotel 
300071,U232 Hotel, Had no issues at all My only suggestions would be possible charge ports for devices on the the terrace and the music to be updated but these are minor inconveniences , Staff were very pleasant from start to finish The hotel was immaculately clean and beds were changed every 2nd day but made everyday Nothing was left to chance very very nice stay 
300072,U232 Hotel, The first room we were put in was out the back of the hotel and the view is probably best described as an all around view of a city block of flats When I asked to be moved they were understanding and moved me and my new wife the next day unfortunately in the new room we moved the chair to go out on the balcony and found a dirty pair of socks behind it Small stuff really but worth mentioning I feel , The staff were brillian nothing seemed to be too much hassle for them Very impressed with the advise and friendliness of all of them
