190367,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, As with all of London the hotel is pricey , I ve stayed at the Millenium a lot It s location is perfect right in the heart of Mayfair The club is very handy and for longer stays becomes a bit of a second home 
190368,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Smoking area outside need to be cover instead of big umbrella if it possible please, Location of the hotel is excellent Reception staff are well traind There was a very helpful staff and I thank her for that

190371,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, 1 I stay in this hotel 3 4 times a year but yet no one recognises me or greet me as a member They said it is because I did my booking through Booking com the system does not recognise my membership 2 Empty bottles from minu bar and used glasses were not taken out for two days When I called housekeeping they said I have to take them outside myself or throw them on the bin as they are not allowe to take anything out from the room 3 When I checked out I told them I was waiting for a delivery and will wait at their bar The staff said I have to tell the concierge myself as they are not taking that kind of message Well the concierge is next to them I guess everybody is just doing their job and not focus on client satisfaction , The location is excellent
190372,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The room furniture except the bed was run down The bathroom was too old and overused with minimum maintenance The carpets were dirty and the wall paper was torn in many places and dirty The staff is very negligent We reported that the water from the bathtub was not draining well and it took them 3 days to respond after 3 consecutive reminders in person I even filled a feedback form and kept it at the reception but no one bothered to check with us or call back This property is simply run down and the money we paid for this stay was too high for what we got , Only the location 
190373,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Unhelpful staff who were rude to us during our stay When we arrived someone was being shown our room after we had booked in We couldn t be sure if they would do that whilst we were out during the stay ,No Positive

190378,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The bathroom hadn t been cleaned properly The air con didn t work so room was hot The room and hotel looked tired The website advertised free wifi but we were told this would be 10 on arrival Breakfast was cold Service at breakfast was not very good with us having to ask for coffee and toast and not offered to us Then they didn t know which table things were for Not worth anywhere near the money we paid to stay ,No Positive
190379,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Could have had more than one tea bag in room on arrival and maybe a bottle of water per guest as in the USA, Fantastic location great for exploring by foot Lovely piano bar in which to wind down in the evening 
190380,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair,No Negative, Attention to detail in the bedrooms e g light switch conveniently placed by the bed comfortable armchair sockets above the dressing table ample room even in a standard room plenty of storage space etc Also very good customer service in all areas and a well prepared and presented breakfast 
190381,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I only stayed one night therefore did not make use of the facilities to give a view we thought though that the bar menu light bites was a bit over priced for example a portion of chips was 6 , I only stayed one night therefore did not make use of all facilities to give a view my room was very comfortable though
190382,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Check in was very slow and people who didn t cue we re served before us staff didn t seem to care I was given someone else s room card by mistake bit worrying , Even the sofa bed was comfy
190383,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Arrived at hotel past 5pm and they were not ready for us unacceptable Housekeeping did a quick job but room was not clean Requested for room to be cleaned but housekeeping didn t come anytime soon and we just told them to forget it and come the next day Booked a club room for three had to request for an additional set of towels for the third guest Hotel only provided one bar soap for all guests and this was not replenished the next day We had to make two requests and then ask the housekeeper directly before we got hold of one bar soap Tea cups were provided for only two guests throughout the stay It is odd that we paid for three yet the hotel was only ready to provide a room for two Room allowed use of the Club Lounge great but also meant that our included breakfast could only be consumed at the Club Lounge We could only eat at the restaurant downstairs at a cost of 5 pounds This was NOT explicitly stated in the booking terms and conditions Needless to say the restaurant on the ground floor has more space and more variety of food provided It made no sense to me that guests who had breakfast included had to pay an additional 5 pounds to enjoy the a slightly better breakfast in a more comfortable area do note that booking fee for the room was also rather steep They should have just allowed guests the choice on where they would prefer to have their breakfast Having patronised this hotel several times before and recommended them to other friends I was left very disappointed with the service this time around A lot can and should be improved for a four star hotel Upon check out I enquired about the booking rates for two weeks later should I wish to return Receptionist explained that it would be better for me to book online on their website as I would be able to make use of a 5 discount voucher She handed me a voucher that expired on 30 June 2017 I checked out on 2 July 2017 Think this pretty much sums up everything , Location location location Can t stress enough how great the hotel s location is for those who enjoy spending time at the Hyde Park Oxford Regent Street areas West End district hotel is perfectly located 
190384,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I asked for my details to updated at the start of the stay as they had the wrong address phone number and loyalty card number At time of checkout they weren t updated so the receptionist said they will do it and email me a confirmation I wrote to them 48 hours after checking out and still no response from them , Great Location Staff breakfast
190385,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The staff were rude and unhelpful We had a lot of rooms booked for our stay and all of us encountered an issue with the staff not being helpful, Location and large rooms

190389,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The hot breakfast could have been warmer, I have stayed at the hotel before so I knew what to expect what I didn t expect was a lovely upgrade to a Club Room as I was there with my husband to celebrate my birthday This was a wonderfully spacious room with a seating area and plenty wardrobe space The bathroom was well stocked with fluffy towels and toiletries The location of the hotel is fabulous and this is one of the reasons we stay there With Regent Oxford Street just on the door step it s wonderful to stroll through the gardens and be at Selfridges Turn right when you go out the front door and this takes you down to regent Street We didn t eat at the hotel but enjoyed a few cocktails there Expensive but it is London The breakfast was plentiful but not warm enough My scrambles eggs were well made but cold so I left them The cold buffet was lovely though with lots of cereal crossiants etc Request toast and it comes freshly made The reception staff were very friendly and efficient and although we arrived before the actual check in time our room was ready I d highly recommend this hotel and already planning another stay

190392,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, we booked a Club room rate INCLUDING breakfast actually for Club rooms the Hotel provides breakfast at the Club small lounge tables and seats etc not comfortable and certainly not healthy with a small buffet If you want to join the big breakfast buffet in the restaurant they try to charge you with additional 5 pp It took us a long and intense discussion at the checkout to not be charged for these extra costs ,No Positive
190393,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The staff were not very friendly or attentive and the breakfast was absolutely stone cold and distasteful after the price of the room and locations of the hotel i think it was VERY poor the price of the breakfast was 40 for two which is extorionate for that level of food , The room was lovely and very comfortable 
190394,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Could have provided sufficient tea coffee sugar in room , Bed was comfortable room was well provided e g iron and board trouser press hairdryer etc 
190395,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The kettle plug lead was about 2 inches long so you had to tilt it to plug it in while it was boiling Slippers would have been nice for hygiene which is complimentary at Holiday Inn especially as it was a carpet and therefore more difficult to clean There was only two lighting options all on or all off Bedside lamps would have given my wife and I more flexibility when one of us wanted to read and the other wanted to sleep , The bed was large and comfortable The location was fantastic and the staff excellent 
190396,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, We contacted reception Sunday 4th June with regard to disruption of travel in and out of London due to the events of the previous evening We spoke to a mature gentleman at the desk who checked trains etc However he did seem very blas about the whole situation We as travellers were most concerned We were spending the day in London but all we wanted to do was get home as soon as possible We all have family back home who were very concerned about our welfare A little bit more understanding really wouldn t have gone a miss , Location was excellent most of the staff were very helpful and pleasant
190397,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I didn t like that I had paid up front through Booking com for a birthday present and when the guest arrived you made her pay the full amount again and said you would refund the original payment back to me What I have not RECEIVED and no communication,No Positive

190400,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, 1 The attitude of the staff except for the concierge sucks major They are all argumentative unhelpful and aggressive in their stance against you I found it a real turn off 2 The air conditioning in the room sucked in spite of having it on Fan Speed 3 and 18C degrees the room was always warm the A C is just old and decrepit It is totally unable to cool down a room 3 Rooms were not ready when promised at all In spite of arriving early and the sour faced russian woman on the front desk pointedly commenting that check in time was 2 pm the rooms were not ready until 2 30 pm 4 One room was supposed to have a double bed they gave us a king They promised to separate the king into two beds never did 5 The second room was supposed to be a King they gave us a queeen promised to find us another room never did 6 The hotel is really far away from the Tube 7 Paid WIFI in this day and era This Millenium is a sad sad hotel Nothing compared to the one in NY which is amazing I am never going to stay in it again Total waste of money , Honestly nothing was that great The hotel is nice inside but I didn t find anything outstanding 
190401,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, You have to present the card which you booked the hotel so if it is paid by someone else you vet there and you cant have the room They should mention this while booking Plus it makes no sense since they have the right to charge thw card used when there is a no show but they cant charge it when you go to check in,No Positive
190402,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Spa facilities would make this so much better, location was amazing staff at reception were very friendly however Oliver and his staff in the Club lounge were fantastic friendly professional and very attentive
190403,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair,No Negative, This was a great hotel for us and we wish we had spent more nights here Across from a park next to the US Embassy Close to Hyde Park and walkable to many locations Hotel was very clean and well maintained Room was a good size for London hotels Bed was very comfortable And room even had an outlet for our American chargers 
190404,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Breakfast is pricey hence we avoid it , Excellent location for shopping and sight seeing Breakfast in Hyde Park is a must on a Sunday morning walk Staff are lovely We were upgraded as we are return customers which was an unexpected bonus It s nice that loyalty does pay 
190405,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Waiting for check in was at 2 PM and I reached the hotel around 8 Came back at 2 but the room was not ready and waited until 3 40 to get into the room, Location is great Everything is a walking distance from the hotel oxford st Hyde park bond street station new bond street etc 
190406,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Instant coffee in room gag Asked for additional towel and it never was delivered On line ad for Millenium Hotel indicated a shuttle to airport We emailed 3 days ahead of arrival and it was confirmed Then upon arrival came to learn the hotel could only order a car which we could have done ourselves at a cost of 60 pounds When we challenged this the desk manager said he didn t have any awareness of there ever being a shuttle aside from car or cab and that the problem was that we made our reservation through Booking com not the hotel He said email assurance must have been from booking com as well and inaccurate Since hotels benefit from bookings from on line resources and should know that their reputations depend on appropriate representation I felt that the hotel could have been more helpful After quite a bit of back and forth they offered a car at a somewhat reduced rate Since we were already there and the room was pre paid we didn t have many options We had taken the tube to the hotel front the airport and found that hauling bags up and down stairs for two senior citizen women was doable but tough on arthritic joints We had chosen the hotel in part because of this service , Beds were comfortable room service coffee came promptly room was comfortable and had lovely view of Grosvenor Square room was quiet 
190407,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, One of the lifts was a bit problematic floor indicator not working Shower was quite fierce and couldn t proved a diffuse spray Some bedroom furniture a little tired , Didn t eat in apart from breakfast which was good Staff all v helpful especially in bar 
190408,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Room located next to the service elevator shaft Disturbing and noisy Hotel pretty worn out and requires immediate investment , Very good and quiet location 
190409,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The hotel is a little tired but great for a 3 star rating Sheets and towels perfect , Great location 5 minutes walk to Oxford Street and Hyde Park and 10 minutes by taxi from most central London tourist spots 
190410,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Got woken up at 7am by drilling coming from the outside of the building and then again in the room next to mine drilling went from 7am through till check out at midday Really ruined the stay and I will be writing a complaint unfortunately Could ve been a really nice stay , Location was good Style of the interior and exterior of the hotel were brilliant Good chilled evening singer in the evening at he bar 
190411,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Nothing to find fault with, Our first visit to the hotel Excellent service received early c heck in and an upgrade requested prior to arrival Service and staff were excellent Good location will certainly visit this hotel again in the near future 
190412,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The room although an upgrade was very dated The bathroom smelt of bad drains I had to ask four times for earl grey tea bags in the room as it did say tea coffee making facilities but I don t drink green tea or English breakfast tea , It was central to where we wanted to go 
190413,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Decor a little tired with an update this could be a great hotel Noisy children in room next door , Fab location large Club room with use of a lounge for complimentary snacks and drinks throughout the day Lovely piano bar Good value 
190414,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The cooked breakfast was actually quite poor Not hot and not good quality So disappointing and I would recommend going elsewhere for breakfast , Rachel on reception was very friendly and helpful and the bed was super comfy 
190415,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I have nothing to say There was nothing to dislike , The staff member at check in was very helpful and enabled my wife to check in prior to published check in time I was running in the London marathon and on check out day I was able to return to the hotel to use bathroom facilities prior to the journey home Staff were all courteous and helpful The hotel was ideal for London marathon runners convenient for the Jubilee Line that provides access to the DLR and Marathon Expo 
190416,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I was pushed back into the lift by another guest I had food delivered and noone would bring it upstairs and a bar tender made me feel like a thief for taking a glass of water to my room even though every other member of staff said it was ok Little bits I would have expected better from anow establishment like that, It is a beautiful hotel and some of the staff are brilliant willing to go above and beyond
190417,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, This hotel is a poor excuse for a 4 star My bed linens were torn and had holes the shower tub had cracks The bathroom floor was frozen cold and there were no slippers in the room nor robes by the way The room in itself was cold I increased the temperature of the heater but it didn t change anything The mattress needed to be refreshed Overall highly disappointed , Location
190418,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, An earlier phone call to reception before arrival to inform them that a parcel was being delivered which we had previously been told was no problem was met with a very terse and unhelpful male receptionist who said it would not be accepted as we were not yet booked in and it was due to their proximity to the US embassy As this was a wedding present for the couple getting married and staying with us in the hotel the suggestion that it could be delivered later was neither helpful or practical We decided to do nothing and were informed a day later by the courier that it had been delivered On check in I asked for it and it was handed over with no problem so what was the point of causing such uncertainty one small but unsettling incident in an otherwise pleasant stay , Staff eager to help and responded quickly to request to have bed reconfigured into single beds Having a club room breakfast in the club lounge rather than the main dining room made for a relaxed atmosphere with pleasant views from the seventh floor 
190419,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Just a very minor point some female staff in the lounge could have shown a more friendly face , The location of the hotel is excellent with just 5 minutes by foot to Oxford street and to Bond street underground station Many tourist attractions are also within a walking distance The hotel still has an old world charm to it added with modern comfort We found the club room with access to the lounge excellent value for money The staff was helpful and friendly All in all a great experience would definitely recommend 
190420,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, CLEANING housekeeping is not doing their job well they keep coming back as requested but still leave the place as it was before , the location of the hotel is tops Lounge access was useful Breakfast was excellent Team was very good concierge as always plus reception We were upgraded to a bigger suite following our complaints about cleanliness and they invited us to complimentary 5 oclock tea for my son s birthday which was very nice 
190421,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Room service dead slow The front desk doesn t respond to your request I complained about my room to the front desk they couldn t slove it and said the duty manger would call me back He never did Very noisy at the back door especially at weekends , Location only
190422,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The noise of the heating in my room was loud and annoying Bathroom was dated could do with an upgrade , Food was fresh staff were attentative to the details 
190423,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The receptionist who booked us in initially said wifi was not free and we would have to pay and offered a package of two breakfast vouchers and wifi for 39 When I said I didn t want wifi and complained it should be free it suddenly was if I added my name to their mailing list watch out for that money making scam We were kept awake from 2 30 am til morning by a couple screaming at each other for hours on end and running numerous baths it was torture and then choosing a hot breKfast at 7 15 am which was stone cold was the last straw after a sleepless night I was glad to leave , It was right next to American embassy for a visa appointment
190424,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Not so easy to get Halal foods Pork was placed in the same place as other foods during breakfast A separate location for it would have been more comfortable for Muslims Nice piano music in the lobby especially in the evening would have been nice , Concierge Omer and the porter were very helpful and cheerful

190438,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Mattress in bed and pillows could have been softer Curtains could be renewed , Staff over the top Breakfast very good paricularly the mediterranean and levantian part Be sure to book breakfast in advance Room old style fashion quiet and comfortable Very good water pressure also at 6th floor Huge bath towels of high quality 
190439,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The room was very small and the shower room was even smaller There was quite a drop when stepping out of the bath shower which would have been very difficult for anyone with even minor mobility issues Also the stairs into the hotel were quite steep We were told we had been upgraded to a superior twin on arrival but this was actually what we booked , The lobby was inviting and the receptionist was lovely It was very easy to check out 
190440,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Breakfast put you up bed tired bath lack of tea coffee loose power socket next to bathroom door heat temperature, Staff were really friendly and helpful
190441,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Was there with a group and everyone complained the rooms were too hot as air conditioning in rooms not working properly I had an engineer up who said it was on heating I asked for the window to be opened and he had to remove 5 screws I think it s a cost saving measure as other guests complained at reception Bathrooms could do with an overhaul , Breakfast room and bar area nice Reception is glitzy and nice

190446,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Somewhere loud music was playing until the early hours, Good selection of breakfast items but the English breakfast wasn t very hot Hotel chosen because of its location to an event we were attending near by 
190447,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Some staff had an attitude and there was no consierge outside the hotel helping you in with your bags He was not obvious in the hotel either, Very convenient location and spacious rooms if you book the one that holds 3ppl
190448,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, A little more selection in the restaurant at affordable prices would be an advantage This would compete with the many restaurants in the area , Location and comfort
190449,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Our first rooms 2 booked were classified as standard and seemed tired and quite dull so we paid for an upgrade and had two adjoining large rooms which were much more to our liking Lighting was poor and there was evidence of a lacking of maintenance WHB could not retain water and bathroom door hook loose and hanging from door Marble flooring stained and gave impression of being dirty Unfair to cleaning staff as marble requires polishing and resealing Main criticism is that one bathroom had no separate shower cabinet and over bath shower potentially dangerous as bath high The outstanding situation of this hotel makes it hugely desirable I also respect and appreciate the logistical challenge of running such a large establishment , Friendly and efficient staff breakfast choice varied and of good quality Croissants excellent light and flaky Club room staff we used both bk fast areas extra friendly and gave service with a smile 
190450,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Paying for WiFi , Everything was as we would have wanted My husband would have preferred free WiFi but no complaints otherwise It was a very pleasant stay despite the wet weather 
190451,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The pillows were hard as bricks Our room was like a sauna the air con didn t work However after calling the duty manager an engineer was sent who quickly fixed it this man was extremely helpful even ringing us back to check if temp had dropped He brought us a portable fan as well as giving us the option to change to a cooler room so we felt he went beyond the call of duty and was very polite , Perfect location service was excellent decor was a bit tired but it was nice clean bed was comfy though pillows hard and wifi in our room was fine it was close to US Embassy where we had business 
190452,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Shower head was too strong and couldnt regulate it Air con controls did notnwork and was too cold , Excellent location for US embassy issues Staff very friendly I loved all the toiltries in the room Very clean comfortable and practical items Walking distance or non expensive taxi fares anywhere I recommend this hotel 
190453,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Staff couldn t understand my accent Neither did they bother trying to listen to me so made my room decisions for me in which I gave up trying to explain myself Some of the staff don t respond well to being greeted with hello especially if you have any tattoos on show , Very good location central to all the places my partner and I wanted to see all weekend The facilities looked very nice The hotel had the look and feel of what a proper London hotel should be written all over it Staff seemed friendly for the most part 
190454,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I did t like being over the top of whatever party was going on below and having the bed and floor shaking from the music and having to be moved in the middle of the night and having two single beds when we asked for a double they weren t even two singles made as a double staff were courteous though and did find us a room away from the rave , He food and staff were incredible in the restaurant magnificent
190455,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, This was a gift for my parents 50th birthday and when they arrived they were told they could not check in as I was not there with the card it was paid on This caused a lot of stress as I was at home and couldn t do anything about it I was spoken to by a rude manager who wasn t very helpful I was upset as it had ruined the start of the weekend for my parents Luckily this was quickly sorted and they got on with the trip and had a wonderful time , Breakfast was very good and rooms clean and comfortable 
190456,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Our bedroom had no heating at all we didn t want to spend any time In the room in the evening or in the morning before checkout We couldn t shower as it was to cold Not what we expected , The staff were friendly
190457,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Our room was very disappointing In the bathroom the sink was cracked tiles around the bath were smashed and the mirror was dusty Lacked the wow factor that you would expect from a 5 hotel in Mayfair , Hotel bar was lovely especially in the evening with the man playing the piano Staff were very friendly and helpful

190711,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The shower was very poor with no direction just horrible Also the dark skinned oriental lady in the club lounge did not impress us we arrived at 10 15am breakfast served 7 00 10 30 and as we went to choose our breakfast she pointedly looked at the clock as if to say we were late , Having access to the club lounge gave excellent value for money to the trip Free canapes and drinks in the evening and a free breakfast in the morning which we expected to be cold continental breakfast but turned out to be a hot full English Excellent 
190712,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The staff from the moment we walked in put out negative energy and were simply rude This remained consistent our entire visit We were though sure to tell all who we met with while in London what a terrible experience we had, Location

190722,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Breakfast staff were not organised our room was noisy due to the heating system though we were moved to a better room during the night , Hotel staff were great the hotel decor is excellent
190723,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The stay was unfortunately spoilt for us due to issues both nights that we stayed here The hotel room was very cold from arrival and although the hotel sent a portable heater to try to combat this it did make the room quite uncomfortable It s expected that everyone enjoys different temperatures in their room however usually you can control this yourself and aren t left frozen from bed to bathroom As we stayed for a few nights we requested to move rooms and the hotel staff were very helpful However our stay in the new room was unfortunately again spoilt by the first floor corridors and room itself smelling particularly unpleasant Although again the manager was very helpful after we requested to speak with her regarding this it isn t what was expected of a 4 star hotel and I wouldn t recommend to a friend , The location is great the hotel is in Grosvenor square in easy walking distance of Marble Arch or Oxford Street The staff were really nice and helpful however they were unfortunately let down by the facilities and hotel itself 
190724,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Had to park and collect car myself Paid extra for parking when I thought it was part of the package Breakfast poor Had to wait a time for fried eggs to be cooked coffee very weak so ordered double espresso coffee twice before it arrived No offer on toast , Bedroom fine Shower excellent

190729,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, My only gripe and it is the same for all 4 5 star hotels is the exorbitant price charged for soft drinks Over 3 for 200 ml of coke is ridiculous and out of order A thousand percent mark up or more for soft drinks is outrageous and hotels should think again this is no encouragement to use the bar especially if you do not drink alcohol , Wonderful location quiet but central Received an upgrade which was very nice Large room great bed good bathroom Only there for one night so did not use the restaurant but will definitely stay there again when we have a weekend in London 
190730,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Found a dirty pillow case and then after house keeping cleaned the room it was still there My shower was also broken and when I told them nothing happened The food was ok at best depending on what you order I had a pizza and it was ok but the penne with tomato sauce wasn t good at all It s also too expensive for what you get, The view and the location
190731,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Room was dark and gloomy Only 3 milk pods no biscuits and no water on bedside Breakfast mediocre cold scrambled eggs , Location and parking facility Excellent concierge who told us how to get discounted parking fee Wouldn t have known otherwise

190734,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Our room had secondary glazing broken missing so very noisy and cold when we arrived back after evening out and early morning The bathroom hinge was virtually hanging off so you couldn t shut door let alone lock it We defo would have complained if it hadn t been so late arriving back and didn t fancy changing rooms at 1 am We did tell concierge when checking out and said they d address the problems however that doesn t help our stay and upon arriving home you can see these issues have been brought up before and obviously done nothing about them Apart from these two things it was great but these are terrible things to overlook Easy to say we will look at it how about a gesture of good will a partial refund or offer rather than a promise it will get fixed Which you are obviously not doing as the problems are still there , Easy access to tube and therefore everywhere else in centre but so are most other hotels in the centre Breakfast was great concierge was excellent rapid and very helpful

190738,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Couple of things in the room the light dial was broke and the few loose tiles in bathroom , The location was brilliant every where we wanted to go was walking distance and if we did want to travel further Bond Street station was very close
190739,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The breakfast needs to have more variety Other wise the atmosphere is nice and the resturant staff are welcoming and cooperative , excellent location excellent house keeping and room service Very cooperative staff 
190740,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Well the first thing I didn t like was the fact that you pay a lot of money for the pleasure of the room but when you come to check in the reception staff wanted more money from you for deposit this wasn t stated at time of booking Another one of my bad experiences with this hotel was I originally booked the hotel on New Years ever 2014 for new year 2015 to my horror on the 30th December 2015 I was advised that the hotel had canceld my reservation for the 31st December via email When phoning the hotel the man I spoke with was unhelpful and advised me their was nothing he could do and to contact booking com for them to deal with the issue In total trying to get the room rebooked took me 3 hours as I was getting passed from pillar to post but I eventually got the issue resolved Me and my partner made the 3hr drive down to London we had a brilliant time bringing the new year in where now home and still waiting for the deposit to be refunded to my bank account , The facilities where good restaurant was nice for breakfast always plenty of choice to chose from The comfort of the hotel room was good the bed was nice and big bathroom was a little compact when the door was opened Location was brilliant 10min walk to Bond Street underground 
190741,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Had to wait until 4 30pm to be able to check in to our room despite the check in time stated as 2 00pm Disappointing We also had a club room booked with access to the club lounge but the male receptionist did not think to tell us we could wait in the club lounge until the room was ready Instead we had to wait around until We finally though to ask if we could wait in the club lounge and he female receptionist said of course , Really beautiful location infront of Grosvenor Park Much more attractive entrance at the front rather than the rear In particular the man who was looking after guests in the Club Lounge is excellent He really changed our impression of the hotel after having to wait for our room to be prepared He is a massive asset to the hotel and made our experience all the better Thanks to this excellent member of staff 
190742,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I don t usually fill in these surveys but since you ask here it is We had a problem with our first room key not unlocking the room After 4 key changes a visit from a maintenance man and us having to vacate the room whilst he took the lock off it still wasn t working on our return we contacted reception and with just over an hour to go before we were due to go out requested a new room new room tired d cor curtain hanging off stained carpet Definitely not an upgrade On check out we were going to be charged our bar bill incurred whilst we vacated the room had to point out the inconvenience caused to us and so it was waived My husband and I are not usually ones to complain but we were disappointed , Location
190743,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair,No Negative, Perfect location 5 min walk to Bond street and 10 mins to Oxford street and Regent Street Reception and concierge staff polite and helpful Would definitely stay here again 
190744,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The room we received room 168 which looked like a set of old furniture with an old carpet We had to pay extra 50 pounds per day on top of booking com fee to get a proper room Also wifi worked only 20 of the time and hotel personnel didn t solve the problem, The location
190745,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Freezing cold in the room they gave us a small heater No TV signal mantenience came and could NOT get a great signal Asking for a TIP whilst paying on check in by card , Location

190747,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I ate with my son in the Italian restaurant in the hotel The meal was OK but no more My spaghetti was slightly undercooked His fillet steak was said to be 24 days aged but it was way too tough for a 24 day aged steak , Good location for my purposes It has an underground car park on site which I need as opposed to one a few blocks away Comfortable room albeit a little dated but for the price more than acceptable 
190748,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Not a bad experience as such hotel just seems to have no customer history database or recognition and I have to fill out full details each time I stay there Millennium loyalty card details not requested and I m not sure what the value of this is , Very handy base for Central London where I have stayed many times over the past 10 years usually on business Have also stayed many times in sister hotel in Knightsbridge 
190749,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I think it s stingy to charge for wifi in other comparable hotels in London it is complimentary , We asked for a quiet room and so were pleased to be overlooking the back 
190750,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Bath could have been cleaner Loose boiler room door in room was shabby 260 , Fluffy towels and sumptuous sheets Room had view of mews which was very quiet

190752,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, We had a meal in hotel thought it was a bit pricey for what we had but being London I was ok with that but did not like the fact the tip was included in the bill I always tip but would of liked to of Done that myself, Hotel was lovely staff friendly
190753,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, It was all terrible from the delay in checking in to changing the beds into two singles which I had requested the room was smaller than what was stated on the website the bed was uncomfortable and hard the plug in sockets were scattered unevenly around the room which was irritating when trying to plug somthing in The bathroom was vile the size was absolutely tiny and the bathtub was dirty and slightly grimy Later during my stay I was watching television and I get a knock on the door from security saying there s too much noise in the room the television was not even loud the cheek and basic disrespect from staff was terrible disturbing , I didn t like like anything 
190754,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, The walls were paper thin The people in the room next door were a bit loud but not that bad but we could hear every word of their conversation Bathroom was tiny and not particularly clean , Good location
190755,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Arrived an hour before check in and was informed that my room was ready but I d have to pay an extra 50 for an early check in Other London hotels that I have stayed in do not do this if the room is ready And they have my repeat custom The bedroom and bathroom were basic and not worth the high Mayfair price , Good location and bar lounge area downstairs 
190756,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Query with bill was not handled well Also booking in took ages even though I had booked on line and pre paid The fact that I had booked all 3 rooms seemed to confuse them Service charges in bar outrageous, Location Room 
190757,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Wifi is not available unless paid when paid it was very weak and disconnected most of the time Fire alarm was tested without any notice that there will be a test, Location
190758,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Rudeness of staff member who checked me in Talked to another member of staff about me like I wasn t there Room slightly dated, Room service pizza was good New referbished bathroom location 
190759,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Frosty staff compared to other London hotels Had to remind staff after an hour to sort something out and there wasn t a warm or helpful reception on arrival The staff would benefit from going to hotels like the Montcalm to learn from their staff Disappointing for the price unfortunately , Clean room and bedding although boiling hot despite it being winter and the aircon being on which clearly didn t work 
190760,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair,No Negative, The location was perfect for us Comfy room We didn t eat in the hotel so can t make any comment about the food but the reception and concierge staff were very polite and helpful 
190761,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, Very cold in the room no bath robe slipers paper tissues in minibar just sparkling water very cold and just in the first day the heating system very noisy , The location position

190816,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, There was a confusion at the breakfast because apparently the breakfast vouchers do not entitle you to choose from the menu however nobody has explained it to us before buying the vouchers It happens that we wanted to order from the menu and then had to have 3 or 4 conversations about it with the staff It looked like some training around the voucher concept would have been appropriate to both reception and f b staff together with customer focus To their point we ended up not having to pay any extra but felt like having been done a favour and the situation was unpleasant and ruined our breakfast experience The eggs benedict were wonderful though ,No Positive
190817,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, We arrived at 3pm i e one whole hour after the recommended time We were informed that our room was not ready and that if we wanted to be allocated a room we would have to pay for an upgrade Eventually the receptionist allocated a upgraded room at no extra cost When we entered the room it was clear that maintenance had failed to replace the shower door and that the shower had not been secured to the wall ,No Positive

190824,Millennium Hotel London Mayfair, I had requested for a room overlooking the front rather than the back of the property and was told that a room with a view would cost extra Again I informed them of an early check in as my flight schedule dictated but the room they claimed was booked for me was not ready even with the payment of early check in fee I did not like the room allocated but agreed to wait till 3pm for the originally scheduled room The room was never ready The front office staff did try their best to help but the duty manager did not find a need to speak with me despite my protestations at the room I was given If she was the one I spoke with on the phone then she is very rude and not an asset to the hotel 2 The house keeping was very very poorly done They failed to clean or take away cups and cutlery that had been used The waste basket was not emptied I observed clothing from a previous occupant under the sofa and this remained there for the three nights I stayed despite the room being cleaned everyday , Location was close to shopping and yet had privacy 5 minutes walk to Oxford Street
