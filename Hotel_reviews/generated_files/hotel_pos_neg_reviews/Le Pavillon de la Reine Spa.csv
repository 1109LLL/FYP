129961,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Breakfast at 35 is rather pricey Room was not the largest but this is normal for Paris Who likes a shower curtain that sticks to you whilst in the shower A bit cheap and nasty for this standard of hotel , Staff very nice and helpful Lovely setting on the Place de Vosges spoilt at times by sightseers having a look it was Louis XIII mum s house after all An honesty bar can be dangerous thing Never up in time for breakfast so cannot comment Lots of cafes in the neighbourhood so not a problem 
129962,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, The Place des Voges is beautiful and historic it isn t centrally located or a quick walk to most museums but a restful start or end to the day The hotel s morning breakfast is marvelous outdoor space is comfortable Many family groups were staying there
129963,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Rooms were a bit noisy thanks to noisy guests above Not a problem on all days Not much to complain about , Beautiful building great service welcoming staff friendly to English speakers terrific location and fantastic air conditioning Concierge was very helpful 
129964,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, It s a beautiful hotel in a beautiful area on a historic site The staff is courteous and professional The courtyard is a real gift and it s a pleasure to sit there in the afternoon or evening with a coffee or drink and pass the time 
129965,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Tiny elevator but that s Paris , Super attentive service from the whole team Concierge did a great job to get us the last minute restaurant booking we hoped for Loved the courtyard and honesty bar 
129966,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Difficult to find faults with this lovely hotel Maybe it is a bit expensive given that the rooms are not on the big side but I understand there is a price for beauty and perfection , I liked the beauty of the hotel the little court garden the breakfast rooms the perfect location providing both quiet and access to a lively neighborhood le marais And above all the extreme helpfulness of the staff and their readiness to go the extra mile to make you comfortable and to quickly make up for any inconvenience 
129967,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, We arrived early in the morning after a night flight the staff made the room available almost straight away The quality of the breakfast was exceptional from the ham to the bread croissant choices of jam fresh fruits The staff is very helpful and friendly The location is excellent and even though it is in a center of Paris it is very quiet and peaceful Will definitely come back 
129968,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Bed and pillows were firm Ok for some but not my preference , Lovely grounds impecable rooms outstanding staff always willing to assist in any way 
129969,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Breakfast way too expensive No fire escape staircases were available in an emergency due to refurbishment works not that safe , Hotel lobby and bedroom
129970,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Breakfast is delicious but quite expensive as is the cost if you order a coffee while sitting in the lobby I wish they hadn t taken quite such advantage of the convenience for guests of eating in It s beautiful comfortable and food is very good but overpriced Nicer to recognize guest loyalty by charging a more fair rate , The hotel is gorgeous Service was extraordinary helpful and polite One of the women who was working at reception kindly gave me her own safety pin when I had an emergency need for a rip in a dress On Christmas Eve we discovered a gift on our pillow handmade chocolate in the shape of a musical score of Silent Night with hand painted notes 
129971,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Nothing to complain about, All the staff were very helpful The room was delightful The location was superb whilst the courtyard garden was as pretty as a picture 5 min walk to Opera Bastille not far from Notre Dame de Paris and other tourist attractions very good selection of restaurants and cafes around Definitely recommend the hotel to those looking for a quiet place in the centre of Paris for luxury holidays
129972,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, There isn t anything , Everything about this hotel was perfection and quisentially Parisian The location in the Marais is directly across the street from one of the most famous and beautiful parks and is right on the Plaza des Viosges the exact square where Victor Hugo also lived You walk out of this gorgeous hotel and are surrounded by beauty amazing and totally unique shops and cafes and nothing is far away As for the hotel itself it is as classy as can be The doorman was always there to greet us smiling upon our return and the lobby has two absolutely beautifully designed sitting rooms where delicious food and drinks are available throughout the day and evening There is also 24 7 room service and the food was wonderful esp the Thai curry with prawns The staff was exceptional very warm inviting and always helpful You can get tickets to some of the museums right there at the front desk and avoid long lines We were happily surprised to learn this about Musee D Orsay The housecleaning staff was wonderful too and our room was exactly what we d hoped modem bathroom wood beamed ceilings CNN for when we wanted to catch up on a little news It s a simply beautiful hotel and though we didn t use the spa ourselves we visited the floor and it too looked extremely inviting and exceptional 
129973,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Nothing this is a charming small hotel , the bed was the most comfortable we have ever had in an hotel truly dreamy Very helpful and friendly staff perfect location Great restaurant recommendation
129974,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, Situated at the Place des Vosges you find the amazing hotel Pavilion de La Reine It is absolutly outstanding charming fine with an exceptionally service The rooms are magnificant and the breakfast is very exclusive Thanks a lot for this pleasent stay la prochaine 
129975,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, I think the value of the room compared to the rate we paid was not worth Very expensive superior room that is too small no place to move Dose nt worth the very expensive rate of payment , the hotel is beautiful the surounding the staff the breakfast
129976,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Rooms decor rather dull needs to be freshen up very old fashion compared to the reception area, Found the rooms good size beautiful garden to sit in and loved the free bikes A slice of paradise in the middle of paris
129977,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, Loved the location And the staff was so helpful Forgot my phone in a rent a car and the staff called the company and got it shipped to the hotel than shipped it to my house in Canada When we go back will definitely stay there again 
129978,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, None , The hotel was beautiful with friendly Professional and helpful staff Check in and check out was easy Good location clean and beautiful room Very comfortable bed sheets and quiet which are what we needed Loved it Will come back again
129979,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, The Staff we excellent very helpful very attentive The hotel is fabulous we had a stunning room and very comfortable bed giving an amazing nights sleep 
129980,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Awkward room layout toilet ina closet downstairs sink for washing hands upstairs nonworking hairdryer unregulatable shower either scalding hot or ice cold half the outlets didn t work , Fabulous location 
129981,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Rooms could have been a tad bigger , The quiet surroundings and the garden Hotel facade is really lovely The lobby is very stylish and cozy Also liked their gym spa at the basement 
129982,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Not comfortable with tourists rubber necking INSIDE the hotel Where has my photo been posted Perhaps I did not want to be recorded as being there , No pressure from any of the staff Only help when needed 
129983,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, The staff was our favorite part of the experience This was our first trip to Paris and they were incredibly accommodating and kind We loved the breakfast in the front study It was pricey but we got our monies worth The bellmen and front desk were amazing Perfect location for a short or long stay We loved Paris more than we expected for our 1st time and this was the perfect spot to get that feeling I think many look for when coming to Paris Thank you all 
129984,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Stairs to the loft bedroom were unexpected The price of breakfast was high but the quality was excellent, Very attentive staff at front desk and in lounge breakfast area Good advice re local family restaurants Excellent position in the Marais
129985,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, The breakfast which was very expensive could have been a little bit more elaborate and not just standard continental with eggs to order , The location was fantastic I also like the fact it was central but very quiet 
129986,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, The mattress was too hard I prefer large square pillows Everything else pleased me , All the staff were very helpful The room was delightful The location was superb whilst the courtyard garden was as pretty as a picture 
129987,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Since the rooms were small and close to each other there was too much noise transpassing , Excellent location very friendly and cooperative staff cosy luxurous hotel loved the Honesty Bar
129988,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, The rooms weren t nice on the 4th top floor with tiny window that look out into other people s windows and attic like rooms that cut the area space because of the attic like diagonal walls The rooms with an upstairs and downstairs separate couch area were particularly horrific The toilet is downstairs and the sink and shower is upstairs where your bed is They were also dark and not updated I think the lower level floors might be much nicer with big open windows Make sure to ask for a room on one level facing the main courtyard and you will probably be ok Do not book on 4th floor Breakfast is expensive and better elsewhere , The location was great and the staff and concierge were very helpful 
129989,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Nothing to complain about, Fantastic friendly and helpful staff Room was very clean and nice The inner garden was so peaceful and I like the bar set up 
129990,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Nothing, I loved everything about the hotel starting from the welcoming greetings at arrival Cozy property located in a cozy place quiet and friendly good spa and fitness facilities very friendly and helpful staff 5 min walk to Opera Bastille not far from Notre Dame de Paris and other tourist attractions very good selection of restaurants and cafes around Definately recommend the hotel to those looking for a quiet place in the centre of Paris for luxury holidays 
129991,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, The rooms are in need of refurbishment Although the bed is very comfortable the overall decor is tired dark and a little unwelcoming We were paying over 400 euros for one night and this seemed really excessive for the quality of accommodation The breakfast in the morning was 35 euros EACH and was an unedifying buffet of cold croissant cheese and fruit salad I felt really disappointed with the experience as a whole as I felt slightly ripped off , This traditional hotel is based just off the Place de Voges in the Marais district a great location and behind gated walls which keeps it quiet The staff are friendly and we were upgraded to a Superior Room which was a surprise The room service menu was excellent 
129992,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, I stayed here as a solo traveller visiting family nearby It s a lovely hotel in a great location but the mark up for the romantic address meant it was not the most economical choice for what I needed, Great location Friendly and helpful staff 
129993,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, This hotel is quiet private and chic If you like the feeling of privacy in a beautiful place and a cool neighborhood this is the hotel for you This is not one of those grand hotels and so the hallways are a bit too narrow and some of the rooms are not as great as others I think this all adds to the charm of the place and the sense of history The staff was friendly and helpful Even the ladies who cleaned the rooms were sweet Don t miss out on having breakfast in the 2 beautiful rooms downstairs Really a treat This was our 2nd time there and we were upgraded to a family suite which was a wonderful surprise We were 3 and had 2 bedrooms a living room and 2 bathrooms It was for us a very memorable stay 
129994,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, Beautiful location in centre of Marais district with the stunning Place des Vosges on the doorstep Room we as small but very comfortable and the service was friendly and attentive without being fussy We had the delicious hotel breakfast one morning and investigated the local caf s on other mornings
129995,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Room a bit small but you can t have it all , Nice cosy boutique hotel with a courtyard around close to a trendy area with small streets terraces boutiques and good restaurants either cheap or very expensive And last but not least the hotel has a very romantic bar library self service 
129996,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, Breakfast OK but not worth 35 Room on the top floor a little dark Ask for room on lower floors as they seemed to havet larger windows , The beds the staff the ambience the location 
129997,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, The wonderful location the splendid reception with the honesty bar the very good breakfast We had one or two problems which the staff remedied immediately with charm and grace 
129998,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, Le Pavillon de la Reine was an amazing boutique hotel The surroundings are so elegant and charming The room was large beds were very comfortable everything was extremely clean and well appointed The concierge and front desk staff were incredibly kind and helpful Whatever it is you need they helped Anything from booking walking tours day trips restaurant suggestions directions they even were kind enough to help me find my mobile phone which I had left in a tourbus They had a driver retrieve it for me If you want to treat yourself to a lovely elegant and charming boutique hotel stay here I enjoyed every moment 
129999,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, the air conditioning didn t work on one night and the noise from it woke us up in the middle of the night some other facilities also seemed worn out, Quiet ambience beautiful courtyard and building
130000,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, A fire alarm went off due to a technical error while we were relaxing in our room With our small children we rushed down several flights of stairs to the entrance A complimentary aperitif or even a simple apology for the inconvenience would have been appreciated for the gesture , Charming hotel in tranquil location in Place des Vosges Courteous staff The hotel has its own parking facility which is very convenient and complimentary for guests

130003,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, We didn t get a chance to eat here however the coffee and service we received was excellent I can only imagine what we missed out on The steam room was beautiful and serene however it got too hot maybe this can adjusted I m not sure , What didn t we like This is one of the best hotels we stayed at stunning property excellent location amazing staff luxurious rooms and more The staff was super helpful and gave us excellent recommendations for restaurants and other interests They were extremely attentive to all our needs and requests It was so easy to get around as the location was central to us We highly recommend this hotel 
130004,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa, It was expensive and the room is slightly smaller than my expectation but by the end I didn t want to leave, The staff were very accomodating and friendly The property feels like a small chateau in the centre of Paris The key is the staff and the 24 7 room service Really excellent 
130005,Le Pavillon de la Reine Spa,No Negative, Perfect location in Paris and a great atmosphere both in the hotel and the Places des Vosges just outside Very helpful staff too highly recommended
