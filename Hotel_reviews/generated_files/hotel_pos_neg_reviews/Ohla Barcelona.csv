479380,Ohla Barcelona, Probably gave us the worst room in the house 103 which was facing the street Not sure if it was because we were only staying for one night Loud traffic could be heard from the room which resulted in general annoyance and a lack of sleep Room also didn t have great hallway sound proofing and given this is near the gym facilities you can hear people talking and walking in and out Room layout also wasn t great the shower is a glass box facing the bed While this might seem perfect from a voyeur perspective this isn t practical if one person is trying to sleep and the other has lights on in the bathroom Not sure if all the rooms are like this Highly suggest if you get room 103 to change Very impersonal staff compared to other hotels we stayed at on our trip we stayed at many ranging from boutique to 4 5 star , Really central location close to all the major shopping and sightseeing Good breakfast selection Concierge gave us a nice recommendation for place to eat although it wasn t really authentic tapas food suggested which we had wanted and a more modern version Great views from the rooftop and nice pool 
479381,Ohla Barcelona, Shower was cold on one of the days and wouldn t heat up It would have been nice to be able to get tea coffee and cake on the roof terrace Asked for poached egg for breakfast and a cappuccino Poached egg came practically raw and cold and never did get the cappuccino , We were celebrating our anniversary and were given a lovely letter chocolates and a bottle of Cava with the compliments of the management this was a very kind gesture and much appreciated The hotel was situated in a very good area close to restaurants theatre bars shops and close to public transport which was very convenient and easy to use The concierge was very helpful on our first day booking tours with very little notice Hotel was very clean Check out was very quick and easy 
479382,Ohla Barcelona, Marketing photo s of roof top bar appeared to imply pool area significantly bigger than encountered albeit we accept this was a stunning facility and also a city centre hotel however limited sun bed opportunities and had been the deciding factor in choosing the hotel Bar staff at Roof Top bar were quite pushy and over confident but maybe were just being British , Cleanliness comfort of rooms and quality of food at breakfast Personal touch and welcome greeting on behalf of our Anniversary break 
479383,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Loved the roof top bar Sadly we didn t get to use the pool because we only stayed one night and it was closed by the time we arrived The bed was super comfy and the buffet breakfast was delicious A fabulous stay 
479384,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Our two favorite things about the hotel were the location and the rooftop pool lounge We were in Barcelona for 3 days and only had to take a taxi twice Park Guell and the W for a drink For most tourist attractions we were able to walk I would definitely stay in this location again However the best part of the hotel is the rooftop pool It has amazing views great drinks and is very relaxing The perfect way to spend a couple of hours in between tourist activities and a night out on the town We would absolutely stay at Ohla Barcelona again 
479385,Ohla Barcelona, The lift operation was confusing , We liked the decoration dark theme with a mix of shiny matt materials and art Room was comfortable loved the dimmable hanging egg lights Bathroom was clean and stylish with a concealed toilet door very neat Staff was great also The rooftop bar was windy and refreshing after sweating the whole day in the city good cocktails served And the tapas restaurant really worth a visit 
479386,Ohla Barcelona, The pool area went once and was told that the area we were sitting in es reserved plenty of empty spots but couldn t sit anywhere Never went again in the six days , The room was fab and very spacious Always lovely towels and housekeeping were great 
479387,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, The hotel is stunning and in the perfect location for exploring Barcelona The highlight is the wonderful roof terrace with pool The staff on reception went over and above to help us On arrival the lady who looked after us had already noted we were both vegetarian she took the time and effort to point out on a map approx 4 Vegetarian and vegan restaurants she could recommend We were also thrilled to find a bottle of bubbly on Ice in our room one day as they had also noted we were on honeymoon These little touchs make all the difference Room and bathroom very spacious Would definitely recommend 
479388,Ohla Barcelona, We were a little disappointed that they did not inform us at check in that they would be pre authorising the entire stay We were paying for our friends room as well as a gift and as they did not release the pre auth amount until a week later we were 5000 Australian out of pocket for a week Tip would be to pre pay when you arrive to avoid this, The room was amazing Very comfy bed and very spacious The rooftop bar and pool area is a great escape from the city 
479389,Ohla Barcelona, Some more hands on tips from the concierge in terms of restos and bars in the vicinity , Great location up to date fittings friendly staff throughout and
479390,Ohla Barcelona, The only suggestion would be to include some breakfast cereal that was less sweet such as rolled oats or plain muesli Everything else was perfect , Ohla Barcelona was one of the the best hotels we have stayed We had the junior suite which was beautiful looking out to the city The staff were so friendly and helpful we loved that they turned down our room each night and re stocked the water and left a different treat The hotel was in such a great location in east walking distance to all the main attractions The rooftop pool was excellent for relaxing in the afternoon however there is limited space for seats We would definitely stay at Ohla Barcelona again 
479391,Ohla Barcelona, Hard beds shower bathroom configuration for companion travellers not suitable and the coffee is awful and is such an easy thing to get right , The concierge were great 
479392,Ohla Barcelona, The service wasn t the best The whole experience felt very impersonal we stayed for a week and even by the end felt like we were faceless in a crowd We had various mix ups initially given the wrong room failed wake up call wrong drink orders etc Also wasn t a fan of the bathroom layout which doesn t allow for any privacy particularly difficult if you are traveling with a friend rather than partner , Convenient location and lovely building 
479393,Ohla Barcelona, Liked everything , Excellent hotel Beautiful rooms and public areas Two restaurants wine bar and rooftop bar with pool and excellent cocktails Very good location close to La Rambla Gothic centre and beach is a few minutes away by car The staff and service was great very polite and helpful 
479394,Ohla Barcelona, The only drawback is having to wait for the lift for quite a while especially to go up to the roof terrace as only one of the two lifts goes there and they re both quite slow Really minor thing but as everything else was amazing I have to nitpick , Fabulous hotel The location couldn t be better Has everything you need The staff went out of their way to ensure we re comfortable 
479395,Ohla Barcelona, The roof top and pool pictures were so misrepresenting the real and actual view The pool was so so so small And since it s in the Gothic area it was quite noisy at night Some young people were drinking on the street almost every night and making quite a lot of noise The window was not double glassed therefore we were being woken up a few times at night The breakfast was not worth the money poor quality food and not many choices Only 1 2 staff working in the morning and have affected the service quality also Don t blame them as they have good attitude but just too much work and not enough staff , Good location in Gothic area 
479396,Ohla Barcelona, The location of the hotel was perfect for exploring the Gothic quarter however the bin men came at about 3 4am every night and woke us Also the close proximity to other businesses every morning was an early start as the deliveries and hustle and bustle of street life and traffic was very apparent They need to sound proof the front and side of the building, Warm welcome from the staff who were extremely attentive and knowledgeable about the city sights and attractions The concierge team were 1st class and spoke fluent English In my opinion nothing was too much trouble and they provided us with all the information we wanted and also their recommendations 
479397,Ohla Barcelona, I would have liked a breakfast menu for hot food i e eggs benedict etc, The rooftop area is excellent and the view from the roof is fabulous The staff were extremely helpful and the concierge was very knowledgeable 
479398,Ohla Barcelona, Room stated soundproof on booking com but our room wasn t Hotel didn t appear to stop people reserving seating on roof top pool which meant no seats available over weekend but no persons on them Lifts incredibly slow stairs badly lit , Hotel perfect location staff 100 helpful roof top pool fabulous room well stocked and clean 
479399,Ohla Barcelona, Lack of attendants in the front considering a 4 stars property but the concierges Albert Pablo were very helpful , Great location short walk to La Rambla Gothic Quarter Pleasant staff but seems understaff with the amount of guests especially slow response from housekeeping bell The mezzanine check in is a bit off when you travel from far have to take luggages upstairs The breakfast offerings are great so is the beautiful rooftop 
479400,Ohla Barcelona, Service levels are a bit mixed excellent check in but hit miss in bars breakfast, What s not to like Great location Superb rooms Excellent pool deck
479401,Ohla Barcelona, It was our anniversary celebrations would have appreciated some gestures from the hotel , Great location amazing terrace pool Amazing staff concierge was very helpful Terrace bar staff were great and Gabriela makes amazing cocktails at Vistro 49
479402,Ohla Barcelona, The bed was 2 singles pushed together A 5 hotel should have a proper king sized bed Hotel likes posting letters under the door of your room to let you know about things like your bill etc the 1st couple are a cool touch but it gets a little annoying after a while to be honest when you ve got 4 5 after a 3 night stay We had a suite with a big balcony but it wasn t accessible It would be nice if they could modify the room balcony so that they are accessible , Breakfast amazing room nice and rooftop terrace amazing In my opinion a close 2nd best to Hotel1898 but still v nice 
479403,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, The service and the all round assistance from everyone at the hotel was superb The complementary bottle of Cava for a birthday was brilliant A fantastic touch And the icing on top of what was a magnificent cake Will definitely want to return Best hotel we have been to 
479404,Ohla Barcelona, Service at poolside Uncomfortable bed Noise metro from 5am No decent films or tv channels breakfast very standard no front of house help with luggage cabs Couldn t open window in room Very basic gym, The concierge service the shower in the room WiFi
479405,Ohla Barcelona, Cold water in the pool Our room was on 6th floor but we could hear the traffic noise We slept with earplugs , We liked the central location Small but good breakfast Nice bar by the swimmingpool Not so big hotel 
479406,Ohla Barcelona, There seemed to be a problem with the toiletries being replaced each day , The bed was soo comfy and the shower was very good The curtains were closed for you in the evening and a different sweet left on your bed was a lovely extra touch All staff were exceptional Thank you 
479407,Ohla Barcelona, I thought it was a tad overpriced for what we paid and there were a few housekeeping issues stains on our suite sofa Shower hose attachment falling off the wall and shower nozzle on bath was broken But these were small things that didn t dampen the experience Some blankets on the roof terrace or fixed heaters might have been nice when it was cold as it was still nice to sit up there but way too cold in the evening Take a warm wrap for cooler months , Lovely quirky hotel in the heart of Barcelona large rooms comfy beds Great Pillows The ample continental breakfast was excellent Close to some fantastic restaurants and eateries Las Ramblas the Market go here to eat one day and basically everything Nice in house bar expensive cocktails but hey cocktails are Great bar staff who gave me a free glass of vintage champagne when I found my glass was dirty high standards 
479408,Ohla Barcelona, Cooked breakfast could have been hotter Overall great selection though Beautifully presented , Rooms large Beds great Concierge very friendly helpful telling us how to get to places Location was amazing We could walk everywhere Highly recommend Would stay there again 
479409,Ohla Barcelona, Just feeling uncomfortable in the hotel on occasions , The location was perfect Hotel beautiful but a little too posh felt uncomfortable at times But all in all have a very nice stay 
479410,Ohla Barcelona, Very little negatives other than some people may not enjoy the fact the shower is the main bedroom space Make sure to close the curtains , This boutique hotel has all the good qualities of a large chain but with more charm The location couldn t have been better the room was spacious and comfortable and the rooftop view just amazing 
479411,Ohla Barcelona, Frukosten hade g rna f tt ha mer att v lja p St dningen var bra men de missade att fylla p duschgrejer b da dagarna Kaffet Inget svenskt kaffe p hotellet , L get r perfekt n ra till allt Personalen r v ldigt hj lpsam och trevlig Riktigt mysigt p takterrassen 
479412,Ohla Barcelona, The hotel is located in a very busy street so rooms located at the front of the hotel might suffer some noise disturbance Personally we weren t really annoyed by it because our room was at the top floor , The staff was extremely friendly and helpful The rooms were modern and still very cosy The beds were amazing and the linen was super soft Bvlgari toiletries are always a plus The breakfast wasn t what you could expect in a five star hotel yet everything was very tasty 
479413,Ohla Barcelona, Bar was closed for renovations our last two days , Customer service staff and location were great Also enjoyed their restaurant Plassohla and lobby bar 
479414,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, The Concierge Albert is one of the best we have encountered He sent us to four perfect restaurants in three days and a fabulous jazz club All the staff were excellent The roof top terrace with pool and glorious sunset views 
479415,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Staff were very welcoming friendly and attended to all our needs Location is superb Breakfast was excellent and tapas in La Plassohla were extremely good 
479416,Ohla Barcelona, Hallways were painted in black with dark carpeting and the walls of the black marble spiral staircase were also in black Beautiful but lighting was low which made it difficult to navigate At some points the stairs were dangerous and required full attention Of course an elevator was available as well but we like taking stairs whenever possible , Location was perfect easily accessible to major places of interest Tasty and diverse breakfast options Room was comfortable and bathroom area was interesting with large glass shower and private toilet room Concierge services were outstanding and appreciated 
479417,Ohla Barcelona, breakfast could have been a little bit more sophisticated different egg meals , very nice staff great Location rooms are really nice maybe bit small fitness center
479418,Ohla Barcelona, The restaurant was good looking but the food a bit lower than the rest of the experiences Or perhaps the other experiences were exceptional , It is truly a great Hotel What makes it unique however is the proactive customer service and cross selling of services to ensure a memorable experience Kudos to all the team but especially Jorge and Cristina at the experience department From flowers and champagne to a great guide that can walk you through this wonderful city they are there for you 
479419,Ohla Barcelona, Although booked six months in advance they gave a first floor room with street and metro noise strangely enough everytime the metro passes the room was rambling It was supposed to be a five star hotel but there is no reception or lobby area That was very dissapointing The hotel management gives priority to outside customers for restaurants They do not make you feel special Stairs are too dimly lit hard to see your steps Breakfast area is too little and food is very poor for a five star hotel Nice terrace but no service, Outside appearence is very attractive Room decoration and bathroom very modern and comfortable Centrally located excellent location
479420,Ohla Barcelona, Nothing, The conceriage staff were all very very helpful we needed a wheelchair which was offered to us for the duration of the stay everything organized on time and perfectly we ll definitley stay again when we visit Barcelona
479421,Ohla Barcelona, Sadly the rooftop pool was being refurbished so couldn t enjoy that , This hotel is an absolute gem Booked two nights as a surprise for my partners birthday and the hotel did not disappoint Staff were incredible Thank you Jennifer and Jose for all you did for you Sometimes it really is the people that make the whole holiday worth while We want to go back already Room was stunning we had a junior suite and I m so pleased we did 2 nights is not enough 4 nights would have been just perfect Ohla Barcelona is 10 10 fabulous 
479422,Ohla Barcelona, The arrangement of the bathroom could have been a little better The shower doors leaked water flooding the bathroom floor Other than that everything was great , The staff were amazing The restaurant downstairs was very good I did not get the opportunity to go out of the hotel for my 2 days stay I got everything that I needed 
479423,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent services good breakfast and excellent location really close to the center so you don t need worry about to use your car there Unless you want to do it 
479424,Ohla Barcelona, Pool area roof terrace viewing area was being refurbished and sometimes closed This was one of the main reasons for our stay Roof was a building site works and cranes workmen on site , breakfast room bar
479425,Ohla Barcelona, No openable windows and the shower is panoramic, The staff were so helpful and understanding and they actioned my requirments i have mentioned in the order confirmation
479426,Ohla Barcelona, The rooftop bar and pool were closed which were strongly featured on booking com and the hotels information just before our trip, Staff and concierges especially
479427,Ohla Barcelona, Bedside lightening is not good The color black for the halls and staircase can be very disconsorting for people with poor eyesight , The location is perfect You can reach the Metro quickly The neighborhood is historical and shopping and eating places abound The bedroom was quite spacious but we had a suite The bed and bathroom were perfect The restaurant Passohla is truly wonderful Breakfast was exceptional Service is outstanding as well 
479428,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, the restaurant was excellent and staff extremely helpful in choosing dishes the suite was very comfortable and reception in arriving with cava great
479429,Ohla Barcelona, The management and the design of the hotel Let me start with the design You walk in like going into a cave It is just pitch black You cannot see the steps the ground floor is split in half and on the second floor you have a tiny reception The rooms you can like or not I do not like to stand in a shower in the middle of the room with 3 sides glass Ground floor has a concierge desk which is constantly occupied because they are all on there own Knowledge is not good enough for a 5 star hotel The staff in many occasions is helpless because they have no or the wrong instructions Manager is never visible Food They claim to be among the best in Barcelona I would say that this is very very far fetched We had New years Dinner for Euro 120 00 each The wine selection which went with the dinner was good the food was the worst New Years Dinner I had in the last 25 years and every year I have one in a hotel Breakfast buffet is borderline acceptable for a 5 star hotel After midnight the service broke down to almost zero Sorry Hotel Ohla but there is room for improvement and there is also white paint The key in my world of design is the following statement Modern BUT cozy Your hotel is ultra modern and ice cold Never again Sorry , The location is perfect The intention of the staff is great The ability is not quite there yet The staff was very nice 
479430,Ohla Barcelona, Very noisy bad soundproofing No privacy direct view on offices opposite the street Shades must be closed all along the stay Such inconveniences could be okay but not for the prices offered at this location , It s clean and spacious as it is the norm for a 5 hotel
479431,Ohla Barcelona, Weird hotel All is black Can t see the steps Reception very small not adequate for a 5 star hotel Rooms are ice cold designer rooms No cosines bad bright lighting Shower in the middle of the room If room door opens everyone in the hallway can see you under the shower Again this is subjective taste Some people might like it I will not use the hotel again , Great location Right in the middle of Barcelona Shopping is right there 
479432,Ohla Barcelona, The laundry service was really expensive We just tried to get laundry service for only washing but they ironed even the socks We paid 170 euros for laundry service , The location of hotel was really good 
479433,Ohla Barcelona, poor small size room aircondition fixed no change no body to take my big bag when iam aarive, best thing in this hotel advise of conserge good onest person called daniel wi fi good
479434,Ohla Barcelona, There was a foul gutter smell at the entrance of our suite Inspite of telling them repeatedly it was not solved I think its a major issue they need to look into , The staff were very helpful As it is a boutique hotel it has a nice homely feel to it and the personal touch was there The location is superb as you are right in the middle of everything and yet away enough from the madness 
479435,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, The room was very spacious and very comfortable Being on the 4th floor helped in having the room in a quiet mode as if you stay on the first floor it is too noisy 
479436,Ohla Barcelona, The room was very strange with theglass shower in the middle of the room with no privacy at all You have to close the curtains of the window when having a shower so the people in the uilding opposite can t see you Unfortunately the electricity went off three times for about a minute once when I was in the shower and as the curtains were closed I was left in pitch darkness , The staff were very attentive perhaps too attentive at times The decoration was nice and it was all very clean
479437,Ohla Barcelona, Bathroom and shower right next to the bed a HORRIBLE ROOM FLOOR PLAN VERY UNFREINDLY CONCIERGE STAFF except Matthew he was great Very unhelpful and condescending RECEPTION STAFF , Location
479438,Ohla Barcelona, Based on the 5 star rating I do not feel the staff on the main floor was up to scratch The service at breakfast was fair allowing plates to pile up on our table while they were busy polishing wine glasses The breakfast also lacked a bit of variation particularly in the warm offerings The concierge although friendly and helpful allowed my wife to carry her bags in and out of the hotel upon arrival and departure Small things but details are inportant I expect at a 5 star hotel that the staff is falling over themselves to serve you , Very Nice modern hotel with a great location in the center of Barcalona The room was immaculate nice bed 
479439,Ohla Barcelona, There is not one thing I can criticise in any way , This hotel is wonderful in every way From the moment you are welcomed at Reception with a glass of cava everything is perfect The facilities are excellent the location is central to all sights the staff are very friendly professional and helpful 
479440,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, The staff was very helpful and friendly and the room was prepared as I requested and surprisingly better than I expected The room itself was excellent and the see trough shower is a must the location is perfect right in Via Laietana Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone 
479441,Ohla Barcelona, Afternoon bar man not interested His evening colleges could teach him a few things it is a 5 star hotel Service should match A colourful print in the rooms perhaps The corridors a little too dark Everything was a little too mono chromed for my taste , Welcome warm friendly Love the reception upstairs Breakfast IS A MUST Roof Top bar is wonderful Bathroom in room is luxurious Wonderful towels and products and a full size hair dryer Magnifying mirror Well thought out Hotel is Very well located Luggage lock up while you spend your last day sightseeing very secure 
479442,Ohla Barcelona, Wish it would ve been warmer so we could use the roof but obviously that s not in the hotel s control , The service was wonderful the restaurant was delicious the cocktail bar was very impressive Ohla was the perfect way to end our honeymoon 
479443,Ohla Barcelona, I think that the lighting on the main staircase should be improved Levels one and two would tend to use this route rather than wait for the lifts , The cleanliness and attention to room service The initial welcome and helpfulness of all the team 
479444,Ohla Barcelona, A nespresso or similar coffee machine in the junior suite would have been a great addition especially for the price of the room, Loved the location rooftop bar and pool staff were amazing junior suite PlassOhla restaurant is fantastic Stayed for 5 nights and loved it 
479445,Ohla Barcelona, Hotel restaurant was not friendly and was overpriced breakfast was not included in rate and was very expensive only hotel in our trip to Spain which charged extra for breakfast , decor rooftop pool and bar with view 
479446,Ohla Barcelona, I was a little annoyed that later in the evening I wanted some more of the juice that was available during the day the wine was out at this time and the bar attendant gladly poured two glasses and then charged our room for them , The breakfast was the best spread of tasty and delicious foods I have ever experienced We only sampled a few things since we don t eat much usually and they were all perfect as were the juices and lattes The rooms were very comfortable stylish and with a sexy see through shower 
479447,Ohla Barcelona, Staff spoke generally very poor English and they were incredibly unhelpfull and unprofessional They were not at all street smart to be diplomatic It looked like every question was treated like asked about the development of nuclear power plant No helpfull tips or recommendations Rooms are extremely small hard to fill in 2 suitcases on each side of bed you have max 40 50cm space left If you do not have luck to get room with the street view you are facing very ugly yard with such short distance of the oposite building For the price I would expect much much more Did not understand if Spain is facing one of the highest unemployment rate especially amongst young educated people how is it possible that staff is such poorly equiped with customer service skills professionalism and language skills That did not apply only to the hotel it is generally everywhere very poor service forget taxi drivers speaking any English, Liked the outside design pool is excellent fab modern design and the view from the pool is amazing pitty it has NOT nice chairbeds to lay down Also service there is totally bad if you want any drink you need to go to bar and ask Will be faced with very poor English 
479448,Ohla Barcelona, The fact that we had to leave , Beautiful hotel in a great location The quality of service and the standard of the room was fantastic Great attention to detail with some lovely touches such as the night time chocolates on the bed The staff were extremely attentive but not too overpowering Also we were given a complimentary bottle of fizz to celebrate a birthday which was another lovely touch 
479449,Ohla Barcelona, At the breakfast table it would have been nice if the dirty plates were taken away a bit sooner Otherwise everything was good , The breakfast is very good and the personal is very friendly The people at the front desk are extremely helpful so as to make your stay as pleasant as possible 
479450,Ohla Barcelona, Room isn t nice enough for that price, The hotel is well located the views from the room and from the terrace are amazing The restaurant in the hotel is very good and service is also good and fast enough for Spain 
479451,Ohla Barcelona, The air con in the room kept going off during the night I think this was user error rather than anything faulty and I m sure if we d mentioned it the staff would have sorted it for us, Staff were all really helpful and spoke amazing English which was great as my Spanish is very basic Room was lovely and comfy breakfast was good and even had Cava We spent our last day by the pool and really enjoyed ourselves 
479452,Ohla Barcelona, A little too hard bed for my taste, 1 The personnel was very helpful great over all service 2 They cleaned the room 2 3 times a day Putting in fresh towels making the room ready for the night etc 3 Great location
479453,Ohla Barcelona, Everything was great , That staff was wonderful We were given great recommendations for two resturants that were incredible Location was great Rooftop bar has the best lemon pie that s not really pie at all but wonderful along with the drinks and pool Corner room bright and spacious 
479454,Ohla Barcelona, Very noisy rooms on the front side even you can hear when the metro arrives to the station The room is not a 5 star room style very poor decoration with open bath The breakfast is very poor and same every day , Location is perfect but this is the only reason to book that hotel 
479455,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, The staff were so polite and friendly and couldnt do enough to help us The roof top pool was the hi light of our stay with amazing roof top view across the city 
479456,Ohla Barcelona, Nothing , Wonderful hotel Very clean facilites Superb room that was cleaned twice a day and smelt lovely Excellent staff that made you feel welcome My gf is vegan and the restaurant staff were very helpful in making her a personalised breakfast every morning Rooftop bar is superb for evening cocktails Excellent location close to city and beach Good wifi connection which isn t always the case in hotels I couldn t recommend the hotel more and will return again next year 
479457,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Location location location Rooftop pool and bar with great music and views fantastic way to spend leisurely afternoon or late evening after dinner Compact but existent fitness centre
479458,Ohla Barcelona, You receive prior arrival a preference list And it seems that despite my answer it was not taken into consideration So why ask I m not a great fan of bathroom in the bedroom Intimacy even with the loved one is preferable , Nice design of the overall hotel Good location Good bed
479459,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Everything was brilliant location was perfect for seeing Barcelona the food was really enjoyable and inventive Best hotel I ve stayed in to the point I can t wait to visit again 
479460,Ohla Barcelona, The rooftop pool area was a little uncomfortable no lounges cabanas very uncomfortable seating and this is where we encountered staff not up to standard of other hotel staff , The room was very comfortable and most of the staff excellent The hotel itself has a bit of funk factor whilst still being luxe 
479461,Ohla Barcelona, The Gothic quarter is much better looking at street level than at roof level if it was not for the amazing building right in front of the pool you would think you were looking into a Brazilian favela I got a good room with a view I thank the welcoming team for that if I had one of the back rooms I would have felt a bit underwhelmed I felt a little pressured to tip after some irrelevant room air conditioning and safe information that I did not want nor requested I hate when staff do that The entrance does not quite ring 5 star quality and the check in area seems almost like a simple office The rooftop pool is considerably smaller that I expected from the pictures but still a very good experience After visiting the Bangkok Sivatel 5 Star hotel pool I find it difficult to rate the two even in the vicinity of each other , The hotel is worth it if you get a good deal Clean great location modern rooms I found that the day breakfast price is just exorbitant however I found that its much cheaper and a much better experience to just order your breakfast in the room the night before The hotel staff seems kind and motivated to help which is very good Even though the Pool is smaller than expected and the view less overwhelming than suggested it is still a wonderful and premium experience I recommend Thank you for a good stay 
479462,Ohla Barcelona, The hotel is so dark inside Nearly all black decorating schemes are not that cool I know it was high season but the cost was too high Breakfast at 20E each is high IMO , Location is great Very convenient to Catalunya Las Ramblas 
479463,Ohla Barcelona, Drinks in bar and snacks on terrace very expensive even by London or luxury Venice standards Would be nice to include a few olives nuts crisps gratis with a round of drinks as is the case in many hotels of such calibre , After a tiring day in hot but beautiful Barcelona sight seeing it was a delight to chill out on the stunning pool terrace with a wonderful view of the Barcelona vista Great central location with very helpful staff Rooms very comfortable with modern decor 
479464,Ohla Barcelona, Rooms very small and kids causing havoc on roof terrace bar Nice hotel but if they want to be 5 star need to up their game, Great location and rooftop terrace with infinity pool
479465,Ohla Barcelona, It was quite expensive to stay and drinks prices were steep , Very good location excellent standards New decor and very modern We would stay here again Fantastic views from roof top bar and pool Very helpful staff 
479466,Ohla Barcelona, The concierge seemed clueless when I asked about gay places in the area He didn t even try to research or ask to at least satisfy the customer which is surprising when probably the LGBT community is probably one of your biggest customer , The accommodations are great location is amazing food was awesome and the pool is ridiculous 
479467,Ohla Barcelona, Nothing not to like , Fantastic staff could not have been more helpful and friendly and with excellent English Lovely roof top bar a must visit for sunset The restaurant downstairs serves delicious food I was tempted to eat there every night but when I did want to go out the concierge were very helpful I am keen to return to Barcelona and will definitely book here again 
479468,Ohla Barcelona, The staff aren t very welcoming a different vibe from the Experience Department email we received prior to arriving , The location is excellent and the concierge assisted a lot as we had quite a few enquiries however it s not service with a smile kind of more impatient Room size was good Junior Suite but the soundproofing through the door wasn t so great and we were near the elevator 
479469,Ohla Barcelona, Few places to dry wet towels swim wear after visit to the beaches of Barcelona , One of the few hotels that lives up to the pitcures on the web site The roof top terrasse must be seen Remember also to visit PlassOhla the Tapas bar and try the frozen Creme Catalana Wow 
479470,Ohla Barcelona, We had rooms on the first floor Pretty noisy The beds were pretty hard not super comfortable And the bed covers very thin Considering the price of the rooms Also watch out for the step from the bathroom area to the room In the middle of the night especially when you re jet lagged you can miss it and it ll give you quite a jolt , The concierges all of them were amazing Fabulous service fabulous recommendations they took such great care of us And the staff at reception first rate The rooftop pool and the view were fantastic The food at the hotel is incredible Don t miss it And the location is great right in the middle of the city walking distance to just about everything Despite some of the negative comments I made I would stay here again I just would ask for a room on a higher floor I definitely recommend this hotel 
479471,Ohla Barcelona, Nothing, The whole experience was truly amazing Perfect location for everything The staff was top notch Does make for interesting talk when you get into a taxi Ohla Ohla Hotel please Taxi driver says Ohla What hotel Ohla 
479472,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming and nothing was too much for them to do for us The rooftop pool was amazing with excellent views and the bed was extra comfy 
479473,Ohla Barcelona, Having to leave , The rooftop pool and lounging area was relaxing and had delightful views Service throughout the hotel whether it was the reception crew the bartenders or staff in the restaurant was all excellent By far some of the best tapas and sangria around Don t pass up the chance to order their octopus and black hummus tapas by far the best octopus we ve ever had 
479474,Ohla Barcelona, The roof terrace bar was great but VERY expensive and would have benefitted from sun loungers during the day , Fantastic location comfy beds wonderful roof terrace great breakfast The staff were also great real welcome even though we arrived very late at night 
479475,Ohla Barcelona, 5 star price for a 4 star hotel Bedrooms too small open plan with no privacy when using shower Windows couldn t be opened no fresh air Bed too hard Black decor and dim lighting corridors and stairs were annoying Web site photography of roof top was deceiving the pool is tiny Fitness area was small with very little fitness equipment Overall poor value for money I paid 1 738 80 for seven nights 284 40 per night excluding breakfast , I liked the location I liked that I didn t eat breakfast in the hotel but in a local restaurant down the road that the local police ate in That was nice 
479476,Ohla Barcelona, Bedroom was quite small and bad value at 1833 30 Euro for 7 nights ie 261 Euro per night excluding breakfast In my room the shower which had glass sides was between the bed and the door to the corridor see photos you can see the shower head This meant no privacy if someone opened the bedroom door from the corridor while one was in the shower While the room layout was different in other rooms I saw three they were all quite small I ve had larger bedrooms in three star hotels The photo of the pool on the roof was deceiving the pool was tiny with glass sides so that guests sitting at tables could observe you through the side as if you were a gold fish in a bowl The color scheme within the communal areas of the hotel corridors and stairs was to a large extent black Black floors black stairs black walls and black ceilings with dim lighting An accident waiting to happen on the black marble stairs in my opinion Lifts were a bit frustrating to use Only one went the whole way up to the roof but when you called it the other shorter lift would keep arriving You had to send that one away in order to allow the correct lift to arrive , Services in general were on par with other 5 star hotels I did of course like the free wifi but every hotel I ve stayed in regardless of star rating has this nowadays 
479477,Ohla Barcelona, Lifts were confusing as they didn t both go to the top floor , Bedding was beautifully soft The staff were helpful and accommodating Great rooftop bar and plunge pool Very relaxing hotel Fantastic location for visiting all attractions and the beach 
479478,Ohla Barcelona, Most of the staff seemed disinterested in helping They would just send us out to chase down a taxi instead of offering to help When asking for dinner suggestions we were clear in saying we were tired of walking and would like to sit down and relax over dinner but they didn t seem to listen and tried to send us on Tapa s tours every time Fitness center is a joke unless you count 2 treadmills and an elliptical as a Fitness Center , Location is amazing rooftop pool was beautiful Room was clean and fairly good sized Shower is cool as long as you don t mind being naked in front of whomever you are traveling with Bar is great the Mojito with chocolate was exceptional 
479479,Ohla Barcelona, The breakfast didn t reach five star service The buffet was cold and no chef on duty to cook fresh I had great difficulty with everything being black The lift needed a torch to see Anybody needing glasses would struggle Its for younger people not older , The staff were lovely The bedding excellent quality and everything very neat and clean 
479480,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent location for access to the old town Ramblas Gaudi buildings Lots of restaurants nearby Fabulous rooftop pool with views right across the city Good selection at breakfast and helpful concierge service 
479481,Ohla Barcelona, There isn t anything I would improve it was perfect , The rooms are gorgeous shower powerful and hot water The beds are so comfortable and the smell in the room was divine The roof terrace is fabulous with amazing views Breakfast was delicious I would go back tomorrow 
479482,Ohla Barcelona, For the price the quality of the rooms fixtures and fittings isn t world class It s good but not top notch A few bits of peeled off paintwork and scratches on the TVs etc Also the occasional rumble of the metro going under the hotel might be a problem for light sleepers though to be fair we were on a low floor Breakfast was ok nothing special I m nit picking but at this price you have to , Prime location Free bottle of cava on arrival to our room The roof terrace is beautiful with wonderful views of central Barcelona which you can enjoy from the pool The staff were very attentive and friendly 
479483,Ohla Barcelona, Nothing We liked it all, Excellent location superb service very high quality restaurant gorgeous rooftop pool bar terrace contemporary smart rooms with very comfortable sheets and pillows overall I would highly recommend
479484,Ohla Barcelona, The pool is small Don t plan on any real swimming But pleasant anyway , Awesome location beautiful trendy hotel gorgeous rooftop view Amazing staff and fantastic concierge service 
479485,Ohla Barcelona, More staff and food choices on busy rooftop bar Expensive, Perfect greeting by reception Lovely rooftop pool nice comfortable rooms and location great little wine bar with knowledgeable staff 
479486,Ohla Barcelona, We booked the Sagrada Familia tour with the help of the concierge however we were not told that we would need to buy a different ticket to have an audio guide and these cannot be purchased inside Slightly disappointing to have to walk around with no audio , Overall an incredible stay at a top class hotel In particular we found the beds to be super comfortable 
479487,Ohla Barcelona, The room faced the front of the hotel and was very noisy throughout the night If you are booking request a room facing the back of the hotel that is on floor 6 or 7 We ate in the hotel on our first evening and the food was excellent A very good selection of Tapas and delicious desserts Later in the week the menu had changed to a more limited choice cheaper alternative Breakfast was good but there was no option to have eggs cooked or other items only scrambled or boiled eggs were available The pool and the bar area on the roof of the hotel were very cleverly photographed for the website both were very small and did not resemble the publicity shots , The hotel staff were very helpful The front desk staff were particularly good recommending restaurants booking restaurants booking excursions and visits Staff in the restaurant were very friendly The hotel was a well located base for sightseeing in Barcelona The bedroom was very comfortable although a little Spartan in terms of d cor 
479488,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Great location Staff we re extremely friendly and helpful One of our favourite hotels to have stayed in Would stay again and highly recommend
479489,Ohla Barcelona, Quality of the toilet paper used didnt match the overall quality of the hotel I would expect a hotel of this quality and price to use high quality toilet paper , Design comfort location
479490,Ohla Barcelona, We only booked one night would have loved to stay longer , Room Service was excellent room and rooftop offered a spectacular view Breakfast was delicious Champagne provided made our first Honeymoon night in Barcelona very much enjoyable 
479491,Ohla Barcelona, The location is pretty good but this is certainly not a sdandard 5 star hotel It is the worst hotel we stayed during this trip Regent Berlin Marriott Amsterdam Sofitel Rome but the most expensive one It is also one of the worst in all 5 star hotels I have stayed so far Taking together I can only consider it as a 3 start hotel at best , Location
479492,Ohla Barcelona, the food has gone down not as good as previous visits Breakfast really poor buffet for 5 start Couldn t even make an omelette no bacon these are basics, excellent hotel in every way
479493,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Everything about this hotel is amazing from the staff to the restaurant and to the world famous cocktail bar We booked this for my birthday trip away and it definitely made it a birthday to remember Will be going back again for sure 
479494,Ohla Barcelona, Front desk staff seemed indifferent Rooms transparent shower cubicles and lockless toilet doors a really bizarre idea Overall the hotel gives an impression of design over comfort Only one sitting chair in double room not good enough for a 5 establishment , Comfortable beds great service from concierge desk nice breakfast 
479495,Ohla Barcelona, Cocktails were a bit pricey in the bar, Upgraded to a Junior Suite Lovely view from the 5th floor Room was spotless and the position of the hotel was ideal for exploring the old quarter Used the metro and local buses to travel around and would advise purchasing major site tickets prior to departure 
479496,Ohla Barcelona, The barman was not up to the standard of the rest of the staff , Staff were very attentive rooms beautifully clean Breakfast very good quality Concierge extremely helpful 
479497,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, This was a trip to celebrate my husbands 40th so we wanted something a little more special and I can honestly say Ohla did not disappoint Right from when we arrived the staff went out of their way a nice glass of fizz as a welcome and they held our bags so we could go off and explore the city while our room was being prepared The bar man Camilo upstairs gave us hints on where to visit tapas cocktail bars etc and the bar we found was the best cocktail bar we ve ever been in Crepe el born We arrived back to the room to a complimentary bottle of cava from the hotel for hubbys birthday and some gorgeous chocs Room was cleaned exceptionally every day and the staff were always happy to guide us to where we wanted to go Even smelt nice everywhere On our last day we had a later check out and staff held onto our bags as we had an evening flight so we could enjoy our last few hours When we returned we were allowed to use the gym area to shower before our flight and chill in the bar 4 days in the city flew by but we had the best time and Ohla definitely made it one to remember Can t thank the staff and management enough We will definitely be back 
479498,Ohla Barcelona, Only 2 tv channels in english sky news and bbc world news the lift had a mind of its own lots of complaints about it , Bed comfy and pillows too Room very clean staff very friendly and helpful Bed turned down nightly with fragrance on pillows and a chocolate each left on bed Pool terrace was great 
479499,Ohla Barcelona, the only 2 things i didn t like were the number of large towels only 2 in the room for 2 adults and the toilet paper which was the cheapest kind thin and hard not what i would have expected , loved the location of the hotel its design the spacious room we had the junior suite the staff were very helpful overall a great experience 
479500,Ohla Barcelona, Leaving , The friendliness of the staff The Hotel was fabulous The room was great quirky The Location was ideal The restaurant was really good 
479501,Ohla Barcelona, Wifi is so slow so we were able to use roaming to send email Awful smell in the room Can t open the window Our cards didn t work Couldn t get on our floor have to go 1up or down No coffee machine In the room closet doors are done parquet floor is done Bathroom has absolutely no light to make up or shave Hotel needs renovation , Nice roof top terrace with pool Location 
479502,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, The bed was comfy The location was brilliant as it was a short walk away from some great places The staff were very kind friendly and helpful and went the extra mile to ensure that our stay was as good as possible The housekeeping was amazing as every day we were provided fresh towels sometimes twice a day and it was a nice little touch by the maids for putting a little chocolate treat on our freshly made bed 
479503,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Room was lovely Staff were super friendly We were given a bottle of fizz on arrival in celebration of my boyfriends birthday Whilst there we also got engaged so all round a fabulous trip 
479504,Ohla Barcelona, A minor point I need to call housekeeping for the additional bathroom amenities on all occasions It would be good if they had observed the finer details and replace them accordingly during the stay , Friendly staff that goes the extra mile to ensure the stay was excellent The restaurant s tapas and mains are excellent I tried their bikini and It was the best among all I tried in Barcelona Location is excellent and I was in the heart of Barcelona 
479505,Ohla Barcelona, Previous comments I agree with Bed was too hard and uncomfortable needs a simple topper No additional pillows and strange shape Toilet tissue was paper rather than soft tissue 5 remember Shower in middle of room in a clear glass format not a major issue as we are a married couple however strange to be completely clear rather than frosted glass No newspaper at front door 5 global standard , From check in to check out the staff were courteous knowledgeable and very customer service orienrated The building and location were superb and would recommend highly even though some cosmetic changes would make it perfect 
479506,Ohla Barcelona, The glass shower was in the middle of the room no privacy , Beautiful hotel Fine service staff was so wonderful The location was excellent near the centre Rooftop bar and lounge area was divine And the included breakfast was delicious 
479507,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, The location is incredible most things are within walking distance the Gothic quarter cathedral beach and there are great transport links to areas which are a little bit further out The staff were lovely very friendly and helpful and the hotel itself is beautiful We only ate breakfast in the restaurant but the food was good and staff couldn t do enough for us The views from the rooftop pool and bar are stunning and the cocktail bar is definitely worth a visit too Perfect for a long weekend in an amazing city 
479508,Ohla Barcelona, It is quite expensive and positioning of the shower bath quite exposed is great for a couple intimate but not for friends etc , The bed was super comfortable staff were helpful The rooftop terrace chill out zone was a highlight and a fantastic location close to metro and walking distance to La Rambla beach etc 
479509,Ohla Barcelona, in the colder months it be good to have had a residence lounge area or larger reception space In the warmer months I guess the rooftop space could be used, Overall a good hotel made into a very good hotel by the staff all of which were very helpful friendly and efficient
479510,Ohla Barcelona, The room was too small and I didn t like the open plan shower or that we couldn t open a window It wouldn t put me off staying again but next time I would book a junior suite, Great location excellent staff lovely tapas restaurant 
479511,Ohla Barcelona, I am really just looking for things that are bad but the only thing i can say is We stayed there 5 days and by the 5th day i did wish a little that they changed up there breakfast a little , The breakfast spread was great the service from the staff was amazing I love the rooftop deck i definitely think we will be back in summer to spend more time up there 
479512,Ohla Barcelona, The wi fi password is changed regularly it would help if you were told that on arrival We arrived back late a couple of days and thought there was a problem with our smart phone reception till we realised, We liked the modern and contemporary design of the hotel the service and when we had dinner the one evening the quality of the food was excellent The staff are excellent too 
479513,Ohla Barcelona, You would expect either local food or American style buffet but breakfast is neither French not American Pastries were great but try to eat something if you are on a low calories diet , Location is excellent for walking around old town
479514,Ohla Barcelona, In room bathroom not ideal as noise invades rest of space Glass shower cubicle not private enough , Bed very comfortable with choice of pillows prebooked Staff efficient and friendly especially concierges 
479515,Ohla Barcelona, A rather hard bed did not match other comforts of a deluxe suite , Very attractive airy large suite with French windows on the 6th floor Good bartenders in hotel bar pleasant staff 
479516,Ohla Barcelona, The breakfast area and the way it was structured The staff was incredibly rushed likely short staffed as it was only two people serving We had to first queue then not get to order at all finally we got our coffee but no cups to drink from We would expect a LOT more from a 5 star hotel , The Location was fantastic walking distance to the Sea and many sights Friendly staff and we were served a glass of bubbly on arrival which is always a nice touch The room was also wonderful 
479517,Ohla Barcelona, Breakfast was dissapointing Long waiting times before getting a table and long waiting before being served coffee , Room was more than perfect Staf was very hulpfull Very good central location 
479518,Ohla Barcelona, Everythings great except they are very forgetful They forgot to arrange our breakfast and they forgot to change the time of our reservations Please take notes concierge people ,No Positive
479519,Ohla Barcelona, Bathroom area is not separated from rest of the room toilet has a door though not possible to open the room window, Great location modern design very friendly helpful staff
479520,Ohla Barcelona, The gym could be upgraded but walking down the city is just as good exercise , An excellent experience I would repeat The staff is highly professional friendly and helpful and the location is next to the heart of the city A cozy and modern design that will draw your attention And just wait to see the pool A 5 stars hotel to the detail 
479521,Ohla Barcelona, Nothing, Everything was great This was a very special stay for us Thanks to all of the Ohla Hotel staff because they made our stay wonderful The quality of the Hotel and the rooms its location the kind and helpful staff everything was perfect 
479522,Ohla Barcelona, Nothing particular, The location is wonderful The airport bus stops near the hotel it s only 5 minutes walking distance Many attractions are near the hotel 
479523,Ohla Barcelona, Everything was great Shower area is quite funny Its only for couples really It s inside the room and transparent so person on the bed can see you how you take a shower lol, Amazing location Supermarket nearby Tube station 30seconds away Ohla 
479524,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Javier Rueda and his team were really helpful going beyond my normal expectations They made us most welcome and very comfortable The rooms are modern clean well equipped and roomy The hotel is located in a great position with easy access to all that Barcelona has to offer and has fantastic views from the rooftop bar I highly recommend staying here because we know we will be next time we are in town Thanks Ohla

479526,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Staff was very helpful Location is ideal for Barre Gotic sightseeing Sauc Restaurant 1 star in hotel Taxi system works great in Barcelona Very convenient for Marina Very quiet and restful to stay
479527,Ohla Barcelona, The only negatives i would say was the Hotel Bars lack of selection of beers they seemed to focus on cocktails and the like but as someone who likes to start the night with a nice cold beer and being in Spain i d expect more variety Also the pillows were a bit soft for me but thats personal preference , Excellent location Staff really friendly and couldn t do enough for you really nice welcome and check out Nice sized room with a really nice layout Really liked the shower nice sized bed The food at Sauc if you like that type of dining was different and exceptional 
479528,Ohla Barcelona, i wished the shower area was be more private since my kids were with me we took a junior suite , the location was amazing the staff were super friendly and helpful 
479529,Ohla Barcelona, Bath too small Could not open windows Expensive compared to other 5 hotels in Barcelona Had to wait until 3pm to check in despite informing hotel we would be there at 1pm Car parking exhorbitant, Bed Very Comfortable
479530,Ohla Barcelona, I would have expected a Nespresso machine in such a hotel standard Hairdryer kept failing on me and I had to request another one , Staff were very friendly welcoming and helpful Room was lovely modern Quick turn around when I asked for a hair dryer to use instead of one in the room 
479531,Ohla Barcelona, Chased us for money owed on minibar that wasn t actually owed No sofas available to lounge on as bar didn t open till 5pm Reception was on mezzanine and restrooms are in basement neither dramatic but a little irritating not ideal for anyone with a disability Don t let these comments put you off very minor , Location is good very accessible good shopping locally many tourists great atmosphere Staff very friendly hotel cafe restaurant was nice good value for money Hotel is good looking architecture pretty with modern rooms

479535,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, the best location in Barcelona perfect rooms staff pool view worth an experience in gastronomy of the restaurant michelin star in the hotel 
479536,Ohla Barcelona, Rooms very comfortable but our bed was rather hard , Fantastic location metro across the road and a short walk from the Gothic centre Great buffet breakfast and incredibly helpful staff 
479537,Ohla Barcelona, Value for your money would have been higher except for the roof top bar The view of the city is wonderful but 42 Euros for 2 beers and a Sangria is a little to much , The staff was excellent and very helpful The hotel is located on one the main street and within a block to the metro 
479538,Ohla Barcelona, I would give this hotel 4 stars at the most The bedding is not as comfortable as it should be at the 5 star hotels And hotel itself is crowded in between a narrow streets do not expect a good city view or a lots of light Next time I will choose hotel W or Majestic , Ohla Hotel is conveniently located within a short walk to the Ramble Blvd Catalonia Plaza and Marine which are the main spots to hang out 
479539,Ohla Barcelona, Rooms are not for families with children the shower is a glass cube located almost in the middle of the room no doors to be private in the bathroom , Location food staff

479545,Ohla Barcelona, No negative experiences, I enjoyed the following the location cleanliness of rooms and comfortable beds professional and friendly staff contemporary decor and large choices for breakfast in a very pleasant restaurant 
479546,Ohla Barcelona, The shower cabin is all crystal so no privacy in the shower , great location very helpful nice staff I ordered in advance some services to celebrate my birthday during my stay there They collaborated so kindly in preparing all services I asked Separating the concierge reception from check in area welcome and check in desk is in the first floor made the check in time more pleasant 
479547,Ohla Barcelona, I faced problems with WIFI during 1 of 4 days of my stay, Wonderful design great breakfast delicious tapas very comfortable rooms and loungy sundeck bar and pool on the roof
479548,Ohla Barcelona, I feel for the price paid it could have been better Great staff but more complementary drinks mini bar , The consiarge was extremely helpful Helped us with all our needs Went above and beyond He was a man in his 50s grey hair and a goatie beard Great location to see Barcelona

479550,Ohla Barcelona, There was nothing at all to dislike at this hotel , From the time we arrived to the time we left the service provided was excellent Nothing seemed to0 much for the staff who were always available to make our stay as enjoyable and memorable as possible They succeeded The location is perfect with numerous shops and restaurants within easy walking distance Yet the rooms were extremely quiet The roof top pool and bar was most enjoyable A wonderful relaxing and enjoyable stay 
479551,Ohla Barcelona, Extreme lack of lightly in areas painted completely black Very dangerous Classic example of trendy design over basic function Trendy certainly user friendly not really Lack of adequate computer and printing facilities Having to balance a small chained up laptop on ones knee while hunched on a small stool is hardly appropriate for serious computer access This precluded completion of some important work related tasks Corridors and stairwells dark which would create significant problems for persons with disabilities or poor eyesight , Location breakfast and concierge
479552,Ohla Barcelona,No Negative, Perfect location in the center of Barcelona 2 very good restaurants in house and a very nice terrace on the roof to relax Will definitely come back

479557,Ohla Barcelona, Check in was too slow Design of room poor small details mirror and hair drier in wrong place Whole place a bit too dark Bit impersonal , Location and breakfast Lady who ran breakfast and Jackomo in cocktail bar very helpful 
479558,Ohla Barcelona, We requested a room on an upper level as we had read that the lower level rooms suffered noise from the underground trains We had a room on the 4th floor out of 6 but you can still hear a gentle rumble of trains until the service stops around midnight although that didn t seem to stop us getting to sleep maybe because the bed was so comfortable and the cocktails so nice The Wifi was not great which might have been an issue if I had been on a business trip but manageable for personal use , Fabulous hotel with friendly efficient staff Our room was spacious and immaculately clean Superb choice of breakfast food The rooftop pool and cocktail bar is fantastic The location is great being on the edge of the Gothic area central for most other attractions and a short walk to the sea front 
479559,Ohla Barcelona, Having to check out come home , Location was great staff were friendly and the roof top pool bar was amazing Great vibe around the place you d be mad to stay anywhere else
