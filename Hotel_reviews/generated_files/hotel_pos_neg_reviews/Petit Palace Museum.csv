314264,Petit Palace Museum, The air condition is located only at the children room Although the two rooms are connected it was still hot in the second room , Very clean and luxurious family room We enjoied the hotel location the good breakfast and the great big jacuzi Helpful stuff 
314265,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, Super comfy beds personal very nice and helpful nice jacuzzi and great bathroom Everything was perfect See you next time we re in Barcelona 
314266,Petit Palace Museum, Room was a bit smelly needed airing silly enormous jacuzzi in the middle of a family room really Unclear info at check in regarding cost of breakfast for children leading to a discussion at checkout which was however then settled quickly painlessly favourably , Family rooms a rare find We have often used Petit Palace for exactly this reason Great location quick walk to bars restaurants shops lovely stroll to Ramblas 
314267,Petit Palace Museum, My only negative was that the take away breakfast prepared for our 6 00 a m departure was really disappointing It consisted of a tomato and cheese sandwich on white bread which ended up being soggy a croissant an apple a yogurt and two beverages After being pampered by the regular breakfasts this showed no imagination unlike everything else at the hotel , The facilities were really fun and zany The room was attractive and comfortable The staff could not have been better They helped with reservations and all information we asked of them The breakfasts were terrific and offered a really nice selection 
314268,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, I loved the fact that you had a family style room I was traveling with my 3 sisters and I was happy that we all got to stay in one room Adults staying in bunkbeds was unexpected but we are small and agile so it worked just fine The beds were super comfortable We are not coffee drinkers so we can t rate the coffee Our overall stay was superb I would recommend it to others and I would stay there again 
314269,Petit Palace Museum, One negative point though and that was it looked like there were private sun beds on a roof top That apparently was for a private room Bit misleading , I thought the hotel was much better that the photos the hotel put on the website They should invest in a photographer to take some good ones Loved our family room for five which included a Jacuzzi Thank you
314270,Petit Palace Museum, I had no issue with a thing , Staff was so attentive When we asked for ice it was there in seconds One friend became sick and they had a Dr there in 40 minutes
314271,Petit Palace Museum, Didn t like that the price quoted on booking wasn t the price we had to pay at hotel It went up 135 to be careful waiting till you get to hotel ,No Positive
314272,Petit Palace Museum, No coffee tea facilities which normally is available in a room at that rate TV very badly placed in a corner of the room also didn t work though I did not complained about it , Excellent staff and location
314273,Petit Palace Museum, Room was a completely undistinctive box Very little storage space Small and inconvenient bathroom The room was not the room shown on the website when I selected the room much smaller not as attractive And not worth the nearly 400 a night paid despite the great location Not remotely the value expected for the price I know the area well you can find similar hotels in the area for a lower price or much nicer hotels for the same price , Great location Nice public areas Breakfast pretty good 
314274,Petit Palace Museum, The lack of drawer and cupboard space dated trying to be cool furnishings chip in the basin crack in the WC lid No full length mirror, Great location pleasant helpful staff
314275,Petit Palace Museum, The block system at the entrance disturbed a bit once my friends came to visit me You had to go down to let them in each time The rooms service is very slow Even I was welcomed with bottle of champagne and fruits I had to expect it during 3 hours and make sever calls to the reception desc to remind , I live in the city but as most of us have willingness to escape from the town to have a rest When I don t have any offer to travel I book the room city s hotel with the access to the space where I can chill taking sun bath and refresh in the swimming pool The city beach is overfilled of tourists this period so to spend WE in nice room with ferrase and jakuzi might be the best good option So I was very satisfied staying in the hotel 
314276,Petit Palace Museum, There was no privacy Bathroom had glass door with no bolts The moment you switch on the bathroom lights the entire room is illuminated No sound proofing in the room The door opens straight towards the bed This was the king room The door is so slim that it lets all sounds out and in We were woken up by the alarm of the guy across the corridor Cleaning is not up to standard You are met with dirt the moment you open up any cabinet or even the minibar , Room service and reception staff was excellent They upgraded us because the booked room was not clean and sub standard The location was convenient Round the clock reception attendance Food in room service was good The terrace attached to the king room is nice 
314277,Petit Palace Museum, A glass door that doesn t lock in the bathroom is a terrible idea Everything seemed worn down And there was a lot of dust and unclean areas , The large bed was comfortable 
314278,Petit Palace Museum, The room was a bit dark and had a small window with no view , The room was quiet and cleaned every day The breakfast was great and had a lot to choose from either savory or sweet options 
314279,Petit Palace Museum, there was a blockage in sink at bathroom it was filled with water when we called the receptionist he told us that he cant do anything and cant change the room because all the rooms are full and we have to wait until morning he just adviced us not to use sink what a great idea so we didnt use sink during night and next morning also they didnt put slipper in room when we requested for it he told us that there isnt room service at night shift so we had to wait until next day for slipper too bed scarfs were dirty covered with hair all in all it was an awful experience for us , location
314280,Petit Palace Museum, One of our hot tubs in the room leaked so we had to turn it off that was the only flaw , Lovely rooms with beautiful balconies Rooms for 5 people were fairly spacious and suited is fine Staff were extremely Helpful and friendly 
314281,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, The staff were really helpful My daughter left her earbuds on the bed when the room was cleaned and they went in the laundry by accident The staff tracked them down and even taped them to our suitcases in the luggage room Excellent 
314282,Petit Palace Museum, None, Excellent location amenities and great staff We had a family vacation for three nights Great central location close to La Rambla Placa de catalunya Sagrada Familia shopping areas the Gothic Quarter restaurants bars and easy access to take Aerobus to the airport Room was a decent size with a breathtaking view Extravagant bathroom with a big shower head and jacuzzi which was needed after a long day of sightseeing Great room service the breakfast had a variety of food and was tasty The staff was excellent well mannered kind and very helpful Big kudos to Mr Yannick Adrianna Lisa Carmen Javier and Maria for helping us gettting around and making our vacation a memorable one As an added bonus the hotel smells lovely and very welcoming I highly recommend Petit Palace Musuem to anyone staying in Barcelona 
314283,Petit Palace Museum, Nothing, Amazing hotel was perfect location breakfast has plenty of choice recommend to anyone Champagne and chocolate for my boyfriends birthday was an exrta special touch to the break
314284,Petit Palace Museum, We offered 4 bed room but they don t serve us Sometime the water smell bad like pool They say they have Gym but it s closed , The stuff answered us everything so it was nice Also their appearance is good as well 
314285,Petit Palace Museum, Didn t realise that breakfast wasn t included and the bar and room service didn t start until 15 00 so couldn t get any drink in the hotel in the morning , Beds were extremely comfortable large room and large bathroom with a great shower Staff always helpful 
314286,Petit Palace Museum, The hotel bar closes at 11PM , Large family room with bunk bed for the kids Very nice breakfast Centrally located in Barcelona with easy access to taxi airport bus and metro Many nice restaurants nearby 
314287,Petit Palace Museum, We brought are own kettle and cups and tea and coffee the only fault and it is a small fault they could have had tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms but that s just me being picky because I can not live with out tea , All the staff were helpful as my Spanish was terrible They were on hand to help with information and directing me to the nearest Farmacia the mother in law got sick They threw in a map of the area and said if i needed any more information please come down or phone us and we will oblige The breakfast was plentiful and for everybody hot food cold food breads pastries an espresso machine English breakfast tea Whole milk Skimmed Milk Lactose free milk Almond milk forgot the other milk Cold Spanish meats cold cheeses You basically help yourself it was all a very enjoyable experience so sorry not leaving a tip for the maid who cleaned are rooms every day with fresh sheets and towels But we had a plane to catch and I forgot she was the unsung heroe of the hotel the room was spotless 
314288,Petit Palace Museum, I have seen better staff These guys weren t always helpful and not as welcoming The property is overrated for being a museum We expected more Rooms were extremely small and sometimes not as practical It was quite expensive compared to the other hotel and less value for money , The location is fairly good with easy access to Placa Catalunya and the La Ramblas The breakfast was decent They had great showers 
314289,Petit Palace Museum, Little details crack in bath mound around shower head, Perfect location Decor very fun comfortable Brought complimentary cake for my daughters birthday
314290,Petit Palace Museum, Room not massive but decent size Nothing else , Good size bathroom Shower excellent Clean friendly staff Had a small problem with the safe Fixed in about 10 mins We went out came back and we had been given 2 small bottles of prosecco and loads of chocolates Bed was a good size Loaned us umbrellas cos weather was poor As a good hotel should but appreciated Excellent location Would stay there again without doubt 
314291,Petit Palace Museum, Very little, From the moment we arrived the staff could not have been more helpful their friendliness and knowledge of the area made our stay all the more enjoyable The room was very comfortable breakfast was excellent The hotel is well positioned in the centre of the city with easy access to all areas 
314292,Petit Palace Museum, The only one problem with this hotel was one of the front desk staff Sara Every other staff member in this hotel was extremely friendly and helpful but Sara was always slightly irritated and seemed rushed and frazzled She gave us inaccurate information which caused us to waste several hours Another time we asked her a question she told us to come back in a few hours because she was busy Unfortunately she was at the front desk a lot and we quickly learned to just avoid her if possible , Location was great Room was very comfortable Bathroom was very nice Breakfast was good 
314293,Petit Palace Museum, It should have been dusted better Toilet door was almost transparent and could not be locked The quilts of the single beds had no full bed cover The price for the breakfast was extremely high for a family and not affordable The lights are not bright enough The staff could have been more welcoming with a genuine smile rather than just doing their duty But they were helpful with directions The photos of the room do not match the ones when I booked the hotel There seems to be a mix up of pictures between this hotel and the Petit Palace Barcelona Hotel Not professional and misleading for the customer , It was cosy and quiet We had a good night s sleep 
314294,Petit Palace Museum, Wifi was not fast enough to watch tv on my i pad, Wonderfull staff made My Birthday trip special and memorable Thank you Anatol and Jordi for the laughs personable service and extra s like champagne chocolates at arrival Plus for my dog also warm wellcome with dogfood own dogpillow and plate Transfer from and to airport well organised by hotel Location fantastic 500 meter from Pla a de Catalunya and Passeig de Gra ia Opposite hotel superb breakfast caf called Ramblas 31 Great boulevard to walk Rambla de Catalunya with shops tapas places just around the corner from hotel so donot go to the famous La Rambla with tourist thieves Fantastic sunny weather allthough beginning of january Next visit AGAIN at Petit Palace Museum 
314295,Petit Palace Museum, I paid for a romantic package and while we got the room we paid for the package we also paid for came with a bottle of champagne and that was never ever delivered , Location was great Breakfast was amazing The room was great too Loved the balconys 
314296,Petit Palace Museum, Wifi almost didn t work too slow Cleaning service really poor We found personal belongings from last customer besidethe bed glasses weren t cleaned during the bedroom service morning coffee poor of options for the price , Location is near Catalunya Plaza 
314297,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, Very comfortable bed Excellent location Very practical family room Jackusy in parents bedroom was not working first day but breakfast was offered in compensation Highly recommended 
314298,Petit Palace Museum, Besides provided of double glasses the windows of the room badly isolate atmospheric agents and from external noises that being in the city center are on 24 hours Curtains were stained by humidity probably because when it rains some water drops in The room has a spectacular view over the roof interior but the glass that separates from it is dirty , Nicely placese close to Plaza Cataluna 
314299,Petit Palace Museum, There wasn t anything that we didn t like , The location is very convenient They offer portable WIFI which was nice surprise The breakfast buffet was excellent 
314300,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, Close to transport hubs in the center of everything Staff went out of their way to be helpful Even managed to print out several tricky airline boarding passes 
314301,Petit Palace Museum, Unfortunately I had no view from my room window but this was fine as the hotel is very central and spent very little time in it The room very comfortable shower and bathroom excellent all very clean , Breakfast was varied to cover all likes and dislikes 
314302,Petit Palace Museum, Lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room We were up on the third floor but the room was on the roadside and quite noisy could hear every past , Great location 5 minutes from La Rambles Comfy bed Modern bathroom with great shower
314303,Petit Palace Museum, Nothing everything was spot on , This was our second visit there and everything was great the staff were so helpful breakfast was plentiful and it is in a great location 
314304,Petit Palace Museum, The private terrace and hot tub area could have been cleaner someone else had used candles previously and the wax remained on the floor and in the tub for our arrival , We loved the service Boris and forgive me if this incorrect or misspelt Anatol were fantastic members of staff who were very friendly and helpful giving great customer service The little touches such as the champagnend goodies and note were a lovely touch and made us feel valued The location of the hotel was perfect breakfast was fantastic great choices and we made use of the free bikes 
314305,Petit Palace Museum, We found the bed a little hard and the room decor somewhat sparse minor gripes though, Situated in an excellent location this hotel with its quirky modernist decor is comfortable and functional The staff are pleasant and the breakfast substantial 
314306,Petit Palace Museum, We wanted to see Flamingo dancing The staff at reception recommended a flamingo show which we were very disappointed with They advised every seat has good viewing Instead it was a small cramped venue and we had to stand the whole time to see the foot work Was not worth the money , Location is excellent Staff are polite and friendly 
314307,Petit Palace Museum, We chose not to have the breakfast due to the perceived high cost, Room was spacious and clean Windows could open wide to let in fresh air Staff were very helpful Great location 
314308,Petit Palace Museum, Reception is busy most of the time or no one available to talk ton or get directions Although we checked in very late around 10 pm and we stayed 6 nights they were strict on 12 noon check out or pay 30 euro for 3 hours late checkout other than this the hotel was very good choice , Friendly reception staff Quiet Cozy place Breakfast was good and staff very friendly location is very convenient close to Rambla street Close to Metro Close to shopping areas and many many restaurants 
314309,Petit Palace Museum, Our room wasn t cleaned until early afternoon but that s my only negative , This is my second time staying at this hotel and I feel that the location of the hotel is great and within easy walk to the tourist attractions and would definitely stay in this area and hotel again 
314310,Petit Palace Museum, The staff is not well informed and there are no concierge services We needed some advice on where to eat where to shop the staff was friendly but could be much better informed , I really liked the location it was close to a major street of barcelona the Passage de Gracia 
314311,Petit Palace Museum, Booking 15 00 12 00 15 00 30 Benefits for reservations through the hotel website we arrived at the hotel with another couple of friends We made the reservation through we Booking and the second couple made a reservation directly through the hotel s website It turned out that whoever is available through the hotel s website gets late check out 15 00 and We have been asked to vacate the room earlier 12 00 When we asked to check out by 15 00 we were asked to pay 30 euros , 300 5 Breakfast excellent and rich one of the best I have ever seen in Europe Includes cheeses salmon casseroles vegetables champagne Free freshly squeezed orange juice instead Location very close to the Rambla 300 meters There is a metro station within a 5 minute walk Rooms We took a double room The room was sufficiently spacious And clean Shower excellent Especially with the many streams that come out of it Staff polite good English speaking Bed and a very comfortable bed
314312,Petit Palace Museum, At times it was a bit hot in the room without aircon , Staff was very friendly and helpful We enjoyed breakfast and two great dinners Room was bright and overlooked the park Alba was very helpful 
314313,Petit Palace Museum, The bathroom The tub was too high and there was no where to hold on so I fell and I am still sore and limping They should put some handles to exit the shower without accidents, The breakfast was awesome The place was spacious and bed comfortable Great location close to everything 
314314,Petit Palace Museum, The odd moment when the staff walked into my room without knocking having that was the only unpleasant finding, Service staff location and overall ambience 
314315,Petit Palace Museum, Nothing it was really a great choice for central Barcelona , The location was absolutely fantastic Walking distance to the Metro station 2 streets away major restaurants outdoor cafes tourist sites etc Perfect The staff were incredibly helpful the room very clean and comfortable and very tasty breakfast with plenty of hot and cold food variety We loved the d cor of the hotel too 
314316,Petit Palace Museum, Sadly the ordered champagne as described in the honeymoon offer was not available on arrival and took a long time to arrive No coffee machine in the room and no vending machine for other drinks available in the hotel The ceiling in the bathroom required attention The sink in the bathroom was a bit odd and reminicent of a fried egg , Loved the outside terrace and the ceiling in the main room the glass panel allowing viewing of the attic beams etc The breakfast was very good The bed was extremely comfortable 
314317,Petit Palace Museum, Small black debris came out of jacuzzi jets, Friendly and helpful service from Francesc Perfect location nicely appointed room with a good outlook funky lobby area

314319,Petit Palace Museum, Staff was very nice but a little undereducated ie no maps for the bus didn t know good restaurants no pool or exercise room, Safe excellent location very clean
314320,Petit Palace Museum, The rooms while well decorated weren t big enough for a couple like we were in a single room but they out a double bed in it Don t bother booking the romantic package a welcome package and a special bed was specified My girlfriend was arriving before me so I made sure I got that so there would be some cava and chocolates waiting for her What actually happened was they asked her to wait while they prepared the room then forgot about her for a couple of hours while she watched other people checking in Then no cava or chocolates in the room When I got there and asked about this the staff said they forgot and would do it the next day and acted like I was being difficult And tbh it was the cheapest cava we could find in the supermarket I believe the bed was standard as well It s little things like this that can make a big difference to ones stay One more thing I asked them if they could arrange a booking at a restaurant for us and the concierge flat out refused and told me they don t do that , Loved the decor amazing location quirky vibe 
314321,Petit Palace Museum, Nothing, The people at the front desk were very helpful with directions and local suggestions of what to do and see The room was perfect and had a nice funky decor with a great brick wall too
314322,Petit Palace Museum, The first room given did not have working hot water which was only found out when stepping into the shower It was very inconvenient Then we were told that nothing could be done till the morning So two cold showers later we were moved to a room which had hot water These things should be checked before giving the room to a guest The rooms are too dark and pokey No conditioner in rooms Had to ask for bathrobe and slippers in the second room , Anatoli and some other staff members at the front desk was very nice and went out of their way to help The location was good as it was away from the major tourist thoroughfare and between two major shopping streets 
314323,Petit Palace Museum, some small lacks I do not know no indication of the numbers to call the reception from the room or in case of emergency the internal phone it seemed not much operative the television with a few channels and poor reception lack of proper water flush jet for the cleaning of the WC or alternatively a brush suitable for that purpose , Very central position to the main point of interests of Barcelona placa Catalunya La Rambla Casa Batllo the staff at the reception was kind and professional the room was comfortable also the lounge very elegant

314331,Petit Palace Museum, couple of very minor maintenance issues in the bathroom blown bulb leaky shower screen toilet flush mechanism kept sticking We didn t mention these until checkout as they weren t a big deal for us and I m sure they would ve fixed the problems right away Other than that it s really difficult to fault this place It s exactly as described and we had a really good stay , comfy beds stylish design good breakfast great location

314343,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, Location was perfect staff were extremely friendly and helpful rooms were good size and the shower was just incredible Will most definitely be back and will have no problem in recommending this hotel to others 
314344,Petit Palace Museum, the hotel did not have any helping documents in the place to tell us the numbers that should be dialed or even details of the facilities it had as the next day we were informed that room service is not available during sunday and monday which was odd when we came only 1 staff does it all , its location was close to most of the important locations which was good and also a walking distance from the tourist bus drop which was excellent
314345,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, We went on a cruise for our honeymoon and stayed at the hotel after the cruise for one night before our flight The hotel was very chic and modern The staff was so helpful friendly they also upgraded us for our honeymoon as a gift from them which was so thoughtful The staff also gave us dinner recommendations and offered directions a map The next morning we had breakfast in the hotel which was delicious with lots of variety 
314346,Petit Palace Museum, Room was noisy because the windows were original and therefore old not used to non double glazing But these windows could not have been changed without affecting the facade of the building, Great reception staff comfy bed nice room and bathroom
314347,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, The staff were lovely greeting us each time we arrived or left The room was spacious and facilities excellent The hotel is well maintained and clean Breakfast buffet had an extensive choice and plenty of time The hotel is only two minutes away from Placa Catalunya at the top of The Ramblas making it very central We had a lovely stay and will return to the Petit Palace Museum hotel very soon 
314348,Petit Palace Museum, Would be nice to have a cattle for coffee tea in the room For that price should be obvious Also 2 light chairs to seat on the balcony would be fun Oh and a toilet brush in the bathroom It s basic, Location friendly and helpful staff Spacious room balcony Unique design
314349,Petit Palace Museum, Rooms unfortunately are not well kept and feeling tired Front rooms are very noice as windows are single glass No sleep on our first night from the noice We had to change rooms in the middle of the night Back rooms are tasteless Furnitures are old We had to check out on our first night as we did not like the front or back rooms at all We paid little more and went to a beautiful hotel further down , Building looks nice on the outside Nice reception 
314350,Petit Palace Museum, There was no bar or restaurant on site The hotel is literally just bedrooms No English speaking channels on the TV , Family room was spacious beds were comfortable bunk beds for the kids was brilliant clean bathroom with lots of towels Location was excellent 
314351,Petit Palace Museum, A bit more expensive than the hotels we usually use Staff replaced sheets and towels too often but I guess that s common there , Good location breakfast Friendly staff 
314352,Petit Palace Museum, 1 The rooms size view and bed type were not what we excepted to have from the pictures we were a group of 3 families and had to wait for couple of hours to check in and get some descent rooms We booked 4 rooms in total 2 There is no coffee maker or kettle for making tea coffee inside the rooms like other hotels In cafeteria there is a coffee machine but is not working properly 3 Other issue we had in one of our rooms the house keeping took one of the shopping bag along with the receipt and one tiny shirt in it most probably without noticing there is some stuff inside the shopping bag we complained to the reception and they refused to accept this and we were disappointed by their response So be careful to put your stuff inside closet 4 The closet is not built in and not very tall for your tall clothes also no drawers for you to put your stuff No mirror inside the room No iron 5 The washroom doors are made of glass which is bad as you have no privacy inside the toilet 6 in 2 of our rooms the telephone were not working and internet connection was poor During our stay for a week they did not do anything to fix it 7 The washroom in the basement most of the time had no soap Men and women washroom has the same basin common area to wash your hands which makes you feel not very comfortable if you are a lady So I do not recommend this hotel if you are a family or a single lady , Staff were friendly location was excellent rooms were clean
314353,Petit Palace Museum, We booked 5 rooms and some single persons got spacious room with large bed and some couples smaller rooms with narrow bed so staff could use more logic when checking people in No big deal though just a small note , Great location rooms have everything you need spacious bathroom shower with massage Did not try any breakfast so can t say about it
314354,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, Staff was helpful informative Our luggage did not arrive for 2 days and they did all the follow up calls for us so we could just get on with our plans worry free We would go back in a heartbeat We had a street side room that comments said would be noisy but we found it to be fine and enjoyed watching the people on the street The location was great for walking to most tourist sites 
314355,Petit Palace Museum, There is nothing to report I did not like , modern and complete room wel kept location close to Pla a Catalunya very friendly and helpful staff I had to reschedule my business trip and therefore did not show one night I booked a room the next night The hotel could have charged my no show and I would not have complained I asked for the staff to make me an invoice of the no show charge and was told that the night would not be charged Great service that exceeded my expectations Well done 
314356,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, Great hotel in a great location Staff couldn t have been nicer or any more helpful than they were Would return here in a heartbeat Keep up the good work 
314357,Petit Palace Museum, As rooms are towards the street expect a bit of noise in the morning althoug the isolation is quite good As in many hotels in Spain the eggs at breakfast are not the high point very dry a lot of oil, A hotel with a lot of charm in an ancient building I had a room with a small balcony a wonderful place to look over the city A nice breakfast the spinach kiwi cleansing juice was much apreciated Very helpful and smiling personnel I payed around 100 eur room during a promotion so all my evalution is done for this price range 
314358,Petit Palace Museum, On a negative point the hotel is becoming tired and will need refurbishment in the near future and the bar facilities could be better , Perfect location Perfect staff who could not have been more helpful or obliging and they ensured our 30th Wedding Anniversary was celebrated in style Thank You Great breakfast and cleanliness 
314359,Petit Palace Museum, May be the hotel gave us a room for disable person though it is quite spacious but no hanger for bath towels However excellent rain n massage shower , Good location Just 5 min walk to subway Lots of restaurants around 
314360,Petit Palace Museum, No problems at all everything was good although we didn t eat breakfast in the hotel so can t comment on that , Great hotel in a convenient location Very nice quiet family room The staff were very friendly and helpful I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends 
314361,Petit Palace Museum, only a silly niggle we felt maybe a rail in the bath to help you climb out but this is only because we are older could not fault anything else , Everything the location was perfect breakfast was good and plentiful and the staff were wonderful room and bathroom were large and spacious just right 
314362,Petit Palace Museum, Tea and coffee in the room was sorely missed though i did see a couple who had obviously borrowed a kettle , The locaton of the hotel is really good a block away from train metro and at the top of La Rambla We were in room 104 which is at the front and overlooks the street with a small balcony We had no noise problems from the street as the double glazing is superb The aircon is good and not too noisy Bed was good comfortable great pillows The bathroom is good spacious and moden Breakfast offers a good choice though the setting is a little soulless and they need a better more coffee machine for the demand The hotel and staff look the part staff obliging with a smile if asked for help Thus is very much a hotel that in the morning you get up and go at night come back and crash It is not for lounging around in over drinks or an dvening meal there is room service but no restaurant or proper bar but look you are in Barcelona so why would you want to stay in the hotel with this glorious city on your doorstep 
314363,Petit Palace Museum, The breakfast is expensive and doesn t include coffee only ersatz Nespresso One can buy a better breakfast at a tenth the price just outside Granier carrer Balmes , One of the very few hotels were the bed is a real bed and the shower a real shower no curtains no flooding 
314364,Petit Palace Museum, The place looks like it is not maintained well Probably due to high traffic they seem not to take care of the rooms for the normal tear and wear Also we had to request slippers no bathrobes for a 4star is expected no toilet brush The door from bathroom is from glass which is not good during the night when you have to turn on the light the other person is disturbed by light They have a big problem with heating it is done through ventilation not passive elements so it is really noisy turning on and off I could not sleep well because of the noise You can setup the fan speed but in our room only high mode was working apparently Should take care of that , Fabulous Location walking distance from Placa de Catalunya and Casa Battlo Passeig de Gracia You can rent bikes which is a plus because Barcelona is very bike friendly We had a very good price and it was enough to cover the value we received Very attentive with how they treat guests the staff is very good We could store luggage before check in a big plus Design was modern but worn out Power shower is great 
314365,Petit Palace Museum, Twin beds pushed together although comfortable when asked for a double room , Very friendly and helpful staff Great location for city site seeing Fabulous breakfast 
314366,Petit Palace Museum, There s no slipper so a little bit uncomfortable Maybe you should take your own And TV channels are just 11 but quality of screen was not that good , Everyday beds and restroom are cleaned And breakfast was good but it would be much better adding some kind of hot soup Location is wonderful nearing Passieg de Gracia Metro Aerobus stop Plaza de Catalunya Most of all the view was nice 4F and free Wi Fi makes it best 
314367,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, Everything was amazing in the hotel from the minute we checked in to the time we checked out Nuno on reception was more then helpful Always full of smiles and always helped us with every thing we needed this hotel was by far the best we have ever stayed it We could not recommend it more 
314368,Petit Palace Museum, The room did not have a nice view but was really quiet So its not a minus but more choice as hotel has also street facing rooms For us quietness was important and view much less They should remove the strong scent from the lobby its just artificial though nice modern and I am sure that employees hate it So not really necessary for overall nice ambient of the hotel , Magnificent breakfast and pastries Great location nearby metro airport train and Gaudi s work Pleasant staff Very clean and neat Very quiet Price was okay for Barcelona Great coffee and pastry place just accross the street Comfortable bed and pillows Highly recommendable 
314369,Petit Palace Museum, Nothing everything was as expected or even better , Excellent location design and comfort Clean and proper bedroom same for other facilities Recommendable 
314370,Petit Palace Museum, Certainly could have used more clothes hangers in the closet , Great location within walking distance of any major sights you can think of Lots of places to eat around Breakfast clearly above average fresh juice cocktails Loved the credit card operated in room safe no fuss with codes Comfy bed large rooms 
314371,Petit Palace Museum, Location is great but rooms are very noisy even with closed windows , The room is well equipped and has a nice design The stuff is very friendly and helpful 
314372,Petit Palace Museum, There was obviously another chair and little table missing at our room No fan at the toilet and also the door couldn t be closed properly We were cold in a room but could heat by the air cond You can hear noise from the other rooms The bed was also bad quite small for two adults and not stable It was 4 maybe many years ago Not now o , Perfect location right at the main centre of the city round the corner from the shops and restaurants from the main street Rambla from Place Catalunya You can easily walk everywhere or the metro is also very close from the hotel The breafasts were ok fruits hams great baquets yougurts or cereals also some litter smoothies There was a problem with a water for a tea but after we asked the waiter they brought it to us But everything clean Wifi was working properly 
314373,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, The location of the hotel was really good just towards the top end of La Ramblas but convenient for everything Close to the Metro bars restaurants walking distance of the Gothic area The staff were so helpful particularly Sara on reception who really assisted with how to get about town Hotel was well kept nice and clean and tidy 
314374,Petit Palace Museum, Only slight issue was that our bedroom overlooked the back of the concert hall so on the Saturday night loud music could be heard apart from that it was peaceful and quiet for the other 3 nights , Our bedroom 314 had great views and was extremely light and spacious Bathroom was excellent with huge shower and space again 
314375,Petit Palace Museum, If I had to criticise something I would say the bathrooms although impressive were not exactly functional The hand basin awkward and the shower You either were attacked from all sides by water such a waste or it was a hand held shower head The TV remote did not allow us to change language on the Dual language programs so we gave up on the TV But this really is being over picky , The overall feel of the hotel and location was excellent Also I would like to mention Sara the receptionist who was wonderful throughout our stay They could not have been more helpful or accommodating I highly recommend this hotel 
314376,Petit Palace Museum, the bathroom could do with a little makeover as the patch on the spa bath was a little off putting apart from that little else was wrong, staff were very helpful and the location was very near to most of the attractions also easy reach of either the bus or train station for airport transfers
314377,Petit Palace Museum, Our bed was a kingsize made with two mattresses which floated away during night, Great location Friendly staff Lovely breakfast Smell of nice perfumes in the lobby
314378,Petit Palace Museum, Small room window facing a nearby wall needs a little work on painting and wc fixtures , Excellent location Walking distance to many attractions and main transports incl the airport train Awesome breakfast Staff very friendly and helpful 
314379,Petit Palace Museum, one night wifi didn t work but rest of the nights it was fast , bed is so comfy bathroom products quality fast wifi staff perfect location mamma mia 
314380,Petit Palace Museum, Nothing, Provided a bed bowl and food for our dog with no charge of any kind The location of this hotel is perfect near restaurants bars and shops as well as transit and Casa Batllo 
314381,Petit Palace Museum, Overpriced mediocre breakfast Wifi signal horrible in our room but perhaps better elsewhere , Awesome location Nice family size room Friendly and helpful staff
314382,Petit Palace Museum, Just a few small things an extra chair in the room and a few hooks would be very comfortable, The friendly and helpful staff was superb Muchas gracias to all of them They helped us very good when the Iphone of our daughter was stolen Breakfast super beds very comfortable shower very good 
314383,Petit Palace Museum, It would be prefect if there s kettle and free bottle water in the room Mini supermarket located on next street so it s easy to buy drinks , The hotel location is fantastic and the free bike that we borrowed to explore the city 
314384,Petit Palace Museum, At the end of our stay I thought I had paid already but the lady said they had charged the wrong amount so I needed to pay more I wasn t very happy with her attitude towards me which left a bitter taste in me when we left the hotel which was a shame as we had such a lovely holiday , It was clean and tidy the buffet breakfast each morning was great It was only a short walk to the centre 
314385,Petit Palace Museum, Suggestion to make scrabbled eggs lighter other than that breakfast was great , The room was spacious amazing decor The employees were very helpful gracias Alex gave great insights to visit the city 
314386,Petit Palace Museum, part of the staff especially the male ones not friendly for example they don t greet you back when you say good morning which is bit weird , location decor style comfort price
314387,Petit Palace Museum, Lack of proper bar facilities so we could meet up before dinner Only open 3 11pm Closed some days , Location Comfortable Rooms Helpful staff Good bars restaurants nearby 
314388,Petit Palace Museum, The downside for us was the bathroom the shower was good but the sink was so small and low we had water everywhere and were constantly mopping up , The reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful the location was perfect 
314389,Petit Palace Museum, Could do with a pool facility but we can t say We would of had time to use it anyway , Excellent room lovely staff great location very clean and brilliant facilities Impressed by the free and easy use of the safe using credit card technology 
314390,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, Excellent position for the city just off the huddle of the rambalas but close enough to get to also excellent advise and warm welcome many thanks will certainly return to this hotel x
314391,Petit Palace Museum, It s silly but the bathroom doors were glass and didn t latch I wish they had latched for privacy I was traveling with my Uncle if I was traveling with a spouse it would ve been fine The doors were beautiful though, The staff was amazing I wish I could remember their names but there were three that were especially wonderful The location was superb We had a beautiful balcony that had the best view 
314392,Petit Palace Museum, Jacuzzi in the bathroom is always a plus but the bathroom wasn t 100 clean Rooms aren t soundproof Lots of street noise That in addition to the fact that it s hard to keep daylight out with the curtains they have chosen makes the place ok for leisure if you don t need to have a real good sleep perhaps but I wouldn t recommend it for business trips , Good location very central Friendly and helpful staff Spacious room s with large windows or a small balcony but rooms are not soundproof Fast internet connection 
314393,Petit Palace Museum, Breakfast was very average considering price of the hotel and 14 Euros per head Extremely unhappy to have to pay for children s breakfast when hotel do not charge for it if you book direct, Excellent location near Place de Catalunya so easy to get to all parts of the city Spacious room and great hot tub
314394,Petit Palace Museum, No body is there to help you take your loggage when you check in and check out No boiler and free coffee station as i used to see in all 4 stars hotels i visited , Staff specially sara were so nice Always smiling and helpfull Location is near to everything

314396,Petit Palace Museum, Unfriendly staff with little knowledge about booking tickets for the main attractions The gym had a handful of machines none fully functioning Disappointing for the cost , Good location 
314397,Petit Palace Museum, Quality of food at breakfast was poor stale bread rolls sweaty cheese unappetising meats , Wonderful location Friendly receptionist Nuno Funky decor 
314398,Petit Palace Museum,No Negative, The location was brilliant Slightly out of the buzz but that is what we liked as it was only a short walk We asked for a room at the back of the hotel so as it was more quiet and they accepted our request What can we say about the shower bathroom apart from luxury The shower was big enough for about 4 people The staff were very helpful and told us the directions to the main tourist places Absolutely fantastic hotel would definitely come back 
314399,Petit Palace Museum, The room was average The curtains in the room were torn the carpet in the bedroom was ripped the study desk was damaged and chipped and the room chair was breaking Even though the hotel is trying to project a chic and morden look some of the quality of furniture and appolstrary used is quiet cheap and not maintained We got to the hotel at 12 30 in the night and the check in was fine but there was no one to take our bags to our room There was only one person managing the property in the night The room is not baby friendly Alof of sharp edges on furniture , Location was convenient The staff was friendly Alex particularly was very nice and helpful in promptly assisting us
