430983,The College Hotel, A small problem caused by unexperienced staff at breakfast was professionaly overcome next day Otherwise all smooth but expensive , An old building very nicely renovated and decorated like an historical stage Location is very close to city centre near Concertgebouw and museum district Rooms are spacey and very comfortable 
430984,The College Hotel, There were many faults in the room itself Poor lighting bedside lamps didn t work They didn t replace our coffee milk cups water etc, The breakfasts were good The hotel location is excellent and the staff were very pleasant 
430985,The College Hotel, The staff were rather inefficient for the quality and price of the hotel e g forgot to restock the room tea coffee more than once and forgot to order a taxi Although the food in the restaurant was very good quality it was overpriced and the service was extremely slow , Very friendly staff Very nice hotel well situated for the museums in a nice area Lots of good restaurants within easy walking distance Very nice breakfast Comfy bed nice well stocked bathroom 
430986,The College Hotel, The lack of detail i e Room not cleaned before 3 00 pm miscommunication as to dervices to room chackout with broken creditcard machine 2 , Location
430987,The College Hotel, No built in airconditioning only portable music playing late at night on terrace below my room while terrace was empty , Atmosphere friendly helpful staff nice spacious room 
430988,The College Hotel, as above, All very good Only problem we had planned our day around eating at the hotel in the evening The wedding event meant that the restaurant was closed to guests that night It would help to put a notice for people if this is the case so that they can plan accordingly After being out all day we had really wanted to relax and eat at the hotel that night The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel is relaxing and the stylish environment and ambience are fab 
430989,The College Hotel, On thing which was very annoying was the light system As you turned one off others would come the other way round Not much tea milk but on requesting more it was supplied with a smile , Beds were comfy Good location Staff very helpful polite 
430990,The College Hotel, The rooms need maintaining peeling paintwork peeling plaster torn window blinds and broken air conditioning system House keeping could improve their services by checking that all items are in the room such as a shower curtain for the bath refreshments and crockery to drink them with Luggage racks for suitcases would also be nice , Comfortable bed clean hotel great location fantastic staff and customer services Our first room had a host of problems which couldn t be resolved quickly so the staff gave us a new room immediately which was a lot better They dealt with the matter efficiently effectively and with a lot of care and attention They were really helpful with advice on how to get around the city and other daily touristic queries 10 10 for the staff training as they are a credit to the hotel and a huge jewel in the crown 
430991,The College Hotel, The bathroom toilet arrangement in my room 217 was a little tight one almost had to slide onto the toilet seat , Comfortable beds welcoming staff 
430992,The College Hotel, During breakfast EVERY morning there is floor cleaning wet or with vaccum cleaner So with breakfast you will get dust as well 1st room which was given to us was small and with small window by ceiling like wardrobe Dare to ask for better room In both rooms some light bulbs was burned out , Great and ellegantly served breakfast beautiful and safe location museum area residential area 
430993,The College Hotel, We booked two twin rooms as we were four family members However we were given two double bedrooms also one room was being refurbished and the window was taken out during our stay in the room We were not advised this would happen , Beautifil building and good accomodation
430994,The College Hotel, Upon arrival the staff mentioned there wasn t much to do aside from the museums and park to the north of the hotel Everything else was in Centraal However De Pijp a mere 5 to 10 minute walk ended up being great Due to the staffs suggestion we didn t end up exploring the area until later on in our visit Very minor gripe but add De Pijp to your recommended neighborhoods , Excellent service and cleanliness 
430995,The College Hotel, The sink was in a cupboard and the shower was either lookwarm or scalding as the lever wouldn t hold in the preferred place , The location of the hotel was great so close to the tram stop but away from the hustle and bustle of the centre of Amsterdam The bed was extremely comfortable 
430996,The College Hotel, The room left open while we are away and come back Should not happened for the 4 stars hotel The maid forgot to close the door while they were cleaning the room what a surprised ,No Positive
430997,The College Hotel, Read my other reviews which many people have I always look for the positive and give the benefit of the doubt However I must warn you NOT TO BOOK this hotel We booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary and stayed on 6th April to 9th April 2017 Arrived at 10 00 registered and booked in luggage Came back at 15 00 as agreed to be told there was a mistake with our room we had been allocated 117 when we registered in the morning At 17 00 we were shown to our room 123 we found out that there was a housekeeping issue no one told us or kept us up to date or offered any refreshment while we waited We went to the terrace and a had a drink nice staff great drinks we booked in the restaurant for 19 30 and were told that we would be given a free drink for our room cleaning problem Arrived in restaurant at 19 30 nice waiter engaged us in conversation only to be removed from our table physically removed by a man in a white suit and bow tie who then allocated someone else to take our order 45 minutes later after asking on a number of occasions our drinks had still not arrived and there was no sign of any food not even bread for the table At 20 30 we complained and left we still had not had a drink and there was still no food The following evening we sat outside ordered a drink and again waited for 45 minutes Decided to not eat in the restaurant but ordered room service instead which was ok The room was tired with the shower door off its hinges and more importantly the electics where dangerous two bathroom lights on the mirror did not work and on closer inspection had burnt out and where loos in the fitting All lamps in the room where unplugged and when we plugged them in plugs ejected across the room with sparks flying We paid in total just over 900 euros for two nights with food and drinks I feel completely ripped off I am so angry that I paid them money and they couldn t offer me a basic service and a bit of civility , do not book this hotel and restaurant 
430998,The College Hotel, Despite informing the staff that many things were not in order nothing happened The bathroom light was broken the sink did not empty easily there was no shower door Upon complaining about this during checkout the manager confirmed that she would make things right however unto today I have received no communication from anybody A pity that such a nice hotel was such a disappointment ,No Positive
430999,The College Hotel, Wifi connection very poor, Wonderful staff willing to help and do their best for the customer Beautiful hotel beautiful room very comfortable room and bed Will come back however wifi is very poor so it was hard to get work done 
431000,The College Hotel, The room wasn t cleaned properly black clumps of hair in the shower drain from presumably the previous guest Hotel staff were apologetic and sorted the problem once we explained , Interesting architecture the room had character we had a chaise lounge in the room huge ceilings Colourful psychedelic chocolates 
431001,The College Hotel,No Negative, What a beautiful hotel The beds are very comfortable the pillows are amazing Excellent service and facilities always a truly enjoyable experience Location is perfect for exploring different areas of the city especially de Pijp with its lovely atmosphere A short walk away from Museumplein but also right next to tram stops if you prefer taking public transport Plenty of caf s and restaurants around representing all types of different cuisines Was upgraded to a more luxurious room during my last visit and really enjoyed the additional amenities Will definitely keep returning 
431002,The College Hotel, The breakfast for 19 was however really not impressive A standard normal bread and youghurt and three pieces of ham but other than that very boring for a hotel breakfast , Absolutely fantastic welcome and service It s rare to come across such warm people such an incredible venue for a very reasonable price I have found a home away from home Amsterdam you will see me again soon 
431003,The College Hotel, The rooms were incredibly hot We asked to have our A C fixed and the response was initially to open a window Then they moved our room but it was still hot The rooms look nice but are a little run down in person The staff is nice but are clearly mostly students they could not answer some basic questions though that may be a language issue so we can t blame them for that We were asked to check out two days early because they had something wrong in their system but then did not apologize when I brought the error to their attention The food in the hotel is also over priced , The location was really good Easy access to multiple tram lines one stop from most of the museums Nice people manning the desks Free mini bar though no alcohol in the deluxe room was a nice touch I would say still a good value for the price in Amsterdam 
431004,The College Hotel, Lighting in the sleeping room was very dim brighter bulbs would help We asked and was told that it is s boutique hotel and that s how they want it , The building was beautiful the bed was very comfortable and the closet space was great The restaurant lounge was very comfortable and the food excellent Restauramt prices were very reasonable Staff was very attentive
431005,The College Hotel, The decor around the windows various areas were a little shabby , The room was very well appointed with lovely bedding decor Overall the hotel was very comfortable well presented to a high standard the food is very good Overall the staff were very attentitive friendly e g Natalia Jason 
431006,The College Hotel, The lighting in the room is terrible They need some more uplighters at a very minimum And the wifi wasn t great , Love the building the decor and the staff 
431007,The College Hotel, When I checked in I was told that 5 percent of the staff are trainees In general I was not happy with the service because it was not efficient and professional , The beautiful hotel is situated at an excellent location 
431008,The College Hotel,No Negative, Excellent young staff who were all training went above and beyond to make us happy Very relaxed feel to the hotel which was a stunning building good location 5 min walk from museums but a good 25 min fast walk to the Center
431009,The College Hotel, There was no overhead lights in the room just well placed spotlights modd lighting which is great for atmosphere but not ideal for applying your make up , The decor of the hotel is beautiful the location is great close to the museums and the staff are very helpful 
431010,The College Hotel, Very poor internet needs reworking rooms a bit gloomy and dark real old lighting that needs a makeover Heating in room inadequate I was cold at night , Excellent location friendly staff Big room Good breakfast
431011,The College Hotel, Room was very small We booked a superior room It had a sloping roof in the shower which meant you could only stand at one side The wash hand basin was part of the wardrobe furniture and was in the bedroom area which we did not like This should be in the bathroom area , Location and style of hotel
431012,The College Hotel, Staff very friendly and helpful but requests not always delivered on as promised We wanted some additional teabags they weren t available from reception so we were advised they would be brought to our room They did arrive but not until the next day Not a big deal but we did miss our cuppas , Cosy characterful room Beautiful building The location is great for the museums the trams on the doorstep can take you right to the centre and the road away from the hotel is choc a bloc with great restaurants 
431013,The College Hotel,No Negative, This hotel well located for seeing the main museums in Amsterdam which are within easy walking distance It is very near to a tram stop thus easy to get to the train station The rooms are stylishly decorated though they are not brightly lit if that is important for you The staff were excellently quickly putting right the minor issues we had with our room We didn t try the restaurant but the cocktails in the bar were pretty good 
431014,The College Hotel, Very expensive for what it is Not great value for money Small rooms and you wouldn t have breakfast or dinner as it s over priced 19 50 for breakfast when there are so many good places a short walk away Very basic rooms for 199 a night with no breakfast or meal and no facilities , Comfy beds and nice and quiet and away from the bustle but close enough to walk into the centre or get the tram 
431015,The College Hotel, Not enough coffee and water in the room The Bar closed on the Sunday night at 11 and we was not ready to go to bed but could not purchase another drink The staff seemed very disorganised And the location was far out ,No Positive
431016,The College Hotel, the photo on booking shows a room with a window The 2 rooms I was shown each had a tiny window that was at a height that was above eye level like in a basement ,No Positive
431017,The College Hotel, Was a bit disappointed we had booked dinner and not in the main restaurant but were put in a small dining room with no atmosphere as there was a function going on that night , Loved the hotel Lovely rooms great location and good food
431018,The College Hotel, There was nothing to not like from having flowers in the room a complimentary transit pass to lively bar and dinner settings Most lovely , Lovely small hotel with a terrific and accommodating staff 
431019,The College Hotel, Room 123 was a little dark wifi was poor in the room and the room door was difficult to lock but other than that fantastic , Good Location 45 minute walk to centre of Amsterdam but tram number 5 outside the hotel takes you into the centre Friendly staff comfy clean and stylish rooms
431020,The College Hotel, The in room lighting There are lamps but no overhead light the lamps are not terribly bright and just provide a puddle of light so it s not possible to see to do anything much in the room of an evening , Big room beautifully furnished well heated and the added bonus of a bathtub The location is fantastic and so are the bar and restaurant 
431021,The College Hotel, Room was poor quality no dressing gowns or slippers No windows to open thus room was very airless Did not like the wash hand being in a cupboard in bedroom Shower placed against sloping wall thus could not stand up straight Breakfast was poor lack of waiting staff items ran out and took long time to be replaced Promised grea things but failed to deliver, Location was good for museum district
431022,The College Hotel, the staff are mostly students and don t seem to have enough supervision Both checking in and out took a long time and wasn t a simple process , the hotel is beautifully designed and feels very glamorous
431023,The College Hotel, Thought the Champagne price was quite steep , Liked the can do attitude of the staff Thought the food was excellent and well presented Very imaginative decor and love the ladies room 
431024,The College Hotel, No internal air conditioning in the middle of a 31 degree heatwave We were provided with a portable one in our room but it was unable to cope in cooling the room down and we spent an uncomfortable couple of nights, A beautiful hotel modern quiet central to the tram line friendly extremely helpful staff excellent restaurant
431025,The College Hotel, We were not impressed by the restaurant , Very nice and comfortable room which gave an oldfashioned impression No place at all to place your luggage Friendly and very helpful staff 
431026,The College Hotel, Minibar was empty water heater was not working House keeping has to be improved Last two days all towels were changed but sheets were not , Architecture of the hotel was remarkable Staff were great even most of them were at student and learner level Also hotel had a perfect location few tram stops to popular places like museumplein leidsplein dam square etc 
431027,The College Hotel, The headboard leans forward so much that it is impossible to sit on the bed and read or watch TV because it is uncomfortable A note explaining the how the lights work would be useful The staff who make the bills do not check them before they are given to customers My bill and my friend s bill were several hundred Euros too much At breakfast we were asked three or four times what our room number was Coffees that we did not order or drink were charged to our room I was told our room was excluded for breakfast even though I had ordered breakfast So I had to sign a form in the middle of breakfast When I got the bill it included two breakfasts for that morning i e the breakfast I ordered at reception and the breakfast I signed for during breakfast I appreciate that the young students are learning their profession so I blame the system and the poor supervision that they have to work under , The bed was comfortable The food was very good Hotel and especially the flowers were very attractive 
431028,The College Hotel, In the bathroom there was significant lime scale on taps and tiles and it all just looked tired and worn would have benefitted enormously from a really good scrub The food in the restaurant was average at best , My actual room was lovely very spacious lovely big windows gorgeous beams but my bathroom needed attention The location is great you can walk to everything if you want or take the tram from almost right out the front and there are lots of lovely restaurants and cafes close by Staff are friendly and want to provide good service 
431029,The College Hotel, Need a bell service Near impossible to push luggage trolley down the hall or fit it in the elevator There was no dedicated bell staff, Great location and facilities
431030,The College Hotel, The staff could be a little more hip and trendy They didn t explain anything about the hotel or facilities but rather just checked me in and gave me a key The hotel should have a gym Also since it s an old college they could have some trendy libraries or chill out areas Also the lobby bathrooms use Rituals products but they don t use the same great product in the rooms For that price and luxury I would expect more It looks like it was going for a cool trendy upscale hipster hotel but missed it It was a little too snooty than cool Also the WIFI was horrible, Beautiful old college renovated into a beautiful hotel Reminded me of Harry Potter The hotel was very clean Rooms are big and stylish 
431031,The College Hotel, No robe slippers mini bar games or pay per view TV as stated on booking We discussed this with the hotel on check out and they said it was not their fault but Booking com problem The pillows on the bed were horrendously uncomfortable and we were stuck away in what felt like a broom cupboard not a superior room , It was very quiet at night Building itself was really pretty 
431032,The College Hotel, Some work needed in the room some things were broken and looked slightly scruffy , Bedroom was very nice Bathroom was even nicer Nice extra touches from the staff at the hotel Rather expensive for the overall experience 
431033,The College Hotel, It would be a perfect 10 if the hotel was also on a canal but even so it is well situated and close to the museums tram and center, Loved the facilities the rooms the cool conversion of the building and the very friendly staff
431034,The College Hotel, I like good aircon and requested fans to improve air flow Lighting in the bathroom was subtle but really brighter is better for making up , Breakfast cost a lot but offered a huge choice and was delicious Staff were very accommodating and obviously love the historic building We were attending a wedding in the hotel which was beautifully catered 
431035,The College Hotel, This hotel is not at the cheaper end but when asked to have a later check out for a few hours they would only do so with an addtional charge which is really poor service compared to other hotels we have stayed in which are on the same level The rooms are dark and really lack natural light and we could do no more than the 4 nights as it s too oppressive with very poor light in the bathroom and minimal natural light in the main bedroom , The staff are super friendly and the hotel is very beautiful
431036,The College Hotel, As I eat only muesli n fruit or croissant 20 euros was too expensive I went out each morning for breakfast Light switches in room could work better I reported 2 problems Not addressed during my 4 night stay ,No Positive
431037,The College Hotel, Room on 2nd floor a little dark Window too high to afford a view , A welcoming boutique hotel with friendly student staff Ideally situated for museums restaurants etc Tram stop close by 
431038,The College Hotel, first night we had a free upgrade in a suite and the mini bar for free problem room 206 has no windows to open and the air conditioner did t work well two fans brought by the reception did t help a lot So was it really an upgrade But second night was wonderful I t a great place on sunny days don t choose a room under the roof just to be sure ,No Positive
431039,The College Hotel, The hotel does not accept 500 face value Euro and they do not notice it to their customers 500 face value Euro is legal tender why cannot be accepted in the hotel , Service is good Environment is very good 
431040,The College Hotel, The coffee did not get refreshed in our rooms each day Certain female staff were rude The lift broke down and myself and three friends were trapped for half an hour Male staff very helpful female staff vocal about us being over weight for the lift Upsetting and embarrassing , The overall aesthetics were lovely and the staff were mostly polite and very courteous Managers very good 
431041,The College Hotel, We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and had a junior suite at the terrace side Upon a late arrival in the evening we were left in a room which was clearly not a junior suite and where the airconditioning was clearly not working After having switched the room to a category which we had booked the extra bed fr our son I had ordered in advance was not present on the positive side the a c was working here however we heard much noice A studentparty was booked for the evening of our arrival the noice of the music and people talking loud outside on the terrace was unbearable until the party was over at 02 00 in the night The windows have no isolation single glass and as such all noise was clearly to be heard in the room It was also necessary to chase away a couple from the second floor who were looking for some privacy just outside the door of our room and who were clearly not hotelguests The beds were not properly sheeted which the housekeeping corrected the following day the wastebin in the bathroom was not cleared from the previous guest and the room was not cleaned during one day of our stay despite the sign please service the room Once the issues were addressed the staff worked well to correct this and offered a discount of 20 for the first night and free stay for our son Nevertheless even if the philosophy of the hotel is to train promising students for the work in hotels the processes and guidance by trained staff must be improved , We liked the design of the hotel and breakfast in the morning which was included in our stay 
431042,The College Hotel, The bathroom sink was partially blocked and it took 2 days to get it repaired The breakfasts though good were expensive Not being big eaters in the morning we settled to eat breakfast out which was cheaper and as good , convenient for all the trams and good local restaurants Lovely room with all the facilities you might need 
431043,The College Hotel, Dodgy wifi and you need a separate password for each device plus you need to connect again each time you leave the room and come back, Great hotel fantastic comfort especially when you snatch a good deal on booking com
431044,The College Hotel, The room is a little dark Perhaps add one or two more lampshades in the room to brighten it up , The room is very spacious and tastefully decorated The lounge and the restaurant too have nice decor with comfortable and beautifully upholstered colorful chairs The location is very near the museumplein All within walking distance Staff are young and friendly 
431045,The College Hotel, Can be a little noisy outside by traffic which means you get a wake up call at 8am but you do get to explore the city early , Great location was a lovely walk to everything The staff couldnt of been more helpful sorting out our Icebar booking when we arrived Room was gorgeous and the bath well it was the one of the nicest baths I have been in My friend is going to Amsterdam in July and I have got her booking this hotel as well If when we return I would be staying here again Thank you for a wonderful stay 
431046,The College Hotel, Watch the handles on some of the room doors When you close them going out you need to watch where you put your fingers otherwise they may get trapped between the door and the frame Mine nearly did but I realised just in time , The breakfast was good The room was excellent and the staff most helpful 
431047,The College Hotel, A small grumble but they were a little slow to re stock coffee tea making items even though we asked two days in a row, Fantastic hotel near to the heart of Amsterdam great quality styling throughout lovely reception bar areas Bedroom was modern with nice finishings a big comfy bed 
431048,The College Hotel, The fact that the first thing we were told was that they were going to withhold 50 euro person night on top of the cost per night for the room thus they withheld 300 euro for us for the 3 nights we had booked on top of the cost for the room We felt that we were immediately suspected of walking away with half the room When we then asked for an extra key we were told that we had to pay 60euro for the second key as a deposit NOt very welcoming , Great location close to museum and a relatively quiet part of the city with tram stops right outside the hotel Nice size of the room and very clean The staff was very helpful 
431049,The College Hotel, The interiors are starting to get a little jaded and could do with a fresh coat soon , Staff was professional and friendly Very easy check in check out Good size room for central Amsterdam and very comfy bed 
431050,The College Hotel,No Negative, Staff were excellent very helpful Room was lovely clean big and comfortable Location was good as there is a tram stop directly outside the hotel that goes to central station 
431051,The College Hotel,No Negative, Stayed in a Deluxe room 101 and wasn t disappointed Room was gorgeous and incredibly spacious bathroom was beautiful Booked for a 30th birthday surprise and the staff had left a bottle of wine and birthday message which was a lovely gesture About a 20 minute walk into Dam square and close to Van Gogh and other museums Would definitely return enjoyed every minute 
431052,The College Hotel, Obviously due to many of the staff being students the service was at times less than you would expect from a 4 star hotel but they were all friendly and did their best , A really beautiful building well restored friendly staff Great concept also for those looking for a career in hospitality I loved my stay 
431053,The College Hotel, Trying to order room service was a nightmare People not answering phones and getting passed around the teams without anyone actually wanting to take responsibility , They were good to me on my birthday and booked a restaurant on behalf of my girlfriend 
431054,The College Hotel, The rooms are a little dark there seemed to be a lack of main lights in the center of the rooms Don t let that put you off Also there was some mistake with our room service but overall a great hotel , It s in a great location right by the tram stop that takes you to Central Station but outside of the crazyness The trams go every few mins The hotel is beautiful and the staff are really helpful 
431055,The College Hotel, The concept of training young people is excellent however there can be small glitches in communications when seasoned travelers meet slightly timid staff , Very comfortable rooms and well appointed 
431056,The College Hotel, staff very slow and not so pro active very expensive breakfast noisy rooms, interior and decoration of the hotel and room the high ceilings in the room quality of the furniture coffee maker in the room nice toiletries Great location
431057,The College Hotel, The check in a bit clumsy The room in the attic small especially the bathroom which is hardly a room The bed seems rather old and is not up to standard and price we pay for the room A high window and no view , The breakfast was very good friendly and attentive service The bar and restaurant are cosy and are nicely decorated 
431058,The College Hotel, Got sweets as return guest to make me feel special but when I asked for a late checkout due to a business call they wanted to charge me a big hourly fee Really wrong priority almost never encounter this kind of rigidity,No Positive
431059,The College Hotel, Staff were very friendly and helpful but some of the local knowledge recommendations weren t great but that could have been down to being lost in translation the phone in our room didn t work but that didn t really affect us , The Hotel was stunning beautifully maintained and in a great part of Amsterdam surrounded in late night quality Brasserie s and only a short 10 15 min walk to the museums 
431060,The College Hotel, It wasn t clear when booking that twin room actually means double bed with two single mattresses We were two friends travelling and it wasn t too much of a problem but this isn t made clear Also the bathroom door is a little stiff and doesn t really close properly hence no privacy , The location of the hotel was perfect for us as there were a lot of nice eateries in the area 
431061,The College Hotel, The college hotel is a brand that has a teaching element within it s staffing structure they have a lot of Young professionals who are learning the job within the hotel supported by Professionals who are more experienced This is fine as a concept but I felt the balance of untrained to trained staff wasn t good enough it felt like the place as being run all by the untrained staff at some times with no visible experienced staff around The untrained staff weren t awful by any stretch of the imagination they were generally really good however I felt that compared to the setting within the hotel and the general excellent quality of the rooms etc the service didn t meet the same standard It felt frustrating at times The breakfast was good however you have to order anything that you want hot eggs bacon etc I didn t like this set up because I often found myself waiting for the food to be delivered when I was pushed for time and often it wasn t super quick Twice I had to leave before the food turned up because I was pushed for time , The decoration and atmosphere were really excellent A unique setting for a hotel and very well executed interiors sympathetic to the original building The food was generally of an excellent quality The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was specified to a high standard It felt very luxurious in the rooms and all around the hotel
