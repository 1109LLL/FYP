130160,Le Roch Hotel Spa, Specific room had an uncomfortable layout separating toilets from bathroom The bath had poor design causing the bathroom floor to get flooded with every shower Amenities like shampoo were not restocked for 3 days , Great location for lots of nearby attractions and restaurants and easy metro access for the rest of Paris Very quiet for its central location 
130161,Le Roch Hotel Spa, The shower is combined with the bathtub which made it inconvenient AKA Water spilage , Hotel is super modern and has a nice young vibe Staff was super friendly and helpful The hotel is also only a short walk from the Tuileries Garden around 2 blocks which was nice I could take a walk in the garden every morning and evening just to enjoy the beautiful weather 
130162,Le Roch Hotel Spa, Nothing everything was sensational , Excellent staff Fantastic location Amazing boutique hotel Awesome facilities Loved every single moment and can t wait to return

130167,Le Roch Hotel Spa, The breakfast buffet was good but not at the same level of other 5 in terms of choices The in room dining cart is poor and the food served was not well presented and was lacking some standard items extra olive oil or vinegar no additional salt etc , The design is wonderful The staff is very helpful and competent The location is great Rooms are clean and fairly spacious 
130168,Le Roch Hotel Spa, The reception charged for a coke from the minibar even though it had not been consumed They refused to remove it from the bill Very stupid of them when we had spent 3000 euro on our stay I didn t have time to argue with them over 8 euros , The location The pool 
130169,Le Roch Hotel Spa, The lobby and lounge area was a tad bit dark during the day A bit more light would have been friendly The spa was a bit dissapointing I somehow expected more of it There was no chill area except for a bench A pity , Loved the design of the hotel It s so stylish The staff were really friendly especially at the front desk 
130170,Le Roch Hotel Spa, The room albeit nice it was a bit small , Staff made all the differences Every member of the staff were friendly helpful and made us feel so welcomed Everyone greeted you anytime they see you They were all so well trained and above all sincere in offering good service Even arriving at 7am they gave us the room without is having to ask for the favou as check in time was at 3pm The room had all the 5 star amenities new fluffy towels slippers and it was flawless 
130171,Le Roch Hotel Spa, Leaving the place And it is not unique to this place but maybe hotels should start thinking to offer a better coffee than Nespresso capsules , Literally EVERYTHING from the staff kindness and professionalism the room the swimming pool 
130172,Le Roch Hotel Spa, to enter the spa I had to go through the main restaurant area in my bathrobe but this is just a temporary situation , This hotel is a little jewel and on top with an amazing location I loved the interior design also the right type of music not too loud a quiet street at night Lovely and very welcoming staff The pool is a highlight
