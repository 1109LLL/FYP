448298,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Room with balcony but no view odd , Club lounge was good maybe marginally old fashioned but the more I visited the more comfortable I felt the sky bar was very good a must 
448299,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, In room Wifi was expensive, Staff and concierge were very friendly knowledgeable and helpful Location was great Rooms were very comfortable Rooftop bar was fantastic 
448300,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, The taxi back to the airport which was waiting for customers in front of the hotel and was not pre booked charged us 10 euros more than the one we took from the airport It did not have a meter , The Ritz Carlton is a Beautiful hotel with excellent efficient and friendly staff perfectly positioned for going around the sites and with an underground round the corner with a direct line to the castle of Shonbrunn Lovely room and bathroom Very comfortable beds Delicious and generous breakfast We would definitely go back 
448301,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Everything is perfect I have no remarks Thanks for everything , Fabulous hotel Excellent service by staff The hotel is furnished in style luxurious The location is great The restaurant is incredible and the spa offers everything to relax 
448302,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Several flights of stairs on the way to the room which is uncomfortable when carrying luggage Not enough coffee packets in the room Very expensive but disappointing breakfast buffet, Large comfortable room with large comfortable bed Cleaning staff visits several times per day
448303,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Speed of free internet is low you may buy faster connection for additional price Breakfast costs 36 selection is limited Majority of the items are on menu which makes it longer to order Credit card was double charged at check in, Very attentive personnel Good location Rooms are spacious and comfortable Food in the restaurant is delicious
448304,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, A little bit of enthusiastic help from Simon the head concierge would be appreciated , The Club Lounge it may cost a little more but definitely worth it 
448305,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, The general manager threatened me about reviewing the estsblishment on trip advisor wrong room given all meals were sent back at least once staff rude just don t stay here Vienna is beautiful this hotel is trading on a name it cannot live up to , It was appalling
448306,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Couldn t get into breakfast our first morning as it was so crowded but staff took this on board and the next morning it was better organised so thank you , Beautiful bed linen Wonderful sized room and bathroom 
448307,The Ritz Carlton Vienna,No Negative, If you want luxury look no further The Ritz Carlton delivers at every level and the staff are the most polite courteous friendly people you are ever likely to meet and they always seem pleased to see you Perfect location excellent facilities situated in the most beautiful city 
448308,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, No English movie channels No hot tub in the spa Pool jets had to be controlled by front desk which was embarrassing to keep asking but the staff didn t make a big deal of it Free Wifi is not fast enough to stream movies from your ipad you have to upgrade to payable Wifi which is cheeky for a hotel of this standard , Staff are extremely attentive throughout the hotel and can t do enough for you The D bar is fantastic Great atmosphere feels like a cool New York bar Can get quite smoky later on in the evening as lots of people smoking cigars and cigarettes Try the Ritz Cocktail it s a treat 
448309,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Absolutely nothing, Took my fianc e to Vienna for a big birthday The Ritz Carlton is class personified and so central to all the main attractions A hotel that actually lives up to its rating I couldn t fault a single thing Even had a free room upgrade Room pool cocktail bar and restaurant all excellent Paid for a club room the exclusive club lounge provided light meals during the day if needed including breakfast It s obviously not cheap to stay here but with a discount it was very good value and I fully recommend 
448310,The Ritz Carlton Vienna,No Negative, Staff who ran club room were very attentive a special thanks to Elizabeth who was very friendly and made us feel very welcome we would definitely stay there on next visir I
448311,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, My only slight issue was that the hotel bar allowed smoking , Staff very helpful Loved the roof top bar Great Breakfast Fabulous in house bar The bed was very comfortable 
448312,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, I booked a romantic weekend with my wife for 2 nights First they got us a room with 2 beds despite my request on king size and the double beds are very small Then they had us wait 1 hour despite being 4pm already to move us to a terribly small room with awful view but king bed I requested again a better one We saw the new room which looked nicer but we waited in front of it for 20min to wait for keyes Eventually I went to get them myself Once in the room we realized this was a handicap room which ruined our totally We had to go to the opera so I didn t request another move I went down to express my disapointment with someone more senior and a lady Stephanie helped out and told me she will move us to a better room but tomorrow as they are fully booked She was very kind but that was about the only positive thing about this hotel Once we were back we had a hand written note with a very bad bottle of wine The next day we did get our room which we were supposed to but I must say the interior is very tasteless The hotel looks as it has only 4 stories but that is for the facade In the back they made 2 3 extra floors and the result is small and low rooms I could literally touch the ceiling We found out from friends that this used to be Mandarin Oriental and you can see they saved on renovation and the interior is a tasteless lack of concept worst than airport Hilton hotel not worth the 300 eur a night I don t recommend , Location
448313,The Ritz Carlton Vienna,No Negative, Room was quite big and beds very comfortable Good breakfast Excellent and very pleasant staff they satisfied all our requirements for our baby s food 
448314,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, The original scent of RC was changed , We enjoyed the room tremendously and the beds were fabulous Room service was good but you might get more for your money at breakfast at the buffet
448315,The Ritz Carlton Vienna,No Negative, The staff was extremely helpful and friendly The concierge team Simon provided us with valuable information that made our stay in Vienna so memorable The location is perfect and is walking distance to important attractions 
448316,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Hard to move with a stroller as there are stairs in the reception even though there is a special small elevator for disabled to move to reception from the main entrance but it is inconvenient and slow also there are 2 stairs before our room which we had difficult time to deal with The price is little bit higher than expected The suite we stayed in does not have a separate living room with proper door especially when you have kids sleeping in the living room You can not lock the toilet door it is a normal sliding door , Staff is very friendly and welcoming both concierge and reception staff were very professional and helpful Hotel facility and decoration is very good and looks new Spacious suite and bathroom you always have complementary sweets and water in the reception area which I really liked especially when you have kids We loved our stay in this hotel and we will definitely come back to it 
448317,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Our room door 618 was not working proparly every day i complain about it for 3 days Also they capture an amount of money upon i reserve the room then they had 2 cancelled transaction then upon the check out they had a third transaction , I like the staff atitude They were super nice
448318,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Lack of sufficient amenities in the bathroom such as cotton swab or toothpaste Which are offered even in a business class flight these days and in most hotels as a standard service The room itself is comfortable although not bery well groomed as you might expect from R Carlton Designe is very basic and monotone at least in the room where I stayed Guestures such as a fruit plate at arrival or a spray of fresh flower or a small chocolate box would be nice , Staff were well trained and very affable both at front office and entrance It is an absolutely clean hotel as is expected Super comfortable bed and pillows
448319,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, We did not care for our initial room assignment We paid extra and liked our room but that took extra time and effort at check in after a long journey even though we had specifically written ahead to request a certain room and we are Ritz Rewards members , Great location concierge Phillippe suggested good restaurants located nearby 
448320,The Ritz Carlton Vienna,No Negative, The steakhouse Distrkt was amazing Best steaks ever Side dishes delicious Friendly staff Warm birthday wishes for my husband and they even sang happy birthday 
448321,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, The complicated organization of the hotel corridor sometimes makes it difficult for us to find our rooms when returning back to the hotel , Fascinating decoration suitable organizations describes this hotel 
448322,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Very poor wifi We had better wifi in a remote location in Croatia than in the center of the city at the Ritz in Vienna This was very disappointing , Service was excellent food was also superb
448323,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, We were excluded from the top floor outside terrace bar on our second night and when returning to the hotel for a nightcap there was nowhere for us to go made a fuss and we were taken to a table in the restaurant Why they didn t just send us up to the members club lounge I don t know The public areas were private function and the cigar bar had no appeal the roof terrace was closed Five Star hotel with nowhere to go On the plus side when checking out all our drinks had been given free of charge after making some valid comments to the Duty Manager , Rooms good bed linen top class and bed very comfortable good bathroom
448324,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Not worth for the price interior of this hotel is more like 3 star bussiness hotel doesn t give luxury atmosphere specially at the lobby area also for the room interior was not that great as I said like a normal business hotel room, breakfast staff are very friendly Very comfortable bed
448325,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Housekeeping was hit or miss First day my very obvious dirty towels were spread out on the counter and all my cosmetics had been moved onto them Another day my cosmetic bag which was hanging on a hook had been zipped up causing my products to leak There wasn t even a need for this to be touched as it wasn t in the way of cleaning It was very disconcerting , The beautiful marble tub Location club lounge and the stellar staff that works up there 
448326,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, The roof bar bad service was bad The waitress forgot our drinks and only came 30 mins later to say she forgot It s ok to forget but if we are only a handful of tables what s there to forget , Simply put perfection Hotel is amazing and staff is generally very attentive Surprised with a nice piece of cake and a bottle of bubbly for our anniversary The bed is exceptionally comfortable All in all the prefect hotel
448327,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Compared for instance to NYC Tokyo and Osaka RC the service was technically ok but occasionally not warm and welcome Our room was small Kempinski in Vienna is A LOT better , Cleanliness 
448328,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Children up to 4 are free to stay with their family It should be up to 12 as most of the hotels do The breakfast could be better English kids TV chancel could be a plus , The bed is extra comfy The decore is nice and hotel aminities are new and well kept The staff are very freindly and the check in was very easy quick and around 11 00 before the regular check in times Chocolates and detox water were in the reception for the guests I stayed in a primium room which was 49 m2 and that is realy good space 
448329,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Front door staff sent me in a taxi to the wrong location but that can happen to anyone anywhere , Gwendolyn and Lisa and Benjamin in club lounge outstanding They helped me find a fantastic Austrian restaurant in flieschmarket 11 
448330,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Only slight gripe was that the D bar was also a cigar bar so too smoky to sit in later in the evening So we ended up in another hotel bar nearby on the Saturday night as we wanted more of a bar atmosphere rather than the hotel lounge, The staff were incredibly pleasant and helpful The pool was a sufficient length to actually swim properly Concierge service especially excellent in suggesting itinerary restaurants etc The bedroom was very well appointed and fab shower Ate in the Dstrikt restaurant on first night and that was lovely too Maitre d spoke very good and witty English 
448331,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, The decoration and lighting of the breakfast lounge is somewhat gloomy Especially the paintings on the wall evoke sadness A cheerful and brighter atmosphere would have been better to start the day , Large comfortable rooms with high ceilings and daylight High quality service offered by attentive and friendly staff Beautiful indoor pool with underwater music and lighting Breakfast buffet with a large selection of delicious beverages and food 
448332,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, If we didn t have access to club lounge I would have been disappointed with bar lounge which appeared to be cordoned off for a private party every day Nowhere to have a coffee , Club room was expensive but soo nice Loved the quiet lounge with food and drink all day Staff were wonderful 
448333,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, The suite sitting room smelt stale as if used by a smoker The furnishings were very basic corporate business style and not what we expected A large sitting room of empty space Terrible carpet wall colour grey and felt like an extended stay apartment not the feel of luxury , We liked the quiet bedroom no disturbance and very comfortable bed 
448334,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Nothing, Outstanding service particularly Mr Phillipp Voight and the rest of the concierge staff The private day tour to Sakzburg was priceless Surprise chocolate treats added to our experience being in Ritz 
448335,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, While the service was generally attentive it wasn t more nor less than what one could expect from a regular five star hotel Prior to our arriving we indicated that it was a special occasion for us but didn t receive any word on this and nothing was done with it Soulless lobby lounge akin to a regular 4 star hotel Xmas decorations in the hotel lobby and public areas were woefully minimal none of the Christmas spirit expected for the season was present Key cards didn t work consistently on the elevators Location is uninteresting still 10 minutes walk away from the more vibrant Albertina Museum area Restaurant personnel at the in house Dstrikt restaurant were too informal and overly familiar with guests felt like a mid tier Washington DC steakhouse with high tier prices , Christmas market on the rooftop was a nice touch and offers a nice vantage point over the city 
448336,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, No free internet bad cousin very lazy staff in the main bar and restaurant Wait 1 hour for a steak No thanks , Great pool and wellness great staff on the reception location 
448337,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, if this didn t happen then I would rate the property as 10 The time I arrived the hotel I was given a different price for my total stay with an increase in money for each night it is a different price than when I booked at booking com I was told that It is not an option and the total price has been changed I was also told that it was mentioned in booking com however I always use booking and never saw such a message before and never had this kind of experience , The rooms were excellent in terms of size twice as big as usual rooms in Vienna and Europe in general The hotel was newly opened probably two years ago and therefore it is so clean and nice the staff were very friendly 
448338,The Ritz Carlton Vienna,No Negative, The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly courteous and helpful with the smallest things especially the concierge The room was very well designed and the smallest details were well taken care off loved the heated marble in the bathroom
448339,The Ritz Carlton Vienna,No Negative, The service was excellent and courtious We were made very welcome during our entire stay I have not had this experience in any other hotel It was clear that the hotel takes extra care to ensure high level of facilities and services The Spa area was very nice and the breakfast beyond compare The room was large and well equiped with twice daily cleaning 
448340,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Not impressed with the layout of the hotel and it does not have a welcoming feel Some of the concierge staff were not very knowledgeable and a tad dismissive , The location was excellent and the rooms well furnished The staff at reception were lovely professional and very welcoming 
448341,The Ritz Carlton Vienna,No Negative, Loved the Ritz in Vienna rooms were fully refurbished absolute 5 stars bed was heavenly facilities great concierge very helpful great location good value highly recommend 
448342,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Just a little disappointed at no where to have a drink after dinner It was a little rainy and roof top bar closed Downstairs bar too full of smokers Lounge bar in hotel closed early and would not serve us However we took a walk to the Marriott Which wasn t far So all ok, Loved lounge Breakfast area and breakfast Rooms excellent Reception very good Wi Fi good Excellent steak restaurant Really enjoyed dstk
448343,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Breakfast selection in the club lounge was very limited and there was a mega fly buzzing around over the food , the staff are very attentive and the rooms extremely comfortable and clean Truly a Ritz Carlton experience The hotel s location was excellent everything within walking distance Also there s a hop on hop off station right next to the hotel In addition to the Kursalon and Stadtpark are right around the corner barely 2 minutes and the Opera house is a 10 minute walk 
448344,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, Difficult access for the stroller the water in the swimming pool is cold poor menu not free wifi in the rooms the babycot was terrible, The location the spa the bars
448345,The Ritz Carlton Vienna, May be they need to increase the breakfast area a bit more Especially if the hotel is full , Staff are excellent helpfull pleasant Location is just perfect not inside the busy old town and not far away easy access to every thing One of the best steak Resturant in vienna is in this hotel DSTRIKT we had a lovely dinner well looked foods and the best was the cheascake The hotel has a nice and relaxing SPA smell in the lobby area from the time we get in the hotel
