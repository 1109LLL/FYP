350430,Am Spiegeln, There is a Kindergarten across the street and it tends to get pretty loud No air conditioning is annoying in the hot summer days I was the most disappointed by the breakfast I ve especially chosen the Hotel for the great Breakfast but then I saw the shabby Swedish buffet you could choose from scraping some scrambled eggs off the recipient a few slices of cold cuts and cheese There were also a few yogurts and cereal if you are into that , The place has a big garden and plenty of on site parking place for those arriving by car The staff from the reception is very polite and nice The room was spacious and the WiFi was strong 
350431,Am Spiegeln,No Negative, perfect quiet environment close to some restaurants interspar and the train is reachable wit bus the room was nothing fancy but clean and with a cool view 
350432,Am Spiegeln, They offer gluten free breakfast but they DO NOT have gluten free breakfast I have written the hotel in advance to make sure we will be served gluten free breakfast and they confirmed But in reality the hotel does not know what it means One waiter did thankfully He honestly admitted that they can not provide us gluten free breakfast When I wrote the hotel afterwords they did answere once but did not follow up , Good value quite residential area 
350433,Am Spiegeln, Reception opens at 07 30 this is too late for an early check out and forces people with car to travel at the peak season of traffic this should change Without a cor it is hard to get there, good breakfast and also silent place easy parking as ouside city 
350434,Am Spiegeln, no Sport facilities inside swimmin pool gym sauna , I really like it the hotel huge areas breakfast is really nice they were really friendly Room is also clean simply but you have everything what you need 
350435,Am Spiegeln, lunch and dinner met my need considering it is not dinning room food and appreciative that something was offered But would try not to rely on that , great breakfast clean and quiet room comfortable bed 
350436,Am Spiegeln, Quite isolated location but still easy to get around by bus Bus stop just around the corner , Very service oriented and friendly staff Basic but clean and well kept room 
350437,Am Spiegeln, A little bit far away from the train station but for the price it s a great location , Absolutely everything Amazing staff that made me feel very welcome Amazing breakfast buffet 
350438,Am Spiegeln, Honestly speaking there was nothing i didn t like and for the price i was paying i couldn t have asked for more , The room was comfortable and clean Wifi worked well and the lady at reception was very friendly and helpful 
350439,Am Spiegeln, the location was not all that great the hotel is located in the suburbs so it is kind of far from anywhere popular and tourist like that you would want to go to too bad there are no in hotel attractions such as a pool , the staff was wonderful and very helpful wished they knew more english though 
350440,Am Spiegeln, Even though we knew this as we ve stayed before it is about time evening meals snacks were offered There are a few restaurants a distance away but as we had a large van we couldn t really access them as we were working in the city until late each day staff will order in a take away for you but only pizza menus seem to exist pizza three nights running after working 14 hours was a bit too much for us this time Perhaps a wider choice of takeaway menu would be possible OR of course evening meals snacks could be available from the downstairs breakfast area think you re missing the opportunity to up sell here guys As I say we did know this beforehand but would now think twice about re booking Continental breakfast too did seem a little more measured from our last visit 12 months before Everything else at the hotel is great clean rooms great staff and very quite location , Out of city location for ease of parking large van Friendly staff
