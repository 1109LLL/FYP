57194,The Ritz London, There was nothing that I did not like about this hotel it was faultless, Having traveled worldwide this is the most prestigious Hotel I have stayed in just everything was above and beyond my expectations Fabulous
57195,The Ritz London, the view from our room at the back of the building the bed mattress a bit tired and too soft for our liking, the establishment as a whole the atmosphere of a legendary landmark the staff the quality of the meals the various special offers available making this luxurious hotel more accessible to many
57196,The Ritz London, There was nothing I did not like, In addition to the hotels decor being luxurious from the moment we arrived we were made to feel really welcome nothing was too much trouble to make our stay a memorable one The Afternoon Tea and breakfast was really lovely the service was excellent 
57197,The Ritz London,No Negative, Booked for my mum and her best friend they had a fantastic time and loved every but of luxury the hotel offered for a birthday treat weekend highly reccomend to all 
57198,The Ritz London, Nothing could be better , There s no better location in all of London than the Ritz Every great restaurant every hot bar and club all the shopping anyone could want are all near The tea at the Ritz is legendary for good reason The staff is proper not stuffy helpful and thoughtful Compared to all the legendary hotels in London the Ritz is the most for the least 
57199,The Ritz London,No Negative, The service was top notch amazing Coming back to the room after it had been serviced I could only be amazed at how well arranged my toiletries that I had thrown around the dressing table were made I was able to amaze my partner we were there for a birthday Definitely recommend for a special weekend in London 
57200,The Ritz London, I am used to a larger availability of choices at a buffet breakfast but the service was exemplary, The service was extraordinary the concierges were amazing and the room was very comfortable
57201,The Ritz London, The rudest staff I have ever encouraged in any hotel in the world I will never walk through the doors of the ritz again They need a lesson in how to treat their guests I suggest they send staff for training at the Savoy A truly world class hotel because the Ritz is clearly posed itself well above the station of of its guests Thinking the staff can treat their guests as second third or lower class citizens They have their whole attitude upside down The Savoy saved me and from there and provided me with the most welcoming and wonderful stay , Nothing 
57202,The Ritz London, Bit tired rooms a bit tired with scuffed skirtings and handles missing etc wouldn t have expected this at The Ritz, Lovely classic hotel which everyone should treat themselves to at least once 
57203,The Ritz London,No Negative, Everything about the Ritz was marvellous I have been travelling on holiday with my Dad and this stay at the Ritz for the last night of our trip was a much looked forward to treat The staff are wonderful the room was enormous and so comfortable the bathroom had a separate bathtub and shower with plenty of towels and bathrobes The dinner in the restaurant was one of the nicest I have ever had While the Ritz is very expensive it is so worth it This was the perfect way to end a dream holiday 
57204,The Ritz London, The only thing we didn t like was having to leave, From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were amazed by the exceptional quality and the friendliness of the staff Definitely a once in a life time experience that we have been lucky enough to have fulfilled 
57205,The Ritz London, Not a caring organization I was not given a late check out of 4 hours after staying in a suite for four nights I had to wait in the front desk while checking out as the concerned staff had to leave the place to escort a checking in guest , The interior decor of the hotel 
57206,The Ritz London, A British hotel not having provision for making tea in the room Also it was inconvenient not to have walk in shower , Breakfast was great so was the service The Concierge was superb 
57207,The Ritz London, No business center breakfast is expensive and daily the same no corner for fat free and gluten free which should available in this stander hotel, Staff cleanliness St nder hotel of 5 stars
57208,The Ritz London, Staff The housekeeping staff were perhaps shy they would almost never greet us if we walk past them It should also be a practice that they knock first before opening a room Once I was by the door checking my outfit in the wardrobe mirror when a male staff just literally unlocked the door and barged into the room we were both really shocked good thing I was not naked He was very apologetic and speechless and ended up asking me if there was a maid in the room turns out he was supposed to go into the room next door oops Service We availed to have the daily telegraph delivered to the room each morning however we only received it on one occasion This is not really a big deal for me but I would expect greater attention to detail from such a hotel , We stayed for 3 nights and loved everything about this hotel the history atmosphere rooms furnishing everything made us feel like we were years away from the present time The room The room was very spacious especially considering how central the hotel is it is definitely a luxury to stay in a room that big in central London The bathroom was nice and marbled they even put a lovely fresh stem of flower by the sink for you They also had a heated rack for the towels so it was really nice and warm after a long nice shower I loved the pressure of the shower as well it was quite strong considering the vintage style Hot water water temperature was consistent throughout the shower and the shampoo and conditioner they provide was really great I thought it made my hair look and feel better The location I cannot think of a better location than where the Ritz was It was very close to the main shopping street so you can be shopping till you dropped on Regent street but far enough so that the flow of people around the hotel wasn t all too overwhelming There are several restaurants near the hotel and the lovely Green Park is literally beside it talk about convenience and easy access to the underground they even have The Ritz marked on the underground exit Staff The staff were friendly and very professional reception was very efficient checked in without problems and check out was even smoother The doormen were all lovely the attire smiles hat and that special charm when they greet you oh they were most consistent in greeting us and we always felt like being transported to another time Service They were very helpful and responsive when inquiries are made We have requested to leave our luggage for a week with the hotel upon checkout since we were headed to Scotland and they gladly assisted us We were really impressed and appreciated their service considering we left quite a few things 
57209,The Ritz London, No tea coffee facilities in the room dissappointing We booked a Superior King room I would be surprised if it were a superior room Certainly didn t seem it we had an interconnecting door to the next suite Stayed at the Shard last year and prefer it there , The building is amazing service fantastic excellent food too 
57210,The Ritz London, After checkout we needed to change clothes and had to use disabled toilet as no other room available , The best bed I have ever slept on and I am very fussy about comfort They kept our luggage all day even allowing us to access it to get a change of clothes after afternoon tea Cheerful and helpful staff 
57211,The Ritz London, Breakfast on Sunday particularly slow tomato juice forgotten requested butter three times mistaken for the chocolatier of same name on Saturday night at dinner and it was awkward, Opulence and calm
57212,The Ritz London, Very expensive couldn t afford to do it again for a long time But it was a special occasion , The staff were incredibly friendly and make the experience very relaxed despite being in a luxurious and expensive hotel 
57213,The Ritz London,No Negative, The ritz exceeded our expectations it was a truly amazing experience the hotel room was amazing and we were given complimentary chocolates and cake for a friends birthday All the staff are amazing and make your stay We can t wait to go again

57215,The Ritz London, The checking in the fact that we had to change in the toilets for afternoon tea the return email from the ritz extremely dissappointed , The bed was amazing 
57216,The Ritz London, Prices are crazy 7 00 for water Breakfast on average 100 per couple and dinner over priced and not that great have eaten better for less money, Amazing down to earth staff nothing was too much trouble the Best service ever 
57217,The Ritz London, It would have been nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room , The hotel is amazing all that I expected and more but it was the staff who made it perfect Without exception every single member of staff was friendly helpful courteous polite and professional thank you everyone for making this a truly memorable stay 
57218,The Ritz London, This is one of those places where you would pay more to feel cheap Being so proud of keeping the traditions this hotel s management forgot the importance of customer service Although I needed to have food in order to take my medication before leaving for a meeting the hotel REFUSED to provide any food for me other than the 29 breakfast I almost begged them for something quick like a croissant They asked me to order from the room although I told them that I am in hurry for a meeting before my flight and there is no time for a full breakfast They also told me that there are so many great places outside the hotel which I can get some food in although it was raining heavily I came back 10 50am and asked whether breakfast is still available Instead of answering me with yes or no the feedback was we do not allow jeans After that they would tell me no food is available now I find this too rude Keeping the high society manners is not only about the looks but also about how you treat other people Paying for an expensive hotel room within a hotel which identifies itself as prestigious should only mean that I will check out feeling great Dress code was listed on the website briefly and the meaning of smart casual was not explained Why would I need to have food outside the hotel Just because you would not want to be generous enough to offer other quick options An annoying capitalistic approach which is very rude and not so kind Next time IF I decided to enjoy the interior design of the Ritz again I will make sure to pack my fur coat and diamond earrings to get a better service The Ritz ruined my happy London trip , I love the interior design Actually it is the only thing that might let me go back to this hotel again Room slippers were comfy In room dining was good Some of the staff were very nice but some were not 
57219,The Ritz London, We were not able to obtain a room with a view, Quality of staff and their attention to detail We have enjoyed the hospitality of many International Hotels across the globe however not one exceeds the combination of style excellence and management of the Ritz

57223,The Ritz London, Nothing , We liked everything From the warm welcome by the doormen to all staff who ensured that our stay was most enjoyable Special mention for receptionist Melanie who s attetion during our stay we have not experienced anywhere in the world 
57224,The Ritz London, Perhaps some of the paintwork in the rooms around the skirting boards needed a touch up , Afternoon tea was superb Staff very friendly and attentive Excellent breakfast
57225,The Ritz London, On our arrival the receptionist queried our booking creating a bit of unrest We had booked for 2 nights and she questioned this and also payment which we found embarrassing This was the only blemish on our stay and could have been avoided if she was upto date with bookings ,No Positive

57240,The Ritz London, Overpriced and overrated with laughable priced drinks Bathroom needed updating grouting shabby stain around base of toilet bowl This hotel lives on it s tradition reputation and it s name I think it could do with stepping up the mark in terms of refreshing each room s d cor Overall it was OK but there are other 5 hotels with better facilities and more realistic prices It s a shame as was expecting so much more It was a nice experience though , really comfy bed Fantastic bar area with really great atmosphere Be warned you need to book a table in the bar even if you are a guest Professional and courteous manager who responded well to our comments and sorted things out rapidly and with respect
