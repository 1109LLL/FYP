83097,The Hoxton Holborn, There was nothing that we didn t like about the hotel, The location was great absolutely lovely room with an excellent bed and a fantastically great shower and the possibility of a very late check out
83098,The Hoxton Holborn, Another soft pillow in the bed would have been nice but that s it Great hotel really , The rooms were small but very clever usage of the space Everything felt new and fresh and clean We really liked the small complementary breakfast to have in your room in the morning It felt more relaxed than stressing to get ready to go down for a big buffet Location was excellent 
83099,The Hoxton Holborn, Size of rooms were a bit small , The place was extremely hip but not at all stuffy The location in London was amazing and we took the metro directly too and from the airport 
83100,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The decor was so beautiful The staff were really friendly and they even left a birthday message and bottle of champagne in our room with two glasses It was a really lovely gesture and really made the trip special Bed was so comfy room service breakfast was delicious we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Hoxton and we ll definitely be back 
83101,The Hoxton Holborn, The only breakfast provided is left in a paper bag outside room You get fresh orange juice a pot of yoghurt with granola and a banana You make your own coffee in the room with real coffee bags and fresh milk is provided That might be just what someone wants but if you are on holiday or have a long day ahead you might prefer a sit down breakfast to be included You can buy breakfast in the restaurant in the foyer , Very comfortable bed Fairly small but well designed room Good sound proofing Great location if you want Covent Garden area Modern stylish bathroom 
83102,The Hoxton Holborn, The area is pricey but we knew that already , Drinks very reasonably priced for the area and tasted great Music in the bar was spot on made for a nice chilled atmosphere 
83103,The Hoxton Holborn, Room was tiny and it certainly wasn t a Deluxe suite which apparently they don t have but it s what I paid for on Booking com I had something called a snug would have thought twice before booking a room called snug Also really don t like the idea of hanging a bag outside my hotel door so staff can pop breakfast bits in ridiculous concept Just offer me breakfast in the price simple , Location was convenient 
83104,The Hoxton Holborn, having service charge on a coffee that i went up tp order myself , the originality of the decor without being pretentious the location to area we wished to frequent and the staff couldnt be more helpful late checkout of 12 was fab too 
83105,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Wonderfully comfortable bed Lively food in the restaurant I liked the busy vibe downstairs and the incredibly calm relaxing bedroom Very thoughtful staff Great location 
83106,The Hoxton Holborn, Size and View from room but we were not in it much so didn t really affect our stay , An absolute gem Quality I ve not seen for some time Happy welcoming and caring staff Just simply amazing 
83107,The Hoxton Holborn, Bit expensive though but honestly the hotel and services are great, Great place great location and great atmosphere very hipster though Tube station around the corner brings you in 45 min to LHR Will be back again soon Ver
83108,The Hoxton Holborn, Room size its cramped it appeared big enough in the picture complementary breakfast was poor But dinner at restaurant was fabulous , The room was small for 200 
83109,The Hoxton Holborn, Dark and small room No proper breakfast despite the price of the room Just a banana a yogurt and bottle of orange left hanging outside the room The whole experience was impersonal and felt like a cost cutting excercise Whatever happened to customer care and hospitality ,No Positive
83110,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, This modern boutique hotel is excelent We stayed 2 nights At short walking distance from British Museum Covent Garden Picadilly Circus etc and also pubs restaurants and shops All the staff we had contact with was superb very professional Our room was big and bathroom as well with very comfortable bed Breakfast is not included but they provide every morning a bag with fruit yogurt and cereal bars and water Highly recommendable 
83111,The Hoxton Holborn, Not sure that the breakfast bag hanging on your door really works I seem to remember Travelodge doing this years ago and thinking if was not a good idea then , Modern boutique style hotel that has done its best to make use of all available space The bathrooms are a wonderful example of how you can make the most of a small space Very friendly and helpful staff Plenty of space in reception area makes up for lack of space in rooms 
83112,The Hoxton Holborn, Not much Tiny tiny thing was very few plug sockets and only on one side of the bed , Bedroom was small but comfortable Very quiet even on a Saturday night Nice toiletries Bar was lively at night nice for coming back to for a nightcap We are at the Chicken Shop restaurant was amazing Also the coffee from Holborn Grind is really nice 
83113,The Hoxton Holborn, Last day had a taxi waiting for me whilst i came back for my bags The receptionist on duty wasnt particularly helpful with helping me get me bags quickly as she said she had to supervise a trainee Otherwise great service , Great location cleanliness decor comfort Staff usually particularly helpful
83114,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, One of the best hotels I ve stayed in Upscale but hip not stuffy Beautiful lobby bar restaurant space downstairs Staff were very helpful The decor is gorgeous Our room was impeccable Very well located steps from Holborn tube stop 
83115,The Hoxton Holborn, The room was so small anymore than 1 night and I think people would struggle There is no space to put a suitcase , The room was well equipped Great location and really nice relaxed reception area Generally everything was immaculate and the rooms were quiet 
83116,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Everything was great Really good find Location good as it s quiet but close to Covent Garden etc We were greeted with champagne in our room as we were there for my mums 60th birthday celebrations very nice touch and very much appreciated 
83117,The Hoxton Holborn, Had real difficulty connecting to the internet I suspect this might have been due to the heavy use of the free WiFi by the huge number of people in the common areas , Affordable comfort minutes from Theatreland Thank you
83118,The Hoxton Holborn, Shower leaked for 229 the room was very very small i would like to see the size of a box room Listed as a deluxe room which it is not It s a standard room Dislike how room rate then subject to vat this should be included in the room rate , I have stayed in the Amsterdam hoxton which was much nicer the staff at the Amsterdam hoxton were really knowledgable and engaged I like the quirky look the Horton has and overall the vibe is very nice the food in the chicken restaurant was good tasty and promptly served 
83119,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, A very convenient location low key but comfortable and economic Rooms are small but soundproofing excellent Quirky retro feel adds to experience Suits couples overnight perhaps not for long stay Staff extremely helpful courteous and welcoming 
83120,The Hoxton Holborn, Staff was trying to be friendly but asking the wrong questions Too intrusive , Attractive deco comfortable bed nice bathroom option of small free breakfast excellent location 
83121,The Hoxton Holborn, Room was tiny and there didn t appear to be a power socket anywhere quite strange When you switch the spotlight on the radio switches off even stranger , Good location bar restaurant very good Check in check out was smooth Close to tube station and an easy walk into Soho 
83122,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, We loved the breakfast bags Every evening they give you a paper bag which you hang on a hook placed outside your door In the morning you find yogurt banana and juice are waiting for you A great perk 
83123,The Hoxton Holborn, A lot of sounds we couldn t figure out where came from Missed a brush to the toilet to clean And a bit annoying that we could hear the music from downstairs And downstairs was more like a night club than a hotel , I liked the room the bed was nice and the size of the room was great Free milk water coffee and tea 
83124,The Hoxton Holborn, The rooms are tiny Best suited for a solo guest Even for a couple with 2 suit cases the rooms are like dorms and extremely tight to move around in The lighting is also quite dim with the windows being so deep and that makes it a challenge for getting ready doing makeup seeing outside I would stay again just in a larger room , The hotel has a really cool vibe The lobby restaurant bar is always lively and you could easily just hang out at the hotel all day and have a great time The coffee is also amazing The rooms have a great aesthetic and design 
83125,The Hoxton Holborn, I can t think of anything I didn t like, The staff went over and above to provide us with an excellent birthday stay with some added extras The trim was well maintained and stylishly decorated and very quiet and dark at night time We felt very at home in our lovely room
83126,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, very good located the hotel is 1m walking from Holborn underground and it s 10 15min walking to the main attractions We arrived late and we decided to walk from Victoria Station 40mins The room is small but very confortable The staff was very kind we arrived 2hours late in the night and I just sent them an email the reception is open 24 7 
83127,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The ambiance and atmosphere of this hotel is exceptional great hotel lobby and bar which is always buzzing with activity Excellent hotel especially for younger travelers or couples who don t mind a busy hotel full of life 
83128,The Hoxton Holborn, Service in the bar area is often slow and disorganized Also there should be a guest only area as students come in all day to study which often fills up the whole area, Most of the staff are very friendly and cool The bar area is also great
83129,The Hoxton Holborn, The rooms were tiny and very dark There was no where to put your clothes no wardrobes or cupboards fine for a night or two living out of suitcase but any longer it would be uncomfortable, Very retro Staff friendly It was my partners birthday whilst we were there any got complimentary wine and a balloon on our arrival Complimentary breakfast Ideal location close to tube and also close to Covent Garden
83130,The Hoxton Holborn, The room was bit tight as we have 1 week travel luggages , Excellent location to British museum SOHO and musical theater and very handy from Heathrow by direct train plus the quick breakfast is good and actually hotel accepted us to make early check in as we arrived there still early morning it was very helpful 
83131,The Hoxton Holborn, Not enough space for luggage and not enough hanging space We were travelling for a wedding and nowhere to put smart clothes Also not one single hook in bathroom or space to put 2 toilet bags, The bed and pillows were super comfy Loved the large entrance foyer lounge area also very comfy Great waitress service on ground floor 
83132,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing, The hotel is well situated good atmosphere Friendly and helpful staff The room is quiet clean well decorated and the bed very comfy Nice touch such as breakfast bag delivered to your door free bottle of water Great bar and restaurant
83133,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The staff are very welcoming and helpful the bedrooms are well equipped and well decorated with a quirky style that suits the atmosphere of the hotel as a whole We didn t eat at the hotel but lots of people did and the food looked and smelled appetising 
83134,The Hoxton Holborn, The staff forgot to give us food in our breakfast bag , Everything was superb especially the small touches like the helium balloon and chocolates for our wedding anniversary 
83135,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The hotel s mood is nice A lot of animation downstairs surprisingly without noise at night even if my room was located above the restaurant Huge room but I had a nice upgrade I know they have smaller very convenientely designed with nice vintage furniture An excellent overall experience 
83136,The Hoxton Holborn, The deluxe is a very small room and we had view to the bins, The location is absolutely perfect near the tube station and Covent garden The staff was very helpful the atmosphere is young and lively There is a small breakfast to the room with no charge 
83137,The Hoxton Holborn, Main lobby looks lovely trendy comfortable but very busy so hard to find a place to sit Need to find a way to expand it , Gorgeous room lovely sheets comfy bed fab shower Staff all extremely helpful each and everyone that we had contact with It made such a change from the regular branded hotels to stay somewhere so unique Perfect location for theatre 
83138,The Hoxton Holborn, No place to hang wet towels in bathroom and may need another plug socket or 2 , Excellent location close to underground station and Shaftesbury theatre very friendly staff 
83139,The Hoxton Holborn, Bar was always really busy so nowhere to sit reception forgot our extended check in so got locked out of room, Comfy bed ace location cool bar free brekkie bag
83140,The Hoxton Holborn, Nowt, Just love the fact that it s so central so unassuming feel really comfortable there on my own facilities are spot on it s my number 1 choice also love Hoxton Hoxton c
83141,The Hoxton Holborn, I thought it was a bit over priced but I suppose it was a last minute booking so I was prepared for this Shower drain didnt drain the water So when i showered the bathroom flooded excessively Would have been nice to open the window slightly there was no handle to do this but the room needed some vent even just a slight opening , The staff were nice and helpful and the room was nice comfy bed Nice bar downstairs everyone was very friendly and because I had to extend check out this was allowed at a small cost Would stay again for sure 
83142,The Hoxton Holborn, Honestly there was nothing that could have been improved upon in my opinion , Very nice hotel room was lovely very modern and very clean The bed was comfy and they bathroom was impeccable The hotel bar had a good atmosphere and was really nice The location was excellent and the staff were very friendly 
83143,The Hoxton Holborn, The bathroom floor floods somewhat as there is no shower door or lip on the floor Although it is nice to see such a popular bar reception area a lot of people were taking a lot of room up on seating areas with laptop paraphernalia to the detriment of hotel guests unable to find a seat close to the bar to have a drink I do feel there needs to be a no laptop use area , Very helpful Reception staff they went the extra mile Great location Very comfy bed Good food A gem of a hotel would thoroughly recommend it 
83144,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The general look and feel of the hotel was great I loved everything about the style Very comfy bed great facilities in the room and clean Petite rooms but space worked well Food and drinks were very good also everything you need in one place from breakfast to cocktails I would definitely recommend and would stay again in a heartbeat 
83145,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing It surpassed my expectations entirely Amazing choice I m so glad I booked it If I had to make one criticism while the breakfast bag is nice it would be lovely to have a hot breakfast included especially when it s so cold outside a full English in the morning gets your ready for the day , The bed the staff the room the location the funky bar area downstairs the surprises in the room Everything
83146,The Hoxton Holborn, Fridge couldn t have too much in it or an alarm went off , The room was wonderful coming in to chill music was lovely the shower was fantastic the complimentary bubbly and balloon for our 3rd year wedding anniversary was amazing the wifi was excellent the curtains shut out the light really well bed was so comfy
83147,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Radio in your room makes it more homely really properly quiet At last a comfy bed wish I d been staying for a week Friendly efficient but unobtrusive staff A problem with the tap in my bathroom was sorted out straight away and a note left apologising for the inconvenience 
83148,The Hoxton Holborn, Lounge cafe downstairs was too crowded Difficult to get a seat Cafe staff brought wrong coffees but very friendly , Modern and comfortable with a good vibe 
83149,The Hoxton Holborn, Pillows a bit uncomfortable and restaurant food service a bit lacking They all sat down to have their break so I missed out on dessert, Decent sized towels in the modern bathroom
83150,The Hoxton Holborn, The ground floor of the hotel doubles up as a cafe and bar in the night While it was fine with us it may not be everybody s cut of tea, Excellent location friendly staff and very reasonably priced for a central London Good sized room and free light breakfast delivered to your door in the morning 
83151,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing, Everything such a quirky hotel in a great location at a very affordable price and the staff were extremely helpful worth every penny will definitely be stopping here again
83152,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Loved the hotel and the little detail of giving every guest a free mini breakfast served to your room yoghurt with granola banana and orange juice makes you want to come back Clean good vibe Nothing negative to state
83153,The Hoxton Holborn, The rooms are cosy small but that s all we needed Bathroom was more of a wet room style but as it s small it doesn t really work very well and just getting wet feet the whole time , Great location tube is all but 100yards and Covent Garden is a five minute walk Service and atmosphere were great Would definitely stay here again Breakfast bag a nice little extra The small details make all the difference 
83154,The Hoxton Holborn, Room isn t that spacious compared to the room I previously stayed in at the Hoxton at Shoreditch and it was 55 more expensive We had a late 9pm midweek meal at The Hubbard and bell restaurant It wasn t that busy but staff left us waiting for ages to pay our bill We asked two different members of staff for it and could see them all standing around at the front Eventually we had to get up and go to the front to pay on our way out , Very comfortable bed like the breakfast bag Super friendly staff 
83155,The Hoxton Holborn, Hotel restaurant no children s menu or even a willingness to bring child sized portions even when I offered to pay the full cost a reduction was refused , Location comfy bed The Chicken Shop staff were really outstanding warm and friendly and excellent with children Food here was great too 
83156,The Hoxton Holborn, Despite having paid for the room in advance the charged my card an additional 50 at check in to act as credits for extra hotel food drink I didn t feel this was necessary as we would have gladly paid if we needed anything and it takes 48 hours for the money to reappear in your account after check out , Very cosy feels like your own room at home Great location too even with London being so spread out it s easy to get everywhere from here 
83157,The Hoxton Holborn, As said before downstairs seem to be full of non residents which I don t mind as the Hotel is running a business but what I do mind is when there is nowhere to sit for paying guests staying overnight Sort out a residents only space at the very least , Room was very clean nice comfortable bed great blackout blinds Location very good This was a great Hotel for our visit to London to watch a show Would book again 
83158,The Hoxton Holborn, At night the pub takes over and can be intimidating to walk into , Breakfast bag good idea First impressions of the room decor music and smell location is ideal for central London
83159,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Service from the reception was excellent place is really well designed very comfortable The facilities especially the cafe food bar etc in the communal areas were excellent Rooms aren t huge but expected from a central London hotel with affordable prices All in all excellent stay and would highly recommend I travel to London for short stays very often and I have been looking for a go to hotel centrally located now found 
83160,The Hoxton Holborn, Me and my friend stayed in the economic double bedroom The room size is ok Did wish it could be a bit bigger as there s hardly space to sit on except for the bed We also find it s a bit difficult to find a big enough space to open a slightly bigger suitcase 29 inch without blocking the bathroom door , Nice stylish hotel Location is great the hotel is 5 minutes walk from the tube station and 10 minutes walk from the British Museum and the west end A very handy small fridge in the room with free water and milk provided The hotel also provide free pack of light breakfast for each guest 
83161,The Hoxton Holborn, Leaving The only minor thing is the wet room does get absolutely drenched if you use the shower immediately after someone else if you have a long soak Although this can be avoided if you just have a quick one , This is my 3rd time to the hotel and it is my favourite in London by far I Love the atmosphere as you walk in created by the decor background music couldn t believe it when I heard my current favourite soul record by Saun Starr come on when I walked in in the lobby and very helpful staff The food is always impeccable and turned around very quickly The radio on Chill when you walk in to your room gives an air of class comfort and welcoming they are always immaculate the shower always spacious and the bed like a hug in a cloud 
83162,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The hotel room was fantastic the bed was super comfortable and it was very quiet even though it s in a very central location The little breakfast bag in the morning was a lovely touch as well The design of the hotel is cozy and feels like home yet stylish Overall the cleanliness was amazing The food at the restaurant was yummy The Hoxton is very central to all the sights and only a one minute walk from Holborn Tube station Very convenient indeed 
83163,The Hoxton Holborn, Rooms were nicely decorated but absolutely TINY And the service was terrible the staff in restaurant and bar were incredibly unfriendly couldn t be bothered at all The seats in the bar were all very low to the ground which meant I couldn t sit down I have a bad back A few higher hardback chairs would have been welcome While the free light in room breakfast was a nice idea the content of it wasn t really thought through yoghurt and juice should be kept refrigerated but the fridge was too small to fit them in meaning you have to eat them as soon as you wake up A pastry would be more suitable , The food in the on site restaurant was fantastic as were the bar snacks It s a very stylish place with some quirky touches Location is great really handy Fresh milk in the rooms was very welcome and the complimentary breakfast bag is a good idea 
83164,The Hoxton Holborn, Bit firmer bed would have been ideal or a bit bigger bed to stop us rolling into each other Bit picky of me there though as really it was all perfect , The beds were a little soft but the soundproof walks and windows were fab The breakfast bag was great as was complimentary water milk and tea and coffee 
83165,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Superb value through booking com Very comfy bed excellent facilities great ambience very friendly staff Hugely convenient location for Covent Garden West End 2 minutes from Holborn tube 
83166,The Hoxton Holborn, Lighting in rooms a bit dark but otherwise excellent bit pricey as breakfast was just orange Juice Granola Yoghurt Banana , Really Good Location close enough to walk to most palces of Interest
83167,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing A great place to stay , Loved this hotel The reception staff were wonderful and so welcoming The decor was trendy but cosy We loved the bedroom small but so lovely comfortable and relaxing We really liked the breakfast bag that was put outside the door in the morning Will definately look to return 
83168,The Hoxton Holborn, A real ale would be nice but that s as big as the complaints get, Love the location and the enthusiastic vibe of the place have been to the Hoxton on many occasions and will continue to do so 
83169,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, We liked the small breakfast bags The room was small but didn t feel claustrophobic and was decorated nicely There was an issue with the electricity in our room which got fixed immediately Staff was very friendly and helpful 
83170,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing it was that good , It was an amazing place People there are were super great and the atmosphere was relaxing I highly recommend it and will definitely go again
83171,The Hoxton Holborn, Didn t know how to turn radio off , Perfect location 150yds or so from Holborn Tube with Piccadilly and Central lines Walk to Covent Garden Soho Oxford Street Laid back charm and very welcoming
83172,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, We really enjoyed our stay at the Hoxton It is an extremely well run hotel with a vibrant atmosphere The Wifi was quick and the bed was incredibly comfortable 
83173,The Hoxton Holborn, Room is cozy but no problem for the two nights we were there, Really comfy bed breakfast bag and lovely if smallish bathroom We like to walk this hotel is fantastic location for so many great London attractions 
83174,The Hoxton Holborn, The size of the room was particularly small We only stayed 1 night but 2 would ve been too much, The VERY best part of the stay was the absolute kindness and charm of the staff Nothing was too much We didn t use room service so cannot reply to that one 
83175,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Great staff and a great vibe throughout creating an all round great experience The lobby is great to chill with a drink or get stuck in to some work if ok business Rooms are small but as expected in central london but very nice Limited range but drinks at reception sold at high street prices which is a nice touch Breakfast was also great 
83176,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Really comfy bed small room but well designed to make the most of the space cool decor throughout the hotel fun busy bar lounge both day and night Friendly welcoming staff Loved the complimentary breakfast bag hung outside our door
83177,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing, New clean ensure comfy bed No frills but modern up market ambiance Lively cosmopolitan inexpensive food all you could ask for on a short stay
83178,The Hoxton Holborn, The windows had no handles so could not be opened therefore no fresh air access I was uncomfortable with this Also the duvet cover pillow cases were so noisy it was like sleeping in a paper bag all night disturbing sleep, Querky vibrant hotel
83179,The Hoxton Holborn, We had to have dinner in the restaurant due to a power cut where we had originally booked not very impressed with the food or value for money , The most comfy bed I ve ever slept in Immaculately clean and great location 
83180,The Hoxton Holborn, the chicken coop was a set meal and not much option, The room was adorable and it was a 10 min walk from oxford street The breakfast in Hubbard and bell was AMAZING
83181,The Hoxton Holborn, At one point both lifts were broken but this was resolved quickly , Love the atmosphere the rooms are small but quirky and the staff so friendly Good location close to Covent Garden and the British museum Great coffee shop attached and the restaurant looks good too 
83182,The Hoxton Holborn, Slightly expensive for the one night, Room lovely real milk in the fridge was quiet in the room even though the downstairs bar was busy places to eat in the property
83183,The Hoxton Holborn, No shelters for smokers outside, The bed was very comfortable staff were welcoming and friendly location is excellent as it is really close to theatre land I thought I had lost my watch when checking out and staff were very understanding and helpful I did eventually find it in my suitcase 
83184,The Hoxton Holborn, The only negative was the wet room style shower the water flooded the bathroom floor and soaked the bath mat right through , The whole set up of the hotel it how it should be the idea of the breakfast bag in the morning is fab and you get free bottles of water every day in the mini bar ready to take on your day of sight seeing Free wifi and the bar space is great to have an evening chill All in all a really great place to stay will definitely be coming here again on our next trip to London Town 
83185,The Hoxton Holborn, The bed was maybe too soft for us but we still slept well , Very original hotel we liked all the details that make the change from the ordinary hotels Well done We enjoyed the stay 
83186,The Hoxton Holborn, Absolutely nothing, Just the smartest set up ever Everything well thought out down to the use of space the breakfast bag delivery the layout of the public space was ace
83187,The Hoxton Holborn, I wanted to order room service but there was no menu in the room the reception said there should have been one so I had to go downstairs to order it When the meal arrived the plate of fries wasn t very hot So room service wasn t the best experience but this is only a small complaint The hotel overall is excellent , The Hoxton Holborn is a beautiful hotel with great interiors throughout the building and the rooms The location is great and the included breakfast is delicious and convenient 
83188,The Hoxton Holborn, See above, Room was cool but small Didn t like the student crowd in the lobby yes they were chillin n doing their thing but I m not sure it added to the ambience of the place On the upside I asked the Italian bartender to make me an Old Fashioned and it was pretty much spot on 
83189,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing bad to say overall would have got a better score if slightly cheaper BT equivalent to other good hotels in central London , Great overall feel to the hotel fun professional good quality experience great decor and nice to have the radio on when we came in Some thoughtful touches like milk in the fridge 
83190,The Hoxton Holborn, Can t really fault the place , Everything such a great hotel with so many amenities attached briliant location very cool and funky feel and look super staff can t fault this place and probably my favorite place in London to stay 
83191,The Hoxton Holborn, Would be nice if the bar area had some reserved seats for residents There seems to be no distinction between hotel guests and passing customers The free Wi Fi seemed to attract many who sat sipping at a single drink for a very long time to justify them using up a seat I ve paid a lot less and received more for my money at other London hotels , Nicely presented room Excellent position for transport links and Shaftesbury theatre the reason we chose the hotel 
83192,The Hoxton Holborn, The hotel was uncomfortabley warm and the aircon in our room didn t do much to cool it down Rooms are small but not cramped , Lovely decor staff very friendly and bar restaurant downstairs are great 
83193,The Hoxton Holborn, Foyer area caters to day trippers Was rammed so no space or privileges for guests Food at Hubbard Bell was average at best , Great location Cool setting Decor typically Hox And the Chicken Shop Clucking marvellous 
83194,The Hoxton Holborn, Lack of a proper breakfast The lounge is used by the public and was very busy so finding somewhere to sit down for a drink after our arrival was almost impossible , Rooms are nice
83195,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing except the 249 price tag for small but adequate room Probably would have been cheaper if I d booked earlier, FRESH milk in room none of that vile UHT stuff Comfy bed silent room couldn t hear traffic or other rooms very clean breakfast in bag couldn t fault anything Friendly and helpful staff But above all because of milk able to have a proper cup of tea Used all the tea bags 
83196,The Hoxton Holborn, I liked everything I couldn t fault any of your service , The staff were attentive and professional The hotel was in a great location for shops and tubes and the cherry on the icing was your restaurant was open at midnight and i hadn t had any dinner The burger was delicious 
83197,The Hoxton Holborn, Some seating in reception for residents would be good I understand the concept of a wet room but these are very small and the whole floor gets soaked not very nice for the 2nd person , Almost everything Small but perfectly formed 
83198,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Great location for Soho Covent Garden Great bus routes and tube just yards away Room was cosy but perfectly fine for a one night stay Well appointed good plumbing Fast easy wifi Friendly helpful staff in the reception and bar restaurant The free breakfast bag and fresh milk in the fridge are great little touches We ll be back 
83199,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing, Hotel staff were outstanding the whole weekend was organised as a surprise and they went out of their way to make it exceptional and made all the extras we arranged easy and hassle free 
83200,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, This is a young hotel in age run by younger staff They were exceedingly helpfull had a sense of humour and the whole place was just buzzing We were wondering how it was going to be and it was great 
83201,The Hoxton Holborn, It was a bit warm the air on struggled in October , Great location good room small but perfectly formed Free breakfast was simple but really good 
83202,The Hoxton Holborn, Urine stains on toilet seat Awful smell from shower drains Power cut in the morning so had to get ready under the light of my mobile phone , Good location Buzzing bar downstairs 
83203,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing in all honesty , Location is brilliant shops and places to eat on the doorstep plus the tube is only 200 yards away Price was excellent in comparison to similar hotels Staff were so helpful and friendly and we both loved the theme of the Hotel 
83204,The Hoxton Holborn, The rooms are not particularly large but they are well designed The shower position did mean that the whole floor of the bathroom got very wet not just in the shower , The bed was really comfy and the location was great walkable to a whole range of places and the tube The hotel is beautifully designed and the nail salon did a great job 
83205,The Hoxton Holborn, The only thing which caused us some inconvenience was the fact that shower is not separated from the other space of the bathroom and the water leaks on the floor of all the room making it really wet , The hotel is perfectly located in the center of London you can reach Big Ben Westminster British Museum St James Park and other historical sightseeing just by walking for the longer trips tube station is 1 2 minutes from the hotel Staff is always at reception ready to help you We are thankful to the girl I m sorry for not remembering her name who provided us with a city map and rounded areas of shopping and cafes for our knowledge She also printed for us boarding passes It must be mentioned that the hotel is nicely decorated you shall see yourself It is really worth staying in Somebody writes about rooms being too small I can confirm that they are small but you are not expected to stay in a room all the day while travelling to London for night sleep it is OK There is enough space to place luggage and some things no wardrobe but hangers 
83206,The Hoxton Holborn, No open windows in room sheets are non breathable , Nice lounge good food good vibe very nice interior design perfect shower soft beds location fantastic 
83207,The Hoxton Holborn, One of the booked rooms was very small and the furniture felt crammed in Other booked room was fine They were the same cost , Lots of lovely touches staff very helpful
83208,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing, Location was excellent hotel is modern and clean very lively bar in the evening breakfast was great 2 min walk from Holborn tube station also very easy walk into covent garden
83209,The Hoxton Holborn, A woman with a sword through her head being depicted on the wallpaper was macabre and distasteful , Good service simple practical room design and features

83213,The Hoxton Holborn, Wet room showers result in a bathroom floor that is potentially completely wet, Clean well located within a few minutes walk of Holborn tube although be aware that Holborn tube is exit only 7 30am 10am Mon Fri from 22 8 16 till late 2017 due to escalator works 
83214,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The staff in general were so welcoming The reception staff really went the extra mile when we asked questions about the area I was really impressed by all the staff in every department Also very reasonable price compared to other london hotels considering the level of service and excellent location 
83215,The Hoxton Holborn, Room is just small , Great location A very good vibe as soon as you arrive Love the decor of the place Staff are great Lots of attention to detail 
83216,The Hoxton Holborn, The lifts weren t working Not ideal when on the fourth floor with luggage but sometimes can t be helped , The location is perfect for roaming London and the interiors of the rooms are great 
83217,The Hoxton Holborn, Only one suggestion the rooms have very limited space for hanging cloths and this is part of the concept For two women quite a big challenge so why not using modern hooks which are just at the entry of every room to hang the breakfast bag also in the room to hang staff this will solve much of the problem Another point your design is cool but sometimes tools are hidden You could add a map where tools are to help people just to know I was looking for the hairdryer , I love this hotel This is just the style that I wish to have visiting a city Very young and nice staff Very comfortable and functional ambiente different to the classical hotel more made to share space and thoughts with the other guests it is a kind of community atmosphere were people are coming to talk not only to look to their smartphones and digital tools so it was a convivial atmosphere I liked it I felt in a very big living room the hotel s hall 
83218,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Hip Happening place Super friendly staff thoroughly enjoyed the comfy lounge felt like staying at a friend s place Great location Yummy food Highly Recommend 
83219,The Hoxton Holborn, Room was a bit snug it was a challenge to find somewhere to put our bags where we wouldn t constantly fall over then, Perfect location so much within waking distance and close to tube stops too Little touches like free newspapers and milk made a difference and any of the staff we spoke to were lovely
83220,The Hoxton Holborn, Only one minor thing hardly worth mentioning but the shower tends to spray onto the bathroom floor No biggie as we used the bathmat to compensate The Hoxton was a stand out for us Thank you , We loved everything about the Hoxton from it s central location for us to Daniel and all the other staff on Reception who provided us weary travellers with all the information we needed Then onto the comfortable rooms with all the added benefits sadly we didn t get a chance to use our free international one hour phone call opportunity but what a brilliant benefit for your international guests Wifi was excellent the bed was super comfortable the hair dryer was first rate the shower and bathroom facilities very good And to top it all off you provided us with our breakfast bags at an early hour for our departure the next morning which we happily consumed while en route to Heathrow Airport Thank you again We have already recommended your hotel to others including my brother who lives in London and from time to time has friends and acquaintances to stay in London I m sure he ll be recommending your hotel to them A first rate five star place in our books We will be back again from Australia from time to time and will definitely be staying at the Hoxton 
83221,The Hoxton Holborn, Only issue was the lifts not working but staff helped out with luggage, Really great hotel friendly and helpful staff and excellent facilities Loved the breakfast bag idea 
83222,The Hoxton Holborn, Both lifts were out of order , The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was great I loved the restaurant and bar downstairs and the staff were really friendly

83224,The Hoxton Holborn, No bath only showers, The place has a fantastic vibe to it The lobby area is full of vibrancy Rooms are cool a little small but well designed Room service is excellent housekeeping unobstrusive Front desk staff are very helpful I ll Definitely use it again
83225,The Hoxton Holborn, The foyer was lovely but we were unable to enjoy this part of the hotel experience as all seats were taken from early morning by non guests using it as free office space , We stayed in a roomy room which we found spacious and very comfortable We had asked for a quiet high floor room and this was allocated to us Staff from reception through to cleaners and maintenance all extremely pleasant and friendly 
83226,The Hoxton Holborn, Our room wasn t restocked with shampoo etc but we we didn t grumble I m sure it would have been sorted We will try to book a Hoxton again , The comfortable informality of the place and cheerful staff We appreciated the little breakfast bag Although most of the clientele was much younger than us we liked the buzz of the busy Reception area 
83227,The Hoxton Holborn, Hard to find a spot in the lobby to hang out abd work Just because I had to find something to say , Great location great service friendly staff modern and clean rooms and hotel and timeless design Hard to fault the Hoxley 
83228,The Hoxton Holborn, The bathroom was literally a wet room after using the shower so couldn t get ready in it afterwards and not very nice for person going in afterwards with soggy bath mat Need loo brush , Very comfy bed very modern room Love the books in the room Staff extremely friendly
83229,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Bed super comfy amazing location really helpful staff and overall a great hotel with amazing design We really loved our stay here and would highly recommend 
83230,The Hoxton Holborn, For that Tarrif nothing, Bed very comfy Shower wet room style compact but worked well and felt safe non slip and non trip Air conditioned reception seating merging into bar seating merging into dining area all with wide view through glass wall to street provided us with an attractive and relaxed environment that was busy not too much and entertaining throughout the day and evening 
83231,The Hoxton Holborn, The menu wasn t great We found something to eat but the choices didn t really appeal , The cocktails were fantastic bedroom gorgeous and bed really comfy Quiet and darkened room aided restful sleep We loved the breakfast bags and later checkout 
83232,The Hoxton Holborn, The mattress and pillows, The staff were very friendly There s a great atmosphere in the bar and great choice in the restaurants Location is ideal 
83233,The Hoxton Holborn, All positives , Fantastic location and wonderful friendly staff The rooms are exceptionally clean practical and modern Although small the rooms are well laid out and so comfortable Great coffee downstairs at Hoxton Grind Will be booking the Hoxton next trip for sure 
83234,The Hoxton Holborn, The room we chose not the smallest one up from that was really tiny For two people with large suitcases it is almost too small but we were only staying two nights so we managed If staying longer I would highly recommend one of the larger rooms if you re a pair and your budget stretches a bit further , Fantastic and very trendy hotel Great restaurant downstairs excellent location close to Covent Garden Soho and other sights The rooms are great really comfortable and beautifully furnished Good value for money highly recommended will stay again maybe next time at their Shoreditch property 
83235,The Hoxton Holborn, Room was smaller than thought it would be kept banging my shins on corners of wooden bed , Loved the breakfast bag Nice friendly staff Great location Nice food

83237,The Hoxton Holborn, The room was tiny standing room only Booking com and the Hoxton website use different categories for the rooms The foyer is a cross between a library and a cafe and doesn t feel like a hotel space , It has a hip no nonsense approach to hospitality Great use of designers with an eye for detail 
83238,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Great service at both the bar and for food Hotel it self was in an ideal location near tube stations and local food outlets Will definitely stay there again next time I m in London

83240,The Hoxton Holborn, Would have like to have seen in the bathroom disposable toothbrushes and vanity kit with nail file , The room was very comfortable The idea that they provide a fridge to put your own booze and food in was great They even offered the ice 
83241,The Hoxton Holborn, Bit difficult to close curtains as you had to stand on the bed , Bar restaurant vibe great design quality felt really on trend Room small but well designed everything thought of good toiletries lovely bathroom Loved breakfast in bag 
83242,The Hoxton Holborn, the room was a deluxe double very small shower no bath the reception was more like internet cafe so couldn t find a seat as it was open to the general public always crowded, very clean and helpful staff very smart decor good location
83243,The Hoxton Holborn, Staying only one night and breakfast could be bit more filling , I was recommended to stay at this hotel by my friend and wow it totally exceeded my expectations Stylish cozy perfectly clean very detail oriented music room design breakfast delivery to your room Restaurant bar downstairs is great for food and cocktails 
83244,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing to hate, Very nice and friendly staff The atmosphere is very buzzing And the free bottle of water at check out was a fantastic gesture that won me forever
83245,The Hoxton Holborn, Room service should be available 24 hours or maybe just be available until 24 00 every day A swab or mop in the bathroom to clear away the water after showering could be useful And there is no minibar but on the other hand there is a great bar in the lobby , This is the perfect hotel for a short stay in London I stayed for 4 days with a friend and we had a great time and enjoyed the cool lounge area and really good restaurant several times The staff is energetic and helpful and the atmosphere is great It s a 3 minute walk to Holborn tube station perfect And Covent Garden is 10 minutes away on foot The neighbourghood is really cool and low key The rooms are nice modern very clean and a good size There is a small complementary breakfast water and coffee tea in the room Great hotel 
83246,The Hoxton Holborn, I can t think of anything , The bed was really comfy There were lots of little extras like milk in the fridge and separate shampoo conditioner and a really good DAB radio The breakfast bags were really good to get you going in the morning rather than sitting around for ages waiting for a full breakfast Everything was spotlessly clean and the bathroom was super modern and user friendly 
83247,The Hoxton Holborn, service charges on cocktails in the bar was unexpected , Enjoyed the whole relaxed feel of the hotel and staff The bar area was very welcoming and laid back The hotel was spotlessly clean so the wife could relax and enjoy as if a home from home Would highly recommend Planning next stay already 
83248,The Hoxton Holborn, Room was a shoebox Had to crawl over bed to move from one side to the other Not good having stayed there over 15 times and having brought groups to the hotel , Good atmosphere
83249,The Hoxton Holborn, Could be difficult to get a seat in the lobby bar , The buzz of the lobby bar the comfort of the seats and the people watching Good food especially the breakfast good strong coffee and excellent dry martini I also liked the breakfast bag 
83250,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing negative to say, Stylish modern clean Hotel great location for Shaftesbury theatre wish we could gave stayed another night Breakfast in a bag to get you going great idea
83251,The Hoxton Holborn, There was a mix up with our meal although the food was good slight language barrier I did not get what I ordered due to the mix up Just means we ll have to come back soon and try again , The Hoxton has everything that we look for in a hotel we are not your usual mature couple we enjoy good music the buzz of the bar cafe we also love the quirkiness of all the signage its a fun place to be Love the bathrooms 
83252,The Hoxton Holborn, The rooms are very smart but very small But does that really matter , Funky d cor great staff perfect location free breakfast bag is all you need 
83253,The Hoxton Holborn, Nada , Rooms and decor were really cool Loved the radios Staff generally were great but the restaurant staff in particular were so friendly and helpful We had the best breakfast there and would definitely recommend the hotel
83254,The Hoxton Holborn, Having to leave, Room was great comfy bed and well thought out layout Loved the design and detail everywhere Really nice chilled out lobby area with lots of comfortable sofas and chairs to relax Food and drink was very good as well Would loved to have stayed longer
83255,The Hoxton Holborn, The room was pretty dinky but to be expected considering price and location, Great location with cool bar below Complementary breakfast was a nice touch 
83256,The Hoxton Holborn, Can t think of much to improve , Very comy bed room had everything required Nice toiletries and the brekkie bag was a great bonus Loved the interior design 
83257,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, I liked everything the design the staff the restaurant etc The attention to detail which I appreciate was everywhere I will definitely stay here again 
83258,The Hoxton Holborn, Slightly over priced was luckily to catch an excellent deal on Booking com at the last minute , Really cute and nicely furnished hotel in a great location The staff were really great and helpful especially in the bar and restaurant Restaurant was excellent for food 
83259,The Hoxton Holborn, Relatively small room but cleverly dispatched , Very cool trendy bistro coffee place at groundfloor Nice mix between vintage and new industrial design hotel
83260,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing , Staff were very friendly and approachable Doesn t have traditional feel of a hotel very relaxed Stylish and clean Music was playing in our room when we entered Water and milk in fridge 
83261,The Hoxton Holborn, Price of drinks at the bar but I guess that s just London , Great location friendly helpful staff and loved the quirky feel of the room Nice touches like milk and bottled water in the fridge Problem with a leaky shower was fixed immediately Really busy bar beneath our room but couldn t hear a thing so good nights sleep Would definitely go back 
83262,The Hoxton Holborn, The loud music in the bar area in the evening The over all cost was a bit expensive for what you get but I suppose that s the down side to being in the centre of London, Staff very friendly and helpful rooms clean and tidy and well stocked Afternoon music was lovely and in the background 
83263,The Hoxton Holborn, Restaurant service disappointing Was seated for breakfast at an unset table outside set restaurant area not a particular issue whereupon I became invisible I had to get up ask for service Similar experience the previous evening when wanting a cup of coffee I did enjoy the coffee when it came , Very stylish modern hotel Very comfortable room bed although lighting could be better Breakfast menu excellent complementary breakfast useful if early departure Location close to tube restaurants theatre very handy for my stay
83264,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Hotel has perfect connection from Stansted airport Holborn is only few stops from Liverpool street station Great location thanks to that we did a lot of walking tours The Hoxton staff are real professionals they know how to take cake of the customers Hotels lobby is full of young people they work there or just chill We will definitely arrive 
83265,The Hoxton Holborn, Room was tiny not small really tiny nowhere to put a case just a 30cm gap either side of the bed ridiculous not sure who these rooms are intended for, Location modern cleanliness
83266,The Hoxton Holborn, Ask the staff to tidy the room The claustrophobic room the rooms on the first floor that have an internal views force visitors to keep windows with the curtains closed because of the rats walking in the courtyard Breakfast box just the first day I had to ask for the following days , The location was great The friendly staff The mediocre restaurant 
83267,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, Upon arrival the staff were lovely very informative and friendly I absolutely loved the style of the hotel it was so retro and quirky it didn t have that uptight stuff feel to a normal hotel I ve never stayed in a hotel like it The little touches in the room just made it all the better the retro radio the milk and free water in the fridge nice to not have the pastursied milk When we came back after our night there was a DJ and it was so busy felt like a bar than a hotel Although once in Our room it felt like our own little home Staff were fantastic and was such a chilled atmosphere couldn t fault it 
83268,The Hoxton Holborn, If I had to pick something I d say the Dark grey corridors made it seem a bit dark but that s a really minor point , Great location double double glazing meant quiet and had a really nice boutique sort of atmosphere without being pretentious Loved Chill radio playing on the DAB when we hit the room just eased the journey straight out 
83269,The Hoxton Holborn, Love the Hoxton however they really need to be able to control the fresh air My room was cold even though AC was off I have stayed at the hoxton in Amsterdam and London Generally great experiences ,No Positive
83270,The Hoxton Holborn, Very disappointed with the room literally couldn t swing a cat and there was nothing in there simple things like a robe Not sure how it s a deluxe pretty poor, The style was very cool as hoped and the vibe is great
83271,The Hoxton Holborn, I don t think that I have any negative comments My girlfriend loved it , We liked the location the decor in the reception the friendliness of the reception staff I liked the breakfast bag and the lovely design touches in the bedroom and especially having a Roberts DAB radio 
83272,The Hoxton Holborn, Bed could have been a tiny bit bigger although given the size of the room I m not sure a bigger bed would have fit , Laid back and trendy hotel Staff were lovely and it was in a great location 
83273,The Hoxton Holborn, Drinks and food are very pricey Which makes you want to eat and drink outside the hotel , Trendy hotel great location easy access to all locations very quiet at night enabling a good nights sleep
83274,The Hoxton Holborn, I m afraid our weekend trip to London was rather spoilt in the end by the Hoxton Hotel My wife inadvertantly left her Kindle in the room upon check out Within hours she realised and we were able to alert Housekeeping who had promptly cleaned our room but had not found the 7inch x 5 inch tablet My wife and Kindle remain un united Be warned ,No Positive
83275,The Hoxton Holborn, Expensive I paid 63 more for my room than my friends did Also I was almost charged for my room again on check out even though I had pre paid , Stayed with a group of friends had a fab time Loved the room had everything I needed Breakfast gorgeous Liked check out time of 12pm 
83276,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, the bed is one of the comfiest beds i have ever lied on you never want to get up We were given free late check out as it was an extra special occasion The staff were so accommodating and attentive We stay here a lot and its a good place for an easy simple and comfortable stay
83277,The Hoxton Holborn, Only small issue no spot in the bathroom to hold toiletries A shelf or rack would be nice Only option now is the floor , I liked the breakfast bag perfect to start the morning Plenty of coffee and tea too Location was great easy walk to most theaters the British Museum and underground Friendly and helpful staff Fun design I always enjoy this area to stay in This is a solid option a bit more than the budget hotels but way nicer hotel 
83278,The Hoxton Holborn, Because the hotel bar is open to the public and there is free wireless internet available most of the lobby bar was full of the public students doing work As a result getting a seat in the bar was difficult , Staff were helpful and friendly room was comfortable and well furnished Decor was a nice mix of quirk and class Complimentary breakfast was a nice touch as well 
83279,The Hoxton Holborn, Didn t have time to same breakfast or other facilities so cannot really comment on these unfortunately , Liked the radio being on when I got into my room Bed comfy shower was cool style and decor of room was on trend 
83280,The Hoxton Holborn, A bit pricey for rooms that aren t big but you d expect that in Central London Other than that the lobby is always very crowded as it s a bar lots of people there practically all the time Didn t bother me but if you re looking for a quiet place the hotel entrance isn t one so you might want to reconsider , Fantastic location best in London for me Friendly and welcoming staff Room fully equipped refrigerator was very useful Clean good wifi service Loved it 
83281,The Hoxton Holborn, Staff were rude or unhelpful or simply not interested My room 409 was very noisy all night the sounds of machinery and vibrations It was difficult to sleep , Trendy hotel in a good location 
83282,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing , Really excellent location and hotel staff were really helpful The room was quirky and well laid out and the restaurants and coffee shop next door were brilliant 
83283,The Hoxton Holborn, More toiletries and also to have the option of opening a window Service charge in chicken shop was a bit steep at 12 5 , Beds where very comfy breakfast bags where good idea and we liked that you where not disrurbed as they are left outside the room Great location very cool hip hotel Free wifi throughout was great too 
83284,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The staff was helpful at the front desk and had a sense of humor The room was small but wonderfully designed to maximize the space Cozy and Clean The lobby setting was always bustling with locals and a very fun hip atmosphere The food was absolutely delicious too Eggs Benny were amazing 
83285,The Hoxton Holborn, The room was tiny the smallest we have ever been in not enough room for the suitcase which was small to be open and only enough space for one person to be walking around the room at a time, the bed was really comfy and it was very nice to have fresh milk in the fridge
83286,The Hoxton Holborn, breakfast bag didnt have non dairy option not enough options on the room service menu wouldn t even make us a plain pasta with tomato sauce to accomodate allergies , nice bar really good location made up for any of the downfalls
83287,The Hoxton Holborn, I would have liked a little more storage space in our room for hanging clothes etc but apart from that everything was great , The hotel was even better than pictured and the location couldn t have been better Room was really well furnished and extremely comfortable and the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly Will definitely be staying here again next time I m in London 
83288,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing All OK , Great location for Holborn station and theatres Modern hotel with extremely friendly staff Room had everything we needed Breakfast bag a nice touch We thoroughly recommend The Hoxton and would stay again 
83289,The Hoxton Holborn, Bathrooms only have that half door in the shower which means the bathroom gets soaked every time you use it no matter how careful you are Front desk said they were working on putting full doors in all the rooms that many others had given them that suggestion as well No gym in hotel they have deals with nearby gyms but would have been nice to have even a small workout room for efficiency sake given that there s barely space to do a sit up in the rooms, Great location Lobby always crowded with students and young people either working on MacBooks day or drinking evening Rooms are super tiny but efficiently laid out and you really are only there to sleep great beds and down comforters help Breakfast bag is a nice touch as is electric teapot in the room My room faced the street but noise was not a problem at all and I am very sensitive to it Desk staff very friendly and helpful Restaurant staff was a mix some great some seemed stressed 
83290,The Hoxton Holborn, Room was extra small and has no space at all to put my clothes in Lobby area is always too crowded and noisy, Location is very good Staff very friendly and helpful Food quality and price was very good
83291,The Hoxton Holborn, Mini bar was poor I ve been in less expensive hotels with much better free contents of a mini bar , Spotlessly clean lovely room lovely bed and bedding Fabulous staff very accessible near transport 
83292,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The bed was very very comfortable although the room was a little small it was very clean and comfortable the food at breakfast was very good and all the staff were very pleasant
83293,The Hoxton Holborn, Lounge and coffee area was full as hotel has a free wifi policy There appeared to be a lot of people non residents using the area , Bed was big room was quiet 
83294,The Hoxton Holborn, Rooms are very small Have good amenities but small nonetheless Ensuite could do with larger shower screen although shower itself good , Very good value for an extremely central location Liked cleanliness of the room Complimentary breakfast bag a good touch 
83295,The Hoxton Holborn, Although we payed for a cosy room the given room was anythign else but cosy Comparing with the shoebox photo on the hotel s site it seems that we were given a Shoebox room which is smaller than a cosy one ,No Positive
83296,The Hoxton Holborn, Shower doesn t drain away very quickly so the bathroom floods and everything gets a bit wet , Room very quiet for central london liked the chill out music being played 
83297,The Hoxton Holborn, Impossible to open the window , Well located really comfortable bed and gorgeous eclipse mirror in the room Super animated lobby bar perfect for some drinks 
83298,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The rooms are comfortable nicely appointed and the staff is extremely friendly helpful The lobby bar and restaurant have a great vibe Good location close to public transportation easy to navigate around Definitely recommend 
83299,The Hoxton Holborn, It was impossible to get a seat in lobby to have a drink in the morning because it was full of clients enjoying brunch So not a bad thing really but would have liked to chill on a sofa instead of sitting at the bar, The small touches including the wallpaper breakfast bag well resourced rooms with fresh milk and free bottled water The black out curtains are super Liked the DAB radio tuned to chill when inserted key card into the power source 
83300,The Hoxton Holborn, We didn t like the fact that when you put the kettle on it activated the lights which woke one of us up at 6 am Also we had air conditioning which we found draughty No instructions how to operate Also on our second day our room wasn t cleaned had to tell reception to sort it out as we could not even make a drink , The bed was very comfortable Very clean The breakfast was excellent thoroughly recommend 
83301,The Hoxton Holborn, At times a bit too much of a hipster place The restaurant in the ground floor is always very busy and overcrowded with loads of London start up hipsters so if you arrive after 9 am it is difficult to find a quite spot , Supernice clean dry and comfy London Hotel Very stylish Good restaurant conveniently located on ground floor Superfast wifi 
83302,The Hoxton Holborn, Trendy loud uncomfortably crowded lobby bar area Not a relaxing place to get a quiet cocktail or cup of tea if that s what you re looking for Being over 40 I felt out of place Room space a bit cramped , Hotel was sparkling clean nicely appointed rooms quiet and staff very helpful and friendly Loved the breakfast bag traditional tea fixings and unlimited water bottles Excellent location 
83303,The Hoxton Holborn, When we arrived the fridge in our room had been switched off at the plug so sadly the fresh milk left for us was not so fresh This was only a minor thing though , The bed was like sleeping in a big fluffy cloud super comfy The room was stylish and the rainforest shower was fab Really liked the breakfast to go bag as well a nice touch Would definitely stay here again Also the food in the Chicken Shop restaurant is delicicious 
83304,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing Apart from that I turned the air con off and forgot to turn it back on again and the room got a bit hot , First impression of the room was fantastic Jazz on the radio was a great touch really clean and beautifully decorated It even smelled great Reception staff were really helpful on check in Explained everything really clearly 
83305,The Hoxton Holborn, Nothing not to like, First impressions are that it s a loud vibrant young persons place how wrong can you be no noise at all once you leave the downstairs hustle bustle The whole place is spotlessly clean throughout close to Covent Garden Theatres which was why my wife I were there Very young obliging staff nothing too much trouble Especially appreciated being asked if we had enjoyed our stay by someone young enough to be our grand daughter when we checked out 
83306,The Hoxton Holborn, Wasn t too sure about the breakfast area and bar Obviously popular as is used by many and very busy , The rooms are furnished to a high spec modern and clean Great location just minutes from many theatres and Oxford Street 
83307,The Hoxton Holborn, We had no breakfast bag in the room ready to complete for the morning so we notified reception who took down our request Unfortunately our order was overlooked and we had no bag in the morning Slightly disappointing Good job we d taken some croissants The lobby was just full of people looking like techno zombies on their phones and laptops using the excellent free wifi which meant it was difficult to get a seat Other than that no complaints , There was a great atmosphere as soon as you entered the hotel The bed was comfy and we liked being able to adjust the room temperature We were well placed for our visit to the Dominion Theatre just a 10 minute stroll as well as for Covent Garden The room was clean and had everything we needed although one bath towel seemed a little mean We could have asked for another one Excellent soundproofing too as the hotel appeared to have become somewhat of a nightclub on our return from the theatre with 2 bouncers at the door which took us a little by surprise We did not hear a thing in our room which led to a good nights sleep 
83308,The Hoxton Holborn, It would have been nice to have a variety option on the fruit instead of just a banana , It was a compact and stylish room with a great bar and computer area The stage were very polite and helpful with anything you needed 
83309,The Hoxton Holborn, Bed was too small bar was more of a non residents bar so very busy on a weekend Could not get served at your own hotel bar which is a first for me , Laid back atmosphere free wifi stock your own mini bar and excellent location
83310,The Hoxton Holborn, The staff aren t the friendliest to be honest more trend than smiles The room was also very small albeit everything we needed and 2 nights was the maximum this room is acceptable for , The whole hotel was on trend and supplied everything a young couple would except in a hotel in the capital The bed was very comfy the curtains blackout and the shower powerful All the essentials spot on 
83311,The Hoxton Holborn, I didn t realise they re would be a 50 pound deposit after the room cost when you check in and while we got it back it was an extra cost that we then had to factor in since they said it may take a while for it to go to your account , It was simple and nice the room had everything you could want and there were so many nice touches like free breakfast to your room an amazing overhead shower and an iPhone speaker in each room 
83312,The Hoxton Holborn, Room we bought was a deluxe room When we got to the hotel they told us booking com call the room below deluxe deluxe on their site so we were missold, Nice rooms Nice things you actually want in the bedroom Quiet rooms good soundproofing
83313,The Hoxton Holborn, the rooms are very small and drinks at the bar very expensive view of rear yard , central location quirkiness of d cor cleanliness of room ground floor meeting area breakfast provision
83314,The Hoxton Holborn, Did not tidy the room during the Saturday so we could not shower before the evening Real surprise since everything else was perfect Were heading for a perfect score but fumbled it , Great location for the west end Excellent relaxed welcome at reception Bed and bathroom new and excellent Plus for a big fridge with fresh milk and complimentary breakfast bag The bar is relaxed during the day and lively in the evenings to suit all tastes however the rooms are really well sound proofed All in all they nailed the vibe for me even had cool jazz on the radio when I entered the room Real pity about the housekeeping though

83321,The Hoxton Holborn, Very disappointed that we failed at every turn to get a coffee or a drink in the bar with a seat due to all the people from work on laptops having meetings When mentioned to staff I was informed it was a restaurant bar with rooms I left feeling like a second hand citizen as I wasn t a creative with a laptop , I wanted to stay here as I followed hoxton on instragram I enjoyed the squashy mattress good decor and very good position for Covent garden and soho
83322,The Hoxton Holborn, TV control did not work had to report it twice still did not work in the lounge area downstairs could not get a seat due to trendy people wanting to be seen but hogging seats with just a coffee for hrs Hubbard and bell great for food but irritating that you still have not fixed the air con which ruins the experience , Good location clean well appointed room friendly staff

83335,The Hoxton Holborn, I was charged 100pounds on top of what I paid for my stay and when I asked the purpose of this extra charge staff replied so if you buy anything from us we can deduct it from this pre pay amount as it happened I only spent 6 pounds out of that 100pounds and didn t get the rest back This was not mentioned in your policy when I booked the hotel hidden charges are never a wise way of attracting customers I conduct business daily and I know the impacts of such behaviours , Staff were friendly Good location access to central London was easy and other places

83356,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, A really fun place to stay and what a location only a few minutes walk away from Covent Garden Loved the eclectic d cor and the trendy vibe of this place My room was a double but was pretty compact Not a lot of room if you had big luggage with you and very little clothes hanging space For a one night stay in London though excellent Everything very clean a comfortable bed and a quiet room Liked the breakfast bag left outside the door in the morning A banana granola and orange juice just enough to keep you going until coffee time Nice to have a fridge in the room and some actual milk in it too

83361,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, I loved the unique stylish finish to the rooms I loved the small attention to detail which set the rooms apart from any other London Hotel I have stayed in The staff were friendly and it did not feel pretentious in the slightest 
83362,The Hoxton Holborn, The bathroom could be a little bit cleaner Some of the staff had native accents that were difficult to understand but didn t speak more slowly when asked to repeat what they had said , The location is just perfect tube to Heathrow Airport places to shop and partying nearby The late check out possibility for 5 pounds hour is fantastic 
83363,The Hoxton Holborn, The reception area and around the bar could well have been a Student Union As residents we were not able to sit down in any of the Lounge reception areas as they were all taken up by Students and other guests all working on their laptops and essays , The bedroom was comfortable and well appointed 
83364,The Hoxton Holborn, We asked for an iron but were told that other guests are keeping it and hence they would not be able to lend it to us For a 4 star hotel I should hope that it has more than one set of iron As a result we had to attend an event with wrinkled shirts and suits The reception area is always noisy and crowded with customers for the bar coffee shop The room is also much smaller than it looks in the photo , The location is great Very close to the Holborn tube station and Oxford Street Soho etc The staff are very nice and helpful and loved the free breakfast bag

83372,The Hoxton Holborn, I had booked the room for a special occasion to celebrate my husband s 40th birthday and I made a specific request at the time of booking for a bottle of prosecco to be in the room on arrival I phoned ahead of our arrival to check that the hotel had details of this and they confirmed that they did but this was not in the room when we arrived It was obvious it had been forgotten and we had to ask for it to be put in the room When we checked out we were still charged for the bottle being brought to our room when it should have already been in there Also after we came back to the room from a night out a balloon was in the room saying happy birthday Although this was a nice touch again it would have been better if this had been in the room when we arrived We were not even early checking in so there was no excuse why these finer touches had not been attended to , The room was lovely and the staff were helpful We particularly enjoyed the complimentary breakfast bag

83374,The Hoxton Holborn, Hand shower in my bathroom was not working well so I did not have a good shower which is frustrating I had asked for it to be fixed after my first night but on the 2nd day it was still not working well Also it would be nice if body lotion was provided , Staff is great and very friendly Especially this gentleman called Trevor 10 out of 10 to him And really comfy bed

83383,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, The vibe generally was relaxed while the staff were very attentive and the facilities were excellent The guest dynamic was mixed which made for a relaxed feel Good beer at the bar too and the breakfast bag is a great idea 
83384,The Hoxton Holborn, The staff were not the nicest for such a pricey hotel and while the idea of breakfast bag in the room was original I would have expected more from this kind of hotel , The location is just perfect We loved the area and being so close to Soho The decoration is lovely and they do take care of small details 
83385,The Hoxton Holborn,No Negative, It was more than a hotel it was a venue you could do more in than just park your body in London for a night or two Funky fun with room to frolic if desired whilst retaining the necessary element of class

83388,The Hoxton Holborn, What could be improved facecloths dressing gowns would have been great hand cream body lotion as part of the bathroom amenities would have been great too What we didn t like Our room type was called a snug room when I queried that this sounded tiny I was told there is a smaller room called a shoebox our room would be fine for a 2 3 night stay Well gosh we had to ask house keeping to remove the chair from the room so we could fit one of the bags under the desk area This is despite the clever luggage storage area in the window box there s no ways you could lift a 25kg suitcase up over the bedside table to get it there Doorless shower Absolute pet hate No matter how carefully you shower the water goes everywhere outside the shower area around the toilet etc Ended up having to use the bathmat align it perfectly along the shower entrance to avoid mini flooding Which meant you couldn t use the bathmat to dry your feet as it was saturated Room lighting a bit dim due no ceiling lights, What we liked excellent location very central friendly staff little breakfast hampers left next to your door consisting of a bottle of OJ a banana a small tub of blueberry yoghurt muesli wonderful shower head with rain like spray even though taps directly underneath the shower head is far enough out that you don t knock the taps shower caddy well positioned so water doesn t drip into it resulting in soggy soap Mirror has an anti fogging device so that it doesn t steam up when having a shower coffee bags provided brew quite a good cup two wine glasses a bottle opener were very handy for when we decided to share a cheeky in room vino one night bought from the local Sainsburys clever use of space with the window boxes behind the bed suitable for small medium luggage extra pillows towels in the under bed storage was handy bluetooth speaker was fabulous to connect to our iPhones for music listening too aircon was nice quiet not too intrusive

83392,The Hoxton Holborn, Room described as deluxe by booking com it certainly wasn t It was the hotels smallest room which hotel describe as a shoebox It was laughable the size of the room It was a double bed against the window with no room down side of bed nor room to move around room due to a bathroom taking up a third of the room Price was discounted from 415 to 275 for Saturday night stay on booking com yet hotel said they have never charged 415 for this type of room I am awaiting a refund as room misdescribed and overpriced , Food ambience in fact everything apart from the room
