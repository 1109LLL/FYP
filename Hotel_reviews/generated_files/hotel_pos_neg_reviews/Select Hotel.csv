12352,Select Hotel, The room we were upgraded to featured a double bed made of two singles which kept moving apart , We were upgraded on arrival which was lovely Shower and bathroom facilities were excellent Staff were always helpful and welcoming they spoke English and were more than happy to answer any questions we might have Location was perfect courtyard had lovely places to dine or get a cocktail 5 mins walk from the metro and not far from Notre Damme or the Pantheon Lovely area for dining 
12353,Select Hotel, Breakfast was low quality although many choices There are great restaurants next door howecer and stores nearby Space in the mini bar and coffee maker in room was a bonus , Great staff great location quite clean and charming lovely rooms and common spaces 
12354,Select Hotel, Nothing really , Absolutely everything except maybe the coffee at breakfast but we are fussy re coffee We arrived before checkin after taking a week to cycle from London Our room was ready and the staff were welcoming and so accommodating regarding our bikes We were on the top floor lovely room and very comfortable bed Loved looking out our window across the Sorbonne It is a great location with an M S nearby for supplies 
12355,Select Hotel, The corridors could have been a little wider for luggage A better iron and ironing board wouldn t go a miss and The tap in the bathroom was hard to turn on too However apart from that everything was perfect , The location was great The bed was comfy and the lighting was fab Head to Le Petit Ch telet near Notre Dame for a fabulous meal 
12356,Select Hotel, Fairly tight room for three people sharing, We were three travelers and the room was pretty tight for three people but that is Europe for you The location was very close to Notre Dame and it was very easy to walk everywhere in the city Great restaurants nearby Friendly bilingual staff We were on the top floor and a heavy rain storm resulted in the ceiling leaking over the third bed They immediately provided an extra room for my dad for no additional charge Wifi worked perfectly Took the train metro to the airport due to traffic which was great location about an hour from airport which would have been an extremely expensive cab ride We chose to get breakfast at nearby restaurants so can t comment on the food 
12357,Select Hotel, The room is quite small but not out of the norm for Europe There is very little room to have suitcases open , We had a triple room and it was very comfortable sleeping for three people Good storage in the room for odds and ends The bathroom was actually quite large for Europe and was very modern The shower was exceptional Lots of hot water and great water pressure Nice room with wood beams in the ceiling and a view of the street in front of the Sorbonne The location was excellent on a pedestrian square with restaurants and access to lots of shopping and other restaurants with a short walk 
12358,Select Hotel, There s no where to hang up towels after a shower and the room was very compact , The staff are friendly and breakfast is plentiful We had a Nespresso machine in the room which was frequently used 
12359,Select Hotel, The metro was like 10min by walk and if you are planning to shop and use the metro it tAkes like 30 to champ elysees or Madeleine or etc and when u walk back to hotel from the train station is all up the street so makes u more tired after a long day , The hotel and the room was clean the stuff is nice and helpful Some restaurants around which is not that expensive a supermarket close to the hotel and many stores for shopping Norte dame is like 15min by walk and you will find a lot of restaurants too also behind the Main Street they are little restaurants that sells menu for 12 15 and kebabs and souvenirs 
12360,Select Hotel, Instead of a door knob there was an opening in the bathroom door, Clean and comfortable and the front desk was very helpful and friendly The location was very convenient Walking distance to Notre Dame and Latin Quarter and great restaurants
12361,Select Hotel, Some staff were not very friendly Took a while to warm up to you There was some miss communication with the airier pick up I gave them all the flight info but because they could identify the airline code they didn t send a pick up They could have easily called the airport or type in the airline code I provided But little apology was given they seemed more intent on blaming me for not receiving their email Anyway public transport worked out to be much cheaper and easy thank you Paris metro , Loved the location and the style of the hotel
12362,Select Hotel, It was noisy I was in a room in the ground floor which was noisy and not very illuminated , Location is very good charming neighborhood and square in front of the hotel
12363,Select Hotel, While we were lucky to be given an upgrade the room was smallish but this is common place in Paris , The 4 most important aspects of any hotel IMO were all met and exceeded expectation location staff bed firm and shower best I ve ever experienced 
12364,Select Hotel, Nothing, Our stay at Select Hotel was absolutely great the room is comfortable and clean and looks exactly as shown in the photos the location is great and the stuff is real nice The day we left our flight was late and they left us the room until the evening with no extra charge It s not obvious and we really appreciate it so thanks again 
12365,Select Hotel, Forget to ask about the airport shuttle , Fantastic location Walking distance to Norte Dame de Paris or Jardin du Luxembourg 5th arr is safe area and have plenty good restaurant The hotel is combination of historical building and modern design The shower is very enjoyable Already recommended to my friend and will choose again next time to Paris 
12366,Select Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location Walking distance to the Louvre and Notre Dame Cathedral Easy access to subway which takes you to champs Elysees and the Eiffel Tower Many restaurants and cafes withing walking distance to the hotel Staff were very accommodating and helpful Rooms are a good size compared to European Standards 
12367,Select Hotel, 1 Wish they their room service was actually 24 hours as mentioned Unfortunately when we ordered meals by 11 00pm the staff had already left The staff apparently was from the cafe restaurant next door , 1 Staff always helpful in terms of directions to places to visit hiring us a van for our Moulin Rouge show and trip to the airport sorting our very late dinners from restaurant next door 2 Decor I am a lover of cacti and this place had an awesome display
12368,Select Hotel, A couple of times when they were cleaning the rooms the staff appeared a little disorganized vacuum cleaners left in the middle of the halls Rooms are a little small but well furnished , The location is fantastic Literally walking distance to all the major sites Ambience and atmosphere of the area and hotel is wonderful not too touristy Hotel staff were great and informative Fluent in English They have the tickets for major attractions louvre Eiffel etc on site so that made it easier 
12369,Select Hotel, TV had only French channels No BBC CNN EuroNews English I find it unusual not having any newchannel in English where most customers were not French Please control your payment one day before check out time I checked my bill one before my checkout day In my case there was a discrepancy between their room rate and booking com rate It was later corrected I had the print out booking com t helped me If it were on the day I check out there would be problem Advise for booking com customers , I like the location safety of the hotel just in front of the sorbon university square 
12370,Select Hotel,No Negative, Best hotel we can ask for The location was absolutely amazing Near everything The bad was so comfy pls note that the bath is without door that way I think the room is recommended for couples only We will be back for sure 
12371,Select Hotel, At night you have to ring the bell to go inside the hotel and usually that takes time so be prepared to wait on the door from 5 to 10 min, Friendly staff
12372,Select Hotel, Each night there were loud drunk people out on the square in front of the hotel It was not possible to sleep with windows open The Sunday night concierge gave us wrong directions pointing us in the wrong direction to rue St Jaque He was also unable to locate the first aid kit that the weekday staff had provided for us after getting a small cut On our last day the cleaning crew only gave us one bath towel Lots of little mistakes that added up to a mediocre review The room was very small We had to dance around each other if we were both standing at the same time We preferred staying in the 6th as it was quieter and had more upscale restaurants and stores This was just our preference though , It was clean and modern Access to the Luxembourg Gardens was nice for morning walks Lots of people doing their morning runs around the park there 
12373,Select Hotel, a weak stream of water like all europe we got used to it we herd the noise street but we were so tierd so we slept good centeral aircodition work on heat in april so its a problem if its hot days we had 18 20 zelius degree so it was ok for us, lovly and helpfull staff old building renivation rooms nice and convinient rooms very good place very nice new shower good restaurants near hotel near metro clean room good bed 
12374,Select Hotel, The rooms are tiny and if you have suitcases don t get the standard room It s as big as my walk in closet Also the view from the back rooms is of other guests windows I don t suggest Get a front facing room , The location is good 
12375,Select Hotel, Booked small double we expected a small room not child size double bed I am 5 8 and with my head on the pilow my feet were out of bed resulting in a poor night s sleep Helpful receptionist explained the hotel was full but nevertheless moved us to a twin room for the second night sleeping in separate beds meant we had some room to move but again the beds were very narrow We would have liked a hotel bar area by lift looked like may have been intended as a bar but was not staffed , Good showers spotlessly clean clever interior design retaining original features mixed with modern art welcoming on arrival and pleasant staff 
12376,Select Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location with at least 3 Metro RER stops within walking distance Very central yet in more bohemian relaxed area than the other side of the river Our room looked into the fountains and had a lovely balcony and shuttered windows which made for a wonderful view 
12377,Select Hotel, Would be nice to have also some vegetables for breakfast , Perfect location everything in walking distance metro 3 minutes Notre Dame 10 Louvre 15 Pantheon and Cluny museum just behind the corner Very friendly staff clean rooms and good breakfast Choose this hotel no doubts 
12378,Select Hotel, No complaints but do not go to Boullion Chartier restaurant if recommended It is cheap but not good Food very basic long queues by locals as cheap Ran out of food options early in the evening , the hotel was well placed for walking to attractions like Louvre and Notre Dame Close to metro Shops cafes and restaurants nearby were good 
12379,Select Hotel, Wifi signal this is a permanent weakness in the Hotel And it seems to me that room 27 was not the only which had connection problems as there were always guests in the reception sitting in the sofas taking advantage of the good wifi there was THERE Apart from this issue I strongly recommend Select Hotel for those who do not mind to have a wifi operational signal successfully active only in the hotel reception But I do repeat this is the only dislike I can tell from Select Hotel and I shall be there again when i get back to Paris ,No Positive
12380,Select Hotel, The tiny lift and very narrow staircase to the room and the limited space in the room I stayed in could be a problem if you have luggage , Nice hotel in a great location near Sorbonne Rooms are small but confortable and have exposed beams Fairly standard hotel furniture and fittings and small bathroom beginning to show signs of wear Friendly staff 
12381,Select Hotel, Coffee machine at breakfast could be improved , The slippers the tea coffee making facilities the cushion in the bath tub were very very welcome and a true plus Very quiet and well located 
12382,Select Hotel,No Negative, Definitely not a 4 star hotel I d say 3 stars Very well located rooms are small and a little old Room I was staying at didn t even have a shower small bath tub a normal person can t fit in Breakfast was average only worth it if already included Bed was very comfortable and staff was nice 
12383,Select Hotel, There was no soap in the bathroom The night manager tried to find some for us in the hotel but didn t find any The safe was very small could not fit a laptop Breakfast was so so , Excellent location The bedroom was quite pretty The hotel looked nice in general 
12384,Select Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location extremely central yet quiet due to being tucked away from the main street on the charming little square in front of Sorbonne The rooms are modern and decently sized we re in Paris all the staff is always very friendly helpful and professional the WiFi works just fine The area is full of a perfect mix of interesting shops restaurants and sights to visit 
12385,Select Hotel, The Room is a bit small for guests coming for long trips with a bigger suitcase, New clean and reasonable location for restaurants in St Michel not too close to avoid the noise 
12386,Select Hotel, The continental breakfast wasn t worth it worth going out or the hotel, The opera music playing in the lift was great and my room looked far better than the limited picture displayed on the website I stayed in a deluxe room which had a great view of the area
12387,Select Hotel, The bed was a bit hard for us but that s simply a matter of preference , The region of Jardin de Luxembourg is a great location You re a bit away from the masses near the Eiffel tower but there s still plenty around to do in walking distance Ile de Paris with the Notre Dame the Jardin de Luxembourg itself the Pantheon and I could go on for a while more The hotel and our room was very clean the combination of authentic and new elements see pictures of the breakfast room vs the entrance hall worked remarkably well The staff was very kind We got upgraded to a better room with a splendid view room 56 sight of the university building and Place de la Sorbonne the nights were quiet the room was well equipped What more can one wish for Hotel Select and its room 56 are definitely a recommendation 
12388,Select Hotel, I forgot a jacket on my room so I would have liked if they would have contacted me to let me know I had left it so I could make arrangements to collect it before I left Paris to South Africa ,No Positive
12389,Select Hotel,No Negative, We had very late return flight and staff very kindly offered us use a room to rest and wait instead of hanging around Couldn t thank them enough 
12390,Select Hotel, Nothing, Staff is very friendly they upgrade me to have a room with more luminosity it s clean and a quiet place near by many things to stay in Paris 
12391,Select Hotel, Everything was perfect Merci tous I didn t have breakfast in hotel because we were walking all around Paris all day with friends but other customers said it was excellent , It was my first time in Paris and my room in Select Hotel was better than i could imagine l gance et courtoisie caract risent cet h tel The entrance warm and decorated creatively The bed was extra comfortable and the bathroom a real dream As a professor I appreciated the view to the Sorbonne University A real special feeling Located in Place de la Sorbonne near statione Cluny it was close to everything Paris has to offer The staff the chief receptionist and mademoisselle Tess were very helpfull and polite in everything we asked Politeness characterizes persons and hotels In Select Hotel politeness is the number one rule They make you feel comfortable It was Sunday and i had to return to Athens after 5 days in Paris because of my work in the school If i could i would stay more in Select Hotel i would do it without hesitation It was a perfect choice Walking down place de la Sorbonne and watching the view from our hotel window made feel like writing a poem Merci son merveilleux personnel pour l accueil Nous allons certainement pr f rer ce choix Parfait pour les couples ps I would definately recommend it to all of my friends and persons I appreciate I wish to return back to my room in Select hotel in spring It was un unforgettable and unique experience Thomas B 
12392,Select Hotel, all of the staff were very helpful and friendly except of one staff that he never satisfied our requests and inquiries he was not friendly and with short temper the breakfast is good and clean but does not have much variety there is no business center but they offer a tablet at the reception for customers when needed You have to walk 12 or 15 min to get to the nearest subway station , very clean room and comfortable bed good wifi everywhere except in breakfast place the hotel is close to some major museums and attractions like Louvre and Noterdam and other smaller ones the hotel is very warm in winter and has a very beautiful cheminee in the lobby very calm room that you don t hear any noises neither form inside nor outside of the hotel 
12393,Select Hotel, Could have been a bit warmer in the bedroom but that is more our fault for not asking the staff to increase the room temperature I am sure if we had asked it would have been done This is being nit picky though , The bed and pillows were comfortable The shower had great pressure The staff were helpful and friendly Location suited us perfectly as it was close to a number of metro stations fun bars and restaurants with plenty of happy hour s and the river We would recommend to our friends 
12394,Select Hotel, The breakfast starts at 7 while I had to leave at 6 15 I am not sure whether the labor laws in France allow it to start the breakfast at 6 but it would be nice , After years of passing 1 3 nights in Paris I finally found a hotel I really like and where I will return This was my second stay here The location is excellent the room is larger and nicer than in most of Paris hotels staff is friendly and helpful 
12395,Select Hotel, No restaurant and bar was closed at 9 I had no wifi in my room I complained 3 times to one member of staff and twice to another it never got resolved so I had to sit in the reception to use my tablet were they watched me do this, the hotel was in a nice location it was clean and the staff were very frendly
12396,Select Hotel, Rooms are on the small side although that s normal for Paris Location is a little more south than most tourist sites but transit is available , Great location right near transit and lots of restaurants but still a quiet street Two restaurants right next door even The room s are great too very comfortable bed everything was neat and clean nice bathroom Good breakfast in the mornings 
12397,Select Hotel, Shower tiles joins had some mold that were almost completely cleaned after I mentioned it to the reception , The room design and comfort is fantastic Nice combination of the old wooden ceiling and modern furniture and artwork Great bathroom and fantastic walk in shower Beautiful and modern interior Friendly staff 
12398,Select Hotel, all went well with me , I spent 4 nights with my wife in Paris I jut loved this hotel Very well placed near to RER and Metro in the middle of the Quartier Latin minutes walk to many site 
12399,Select Hotel,No Negative, A really nice hotel located close to Barrio Latino perfect to walk and eat The hotel it s really marvelous rooms nice and artistic the attention at reception perfect and really attentive and friendly and of course professional Thanks so much for everything I ll come back for sure 
12400,Select Hotel, Wi Fi is an issue Select must solve at all I personally talked to them in a very positive attitude But it is undoubtful That I shall continue to choose Select Hotel as my staying in Paris ,No Positive
12401,Select Hotel, Bedroom small for an executive double Little drawer or luggage space , Excellent breakfast but dungeon of a breakfast room Plenty of choice with far brighter ambiance outside hotel 
12402,Select Hotel,No Negative, First of all I have to say that amazing people are working at this hotel Marie Helen Laure Nordine and Mazier It is impossible to accept them just as staff These people are great people warm and attentive With lovely sense of humor Making you to feel that you are surrounded with close and really caring friends That s simply their nature The hotel itself is nicely designed I was staying on the 6th floor The room was functional and clean with very comfortable bed It was a bit small I mean the room but you don t waste time in the hotel room when you are in Paris The location of the hotel is perfect in between two metro stations Luxembourg and Saint Michel next to Sorbone and a few steps from Pantheon There is a bus station about 100 m from the hotel Although in the middle of the city it was quite and peaceful The fountains on the plateau in front of the hotel were creating a specific atmosphere When in the room the feeling was like you are out of the city near some river or waterfall Very relaxing There was an espresso making machine in the room with both regular and decaf coffee capsules and with a selection of tea Breakfast was good Nothing spectacular just good Some standard ham and salami couple of traditional French cheese home made jam selection scrambled eggs with sausage croissant If you are staying in a hotel for more than one night a bit fantasy while creating the breakfast menu would be highly appreciated But again everything was very fresh nice and positive If your breakfast is not included in the room price you can have your morning coffee with fresh croissant for 2 2 euro just on the other side of the street Also there are some restaurants and a Marks and Spencer express shop nearby in case of an emergency All in all it was really a positive experience Definitely recommended hotel for your Paris stay 
12403,Select Hotel,No Negative, Very helpful staff beautiful room with a view over Place de la Sourbonne fantastic shower with great water pressure comfy bed This will be our Paris hotel for evermore 
12404,Select Hotel, Nothing I loved the place Only complaint which is very minor is that I did not have my shower cap replaced more frequently , Yes the croissants were excellent Ideally situated to explore the left bank and also not too far to Musee d rsay and the Louvre Nice little restaurants close by and area was good for lots of walking Am planning to stay here again Staff all spoke very good English and were very pleasant and helpful 
12405,Select Hotel, Hotel seems over designed Design features sometimes seems more pretty than practical Open bathroom design is trendy now and there s a shower curtain that provided some privacy but there s no bathroom door Toilet is separate but there s no sink so you have to walk around to the other side of the room to wash your hands And there s no bin in the toilet, Location Close to Notre dam Convenient for sightseeing lots of restaurants and cafes nearby 
12406,Select Hotel, Elevator finds it hard to cope in busy periods e g morning checkout time , Cleanliness efficiency of staff good value breakfast Quiet rooms despite location of hotel in buzzing student quarter
12407,Select Hotel,No Negative, The location was excellent We had the great good luck of being upgraded to a large room overlooking Place de la Sorbonne Even though the street had traffic during the day the windows and air conditioning were spectacularly effective in making the room quiet From this location we walked easily to sites the Pantheon Jardin de Luxembourg Musee Cluny and just wandered around the small streets of the Latin Quarter We could not have been more pleased with the location the hotel and especially the desk staff 
12408,Select Hotel, Breakfast was just ok could have included eggs but that s very minor, Beautiful rooms with a great view from the small balcony Latest facilities TV in the bathroom Super big comfy bed Very friendly staff and great location 
12409,Select Hotel, Minor things the lift was a bit small there were no English language channels available and sometimes they were a bit slow replenishing hot foods at breakfast , Clever design made use of a small space so we never felt uncomfortable or cramped in the room Good hanging and storage space luxurious bathroom Generous breakfast buffet with a varied range of foods and helpful staff at reception The location is perfect for exploring Paris on foot or by Metro Very good value for money We would stay here again 
12410,Select Hotel, The breakfast is the weakest link They have an outstanding breakfast at Hotel Des Gobelins If they could have something similar I would never stay at a different hotel in my future stays in Paris , Location space everything
12411,Select Hotel, The room was a little small and the breakfast area too hot at times, Very friendly helpful staff always able to offer guidance when requested very clean rooms wonderful location
12412,Select Hotel, The TV didn t work although we did not call for help The light switches were hard to figure out I wasn t able to turn on the reading lights on the bed without turning on the rest of the room lights Not a big deal for a one night stay , Great style lovely lobby and salle a manger Good deal for the room the small size was fine for us Comfortable bed and very quiet Very good breakfast We appreciated the dinner recommendation it was very good Location was excellent 
12413,Select Hotel, The breakfast was a bit limited and the staff for this service were very slow Most of the people were complaining about it, Bed very comfortable AC system working very well during the days I stayed which were very hot Location excellent just 10 minutes walking to Notre Dame and easy to reach from the airport wit the RER B 
12414,Select Hotel,No Negative, The staff was very professional the selection of complimentary candy was a surprise the room was excellent as was the location We would definitely stay there again 
12415,Select Hotel, Elevator was a bit small but in a building this beautiful and old in such a lovely location that can quickly be forgiven, This is a gorgeous setting and very well located I will stay here again on my next trip to Paris It was like a dream 
12416,Select Hotel, The breakfast selection wasn t great and they ran out of a lot of things , Staff were very friendly Rooms were very clean Beds were super comfortable Liked the touch of a robe and slippers Coffee machine in room was brilliant 
12417,Select Hotel, We were up on the 4th floor and could not cool our room down since the air conditioning was set centrally Very warm Another disappointment were the directions from CDG airport that were given from the Select website Instead of the recommended bus we would take the train Much quicker and easier with no transfers Other than those two things we absolutely loved our stay and will be back , Perfect quiet location in the Latin Quarter delicious breakfast in the charming cellar great view of the gorgeous old Sarbonne University from our huge open window loved the mini fridge and coffee maker in room comfortable beds wonderful shower and helpful and friendly staff So happy with this small clean boutique hotel 
12418,Select Hotel, The cleaning staff was inconsistent and did not provide us with sufficient toiletries i e toilet paper soap so we would have to go down to the front desk to request them which was a bit of a hassle , I stayed here for 7 nights and breakfast was provided with the price of the room The location I very convenient close to several metro lines and also a 10 15 minute walk from major attractions like the Seine Notre Dame Pantheon Sainte Chapelle etc the area felt very safe and there are tons of restaurants and cafes nearby It is also a short distance from shopping areas Staff was very friendly and helpful The room we had was facing the street and we got a great view of a nearby chapel and the water fountain and in the evenings musicians would be playing at the cafe downstairs We were also surprised that the room was a bit bigger than what was in the pictures online Breakfast was included for us which was great because the food was definitely solid and there was a wide variety to choose from I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to be in the center of Paris close to tourist attractions 
12419,Select Hotel,No Negative, Amazing value for money Incredibly central Beautifully modern comfortable hotel unlike other hotels I have stayed in in Paris which would charge the same if not more The air conditioning was very much appreciated on hot Parisian days 
12420,Select Hotel,No Negative, The staff was welcoming and extremely helpful The hotel room was modern yet had historical touches that we loved The location was within walking distance of the Louvre and many shops along Saint Germain des Pres Wonderful choice for us 
12421,Select Hotel,No Negative, This hotel had a lot of character but what really made it special was the service Our return flight home was canceled and we needed to stay in Paris for an extra few days The staff worked with us to make sure we could stay at the hotel as long as needed 
12422,Select Hotel, rooms on the small side but man its Paris and this is a lovely hotel to stay in and area to visit , great location in latin quarter helpful staff modern elegant and very clean 
12423,Select Hotel, hard to fault , Staff super helpful and allowed my niece to practice her French where most Parisians automatically speak English it was the purpose of the trip Rooms are small but this is standard and are well equipped Rooms have ac but it appeared to be centrally controlled at night which was a bit annoying 
12424,Select Hotel, Nothing, Everything Firstly the room was amazing for a small double this was more than expected the breakfast was lovely and you can eat as much as you like buffet style the view from the room was lovely over the fountains and would always come back
12425,Select Hotel, No parking , Everything was nice Air condition breakfast good bed quality separated shower and toilet on the room And beautiful design of hotel and room 
12426,Select Hotel, Bedroom a little small but more than adequate Toaster slow , Very comfortable bed Luxurious bathroom shower area Central location close to many bars shops and restaurants Modern decor Great TV 
12427,Select Hotel, Neither the phone or tv worked but it didn t t matter that much we notified staff as we were leaving , Staff were friendly and were available when we required them The room was vert comfortable 
12428,Select Hotel, Room and bathroom were tiny could barely towel myself in the bathroom without hitting my elbows Had to sit sideways on the toilet due to highly inadequate leg room , Nice foyer
12429,Select Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff The hotel has everything you could want and it has central location but still very quiet and next to a charming square Place de la Sorbonne Excellent choice 
12430,Select Hotel, I didn t like the fact the toilet had no sink so you couldn t immediately wash your hands Also the bathroom had no door and was right opposite our bed If one was showering and the other sleeping and the bathroom lights straight in his face and the noise of the shower I know there are better rooms we stayed in better and will make a point to ask for one next time , The room was not too bad What I didn t like see opposite page
12431,Select Hotel, Breakfast could have been better , Beautiful room we went for honeymoon and birthday Staff was very friendly willing to help with travel information storage of baggage and tourist attractions Hotel was in a beautiful location wonderful view of the Parisian architecture Stayed in the smaller room which was still quite spacious with beautiful wooden beams Very cozy and romantic 
12432,Select Hotel, I was given two single beds instead of the double that I booked this was not changed for the first two nights of my 3 night stay the cleaner used a very powerful and to me at least unpleasant room spray despite requests not to breakfast was poor , the location was very good the room was of a good size the bathroom was excellent the staff were helpful
12433,Select Hotel, No thing actually , The location just perfect The decoration is breathtaking It is very clean in each aspect The breakfast is modern and delicious 
12434,Select Hotel, Was twin single beds pushed together instead of double , Shower was awesome Location was great Staff helped us with early check out Room ready on time 
12435,Select Hotel, Some people will find the rooms too small for their taste We did not mind and were happy to compromise on space for the beautiful decor Breakfast is just ok so book without and eat at nearby cafes , Stylish modern rooms and artsy public spaces Though small the rooms are nicely kitted out with colorful decor and the rainfall showers are wonderful Location on the Place de la Sorbonnie with its lovely fountains is very pleasant 
12436,Select Hotel, Proper double bed rather than 2 singles put together , Really good location great hotel good sized room and very good value breakfast Staff very helpful and friendly 
12437,Select Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location very friendly staff with perfect attitude I definitely come back again Nearby 4 closed secure Parking with 36 per day 
12438,Select Hotel, The maid service is iffy We stayed for 6 days and only had our room cleaned for 3 of those days although we left early in the morning and didn t return till mid afternoon The biggest problem is the design of the rooms especially the bathrooms It s as if the designer thought how can I make this bathroom as difficult as possible to use The sink takes up half the room leaving no room for storing toiletries but it s so badly designed that the water only trickles out because otherwise the sink would overflow The taps are round and smooth so you can t turn them off with wet hands which is kind of the point of using them You have to walk under the shower to set the temperature so you freeze or boil while doing so The rooms even for Paris are extremely small so you end up with bruises from constantly tripping over furniture Too bad because it s a wonderful location and the front desk staff are great , The location is perfect and the front desk staff friendly and knowledgeable
12439,Select Hotel, All was great with the hotel Only thing was the fee to get a taxi back to the airport was 20 euros more going back because the hotel was booking it for us Very very odd , Absolutely fab hotel Can t believe I was so lucky to have found it and book for our stay Beautifully decorated Super chic and quirky yet still comfortable Close to notredame and the louvre 2 mins from the metro surrounded by nice shops and restaurants Breakfast although basic was lovely and fresh Perfect stay Will be back Thank you 
12440,Select Hotel, Nothing at all , Excellent location very central to tourist attractions Nice ambience very good restaurants next door The room was only 11sq m but each and every inch of it was put to good use 
12441,Select Hotel, Rooms are a bit dated iron was old and leaked dirt on to clothes They could have cleared tables of used plates so we didn t have to, Great location easy to access friendly staff
12442,Select Hotel, Room was really quite small limited with 2 bags as was the bed though you couldn t have got a bigger bed in there I know they are in the process of renovating some floors and maybe could add better lighting to the hallways leading up to room and bigger numbers on doors , Amazing location stepping out into a little square with a fountain bookshops and restaurants The staff were great They had a laptop we could use which was great Most amazing shower head i have ever seen 
12443,Select Hotel, Wifi access was non existent in my room near the lobby and at breakfast, Awesome location just outside the Sorbonne Helpful staff comfy room albeit a bit small 
12444,Select Hotel, I had searched for a three person room and was disappointed with the size of the room and that there were not three equal beds The third bed looked more like a sofa bed Other than that it was fine Location is good cleanliness could be improved we found a big lump of hair in the room All in all I didn t find that the hotel met my expectations , The location was nice the beds good the bathroom and shower was really nice 
12445,Select Hotel, Pricing is very high particularly for early Spring , Fair sized room comfortable bed great breakfasts Clean modern and beautiful decor Good selection of tv stations Loved breakfast room spotless Ideal location Easy walk to The Seine Many shops and restaurants around Really enjoyed proximity to Luxembourg Gardens Friendly helpful staff 
12446,Select Hotel, Breakfast was somewhat limited , Clean well presented Hotel set in a lovely small square Plenty of Bars and Food places and only 5 minutes from Metro and RER stations 
12447,Select Hotel, bathroom tap designs were absurd trouble to operate with wet hands or know which was cold hot pressure in shower but this was minor should not stop a visit , position view from hotel would go back also would recommend
12448,Select Hotel, Unable to access WiFi at the hotel had to go to a cafe to access Limited selection for breakfast As always as a solo traveler I was given an inner room overlooking the courtyard , Good location friendly staff 
12449,Select Hotel, Room was on ground floor so very noisy every night and early morning and windows were on to street No full length mirror No extractor in bathroom so room hot Poor lighting in room all yellow and none in bed area Shower is boiling hot or cold no medium temp Complained on check out didn t get anything back more of a oh well look , Location
12450,Select Hotel, There was no dividing door between the bedroom and the bathroom No shower , Good location Staff were really friendly We arrived early and were able to check in with no extra charge 
12451,Select Hotel, We have no complaints at all , Excellent central location helpful friendly staff and very comfortable beds We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely stay at The Select again 
12452,Select Hotel,No Negative, The overall 3 day experience at the Select Hotel was outstanding The staff was superb with special thanks to Naomi the day manager The room hotel was absolutely the best we have experienced in Paris to date 7 visits over 12 years and a great value we have paid much more for less quality in the past Great view of square University of Paris and Cluny Museum and Notre Dame in the distance Room amenities were excellent We will return to this hotel in the future Great Hotel 
12453,Select Hotel, Terrible room was not accurate to how the photos looked at all The room was tiny the floor was dirty and the room was so overused and old I could not believe how much we paid for such a horrible looking badly kept room ,No Positive
12454,Select Hotel, We stayed 5 nights booked a winter garden view room with bathtub Arranged to the 1st floor which view was kind of dark and dusty At least not as shown on the photos No door for bathroom so makes room humid after shower Also showerhands was weak hard to being able to take a good bath after long walk The facility varies from room Breakfast was a bummer What matters is the service When I ask staff if there s any kettle Or maybe the cleaner forgot the welcoming water the first day they provided the answers were always Nop we don t have Nop you have to buy it costs 9 euro So are u taking or not I don t think a hotel deserves a 4 star without warm hearts and trying to solving customers needs and provide alternatives My recommendation is that it s no necessary to be equipped for every room but be prepared for some needs That s what good hotel should do Not sure if I was being picky because of this is my honeymoon At least this hotel has rooms for improvement , Location
12455,Select Hotel, very disappointed with the wifi in the room no wifi at all when I was told it was later I was told it was the location of the room that the wifi was not working,No Positive
12456,Select Hotel, Towel racks would be nice , We had a small well laid out room The shower was heavenly the bed was extremely comfortable and the decor was smart Perhaps the best feature was the ability to open the windows The hotel is in such a quiet location 
12457,Select Hotel, We booked a deluxe garden view room with 2 single beds What did we get A room that felt like a cave with a double bed no shower and not even a door on the bathroom When we asked for another room they said they were fully booked and gave us a bedsheet and a roll of duct tape to create some privacy for the bathroom When we checked out we were charged the same price as the deluxe room The complimentary water had already had a few gulps from it , After our complaint re the absent shower and bathroom door in our room we were shifted to what I believe we had originally booked That room was great but that could also just be because it had a shower and a bathroom door The beds are comfy The hotel is in a great location 
12458,Select Hotel, The wifi did not always work there was no hand wash facilities in the toilet the room was a little small The couple in the next room Room number 65 were fighting in the hallway we reported them which stopped it for 20 mins they then carried on for another 1 5 hrs we went out to them on two occasions and told them to keep quiet as it was 1 30am in the morning and they had woken us up , The location was good for us close to the Latin quarter
12459,Select Hotel, The shower fittings were very shiny and hard to grip but I gather they are to be replaced in September The overhead shower there was a hand grip shower as well tended to flood the whole bathroom as there was no lip to keep the water inside the shower staff , Almost everything location staff breakfast the room the bathroom
