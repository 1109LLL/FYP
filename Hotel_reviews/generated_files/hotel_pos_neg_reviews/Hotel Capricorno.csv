448920,Hotel Capricorno, I wish the shower had been a wee bit bigger , As this was my first trip to Vienna I liked that the hotel was a short walk from a Hop On Hop Off bus stop There were also several late night food kiosks and small cafes restaurants just a stone s throw away And the air conditioning was VERY much needed by this American 
448921,Hotel Capricorno, Nothing Everything was perfect , Lovely stylish room Superb breakfast lots of choice and eggs cooked perfectly every morning The hotel even provides complimentary tea coffee and cake in the afternoon Claudia and her team were very friendly helpful and professional The location is great just a few steps from a metro station and only 10 mins walk from all the main sights 
448922,Hotel Capricorno,No Negative, Location Location of the Hotel is excellent in Inner City and walking distance to all the main attractions like St Stephens Cathedral Spanish Riding School Hofberg Palace Etc Commuting is very comfortable to and from the hotel as the main Tram Station of Schedenplatz is across the road The Schwedenplatz Metro station is 50 metres from the Hotel from where all the main metro lines connect to all the parts of Vienna Rooms Rooms were very comfortable with a balcony that opened on the side street which was very quiet Rooms were clean and Air conditioning was effective The best thing about the room was that a Samsung Tablet was provided for free which helped in surfing about the main attractions of the City and tourist activities BREAKFAST Breakfast was excellent with very wide array of servings of eggs bacons sausages fruits good chocolate Croissants and very good Cakes Staff at breakfast was very good and took special care to the needs and requirements of the guests SERVICE Service was excellent and Staff very helpful to take care of the guests The front desk helped us with the bookings of concert online and suggested good concert Also the train bookings to Budapest was also done by the front desk staff after knowing from us our requirements Overall an excellent stay Would Love to visit again 
448923,Hotel Capricorno, The process for breakfast could have been a bit more clear It was only after I had a plate of meat and cheese and some yogurt that I realized I could order eggs and coffee I need to travel more , The welcome email in advance of arriving set the friendly tone in person everyone was as friendly and helpful as could be I loved the design of the hotel thoughtful touches were everywhere and it makes the most of the mid century modernism hipster vibe A refreshing oasis after the ornate everything that characterizes the rest of Innere Stadt Vienna 
448924,Hotel Capricorno,No Negative, The location is very excellent and close to everything the metro station right in front of the hotel the staff are friendly and the room is very clean and the internet is free and fast the breakfast is not of varied quantity but is acceptable and fresh 
448925,Hotel Capricorno, Dont prefer 214 number room which was a room with balcony because the compressor of airconditioner is in the balcony and it makes hot air flow to you very much I offer to change the direction of compressor , Perfect location good staff aspecially the breakfast team 
448926,Hotel Capricorno, Nothing, Friendly very helpful staff Close to the UBahn for really easy travel all over the city Set in a vibrant area with plenty of restaurants close by 
448927,Hotel Capricorno, Nothing except the Hop on hop off boat trip is rubbish , The hotel is right by the canal with public transport to every where Good restaurants nearby 
448928,Hotel Capricorno, This is a struggle If i was being pedantic a real pet hate of mine is music being played at breakfast with the volume so low its bearly audible either play music or not and if you do play music lets hear it This really is a good place to stay , Coffee and cake in the afternoon was a nice touch ad appreciated The location is great easy to get to from the airport via train and metro On the dge of the inner city as well Restaurants are close as well as some late night takeaways The area is clean and feels very safe The hotel provided us with an iron whe required Breakfast was great and the staff attentive 
448929,Hotel Capricorno, Wifi was very patchy in the room Was great at the door but got much weaker as you went further into the room No tea coffee making facilities in the room Breakfast area was very small especially where the actual food was presented tiny Not much room to move about in the bedroom and no table and chairs set in the room either Overpriced for what you get really , Very close to Schwedenplatz Ubahn and a few minutes walk from the city centre Lots of shops and restaurants around Nice sided bathroom Did have free tea coffee and cake from 3pm to 5pm daily 
448930,Hotel Capricorno,No Negative, Great location staff very helpful Hotel is right next to subway but it is only a 5 minute walk into the centre Hotel does not have a bar or restaurant but do not let this put you off there are so many places to eat and drink in Vienna Would thoroughly recommend this hotel

448932,Hotel Capricorno, The only thing that was missing was a kettle in the room for a cup of tea now and then but that is only a minor issue , We enjoyed the location as it was right near the hop on off cruise boat stop walking distance to center etc 
448933,Hotel Capricorno, No facilities for tea coffee making in room , Friendliness and helpfulness of staff A quiet comfortable enough hotel with seemingly understated decor which increasingly appealed Free tea coffee and cake from 3 00 p m to 6 00 p m Easy booking of trips and museums The location was excellent for transport easy walking distance to city centre and for transport canal river trains buses taxis 
448934,Hotel Capricorno, Couldn t have a tea in the room no kettle , The bed was super comfy quiet room and the bathroom facilities great Not forgetting the friendly and helpful staff 
448935,Hotel Capricorno, Could have being given a room with a front view river instead of back view garage since we made our booking three months before our stay and a non refundable one at a high prize higher than average rates of the hotel Our booking was for 4 nights not one or two so why not a better room There were no slippers or bathrobes for us we had to ask for , Location modern room convenient and relaxing bed Nice breakfast with viriety very thoughtful offering free coffee and pastries for the guests in the afternoon Staff very polite in breakfast and cleaning

448937,Hotel Capricorno, There are no restaurants around that are open late at night But it s a problem of Vienna itself and not just this hotel , Hotel Capricorno was a very pleasant surprise The location at Schweden Platz is very good a minute walk from the u bahn station and easy to arrive from the airport The staff were very nice and informative and the room was comfortable and practical very clean Each room I think has a balcony I had a bad weather but in sunny days I guess it should be very nice Breakfast was very nice a good selection of food and fresh eggs are served It also offers free cakes at the afternoon Didn t expect this one This hotel has the perfect balance between luxury and modesty Had a great time 
448938,Hotel Capricorno, View could have been better we faced the back of a building but hey you can t have everything , The hotel staff were really friendly and the room was comfortable the bathroom had a great walk in shower Breakfasts were well stocked and the fried eggs with ham were my go to for 3 days running so delicious Amazingly close to the Schwedenplatz U bahn station as well as trams and there s a taxi stand right outside honestly couldn t have asked for a better location

448940,Hotel Capricorno, Breakfast could have some more options Both time we have stayed there there has not been a lot of choice considering how much you pay per night to stay in the hotel , We have stayed here twice and have enjoyed it both times Metro is so close and the hotel is extremely easy to access from central station Hotel is Close to all the main attractions and city centre and places to eat 
448941,Hotel Capricorno, There is noise coming in from the trams in the street what makes sleeping hard at night when you have a room facing the Platz , Very good location Good breakfast good service clean rooms well equipped

448945,Hotel Capricorno, The first night of my stay I was in a superior room directly about the Subway restaurant Therefore the room smelled a lot of greese I tried to ventilate the room and left the balcony door open but unfortunately it did not help the smell at all I told the staff and they apologized but were not able to move me as they were totally booked out As promised they moved me to another room for the second night of my stay , Hotel is very conveniently located The staff is very nice and reactive Also the breakfast is fabulous 
448946,Hotel Capricorno, Duvets and bed a bit narrow , Very helpful and friendly staff Great location Lovely spacious room Breakfast great choice Would definitely stay here again Get the airport bus to Morzinplatz next to Schwedenplatz Underground pass well worth it for travelling around 
448947,Hotel Capricorno, Staff where arrogant and not informative Room where smelling Bakery food and onion form the down restaurant and staff simply said sorry what to do I changed to lower room ans asked for the rate difference and agreed to give back 20 Euros then on check out they claimed 24 euros need to be paid from my side as a parking but the night manager didn t inform when I parked my car and he told me that the hotel have a space reserved for the hotel in this parking and seemed absolutely free bla bla long story and I ended up paying them 4 5 Euros instead , Nothing I like in the hotel It was a bad experience I will never forget
448948,Hotel Capricorno, Small elevator , Hotel was in an excellent location with sights in walking distance The rooms were nice clean and modern I liked the continental breakfast spread They would ask you how you want your eggs done The omelet was superb Staff were very helpful and attentive to our needs 
448949,Hotel Capricorno,No Negative, I had a very enjoyable stay at Hotel Capricorno The location is convenient only a few steps away from the underground and bus station the rooms are small but very cozy clean and have a pretty design We had a delicious breakfast and to be honest one of the best coffees I had in a while at a hotel I personally appreciated the free coffees and snacks between 3 to 6 pm Also the staff was very helpful attentive and prompt 
448950,Hotel Capricorno,No Negative, Helpful and cheerful staff with stylish rooms the shower was lovely Also the free cake and coffee in the afternoon was a great idea The metro station was just a minute s walk away and there was so much to do within the vicinity of the hotel 
448951,Hotel Capricorno, Receptionist was very business like I would have expected a little more warmth from a leisure hotel If you have a side facing room and you like me like the windows open while you sleep expect a bit of noise from traffic up that street Not the hotel s fault but something to be aware of or request a quieter room , Loved the decor great lighting very funky furniture excellent shower Breakfast was fab as were the service staff in the breakfast room Also liked the mid afternoon coffee and cakes in the breakfast room such a lovely view on a sunny day The location was great and an easy walk from the city centre and Wien Mitte station for the airport train 
448952,Hotel Capricorno, bed was a little hard and temperature in room was hard to get right, staff were brilliant very friendly breakfast was also great love the fact you could order fresh eggs 
448953,Hotel Capricorno, Unfortunately the wifi did not work well at all which is a pain especially when one wants to check info online about the city or if one has some work to do Also the radiator made some strange noises which woke us up a few times at night it was easily fixed by slightly changing the temperature setting but nevertheless it kept waking us up , The hotel is the perfect city break hotel Great central location fairly priced nice down to earth breakfast very friendly stuff and cute stylish rooms 
448954,Hotel Capricorno, Absolutely nothing , This hotel is situated close to all the main sightseeing points in Vienna There are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants around The hotel itself is spotless out room was immaculate Our room was perfect for what we needed the shower is a walk in one fantastic Staff at this hotel are great always happy and speak every time they see you Very comfortable stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to others

448958,Hotel Capricorno, In the night something in the conditioning system turned on and very laut worked , We had two rooms for four people Size of room is litle but comfortable 
448959,Hotel Capricorno,No Negative, This hotel represents the quintessence of hospitality Sincere and helpful staffs with a heartwarming smile make you feel like home And the wholesome and heartful breakfast buffet can make your day 
448960,Hotel Capricorno, As the hotel was central there was some noise in the evening Didn t worry us too much though , The breakfast was great staff was lovely and location was central 
448961,Hotel Capricorno, If you wanted to be staying amidst the monuments of the Ringstrasse then this was not the ideal location but the centre of Vienna is so small and the public transport trams 1 and 2 and U Bahn is so efficient that it makes no difference , Really loved this hotel and it provided all I needed for my short stay in Vienna Good location with lovely room overlooking the Donaukanal The staff were so good that Breakfast Team were incredible always smiling and welcoming no matter how many people turned up at the same time for their great breakfast I sadly never had time for the afternoon teas as I was traveling so much 
448962,Hotel Capricorno, No tea coffee facilities in the bedroom, Modern clean comfortable boutique hotel Staff were very friendly and helpful Close to the river and approximately 15 minutes walk to the cathedral and centre Near to transport Complimentary coffee and cake served in the afternoon and greeted by hot wine and traditional biscuits in the reception area in the afternoon evening which was a lovely addition

448964,Hotel Capricorno, Nothing , Superb location for a leisure traveller U bahn station literally on the doorstep a few minutes walk to Stephansplatz The friendliest hotel staff I ve met in some time Very nice rooms with all you would need and a nice touch of free bottled water each day perfect after all the sightseeing and shopping 
448965,Hotel Capricorno, The internet you get only 3 devices per room and the network itself is very poor and cutting all the time, Location is perfect and the staff are very nice and helpful the 3 to 6 coffee time is very nice touch
448966,Hotel Capricorno, Nothing , Great location close to Schwedenplatz metro station with connections to lines U1 U4 Near Stephansplatz and all other monuments Great breakfast Very helpful staff 
448967,Hotel Capricorno, The carpets in the corridors and in the room were an unattractive colour and design they looked fairly worn The trolleys with room cleaning materials were often left in the corridors to the rooms all day I only remember seeing them tidied away once The storage space in the room was limited only a couple of highish shelves in the wardrobe for any clothes that weren t hung up I m not sure how we would have got two suitcases into the room Our fairly modest one had to nestle between our outdoor coats , The breakfast was excellent Eggs various types delicious and cooked to order It was a nice gesture to have tea coffee and cake available for free from 3 pm to 6 pm and similarly Punch with Lebkuchen from 6 pm to 9 pm The hotel was very conveniently situated for the Swedenplatz U Bahn also close enough to walk to the Stephansdom and yet out of the at this time of year crowded centre 
448968,Hotel Capricorno, They said there will be one big bed 160 cm wide but there were actually 2 separated bed one next to another , We prefered excellent breakfast and very kind hotel staff especially atendand who spoke Croatian and was very very very useful about all questions we had

448970,Hotel Capricorno, Little more chill out space , Hotel was very centrally located very close to airport bus tram stop underground station hop on off bus boat trip etc Staff superb very friendly and helpful Coffee and cake 3 6pm every day a nuce touch Would definitely recommend
448971,Hotel Capricorno, There was no proper bar at the Hotel just a small reception area with self service drinks But a mini bar was provided in the room Hotel Capricorno has no Restaurant but as we wanted to explore Vienna and eat out in different Restaurants this suited us well The breakfast was excellent , Hotel Capricorno had a fantastic position From this location we had excellent Restaurants within walking distance of the hotel Bus tours and underground were nearby as were shops all in all I would book this Hotel again if staying in Vienna

448973,Hotel Capricorno, tiny room standard tiny bathroom windows at 7 meters to the other building beauty bar no balcony pretty old furniture, very nice staff comfortable bed good cleaning good breakfast very close to metro and to the bus for the airport
448974,Hotel Capricorno, Since I m an early riser I had breakfast twice at about 7 AM and the staff seemed a bit disoriented at the time It took a while to get noticed one morning but nothing drastic Very friendly in each case , The location is perfect and the staff very attentive Rooms are cosy modern and well insulated from the outside noise if there was any

448977,Hotel Capricorno, Perhaps the lack of a gym and an indoor pool However if it was the case there was never enough time to spare as we had our day full , That extra treat of a coffee and cake in the afternoon between 1500 and 1800Hrs was most welcome after a day of touring and walking around Vienna city 
448978,Hotel Capricorno, I had very weak Internet To make calls I had to go to the bathroom I didn t expect this from a 4 star hotel Maybe it was just my room but still , Overall a nice hotel very well located 6 7 minute walk to St Steven s church and the very heart of Vienna and also right in front of the metro Line 1 The room was comfortable Breakfast was very nice a great choice of cheeses bread fruits 
448979,Hotel Capricorno,No Negative, Staff excellent at all levels Breakfast was comprehensive Free coffee and cake in afternoon Easy access to centre trams and underground Arranged reasonable priced transfer from airport to hotel 70 euro for a group of six 
448980,Hotel Capricorno, Minor point but step up from elevator to our floor was an inconvenience with bags Perhaps a short ramp could be installed , Wonderful location ten minutes walk from St Stephen s and fifteen to the Opera Staff very attentive and helpful Assisted my wife with a medical arrangement Rooms spacious and beds comfortable Excellent breakfast with good selections

448986,Hotel Capricorno, At breakfast time one has to order tea or coffee staff has to run to kitchen to bring each every cup for customers This is due to lack of space in the dining room I think this issue can be resolved by placing one or two trolley carts with coffee Tea hot water milk Rooms are very small , Location is very central Direct connections to Metro airport Bus vienna central areas are just steps away Hop on Hop off bus is just outside Lots of Restaurants in the area Iron was provided very quickly for the clothes Staff is very helpful 
448987,Hotel Capricorno,No Negative, good tourist hotel in great location access to tube trains trams buses and the river canal section easy walk into city center for food drink and sites the staff were very friendly helpful and polite breakfast very good rooms clean comfortable and ideal for city breaks

448992,Hotel Capricorno, i didnt like that the staff was short and they did end up helping us but it seemed like we were burdening them with to many questions that had zero knowledge about vienna and where to go and were not able to answer our questioned at all we followed the rateings on bookings com and have no idea what ppl saw in this hotel because it was small and dingy nothing of what ppl had actually said was true location was good but not in the best part of town u could tell by the crowds walking around it seemed a bit dirty rooms were too tiny and what we got in the room was not upto the standard of the hotel, it was comfortable eggs were bad breads were amazing servers were super sweet

448997,Hotel Capricorno, The single rooms are too small The bathroom is so small it felt like it belonged in a doll house The shower is OK for someone on the thin side Fortunately it was OK for myself but anyone over weight would have a difficult time taking a shower Carpet in rooms very dirty , Staff was helpful Location great 
448998,Hotel Capricorno, This web site is a pain I was staying alone in a single room but I have had to fill in a choice of Spouse r group pair or family Stupid Other than that there was nothing at the hotel not to like I liked it all , Great location in the Centre of Vienna right next to the Tube station Nice small hotel clean comfortable and attractive room Wifi and a very good breakfast Lovely staff

449049,Hotel Capricorno, I didn t like the bed l 2 single beds stuck to each other and 2 separate single covers not queen or king but it was like this in the other 2 hotels in Austria as well So I guess this is their couple system , I was fooled by the Location on the river and the Balcony So disappointed The hotel is only the 1st 2 floors of the building so you won t be getting any view of the river only noises screaming train sound and police siren from the street Rooms and bathroom were OK a bit small Breakfast is average breads eggs cheese and cereals 
449050,Hotel Capricorno, All minor issues No hair conditioner had only one bottle of combined shampoo body wash The elevator was very small and we had to take two trips to move our 2 pieces of luggage and ourselves up and down Also there were 3 stairs you had to go down to get into the elevator on the second floor which was awkward because if you moved your luggage down from the last step you couldn t open the elevator door No exercise room but I knew that when I booked it , Breakfast excellent beds comfortable and our room was clean and had a terrace It was the only hotel we stayed in Eastern Europe in early April that had a working air conditioning system to cool down the room at night The location was great the Schwedenplatz subway station was right down the street from the hotel Good location if you are going to take the CAT train to the airport as only 1 stop to the main rail station Walking distance to all downtown sights

449060,Hotel Capricorno, Nothing , Excellent location great interior decor and very helpful friendly staff But what I liked the most was that breakfast was available until 11am I m not the earliest riser and it slightly annoys me when hotels set their breakfast up between 6am to 9am or something silly like that I was able to get up leisurely not set an alarm and toddle off to breakfast when I wanted to The breakfast was also amazing If I go back to Vienna which I will because it s beautiful and we loved it I will stay at Hotel Capricorno 
449061,Hotel Capricorno, I dont know If they will pay me back the guarantee not a lot of inforrmations about that, The bed was awesome really I slept better than in my own bed Breakfast yummy and style of the hotel was nice
