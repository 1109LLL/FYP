482104,UNA Maison Milano, The breakfast in the room was OK but would have preferred a buffet or something outside of the room Beware taxi from the airport to the centre Charged us Euro 75 whereas taxi that the hotel called for us only wanted Euro 19 , Excellent staff very helpful indeed and very friendly They really could not have done more for us Would highly recommend just for that Location is excellent if you want to be in the centre of Milan 
482105,UNA Maison Milano, The sign for the hotel is so subtle that we walked by the front door twice , We stayed overnight The location is fantastic less than the piazza that faces the Duomo and the Galleria The room was nice sized well furnished had a great bathroom and and was very quiet in spite of the fact that we were on the 1st floor and facing a busy street The staff were very helpful in arranging transportation and restaurant reservations We wish we could had stayed longer 
482106,UNA Maison Milano, Just sad there is no in house restaurant for breakfast or other meals Would be just wonderful to come back after a hard day s sightseeing to go up to a roof terrace for a drink or two or three looking out over the city guess they have looked into it but that would be wonderful , Location was perfect The rooms were extremely clean the bed comfy with very good choice of pillows The reception staff were knowledge with good restaurant recommendations polite friendly approachable in fact superb We left getting into our taxi with the reception staff trying to sort out someone else s very difficult problem Como which I am sure they did with professionalism and a smile

482115,UNA Maison Milano, When we booked a taxi through the hotel to go back I specifically requested to be able to pay by credit card When we got to the station this wasn t possible , The bathroom was large and had all products toothbrush shampoo shaving cream etc The windows were really well insulated so there was no street noise The location is excellent just 1 step from the duomo 
482116,UNA Maison Milano,No Negative, I liked the everything comfortable room bathroom was large enough and had a bath separately with ocean salt The hotel offers 4 types of pillow which is really make comfortable your sleep The room is very clean and nice We had a room with balcony to Duomo Piazza The only problem is that the hotel does not have a restaurant and in order to have your breakfast you have to make order till 2 am They bring it to the room This creates a problem because you do not know what time you wake up next day in this case you have to plan your wake up You may also order in the morning but it takes 30 min to prepare and bring to your room Also the small table in the room is not comfortable to have a breakfast on it Therefore the next day I preferred to have a good coffee and some wonderful cakes and croissants at Crunchy Pastry near the hotel Bear in mind that hotel mostly has king size bedrooms and with only duvet cover it is not really comfortable if you sleep with child 
482117,UNA Maison Milano, Nothing , Excellent location very central Staff excellent and with a good local knowledge that they were prepared to share Charming rooms comfortable and functional

482121,UNA Maison Milano, Internet connection is very very very slow The phone in the room was not working so I have to go to the reception to ask for anything All this being reported and the do nothing about them ,No Positive
482122,UNA Maison Milano, The only let down is the wifi which is one of the slowest I ve ever experienced At some points lesss than 0 5 Mbps It should be improved a lot for a business hotel , The staff and service are excellent I was sick they got me a doctor my medication and helped me change my flight 
482123,UNA Maison Milano, For the price you pay for the room you should have the breakfast included and from 6 am till late night you can hear the tram car that passes by the hotel, Great location Very nice room 
482124,UNA Maison Milano, Cold bathroom But I received a heater Breakfast served only in the room , Big bed delicious breakfast Deborah and Ralf are excellent Nice clean room with a spacious bathroom and good ammenities

482127,UNA Maison Milano, room was not big as the photo shows in booking web site TV having limited channels TV reaction was slow pillow was uncomfortable water shower was not strong, TV was full HD room temperature was nice location was excellent lighting room control was wonderful
482128,UNA Maison Milano, The room was a bit cold even when we raised the temperature The wi fi tended to be a bit slow , The location was exceptional the rooms always clean and tidy the staff fantastic Loved this hotel 
482129,UNA Maison Milano, It would be better if housekeeping can be earlier There was a morning that we left the hotel after breakfast and then came back to drop off our shopping bags around noon but we found that the room has not been cleaned yet , The staffs were very hospitable and nice helping us with the car and parking Our 7 year boy felt very at home almost instantaneously He helped himself to the candies and was chatting happily with the staffs and another guest s son We liked this place and found the location a super big plus Definitely will stay here if I am in Milan In fact we will try other UNA Maison 
482130,UNA Maison Milano, I loved everything , This really is a gem of a find in the centre of everything the staff on arrival gave us both an upgrade the room as are so divine it is hard to leave the The staff are super friendly helpful and truly lovely people I had so much fun staying here the location was ideal for us as a couple and we could walk to most places The shopping is literally around the corner from the hotel so you will never need to carry your bags around all day The staff arranged for me to have my hair and nails done locally at last minute which was so wonderful I would book this hotel in a heart beat again 
482131,UNA Maison Milano, No breakfast lounge may be a problem for some but we enjoyed our breakfasts in good quality and cheeper local eateries , Our free room upgrade was greatly appreciated and enjoyed The location was excellent for a short break visit Staff were very pleasant and helpful 
482132,UNA Maison Milano, The pillows were hard, Great location near grayling good restaurants the galleria and church Having sound proof windows were a must and were very nice because there is street noise The staff was very friendly and helpful with providing city information In room breakfast was nice too Only negative comment is the pillows are hard and not comfortable for me The executive room was very clean big bathroom and nicely decorated Would stay here again 
482133,UNA Maison Milano, Yes a gym would be nice and the lobby was a little cramped But I didn t book a lobby I booked a room , The staff were outstanding When we had a small mechanical issue in our room it happens they went WAY overboard to make us comfortable and feel valued and appreciated They also gave a resturaunt recommendation that was outstanding an easy walk and something we would have never discovered on our own The room was incredibly well appointed and for an urban hotel quite spacious But the most remarkable part was how quiet the rooms were We were one level above a very busy city street and we heard NOTHING 
482134,UNA Maison Milano, As the hotel is exactly in the center of Milano it s impossible to park a car Although the hotel has a parking but it doesn t work late at night and nobody is there to even take your car and park it All the parkings around that the hotel cooperates with we re closed as they told us After 1 30 hour searching around the center area trying maybe to leave it somewhere with pay timer nothing was working and you couldn t leave it for many hours After searching for a parking spot through my GPS and Internet I finally found parking that was Close enough about 900 meters and left it there Actually I did not like that they only called the parkings that they were cooperating with and not searching for another parking as I did and I found easy after words The second bad thing is that Most of the rooms don t have very good windows so the noise outside can be heard The tram passes a lot so you hear it and it s a Crowdy area so it s a bit noisy either wise , It s a very beautiful hotel in the center of Milano so you can go easily everywhere shop anything you like eat everything you like and visit the area around and the Square People are very helpful and friendly Most of them speak English The rooms are very nice and clean nice showers and plenty of Comfort items We had a simple room and the junior suite room I think that the simple room was actually better than the suite because the suite was very long and and the bathroom was on the other side of the room It has a nice view and you and nice design 
482135,UNA Maison Milano, Breakfast is not included and the breakfast we can order is expensive We found a local option that was resonable , The room was quiet even with being on a busy street The windows were double paned The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spa like with great products and soaking tub The staff was very helpful with information regarding the train to the airport booking taxis and any questions

482138,UNA Maison Milano, Nothing , Staff was exceptional the facility outstanding For us the location was ideal My only regret was our travel plans only included a one night stay Hope to return will definitely recommend this hotel 
482139,UNA Maison Milano, Shower over the bath required additional safety grips and slip resistant base of bath It would have been nice to have a window to the outside world but everything else was very satisfactory Look forward to visiting you again , Location staff attitude and facilities all very good

482152,UNA Maison Milano, Nothing I liked this hotel so much I went back 3 weeks later The only thing that would be a nice to have is somewhere for everyone to have breakfast as opposed to in their rooms but I understand the hotel building isn t that big Still though 10 10 for me , Fantastic hotel room that s in an excellent location and 2min walk from the Duomo Staff are also very friendly and helpful and go the extra mile for any request My suitcase was lost on the flight in from Milan and Deborah from hotel reception continually chased lost baggage services for me until it was found Excellent allround 
482153,UNA Maison Milano, Whilst the location was centralissimo that also means that it was very noisy The hotel dealt with this with effective double glazing But if you crave fresh air as I do you are faced with a dilemma , This is a very efficiently run hotel with a very helpful and friendly staff I particularly like the little treats on offer in the foyer fruit salad in the mornings sweet treats in the afternoon and hors d oeuvres at aperitivo time

482175,UNA Maison Milano, Air conditioning system is too loud Fortunately you can ask at reception desk for switching it off and on when necessary , Extreemly helpful attentive and friendly staff Comapring to many other hotels beds are very comfortable not too hard not too soft There is more than you may need in the bathroom including nail polish remover and bathing salts The breakfast choice is fantastic Room is quiet well equiped and very clean

482179,UNA Maison Milano, We ordered prior to our trip to have a Mercedes pick us up via the hotel We were assured the driver would be waiting at the airport but after a 14 hour flight the driver was nowhere to be found I had to purchase an international plan on my personal mobile phone and call the hotel to check on the driver The staff called back ten minutes later stating the driver was not coming and we would have to take a taxi Not being familiar with the taxis and the customs we ended up having to pay an outrageous 160 euro It was unacceptable and it took too much pulling to find out why the driver didn t show I spent way too much money for 1 night stay to have the driver not show and cause extra euro , Great location next to the Milan Cathedral The staff was attentive to needs and provided a fruit spread as a gift for our anniversary
