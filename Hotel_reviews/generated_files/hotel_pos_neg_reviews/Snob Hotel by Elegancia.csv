256697,Snob Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, The hotel was in a wonderful location and was well done with its boutique theme and decor The staff was super nice and attentive through the whole stay Beds comfortable quiet rooms and a smart phone included to use while in Paris 
256698,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, A broader selection of breakfast could be offered , Very convenient location in the 1ier close to the centre pompidou louvre and other landmarks Staff is super friendly and cares well for the guests 
256699,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, nowhere to store your toiletries in bathroom need to add something small shelve or something, good size for the price and it being paris small but enough space bathroom good very nice shower
256700,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Room was very small We were expecting small but this was even smaller than that Not too much of a problem as we were out and about most of the time , Centrally located and beautifully decorated hotel Lovely welcome from the receptionist Close to metro station and plenty of restaurants 
256701,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, I was charged instantly for 3 rooms in spite of fact that only 2 rooms had note that card may be charged anytime This means that information about card data update has not gone to the hotel or hotel ignored it Hotel charged my private card for business trip Dissapointing,No Positive
256702,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, We booked room for two people but were treated as a solo traveller there was only one towel hanging and other hidden in the closet only one mini bottle of water toiletries for one It was a bit odd I actually like that they don t exchange toiletries every day to throw away soap after using it just once like usually hotels do but during our 3 nights stay I would appreciate changing bottles that really are empty The bottle of hair conditioner was damaged and couldn t be opened so we throw it away but it was never replaced with another one The room facing courtyard is a bit dark But these are all small things nothing major to complain about Overall our experience was great , We had a wonderful stay there thank you Staff was excellent friendly and helpful Great interior design very comfortable king size bed The location of the hotel is also great I would definitely stay there next time visiting Paris 
256703,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Our room had a glass shower door that faced the bed I ve seen this in other European hotels and is great for couples but I wouldn t recommend it for friends traveling together it s possible that not all rooms have this , Best generalist location for exploring Paris region 2 blocks to Chatelet RER Metro station with 3 RER and 5 metro lines passing thru Traveling in on Eurostar and out thru CDG was easy We could walk to much of central Paris also The staff was helpful and passionate about the City they gave us recommendations to non touristy spots They gave great recommendations and were very pleasant and helpful The hotel was lovely It s a boutique and was staffed such that they helped immediately with whatever we needed I regularly stay at the Westin and W for work the Elegancia exceeded my expectations 
256704,Snob Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, Loved the location of this little gem so close to everything Had a slighty larger room by Paris standards however loved the fit out and decorating as was different than the norm Great recommendations by the concierge for restaurants which started out holiday with a long French lunch with great wine 
256705,Snob Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, Perfect location for us Quite inside the hotel noisy and fun outside because of large numbers of bars and restaurants Special thanks to host Elina She was very helpful and made our stay at the hotel and in Paris as comfortable as possible 
256706,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Nothing to complain about The double glazing was very effective but if like me you want to sleep with the window open ask for a room that doesn t overlook the street which is noisy The air con didn t bring the temperature below 16 which is too hot for me The room is not big but that s exactly what I expect from Paris or other big cities, The d cor was quirky but very nice Bathroom was great The receptionist Laura was lovely and very helpful A brilliant touch was the smart phone provided in every room You can take it around with you so you can make calls internet apps like citymap which is very useful and all for free A good location close to the Louvre and Seine Plenty of cafes and restaurants close by Easy access to the Metro I d thoroughly recommend this hotel and will happily go back 
256707,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Room on street so gets noisy at 4 30 am , Croissant excellent but went to St Germain for dinner so can t comment on local ones they looked v busy though Staff v helpful great location 
256708,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, I stepped on broken glass in the room cut myself I complained but the next day found another one The hotel is understaffed 1 employee is responsible for reception go to rooms to check if ready and attend to breakfast No maintenance staff , Location and friendly staff
256709,Snob Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, The bed was the most comfortable I have slept in for the last year Staff were extremely attentive and helpful Hotel was ideally situated and not too far from any of the major landmarks 
256710,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Didn t realise breakfast wasn t included in price and was quite pricey for a continental breakfast Would have been nice to have some outside space or access to some Fridge turned off when key taken out on exiting room Ask for spare card and leave electricity on if you want to keep anything cold in the fridge , Huge room Great staff Beautiful decor Perfect location 
256711,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, I think the breakfast is a little expensive but probably 10 is the average price for hotels , They lend you a mobile phone that you can carry with you during the day which is very conveniente since it has 4g internet and free calls to Europe and USA Canada Great staff Good design and very clean rooms Rooms are very quiet even the one that face the main street 
256712,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Staff didn t speak a word in English Gave us wrong rooms and keys Didn t feel safe there Bathroom stinks and bed too Small Wouldn t recommend it , Room design is nice Location is good but the street is so so 
256713,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, The rooms are a little small And a small point but the hairdryers have handles that need to be squeezed to be operated This made drying one s hair extremely difficult but I can t imagine how painful it would be for anyone suffering from arthritis or CTS A more traditional on off would be preferable , I would highly recommend Snob While the rooms are fairly small they are beautifully appointed with quality wallpaper and beautiful furnishings Probably one of the comfiest beds in all of Paris The location is top notch if you want to be close to the main sights this is an ideal spot close to nearby non touristy restaurants but a stone s throw from the Pompidou and a 10 minute walk to the Louvre etc Staff friendly and helpful The whole experience felt like terrific value and I ll stay here again when next in Paris 
256714,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, The rooms are a little small but it didn t bother us at all , Fantastic staff Always going the extra mile to ensure we had everything we needed Coffee and pastries on demand The room comes with a smart phone which is so useful when exploring the city Incredibly well maintained and beautifully decorated hotel Highly recommend 
256715,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, There wasn t anything we didn t like although it would ve been better if the sink was in with the toilet rather than having to walk across the room to get to it , Staff were AMAZING a really friendly bunch who were happy to chat about our day and give lots of tips and advice 
256716,Snob Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, A fabulous little boutique hotel in a perfect location run by lovely helpful staff The area has seen much gentrification recently and the hotel is a perfect gothic nod to something a little fun Location is an easy 20 minute stroll to the Louvre 2 minutes from lovely restaurants and great for the Metro and RER stations We stayed but one night in a very comfy bed and wish it had been longer We will definitely stay again for our next trip to Paris 
256717,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Nothing to write here, Staff were incredibly helpful The shower was gorgeous The TV the bed the wardrobe space the design the charger ports we only brought one adaptor so this came in handy The hotel is just simply stunning We will definitely return It should be 5 star hotel 
256718,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Have contacted the hotel several times about receiving my deposit and now they ignore my emails and arriving to the room and finding 2 bottles of poppers in the room after it had been cleaned Wouldn t advise paying for breakfast as it is below average , Location is okay and well decorated 
256719,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Check out could have been faster , Beautifully designed cosy room with lots of amenities and a great bed the lounge and foyer is beautifully decorated too Staff were generally very smiley and chatty which is a plus if you re visiting the city for the first time and need great tips 
256720,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, My single room was a little bit to narrow for my morning exercise I think you can ask for a larger single room so no big deal just good to keep in mind for next visit ,No Positive
256721,Snob Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, The hotel is located right next to Les Halles which makes it very easy for exploration on foot or by public transport We had a really nice room facing the inner courtyard so it was very quiet All in all I was very happy with the hotel location staff and room Definitely one to go back to 
256722,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, The breakfast was shown on the confirmation as 7euro per person but the hotel claimed on arrival it was 10euro we went elsewhere, Superb hotel great location and fab staff
256723,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, When we arrived our room was overbooked After that they put us in the room on the first floor which was very noisy Then we changed rooms to a one person room When we checked out there wasn t even an apologize i had to get angry for a small compensation , The location was great 
256724,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, For such a small room the design made it feel even smaller Having drawers instead of fake drawers not having a spare toilet paper holder that blocks the front of the toilet not having doors on the wardrobe which would allow guests to put a suitcase on the floor in front of the wardrobe would make the room space more usable , Staff was great Location close to Louve Notre Dame and Metro as well as RER Room was kept very clean 
256725,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, There was not much room for maneuvering around the bed They really did a great job making it work but it was a little inconvenient Can t imagine if there were two of us , I loved the free mobile phone for use during stay Was really nice to have unlimited data while overseas 
256726,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, Wish there was an extra room for breakfast , Completely remodeled hotel in the heart of Paris Walking distance to pretty much everything Pompidou Marais Notre Dame Breakfast was excellent for French standards The French don t really eat a big breakfast The breakfast area is right at the entrance hallway of the hotel Not that many seats so this could get crowded in the mornings in the peak season Rooms are small but clean and very comfortable everything you need for a wonderful stay 
256727,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, The room was very tiny we actually had to crawl over the bed to get to the bathroom So old folks with no gym experience don t go here , LOVED the decor and the Flamingo wallpaper The styling is great Nice people at the frontdesk 
256728,Snob Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, Great Hotel Very comfortable and so close to everything in Paris The staff was very friendly and helpful The Price was absolutely Fine as the Design of the Hotel is very nice and the Service is very good I can recommend this Hotel to couples for a Romantic Trip 
256729,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, No fridge Could barely put anything on the very small desk Tiny room , Excellent location Train and metro stations and louvre museum within walking distance Many eating places ard hotel Extremely comfy bed Provided luggage rack toiletries bathrobes and slippers Also pleasantly surprised by free evian water and coffee tea gryphon tea making facilities Oh and the lovely complimentary chocolates and note on New year day 
256730,Snob Hotel by Elegancia, There was a albeit light garbage smell at the aisle probably because my room was on the first floor and close to the street , The very friendly and extremely helpful staff Excellent location in the heart of the city
