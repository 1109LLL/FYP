483612,Hotel Berna, We asked for a quiet room and got a room facing the back It was an unusual set up with a bathroom with a very large frosted window and a glass frosted sliding door There were street lights close to the bathroom window and the rooms bathroom and bedroom were full of light at night We couldn t darken the bedroom there were no blinds or curtains on the bathroom window and we couldn t sleep Because of the unusual design there was a step between the bedroom and the bathroom Dangerous We were continually tripping going in and out of the bathroom The air conditioning didn t work properly at all even when we set the temperature at 17 degrees Because of the way the room was set up the circulation was poor We ended up sweating despite the air conditioning , Close to train station helpful staff good breakfast 
483613,Hotel Berna, Shower a little small and shower head kept dropping in room 126 but still usable Otherwise rooms kept very clean and air conditioning excellent , Breakfast very comprehensive but bacon and fried eggs would have been a nice addition to simply scrambled eggs and frankfurters Staff always positive in attitude and helpful

483656,Hotel Berna, due to the location near the station the street is noisy internally you can also hear bathroom noises from other rooms water draining away, convenient location friendly and helpful staff comfortable room
483657,Hotel Berna, The only criticism is that the toiletries provided were a little basic one bottle of liquid soap and one bottle of shampoo bath gel The shampoo did not suit my hair so I would take my own next time It would have been nice to have conditioner and body lotion I took my own to be on the safe side so I didn t ask for any so I can t say whether the hotel would have provided them on request or not , This is a fantastic place to stay The staff couldn t have been more helpful and were all very smiley and friendly The breakfast buffet was amazing and they also have a free buffet in the evening in the bar for anyone who buys a drink You can customise your room online before your stay to ask for extra pillows free soft drinks etc The hotel is just down the road from the Central Station so it s very easy to get to and travelling around is no problem Premiership football matches were shown in the bar plus point for us We stayed in the Tower which is just across the road from the main hotel an ensuite double room was under 70 a night including breakfast The room had air con plenty of towels a TV a hairdryer a safe a wardrobe with plenty of hangers a mirror with power points nearby and the bathroom had both a bath and shower I would recommend Hotel Berna unreservedly

483661,Hotel Berna,No Negative, The staff was so helpful We dropped off rental car around the corner instead of having to drive across town because Andrea G Got in touch with Hertz Massimiliano in the bar was fabulous Very friendly helpful Everyone was great 
483662,Hotel Berna, The price is high but that s Milan The buffet breakfast is a bit dependent on tinned fruit and packet ham but there is good bread and croissants some fresh fruit and a cooked choice Generous for Italy They are particularly geared to American visitors but if you don t mind the lack of local colour this is a good choice particularly if you are staying just one night and leaving by train , Convenient if rather anonymous location with some quite nice modest restaurants nearby Some extras have to be paid for e g charger for electronics The single rooms have beds of conventual size but are clean and comfortable and recently redecorated Computer use for nothing and lots of free water Friendly staff 
483663,Hotel Berna, the women on the reception was very rude to myself and my colleague as she assumed that we could not understand Italian she talked behind our backs to her colleagues in an un processional manner ,No Positive
483664,Hotel Berna, Shower was a bit small for two people in the double room And the city tax That s all , The staff was amazing and they helped with whatever help we needed The transport was right there The rooms were good enough size and I liked the mirrors there Also wifi was very good and that was important They even had a menu and you could order food D If someone is looking for a hotel near the Centrale station this one would be it 
483665,Hotel Berna, Just an FYI there were about 6 steps to just get into the hotel and hauling up our luggage was a bit of a challenge until a staff member came and helped , SUPER friendly staff Rooms were comfortable although cozy for 3 people The 3 of us kept saying the rooms and hallways reminded us of being on a cruise ship The included breakfast was plentiful with a lot of selection and location was well situated to the central train station We were able to buy our metro tickets from the hotel to travel around the city as needed

483668,Hotel Berna, The room was too small actually a bed with less than 1 meter width clearance around it To show the room bigger one complete wall was covered by a mirrors so when you sleep on the bed you d see yourself in the mirror kind of Redlight ish The hotel had a beef with Booking com apparently and the locate booking s customer s in lower grade rooms If they are not happy with it they should close their listing simple , It was very close to Milan central station
483669,Hotel Berna, We stayed in Hotel Berna some five years ago and were very satisfied because of the friendly service So we booked it now again without even looking at other hotels When we arrived with two big suitcases backbag etc in the afternoon we were not greeted by a smile but a statement that we had already checked in as if we had done something wrong It did not start well but thanks to Cesare everything was made good again , Excellent location when arriving by train Great breakfast Complementary soft drinks in the fridge Large and quiet room Friendly staff

483681,Hotel Berna, I missed a bathrobe maybe I could have asked for it but was too lazy D And a little bit soundproofing not from the street since I had a quiet room to the backyard but from the hotels inside It was fine when I got up at 8 AM but one night I had an opportunity to sleep a little bit longer till 9 30 and it was not very possible since some guest or and cleaning action and vacuuming or similar began as soon as 8 30 and were very much heard , I especially loved the ability to chose my bedding pillow and blanket staff was attentive And great variety at breakfast table there was something different each of the 3 days I was there Yes and free drinks and cookies was a great plus for me especially when I arrived at the middle of the night 
483682,Hotel Berna,No Negative, We were really impressed by the personalized service we received from the hotel staff The front desk even remembered our names when we stopped in a bit after check in to ask them to book us a table at a nearby restaurant The location was excellent only a few minutes away from the central rail station and there were many great restaurants and bars in the vicinity

483688,Hotel Berna,No Negative, Just about my favorite hotel anywhere It s not in a scenic or atmospheric location but that s about it s only flaw Very convenient to Milano Centrale literally five minutes walk Metro even closer and you are in the center in 10 minutes The best thing about the hotel is the breakfast buffet which there are no words to describe 
483689,Hotel Berna, Old hotel Room small like a coffin Bad bathroom Second hand toiletries Two stars not four Expensive for nothing The owner is shallow greedy one sees that, Only the breakfast

483693,Hotel Berna, There is actually nothing to complain about It was a little bit weird at first when I was told that my room is not in this building it is in another building accross the street but don t worry it is the hotel s property as well not because there is no room in the main building or something else I just had to go to main building for breakfast but it wasn t a problem walking 10 seconds more that s it I can also say that hairdryer could be better , Everything was perfect Hotel is at 2 min walking distance to central railway station from which you can directly access to Malpensa airport and touristic locations of Milano The hotel cares much about the cleanliness even the elevator was clean and smelling nice Room facilities are very good Bed is large even if I stayed in a single room and comfortable Minibar is free you can drink water cola juice coffee tea in room without paying anything Zero noise from outside you can get a good sleep Fast and stable WiFi connection Last but not least breakfast is excellent rich content and tasty I really felt that Hotel Berna is doing everything as best as possible to please the guests

483730,Hotel Berna, I know it might be normal in Milano but sorry this place is way to expensive for what it offers I am not saying in comparison to other Hotels in Milano just in comparison to my general feeling after travelling for years The people working at the reception are not exactly angels of politeness but we got along Location was good if you were merely passing through Milano but a bit far from the center if you want to avoid metros about 30 minutes walking , Nice clean room Would be an 8 5 if the price of the rooms was halved

483979,Hotel Berna, Not much to dislike although next time I would prefer to be in a larger room in the main building , This is great hotel largely due to the fantastic staff handy position and generously stocked rooms and copious food options at breakfast We were Supplied with a breakfast box at 5 am as we had to catch the train to Paris at 6 am That is what I call service The hotel is a little old fashioned in some ways although the wf works a treat but it is so so comfortable
