43883,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Wish they provided complimentary coffee and tea , The office and desk staff were very helpful and friendly Loved being in 6th Arr Go to Gerard Mulot s patisserie Perfect walking to Musee D Orsay Jardin des Tuileries Musee de l Orangerie Place des Vosges Sainte Chapelle Musee Rodin 
43884,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, No coffee machine in the room You had to go upstairs one floor to the lift and the lift was tiny just room for one person and their luggage , The rooms are very small but lovely Likewise is the bathroom and shower cubicle Nice toiletries 
43885,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, This location is certainly not for everyone It s rustic and old with small rooms and cramped elevators etc as a result of the original building being from the middle ages It s harming however and very central to great shopping dining and numerous tourist attractions can t beat those qualities for the price , Wonderful property in one of the best locations in Paris 
43886,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Too small for us and limited facilities Also no flannels or face cloths in bathrooms , Great boutique for a single traveller as rooms to small for more then one 
43887,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, The price is a touch steep since it competes with the prices you could pay in the 1st Arr , Perfect central location to many desirable sights including the Notre Dame and the Latin Quarter a cooler part of Paris with slightly fewer tourists than the 1st or 16th Arr Rooms are edgy style and clean with lots of space 
43888,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain,No Negative, Hotel Odeon is in a beautiful and central location to visit Paris The reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly Our room was lovely and very clean 
43889,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Replace bath shower with a bigger shower , Outstanding position In lively Paris The staff were helpful and good A classy old building in prime position the room was a little cramped 
43890,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, definitely not worth 4 5 stars The rooms were tiny and very dark The bathroom had sticky floors and it was just a nightmare I think everyone books this hotel because of the 4 5 stars but their rating is sooo high because only 4 people have rated them and that s what mislead us Def not worth 200 a night Never ever again , Nothing to like 
43891,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Safe was broken held my passport and cash without receipts had to beg for soap and towels Fruit was old and bruised Should have not been charged 85 for bar in room since I did not have a safe and electricity went out and food spiiled, Staff were pleasant
43892,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, The bathtub shower was hard for me to navigate I have had major back surgery so I imagine it s okay for most people just not the elderly or disabled , Perfect location 
43893,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Small room with tiny bathroom I didn t fit under the shower and I m not even 1 90 m , Very comfortable and pleasant boutique hotel helpful friendly staff breakfast good value for money 
43894,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain,No Negative, The staff was outstanding They did everything they could to make the stay enjoyable This group were real hospitality professionals The hotel is in a great location and great restaurants are very near You can easily walk to Notre Dam and the Lovre if you are in average health 
43895,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, But the hardware is not quite well and the room is a bit small For the breakfast there are little choose , The service is quite good But the location is really nice for visitor Convenience and safe 
43896,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain,No Negative, Absolutely fine This elegant hotel has a beautiful lobby and entrance and is perfectly located We were in the smallest room and you do get what you pay for The room was tight and a bit tired but the rest of the hotel was quite nice 
43897,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Ask for bigger than a standard cramped room In Feb radiator on full still not warm enough and climate control was switched off blanket or extra heater promptly offered No in room tea coffee maker as offered in many lesser Paris hotels Wall fixed hairdryer components constantly fell apart in hand Generally quiet but walls slightly too thin could hear events next door View onto drab rear courtyard, Attentive friendly staff Efficient power shower Enviable St Germain location Quirky decor by Jacques Garcia designer of Hotel Costes Paris Park Chinois London Clean Fairly quiet Cosy lobby lounge and breakfast room Appealing breakfast offer 
43898,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Nothing, The team at the hotel were so professional warm and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble they were simply great Room was very good and the breakfast was lovely It was a really nice stay thank you so much

43900,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, The breakfast room is cosy but a little cramped , Despite being in a very busy part of Paris just off the bustling Boulevard St Germain the hotel was a haven of calm and quiet Extra glazing to the bedroom windows ensured a peaceful nights sleep 
43901,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Sttaff not well trained Poor breakfast for 14 euro truly small bed and very small bedroom elevator was broken and aid came very slow Check out time is 12 00 but at 11 30 room cleaner tried to enter into the room when there was on the door sign to not disturb Expensive overall for what you get , Fast wifi cozy atmosphere

43904,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, The only questionable item related to height of the ceiling on the 5th floor and how taht affected the room the overall size of the bathroom was OK but there was cumbersome access to the tub The roofline impeded on our sitting area such that the chairs had to be moved to avoid bumping your head on the ceiling wall However the small footprint of the room was well designed to maximize use of the space ,No Positive
43905,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain,No Negative, Lovely charming Hotel in wonderful St Germain location close to Metro and delightful Parisienne cafes Reception staff welcoming friendly and helpful very attractive room very comfortable with well equipped bathroom Very clean and well presented Room extremely quiet Breakfast everything I needed everything beautifully presented I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in your hotel and was sad to leave I will definately stay again if I have the opportunity to return to France in the future 
43906,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, nothing , staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and could not have asked for a better location located within a less than 1 minute walk from major thoroughfare but yet was on a small quiet street with fantastic neighborhood restaurants bakery and shops
43907,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Rooms a bit tight and dark, Great staff they found the forgotten passport of one person in our party and called us right away to let us know When we pulled up in a cab someone was at the door with the passport so we didn t even have to hail another cab

43909,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, We had a ground floor room with no external window therefore little to no natural lighting which was not supplemented by good artificial lighting , Extremely friendly and helpful staff good location as close to Saint Germain hub but outside of heavy tourist traffic which meant no disruption or noise in the evening
43910,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Tiny room no room for a second suitcase staff offered to store a case but not practical when it is packed with clothes No kettle in room Common area kettle locked away with milk at night meaning we would have been charged for a cup of tea this isn t reasonable Fridge in room not cold and no room anyway due to mini bar , Decor intimate boutique hotel Staff especially Julia Lovely 
43911,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain,No Negative, great service with smile comfy beds and duvets close to Notre Dame Sorbonne the Louvre close to lovely bars and restaurants good safe environment
43912,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, This hotel should offer a basic breakfast for the price of the rooms and offer water coffee complimentary Some of the furnishings and carpet could use updating it could use some brightening up , This hotel is located in a beautiful neighborhood and easy to walk to many surrounding shops and restaurants The staff was great very helpful and accommodating The hotel has charm although it s a bit cramped and shabby The room and bathroom was nice but small 
43913,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Breakfast at 14 is pricey We went out to a local caf instead , The staff were exceptional Really helpful and very friendly The bed was also very comfortable 
43914,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Basic breakfast , Good location walking distance to the louve and seine river Good restaurants nearby Lovely boutique hotel We had a triple room which had enough space to comfortably fit 3 people and 5 suitcases Friendly staff who helped take our luggage to the room and provided us with a map and pointed out good places to eat We purchased museum tickets at no extra cost from the front desk which enabled us to skip the lines Staff arranged a car to take us to the airport and happy to keep our bags after checkout until our transfer arrived at 5pm

43916,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Bathroom a little cramped but other than that all good , A good location within easy distance to most sight seeing areas Plenty of great Cafes to eat out nearby Staff extremely friendly helpful 
43917,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, I believe the hotel was overpriced The room was described as a deluxe triple but it was really a double with an extra bed squeezed in The bathroom was in great need of updating The only coffee available cost 3 50 in the lobby For the price of this room more than 350 night we should have had a free coffee , The staff was extremely courteous and helpful The location was great

43921,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain,No Negative, Nice area close to lots of shops restaurants and tourist attractions The building has an old charm appeal and clean The staff are friendly and helpful 
43922,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Had to walk up one flight of stairs take a one person elevator to the fourth floor and walk up another flight of stairs to reach the room , Location and friendly staff 
43923,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain,No Negative, Excellent location in an lively neighborhood of central Paris Very nice small hotel and though our room was not large it had a lot of character and French detail regarding interior decor It is beautifully updated while retaining old features like giant ancient beams from the 1500s Very friendly helpful staff Not for people who might like impersonal generic hotels 
43924,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, I couldn t fault the hotel Everything was as expected Rooms were small and typical of Paris , The staff and locality make this hotel Every member of staff is focused on making your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible All were friendly knowledgeable and professional Locality was better than I thought Lots of the major tourist sights were within reasonable walking distance if you like walking Brasseries cafes and bars right on your doorstep too

43929,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, I wish it was breakfast included , It was a very old and small building transformed to a hotel My room was really small but it was fine The location was great just a few minutes walk to st Micheal notre dam 
43930,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, The triple room we shared with 2 friends was really tiny No complimentary coffee or tea were available in the room The toilets are in the small bathroom , This hotel has an excellent location in the lively area of Odeon The staff is very friendly Breakfast is at a fair price Luggage service 
43931,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Rooms quite small but as expected in Paris so not a problem Our room was on the ground floor and had little natural light We will visit again and will stay in room 2 or 3 as these are very nice , Very nice decor friendly helpful staff and good location Super breakfast choices 
43932,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Let s start with good things employee are friendly and kind but that should be normal for that kind of hotel so nothing new and wow hotel is clean and it is placed on good location rooms so called deluxe are extremely small Bathroom is even smaller toilet is placed inside bathroom and if you have more than 90kg and 1 80cm you are in great problems Lights in room are for decoration But greater problem is if you are women and decide to put make up in bathroom lighting doesn t exist A C exist but doesn t work It s not worth money and stars they have,No Positive

43934,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, When I arrived the window of the bedroom was open I was told someone had probably smoked in the bedroom But again all the staff were excellent and did their very best to resolve the issue There was also a wonderful cleaning lady , The staff were excellent always on hand very friendly and professional all day and all night The two receptionists a man and a woman answered all my questions gave me good advice made me very comfortable The never seemed like I was a problem and traveling alone you have more questions than others
43935,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, We were upgraded to an executive room and the room was still fairly small but it was cosy and quaint So I imagine the standard double rooms must be very small , Location we managed to walk to a lot of attractions especially the Notre Dame and Latin Quarter Nice continental breakfast Decor of the hotel lobby area
43936,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, No dining room so no evening meals and breakfast was basic with only the coffee tea or boiled eggs being hot No parking if you chose to drive there yourself but an underground car park is 200m away , Very clean hotel and very helpful staff Go above and beyond whatever was needed 
43937,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain,No Negative, The room was large by the standards of Paris boutique hotels It was quiet and the bed was comfortable I slept much better than I have done during similar stays at other Paris hotels of this type 
43938,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Even though we were upgraded to a larger room it was small for 2 people in that there was not enough space to store clothes for 2 We had to open suitcases on the floor or the bed to get our clothes , Good location Charming lobby Pleasant service 
43939,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, bedroom very small 11m but no noise and clean room and luxurious linen made up for it , Friendly staff were amazing Small bedroom was beautifully furnished fantastic bed linen great bathroom best of all no noise 
43940,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, No bad experiences , Central location Room was very quiet and we could open our windows at night Staff were friendly and low key but available when needed 
43941,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Unfortunately nothing could be done about needing to cancel a room due to illness but the tariff booked was non refundable so this was within their rights, Design and Location
43942,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, No bath a slight downside be prepared to walk up stairs lift is tiny and impractical but this is a very minor criticism , Very friendly welcome very comfy bed excellent location close to plenty of places to eat drink and short walk to a number of sights 
43943,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, pillows were uncomfortable and the lift was way too small for 2 people with luggage The honesty bar was a good idea until I discovered they wanted to charge 37 euros for a half bottle of red wine A by the glass option would have been a good idea, FRiendly helpful staff well appointed for a small hotel with quality fixtures good breakfast options Excellent location Very quiet rooms
43944,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Elevator extremely small plus did not function on all floors Stairs to elevator very tight and small, Staff was the best Most spoke English Extremely helpful

43946,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, the lift is so small it can only stand one people and one baggage the room is also small how could this hotel can be a four stars hotel , the bed is soft the room is very clean and the location is pretty good 
43947,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, The smallest room and bathroom I have ever stayed and seen in the hotel The wardrobe was like a little cupboard The bathroom is OK if you are a little tiny person , Fantastic location within short proximity to the major tourist attractions and generally the best area to stay in Paris perhaps Overall small and cosy hotel 
43948,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and accommodating and the location cannot be beat I loved being in the 6e just steps from Jardin du Luxembourg and a few blocks from Saint Germain s restaurants and flavor I walked easily to the banks of the Seine to Notre Same and Saint Chapelle and was always met with a friendly greeting going in or out As a solo traveller it put me at ease to be staying in a hotel with such attentive service 
43949,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, No chair at desk Just ottoman Very small shower Just bigger than shoulder width Expensive , Location Friendly and knowledgable staff Clean and modern bathroom 
43950,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, Can t speak to other rooms but on the top floor the ceilings in the bathroom were very low made it tough for a tall person not to bump their head multiple times The shower was disappointing a head that could be affixed to a pole to use as a shower the tub was difficult to drain and the shower head didn t go very high again tough for someone who s tall The room overall was quite small not that you re in Paris to stay in your room but it was a bit claustrophobic , The Hotel is in an excellent location very convenient to the Metro or to walk to other areas We loved feeling centrally located yet still away from some of the more touristy areas The staff was courteous and very helpful with directions or questions The bed was comfortable enough and the rooms were very clean The AC did work though perhaps could have been stronger 
43951,Hotel Odeon Saint Germain, However the room is a little small for a couple Once you keep 2 suitcases there is hardly any space to walk around , The staff are extremely good and friendly The location of the hotel is also good Within walking distance of the metro
