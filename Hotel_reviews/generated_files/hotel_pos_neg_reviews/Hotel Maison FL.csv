221052,Hotel Maison FL,No Negative, Very clean well kept property good size rooms Buffett breakfast was simple but sufficient very pleasant and helpful staff close walk to the Eiffel Tower 
221053,Hotel Maison FL, very small room a bit too expensive for what you get windows broken hair dryer, Silent environment not far from the Eiffel Tower the style of the hotel
221054,Hotel Maison FL, The window between the bathroom and the bedroom was a little weird but after staying in a few hotels in Europe apparently not unusual , We had to book this at literally the last minute after we arrived in Paris and found our rented apartment had been double booked The staff was very cosmopolitan and extremely friendly and helpful The free local smartphone they provide with every room was incredibly useful and an unexpected perk It saved us from needing to spend for an international data plan which are always ridiculously expensive 
221055,Hotel Maison FL, This hotel staff was unfriendly Miss leading Had pay for parking Front desk did not have key for car park Being charged 2 x for a room Crazy Call hotel soon as arrive back to Toronto Would not recommend this hotel ,No Positive
221056,Hotel Maison FL,No Negative, Great location 2 mins walk to metro less than 10 mins walk to Eiffel Tower bus tours boat tours plenty of shops and restaurants nearby Staff were friendly and helpful Room with balcony was stylish and very clean Good Wi Fi connection within the room and the personal smart phone is a great idea 
221057,Hotel Maison FL,No Negative, This hotel has very big rooms compare with other hotels The staff is incredibly nice and kind The bar has the perfect snack combination kind people Internet is working great the neighborhood Passy is the best with coffee shops and stores This is a hotel where I would definitely come back 
221058,Hotel Maison FL,No Negative, Loved the location and the Mobil device the hotel provided for easier access around the city It was a HUGE help We used it more than our phones or a map 
221059,Hotel Maison FL, On arrival we were greeted by a member of staff who lacked a friendly disposition Seemed disinterested Also I requested flowers and a card on arrival Neither of which was done even after it was confirmed by two members of staff via email On two occasions there were no bartenders so we didn t bother trying a third time , Location was fantastic Restaurants in the area were quite good Beside the metro which was great 
221060,Hotel Maison FL, The staff were pretty rude parking was available but at 30 euros per day Bit ridiculous for guests who are already paying enough to stay there the bar lobby restaurant area was not what I expected and was never staffed , Nice room with balcony Good shower 
221061,Hotel Maison FL, Real pity that all hotel facilities except for breakfast are not available on Fri and Sat not even the bar was open Room air cicrulation was poor either too warm or too cold despite the airco unit Our room was also not made up fro three people as requested and we had to ask for a 3rd set of towels On saturday despite us being away for several hours our room was not made up and in the end we asked ourselves for replacement towels Lighting in the room was also poor All in all not a bad hotel but too expensive for what you get It all comes across as a little pretentious , Breakfast was very good as was the location Bed was comfortable and room was clean 
221062,Hotel Maison FL, Breakfast was a little scarce Not much to choose from unfortunatley , Beautiful hotel Room was stunning and spacious we had a bath which just added to the luxury and a balcony leading out to the streets of Paris It was perfect 2minute walk from train station and 5minute walk from the Eiffel Tower Can t go wrong 
221063,Hotel Maison FL, Nothing , Fantastic location comfortable big bed and stunning bathroom Lovely breakfast with option to have continental ordered to your room Upgrade to deluxe room is worth it 
221064,Hotel Maison FL, Nothing , Fantastic location friendly helpful staff beautiful modern and quiet room with a balcony and excellent value for money Will definitely stay here again 
221065,Hotel Maison FL,No Negative, Everything amazing Room and all amenities were excellent Staff were really helpfull specially thanks for helping me with the surprise for my husband s bday So close to the metro station
221066,Hotel Maison FL, Room service was inefficient and lacking Towels were a little meagre and at odds with the nice robe and very nice bed linen , Really beautiful hotel super comfortable and stylish Very well located 
221067,Hotel Maison FL, The room got a little hot but it soon cooled down when we opened the door , Staff were friendly and the smartphone provided was so helpful Wouldn t have gotten around without it 
221068,Hotel Maison FL,No Negative, The Maison FL is a wonderful boutique hotel that ticks every box The rooms are superb The ambience is calm The restaurant serves excellent food This hotel is truly a home away from home The staff are genuinely friendly They even gave me a local phone to use which came in extremely handy I was able to take a lovely walk and navigate with google maps on the hotel phone With this I went all the way to the Trocadero and on to the Champs Elys es I absolutely love this hotel I will certainly be back Thanks
221069,Hotel Maison FL, Cleaning is not perfect moreover a cleaning lady never put extra tea coffee during 3 nights stay When i asked for an extra tea bag on the reception i was charged additional 5 5 eur for restoration at the check out No vegetables for the breakfast , Very comfortable bed variety of products for breakfast close to Trocadero and shopping at Passy
221070,Hotel Maison FL, I can honestly say there s not a single thing we didn t like , Reception staff were lovely and couldn t be more helpful and friendly The hotel is at most 5 mins walk from eiffel tower and about 2 minutes from the metro Would book here again should we return to Paris 
221071,Hotel Maison FL, having a ramp for wheelchairs and then being able to use it for huge luggage would be a fantastic add on for by passing the complicated 3 4 steps of the stairs at the main door, basically everything was very good location staff bedroom comfort bed quality 
221072,Hotel Maison FL, There were times when the room cards were not activated properly to work in the main elevator but the front desk was very supportive with intervening and supplying new cards when necessary , The design of the hotel was very modern and attractive especially the vintage elevator The beds in the triple rooms very very comfortable and the bathroom was awesome 
221073,Hotel Maison FL, The room was tiny even for a Parisian hotel and the bed on the small side The bathroom too small The price on the other sidewas more than average, The location was convenient for my business trip near Passy The breakfast was OK and included a buffet 
221074,Hotel Maison FL, The smartphone in the room with a camera and a microphone it should be forbidden The open space smoking area just below my room Very expensive hotel Small room , Location Convenience Breakfast
221075,Hotel Maison FL, Nothing , Beautiful hotel with good size rooms for Paris Very clean with great decor and fittings Nice touches like having an umbrella in each room and a smart phone to take out with you which had free calls to French numbers useful for booking cancelling restaurants and google maps Very friendly and helpful staff and in a great location near metro shops and restaurants Breakfast is excellent too 
221076,Hotel Maison FL, A more exciting breakfast delivered to room We had a few small croissants and bread jam , We can see the Eiffel Tower clearly from the room The penthouse also has a huge balcony

221079,Hotel Maison FL,No Negative, The staff was amazingly helpful and friendly The views from the rooftop terrace were fantastic Plus they had the best scrambled eggs on the breakfast buffet that I have ever eaten in my life 
221080,Hotel Maison FL, The only challenge with this property was size of room If you are traveling alone this is not an issue but it you are traveling with a guest it is pretty small That being said it would not stop me from staying at this lovely hotel when on another business or personal trip to Paris , The service in this hotel was exceptional The rooms were clean and modern The bed comfortable 
221081,Hotel Maison FL,No Negative, Everything was perfect Staff members are extremely helpful the rooms are small but beautiful and very well equipped the bed is very comfortable I will certainly return to Maison FL 
221082,Hotel Maison FL, nothing, the staff were exceptional Very friendly especially the guy on the night desk who doubled up as the barman he was very happy chatty was a wanted bad influence by talking us into getting a bottle of champagne that he then put in an ice bucket with a tray so we could take upstairs even offering to add an extra hour after check out in case we had a hangover The room though small is very comfortable clean it s a shame that the weather was too cold to make use of the balcony Also great location easy walk to the Eiffel tower 
221083,Hotel Maison FL, We have nothing bad to say about this hotel , The staff were so nice they couldn t do enough for us We were only in Paris for 2 days and they helped us make the most of it by making reservations for shows providing us with tickets etc And arranging transport for us too Really nice staff and the hotel was really clean too Not to mention the hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing We Would definitely book again

221085,Hotel Maison FL, I was there in the first cold night of the winter season The air conditioner was fixed to summer mode only and the room was really cold Next night they solved it In the last day the cleaning lady entered in the room at 9 40 in the morning without even knocking the door She was surprised more than me , Good location Comfortable quite and stylish rooms Very clean hotel International TV channels kettle 
221086,Hotel Maison FL,No Negative, The room was very clean and the space was well managed The location of the hotel was excellent being minutes walk from the Trocadero and Eiffel tower 
221087,Hotel Maison FL, Lobby bathroom was unacceptably dirty all the time The maids walked in on us twice in our room without knocking when we had the do not disturb sign on the door twice in one day Another day We left the sign on the door and then came back and to our room and it had been cleaned which we didn t ask for do not disturb sign still out AND a maid smoked on our porch left their matches and ashes on the floor outside Not impressed with maid service AT ALL , Overall staff was great

221089,Hotel Maison FL, I wished that the water was a little hotter to actually cook the egg or that I knew how to properly operate it I should have asked but I was pressed for time , The croissant in the morning was the best I ve ever eaten Being on the 7th floor it was a huge surprise to have a roof deck with a city view Tres bon 
221090,Hotel Maison FL, The breakfast sucks There is nothing to eat other than corn flex and if you wake up a little bit late there won t be croissant available Anyway don t pay for breakfast and eat somewhere else The wifi is very bad I suggest getting a 1gig 3G on a mobile for 10 better than getting hypertension from using the hotel wifi , The staff are great and very helpful The location is good and close to the Eiffel tower 5 10 min walk 
221091,Hotel Maison FL, There was construction in the next building during our stay in this quarter of Paris next building is next window over as it were in our case Hard to get sleep in the morning I wish there was an alert at the time of booking , Very upscale look and feel mostly helpful nice and friendly staff
