377828,NH Collection Wien Zentrum, I stayed in my room on two mornings and my room wasn t cleaned although the cleaners worked until early evening When it was clear it would not be cleaned a cleaner from another section and reception organised for coffee etc to be provided for the mornings as this was my biggest concern When I left as recompense my payment for the mini bar 3 small bottles of wine and 2 small bottles of water was waived which I thought was an appropriate gesture , Perfect location and very quiet 
377829,NH Collection Wien Zentrum, We didn t like the room was at the last floor near a toilet and also near the kitchen Also we had no internet connection When we asked they said that it seems to be a technical problem but for sure there was no signal in that attic room , The modern design of the room and the location on Mariahilf

377837,NH Collection Wien Zentrum, The television service was out of order during my stay there and most important think they double charged me The excuse it was national holiday and the banks are closed so you will have to wait untill we will give you your money back After 3 days i am still waiting for my money Horrible, Location

377857,NH Collection Wien Zentrum, I don t like breakfast buffet I was stayed another NH group in Berlin and it was very perfect breakfast buffet but this NH hotel it s little bit poor and expensive 22 euro 1 person But you can take any sandwich across the street and you can eat at your room eith free tea and coffee 2 person 13euro approximetly if you buy from the shop And if you want there is a long table and sitting area on the street There are a lot of coffee shops around the street close to hotel We stayed 5 night only 1 day we take a breakfast we cancelled other breakfast amounts , Room is large and very modern lux material lighting ststem wi fi is perfect beds shower area different types many towels slippers tv is free coffee and tea is free at the room There is a very nice sandwich shop across the hotel You can take many types of sandwichs from that shop and eat easily at your room Location is perfect Underground is 10 mt from the loby Orange Ubahn station All shops and aphoteke is very close very nice location Very clean Safe box is ok
