500570,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, The breakfast was not what it could have been for a hotel in Vienna Seemed like the breakfast staff could not keep up with the amount of guests , I felt the bed was a bit too soft We wondered why there was only coffee in the room and no tea bags

500578,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, Rude bartender my husband struck his head on the slanted ceiling in our room and went down to the bar and asked the bartender for ice The bartender acted like my husband was inconveniencing him and snapped at him to wait , Continental breakfast buffet was convenient as there wasn t much else around to eat Can t eat the hot breakfast for more than a few days though it ll make you sick

500585,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, 1 I couldn t pay with my Maestro card although I had already asked through mail whether it s acceptable or not and certainly got Yes from the hotel before coming The man at the reception desk at that moment pretended to try my card on the machine and just got it back to me requiring cash or other cards I have no idea why it was then acceptable on the day of checking out to pay for other service fees 2 At the first day of my stay I was shocked at the taste of cappuccino in the breakfast buffet and then realized its milk had gone bad Too bad that I and my mother suffered from stomachache right from that day on Plus I booked this hotel mostly because I saw several positive reviews on the breakfast buffet but well then I should say that it was way lower than expected especially as a 4 star hotel 3 I used Eurail Pass throughout my stay in Vienna but unfortunately this hotel is reachable by U Bahn Kaiserm hlen VIC is the name of the closest station which is not covered by the Pass In short we need to buy the ticket to take the metro and it costs 2 20 per person for one way , I stayed at this hotel almost a week but the weather was not so generous Then we found a radiator in the bathroom and it worked pretty well it even served as a laundry dryer I mean the laundaries were dried pretty well beside it

500588,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, Very little parking and very tight spaces first night I got a space second night I had to park on the street drove around about 15 minutes looking and then had a good walk to the hotel You can t count on getting a parking place there Then the staff kinda laughed and said On the website it says based on availability I didn t find it funny Breakfast was ok nothing special , The room was nice and big Wifi was fast 
500589,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna,No Negative, For travelers having business arrangements related to VIC this is an excellent choice The location is perfect just across the VIC There is a park near by for relaxing and the metro station is on 3 minutes walk Breakfast is also very good In general the ambient offers a touch of a mountain cottage in the urban Vienna center 
500590,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, No lactose free milk available as requested when booking Instant coffee HAG served as decaffinated coffee in the evening expected better from a 4Star hotel, The size of the room was good Bathroom was OK
500591,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, Don t take restaurant advice from staff One of the nearby restaurants they recommended was abysmal The gym does not open till 8 maybe 9 AM apparently the gym equipment made a lot of noise which would disturb those sleeping and so I couldn t use it needed to leave early My wife who used the gym said it was very basic and poorly equipped The reason why we stayed here was proximity to the conference centre While that s true next time I ll stay in the city centre and take the train to the conference centre train stops right outside the conference centre , The breakfast was included and was good The staff were friendly The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet Got a good night s sleep 
500592,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, This hotel deserves 3 stars at its best Not worth the over 200 per night Very boring and worn out No services just a room and a bed The gym was smaller than my room I saw only 3 staff members non were enthusiastic to serve I have had good experience with the Radisson chain before but this one was a total abuse of the brand My first room had such a poor sound insulation I could hear every word whispered next door and also their alarm clock every morning at 6 o clock I chose this hotel for its proximity to Vienna International Centre but the centre is just outside the U bahn station and its much easier and better to stay in the city and take the train as walking from this hotel takes you 10 15 minutes anyway Will never go back ,No Positive
500593,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, My room was in a separate building which was not very convinient due to the cold weather , Rooms are clean and large It was close to the office I need to go on meeting but its close to metro stops as well

500601,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, The room we had was a splited apartment meaning that instead of a full wall we had a closed door between our room and the neighbours s room so we could hear absolutely everything and this was REALLY disturbing The breakfast is fair but nothing special , Nice and competent staff Ok as a hotel overall but nothing special Close to the metro station even if it s pretty far from the center

500604,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, The heating in the room is not working very well Maybe we were unlucky Be sure you will jot get a room in the secondary building under the fitness room It is opened all night and it is incredibly loud We asked for another room and they solved it immediately , The breackfast was excellent Near the hotel you can find a gas station that has Spar express opened 24 7 which is perfect because everything closes in Vienna between Saturday 18 00 and Monday morning Another advantage of this hotel is that you have U bahn station across the street 
500605,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, It was not the room I booked As a couple we wanted a double bed instead we were given two singles pushed together in a disabled room The shower was at our wait level with no way to adjust to higher This room was provided after we complained about the first one given which was a family room with bunk beds in an external building For the price I paid I should have got the room I booked and staff on duty said it was nothing to do with him It also took nearly an hour on checkout as the hotel refused to accept my employers credit card until telephoned and a form filled in , Room was spacious

500611,Park Inn by Radisson Uno City Vienna, The pillows were not very comfortable The fact that room service and food was not available beyond breakfast was very inconvenient as I had to make sure to buy something to take back for dinner Also the variety for breakfast could have been more in terms of the typical viennese sweets for example and more homemade cakes Some varieties seemed to be packaged and bought from a shop such as the swiss rolls The most important thing was that a friend of mine got a better deal for the same nights from another booking company a total of 100 Euros less and when she told me I tried to book the same way and found there were no more vacancies from that site and the hotel could not do anything about it , The staff were helpful and courteous The bathroom was renovated and comfortable
