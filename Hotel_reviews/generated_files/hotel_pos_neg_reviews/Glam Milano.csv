404728,Glam Milano, Unfortunately some of the other guests spoiled the dining experience for us as because as it was a buffet meal a lot of people seemed intent on eating as much as they could in a short space of time even though the staff kept refilling the trays of food On one occasion it took only 22 seconds for two large trays of cakes to be devoured I would add that this is not the hotel or staffs fault , As we traveled by train to Milan the hotel was in a really good location 5 minutes walk away from Milan Centrale The hotel was excellent and all of the staff were very helpful both in the dining room and on reception The breakfast was amazing and although the evening meal was included in the price which was a real bonus we did go out on a couple of occasions preferring to eat in the old part of the city Would certainly recommend to friends or other travelers 
404729,Glam Milano, I am not very sure how safe the area around the central station is because of the people gathering there in the square it was dirty noisy but I wouldn t say they were aggressive , Nice hotel good location and great staff The room was quiet spacious clean and comfortable The food was delicious Wifi was OK 
404730,Glam Milano, The restaurant was a bit small to accommodate all the guests It got very overcrowded at breakfast Slow to replenish food after it ran out , Excellent location very modern and very well maintained The staff were very helpful and courtious Rooms are a good size and very comfortable We had a few small issues on arrival that were sorted out very promptly and efficently We stayed at the hotel at the beginning and the end of our holiday to Lake Como and it suited our needs as a link to the city centre and the airport I ll definitely use again if I m when I visit Milan 
404731,Glam Milano, The restaurant was too small to accommodate all the guests The food was put out in small inadequate quantities I appreciate they are trying to manage waste but they go too far Dinner was like feeding time at the zoo it promotes greed , The hotel is modern and well maintained Situated right beside Milan Central Station and the metro Airport shuttle buses stop directly beside the station Very helpful staff Would definitely stay again if in Milan 
404732,Glam Milano, I travel to Milan every week I have tried many hotels This hotel was OK The tourist were tourists given the location it is quite touristy The breakfast was worth a look however I recommend you avoid the orange juice Not sure what the machine thinks it is doing but it really isn t orange juice not even close Go Water or Coffee Dinner well If i was on holiday and had my family we could eat It wasn t so bad Nothing there for me after a long day in the office , I travel to Milan every week I have tried many hotels This hotel was OK The tourist were tourists given the location it is quite touristy The breakfast was worth a look however I recommend you avoid the orange juice Not sure what the machine thinks it is doing but it really isn t orange juice not even close Go Water or Coffee Dinner well If i was on holiday and had my family we could eat It wasn t so bad Nothing there for me after a long day in the office 
404733,Glam Milano, If they add more food choices for breakfast and dinner will be better , Glam hotel is one of the best in the area It is near the centeral station The tourist s buses stop few steps from the hotel and can take you to all Italy outlets and sightseeing tours There are many geat restaurants in nearby 
404734,Glam Milano, Restaurant space feels like you are in a corridor Too cramped But for the price the food was good and the overall experience was good , Very helpful staff Great cappuccino 
404735,Glam Milano, It s a little expensive for the location and the service offers , It s very close to the central rail station transiting travellers to other parts of Italy will like staying here they were sweet to let us keep our bags for 3 days till we come back from Florence 
404736,Glam Milano, The evening meal experience was not good The space where it is eaten is not adequate The food itself was fine But we chose to eat out of the hotel on a number of occasions although we had paid for the evening meal in hotel as we simply didn t enjoy the in hotel experience , Bed very comfy bedroom good quality and well sound proofed 
404737,Glam Milano, Forgot to clean our room for one day They did it the next day Construction site is next to hotel Quite noisy in early morning Seems to be completed not long It s better after we changed our room facing the street , Very good location Metro station is a few steps from the hotel as well as the shuttle bus to Outlet Few minutes to the train station Good enough breakfast and dinner Sometimes they provide seafood dishes for dinner Helpful and sincere staff My husband checked in hotel very late and tried to get some food at the restaurant just before 10 30 pm A young waiter immediately arranged two plates of food including cold cut meat dessert etc for my husband although one was enough for him Much appreciated for the initiativeness and thoughtfulness of this young staff Comfy bed new style with nice decoration 
404738,Glam Milano, The food at dinner Wait at check in take more time than usual but it is not a very big issue, Very near to Milano train station about 3 minutes walk Staff at reception are nice and willing to help
404739,Glam Milano, We were given a family room on the 2nd floor directly facing the train station Walls are not sound proof That evening we could hear every train that went by central station music and people talking from the street below The next day we complained to reception and was offered another room on level 6 at rear of the building The room was much quieter Unfortunately there was a drainage problem with the shower our bathroom was flooded We were offered another room Very disappointed with the facilities of the hotel As we had spent the previous 3 weeks in other cities in Italy and stayed at hotels much older than the Glam with no issues ,No Positive
404740,Glam Milano, We were 3 in the room but the house keeping only provided 2 coffee sachets one of them decaf and no milk We paid for half board but the dinner wasn t worth it at all Not good variety of food and if you arrive less than an hour after the dinner start time the good stuff in the buffet is finished and they don t provide more We had to have the same food every day I could have spared the half board money and had dinner at any good restaurant nearby , Modern room adequate for 3 Very good bathroom Hotel right in front of the central station and easy to find 
404741,Glam Milano, Nothing, 2nd stay improved rating We wrote a review a couple of years ago and took off 1 star 4 out of 5 for the quality of food dinner and breakfast were part of the rate with no choice to opt out We stayed again this year because the rooms are great and it is so convenient to the train station metro and airport express THE MEALS WERE GOOD THIS TIME With this improvement we d give the hotel a 5 out of 5 
404742,Glam Milano,No Negative, Lovely hotel with very good facilities in a pretty good location in Milan Excellent value for money with the meals included which were all top quality Would definitely stay here again 
404743,Glam Milano, Breakfast was a bit busy and the quality of the food did not appear very high however overall it was reasonable as included in the price , Location and view fantastic room overlooking the Centrale Station Family room was huge compared to most hotels essentially 2 rooms with proper beds for everyone Staff all very cheerful and helpful Left luggage they kept our cases for a few hours for free
404744,Glam Milano, WIFI is not stable not working during the late evening and early morning No separate concierge desk to ask for help The front office are busy with check in and out The dinner buffet is so so , Big room big comfortable bed air condition fridge The location is 3 min walk from Milan Central station 
404745,Glam Milano, Drinks with dinner were too expensive and spoilt the dining experience a little , Buffet breakfast and dinner were very good Hotel lovely and staff were excellent 
404746,Glam Milano, Bedroom could be better lit Shower difficult to access if you re old Hotel signage not brill in the dark Welcome and how to find us email received at 6am the following morning, Staff very accommodating sorted cold food for our late arrival we were 1 2 board Excellent breakfast Would use again
404747,Glam Milano, Staff have no idea about customer service breakfast and dinner were both a joke chaos to seat customers you felt like you were sitting in a corridor You can only have tea size plates otherwise you will be charged 20 euros for waste i have never been in a hotel anywhere in the world that has stated this Did not even get breakfast the second morning as power had gone out and staff did not offer us anything and no apology when i complained at the check out desk they even wanted my credit card details for a third time when i had paid in full on booking com and the staff member could not give me a reason why they didnt offer any compensation for not receiving the full service i paid for , comfy room and really good shower bathroom and all really clean
404748,Glam Milano, Nothing, Very close to the Central Train Station The wrap around balcony on the 9th floor gave us fantastic views across the city which was great with a glass of wine at night The half board option was good and the food was also good too 
404749,Glam Milano, Housekeeping service was bad There is no parking for cars in the hotel No body assisted in cayying luggage to room Neighborhood was full of homeless ,No Positive
404750,Glam Milano, The reception told me my kid should be 3 years old and insisted that extra money should be added on my booking On the other hand my kid just two months ago had his 2 year old birthday It was a very disppointing discussion with the reception on it It is ok to charge me more if my kid is really 3 years old but in this way it is strange , excellent location
404751,Glam Milano, No milk for the coffee in the room That s all , Comfortable rooms helpful staff who got the air con to the right temperature for me promptly nice friendly bar staff All round excellent 
404752,Glam Milano, The main course offered at dinner could be a little more appertising , We arrived early and were given access to our room on the top floor The room was spacious and modern with a good view of the square outside Milano Centrale station We were given half board and the food was very basic but the drinks expensive 5 for a very small bottle of coke There are a number of good restaurants within walking distance The hop on hop off bus stops outside the hotel We would recommend this hotel for a short stay especially for the easy access to Malpensa airport by train 
404753,Glam Milano, nothing, Big floor ceiling windows over looking the train station palazzo gave the room a spacious feel The half board was great value and provided entertainment via people watching including the prawn muncher 30 minutes non stop peeling and scoffing shrimp Location excellent to main station but walkable distance to Duomo and Castello for keen pedestrians 
404754,Glam Milano, Firm bed hate them , Our 122 euro price included half board and a buffet breakfast THe food was very good too It s a three minute walk from the Central Station This was a four star hotel Our room was lovely large tv excellent air beautiful bathroom everything you could want Got checked in at 10 30 am very nice by a great staff member 
404755,Glam Milano, Not the best stay and I am not that difficult Travelling for business it is quite essential to have power plugs After trying all of them I went down to front office Before I had already gone down three times because my key card was not working This was the fourth time so I was not amused and requested another room Fully booked was the answer and maintenance would come to my room Not something you are wishing for when you already had your shower and want to go to bed Finally two maintenance guys checked all the plugs and happily told me one was working the one where the TV was plugged in The TV was not working in the first place so it did not matter but could only charge my phone leaving my iPad and laptop almost empty the next day No apologies nothing of the sort Will not stay here again Location is far from the center but I knew that when I booked , Nothing unfortunately
404756,Glam Milano, Bad odour on the ground floor seemed like sewage was backed up no USB option in the room to charge phones hidden away with on the TV which is bolted to the walls , One of the first hotels out of the train station good breakfast reasonable dinner option Sight seeing bus opposite the hotel
404757,Glam Milano, It took a few minutes to find the hotel from the Piazza as the signage isn t clear from a distance , The Glam Milano was a great place to stay Check in was efficient and the staff pleasant The room was just perfect the view of the Piazza Duca D Aosta was wonderful the shower the best we experienced in Europe the bed comfortable and the meals enjoyable We found it very convenient and easy to travel by the Metro access to the station right outside If staying in Milan again I would definitely stay at Glam Milano
404758,Glam Milano, Wet floor carpet in the room in front of the bathroom door on arrival However it dried up during our stay Internet connection a bit unreliable at times as was the TV at the time of the Formula 1 qualifying race on Saturday June 24 2017 The actual race on Sunday was OK , Despite the lack of electric power one morning the breakfast staff performed admirably Respect A very modern room to our taste Coffee making facility a big plus Sound insulation very good Dinner inclusive of the room price a big plus too It would be even bigger if the wine were priced at 3 a glass or 15 a bottle 
404759,Glam Milano, Buffet breakfast was fine but the buffet dinner left much to be desired , Clean modern and convenient to the train station Professional and friendly staff 
404760,Glam Milano, We had the breakfast and dinner option The breakfast was alright with most of the usual options The evening meal was very plain It is advisable to get in early as all dishes are not kept supplied and you may find options limited Very limited variety of sweet in fact there are more types of sweet offered at breakfast You also have to pay for drinks Though we had already paid we opted to eat out mostly There is a coffee shop bar on the ground floor but it does not have anything to eat Bathroom had a shower which could be hand held or overhead Never did work out how to change from one to other Overall a very disappointing stay and would never stay at a Glam Hotel again , It was very close to Milan Central Station An easy walk away But the area around the station feels quite unsafe Cleaning staff were excellent One of the cleaners speaks better English than any of the counter staff She would be much more useful on the front desk 
404761,Glam Milano, The restaurant is located in the area which is mainly a corridor overcrowded The food is good and the personnel polite helpful , The view from the superior room 9th floor is worth the money amazing The room is meant for 3 people but the robes slippers and tea equipment 2 units each the room service was good and fast overall we are happy with the stay the location is good food is alright even though the electricity problem occurred in the restaurant and they served breakfast in a box 
404762,Glam Milano, On the first night there was a fire alarm 2 times at around 1 30am 2am Had to go all the way down to the reception 2 times as a result a sleepless night The bathtub would fill up with water while taking the shower and the water wouldn t go away Has requested reception for 3 consecutive days to fix the issue and send maintenance to unclog the pipes the problem was never fixed To be showering in the bathtub full of water is not only disgusting but dangerous as well , The location is good you have metro train station and city center just a few minutes away 
404763,Glam Milano, The first night they did not have AC phones and then no breakfast either the next morning Yes there was a problem with electricity but there has to be a way to handle guests The reception was really rude and didn t even help us with the luggage No compensation was given to us at check out Terrible experience , The decor was smart and modern 
404764,Glam Milano, The hotel is unprepared for adverse event One night there was a power outage and the next morning they did not had anbreakfast menu with the allegations that they could not prepare overnight That is unacceptable for 4 star hotel , Great view of central station Metro right in front of hotel
404765,Glam Milano, A little bit out from the main area but you can walk down in 20 mins so it was easy , Great hotel across from the train station that suited our travel schedule Lovely room and breakfast Nice bar area for drinks 
404766,Glam Milano, BEING ALLOWED TO STAY CONECTED TO THE WI FI INSTEAD OF BEING DROPPED OFF AFTER 5 OR 10 MINUTES WINDOWS THAT OPEN TO ALLOW FRESH AIR INTO THE ROOM INFORMATION OR WARNING ABOUT FIRE ALARM TEST BREAKFAST EGGS COOKED FRESH AND SOFT BETTER BREAKFAST COFFEE BASEMENT INCLUDING MEETING ROOM WAS VERY SMELLY, LOCATION IS TERRIFIC WHEN ARRIVING BY TRAIN EXCELLENT RESPONSE TO POWER OUTAGE ON SUNDAY 25TH WITH BREAKFAST PACK 
404767,Glam Milano, The decor, Our stay was excellent so conveniently situated and the staff most helpfu The breakfast and dinner were lovely and adequate Our room was comfortable but we found the colour of the room and the passageways scary 
404768,Glam Milano, After showering the water leaked all the way over the threshold onto the carpet in the room , Excellent location close to the train station Modern discreet hotel well sound proofed 
404769,Glam Milano, Some of the staff notably a waiter and then the woman at the check out were rude The dinner was mixed but good cooked items were scooped up by other people staying at the hotel A wee bit of a zoo , Convenient good price
404770,Glam Milano, Loved it all Would stay here again in a minute However sigh for hotel is a little hidden by a pillar , Loved it from the minute we saw it from the train station So nice to have it right across the street Great front desk staff very fast excellent English We had 4 rooms total and everyone said it greatly exceeded expectations If also included generous breakfast bar dinner buffet which we didn t realize but it was a perfect surprise Also we all said how nice the bathrooms were with excellent water pressure This place is doing it right 
404771,Glam Milano,No Negative, The Glam Hotel is placed near the railway station and has a subway station in front of it It was a great location for us because we stayed five days in Milan but three days we travelled by train to lakes The room was nice very clean with a great view over the railway station market especially in the evening when the lights were on Wifi worked good The staff was friendly and helpful During this trip it was the first time when we were stuck in the elevator We called the front desk and since we announced it they let us free in a really short time The breakfast and dinner have been included in the room price Both were very good very tasty and we could choose between a lot of dishes 
404772,Glam Milano, My parents were given a room with a problem with electricity they couldn t even charge their phones and air conditioner didn t work But this problem was solved the next day A better room was given and everything was fine , Nice room large and soft bed was very comfortable Dinners were very delicious I liked everything there 
404773,Glam Milano, The staff at the restaurant are talking to each other all the time and ignoring guests walking in Their service needs to be improved also at the reception , The hotel provides not only breakfasts but also buffet dinner The design is nice it s new modern and clean The staff at the bar is very polite and friendly 
404774,Glam Milano, Noise from the construction of a new wing of the hotel Dinner not so good Poor wi fi, Excellent location metro in front of hotel and the Central Station near by Clean Good breakfast Staff friendly 
404775,Glam Milano, I arrived in a south facing room about 5 pm on an afternoon when the sun had been and still was pouring in It was not possible to open the windows so I drew the curtains and switched on the air conditioning but the cool air came in just inside the door and was ineffective over the room as a whole over the rest of the day it reduced the temperature only by about 3 degrees to 27 The next morning I spoke to the woman doing up the rooms and asked her to leave the curtains closed she said it was hotel policy to leave them open I was surprised as I ve stayed in lots of places in Italy and the usual practice is to keep shutters curtains closed against the sun Even then the air con was not very effective The side of the bath was high and broad making it precarious to get into and there was no non slip base to the bath or grab handle Probably fine for the young but a potential accident area or just not usable for some older people My room lights were not much good for reading I personally did not like the ultra modern decor , Risotto at dinner Fresh fruit available What about providing a bowl of water to wash the fruit in I went on to another hotel which did this Bed comfortable also pillows Quiet on 7th floor No noise from adjoining rooms The dining room manager 
404776,Glam Milano, Smell of drains in reception and corridors Quality eating experience and value for money of the evening meal and breakfast was very poor Not worth paying the extra for the evening meal Getting to the food was like a scrum and the dishes were not marked I complained to reception but was given a story that the evening meal was a freebie and the cost of the room was comparable to other hotels this is certainly not how the evening meal was described in booking com s pages and the price I paid was higher due to including the evening meal , Beds were comfortable Room size was good 
404777,Glam Milano, Nothing about the hotel It s really closed to train station maybe 50 100 meters but the sign is not easy too see so it took us about 20 minutes to walk and ask around and find it , Breakfast was excellent Nice and welcoming staff 
404778,Glam Milano, one minor point the door couldn t close properly when we went out We informed the reception and immediately the engineer came and helped fix it Better put a knife and fork in the room for guest to use for cutting fruits or so , Comfortable bed excellent location clear good breakfast helpful staff
404779,Glam Milano, Dinner included is a tourist trap the restaurant is awful the food quality is modest the dining room is not a proper room but a corridor the service very basic Breakfast also feels plain didn t see any croissants or cutted fruits the juices are from a machine The hotel is modern and has good room decoration and furniture but the service management is bad Our room had water infiltrations on the floor and smelled like moisture the maid entered the room at 8h15am on a Sunday without even knocking wouldnt recomend as there must be loads of alternatives for same price on Milan , Good location for travelers by plane train near the metro 
404780,Glam Milano, Couldn t figure out how to use the TV Would have liked brighter lights to read by but it was a beautiful contemporary suite , Friendly helpful staff Upgraded to huge suite Wish my husband had been with me 
404781,Glam Milano, Only fault that we could pick on was an unpleasant smell in our room like sewage and in the corridor outside our room that came and went but mostly stayed Staff were unable to fix the problem apart from recommending that we run the air conditioning all the time This did not stop the problem , Excellent location very good staff excellent room and overall facilities Included breakfast and Dinner both very good in quality and choice 
404782,Glam Milano, We would recommend to make some minor changes to the bathroom like hooks for towels and to add a second chair in the room for two , Great breakfast and dinner Each day different menu
404783,Glam Milano, TV only had a few international channels only news Would have been good to have a little more variety , Breakfast and dinner was included in our package Room was cleaned daily with fresh towels Air con was silent Bathroom was great lit up mirror with hairdrier and large double headed power shower one in ceiling 
404784,Glam Milano, The ambience of the restaurant not meeting the standard off the accommodation It needs to be renovated to create a more flowing and glam pattern , Comfortable and well equipped room
404785,Glam Milano,No Negative, Really 1 mins walk form train station and just nearby the Metro station Hotel is almost brand new everything inside is modern and functional Dinner is great 
404786,Glam Milano, The aircon did not work properly Did not get colder than 26 degrees Complained too the resepsion but no help , Clean room Great location and good breakfast 
404787,Glam Milano, The lighting in the room was not bright enough to read in bed, The hotel is a two minute walk from the railway and metro station The king size bed was very comfy and the room was serviced every day The help yourself breakfasts and dinners were excellent and the selection of foods were of a high quality The staff were very helpful Highly recommend this hotel
404788,Glam Milano, Terrible food at the restaurant dinner for the half board was awful with bad smelling stale food Breakfast is not that good either lots of things from previous dinner looking even worse than the night before , Located right near the train station but the area is nice
404789,Glam Milano, Breakfast and dinner were a mess staff always seemed annoyed had to fight through other guests to get food charged 5 euro for water and would not let tomorrow bring your own , Front desk staff
404790,Glam Milano, These aren t major cons about the hotel but just a few things to be mindful of There is also a bit of traffic noise even on the 8th floor It s mainly early morning so not too distracting while sleeping The main con I have is that for the 3 nights we were there there was a problem with an electrical fault apparently outside of the hotel This caused a light in the entrance to our room to flick on and off through the night and one night stayed on for a few hours There is a door we were able to close but there was no advise or acknowledgement from staff as to how long this was going to go for After mentioning it to staff a few times with minimal response we decided not to worry about it and just keep the door closed For a light sleeper though it was distracting as the light still flashed through the grill in the bottom of the door Not sure if this was just an issue while we were there or permanent , Overall this was a great hotel with a cool funky feel The location was good for us as we were there for 3 night and arriving and leaving from Milano Centrale All other areas of Milan were easily accessible by the metro with access just outside the hotel The bathroom was fabulous with a deep bathtub and overhead rainwater shower I will warn people though that the ledge of the bath is wide and the step down is deep I slipped on my first night and landed with the ledge at the back of my thigh Lovely bruise for the rest of our trip The bar was a nice area but wasn t always staffed We had to get reception to call for service Not a problem but maybe something the hotel could look at improving There are some great restaurants nearby on the street the hotel s entrance is on We didn t feel overly safe at night by the station but other areas were fine If I was to go back to Milan I would consider staying here again 
404791,Glam Milano, Nothing that we didn t like, The location of the hotel high up on the hill The room was very simple with no TV etc so may not suit all but i suggest one should give it a go We would walk down to the town via the many steps and catch the bus back up Breakfast was included which was very nice There was just something about this hotel that made us feel really comfortable Would recommend to anyone
404792,Glam Milano, i did not like the dinner only seafood plate was delicious but the rest was not so good I also think that they should open a spa center for such a nice hotel, perfect location just 2 minutes walk to Central station breakfast was good the staff are helpfull
404793,Glam Milano, The city tax was high and we were unaware of the extra until we checked out , There was a problem with the shower flooding the bathroom The staff had the problem solved in 15 minutes with minimum disruption to us Nothing was too much trouble 
404794,Glam Milano, Wifi disconnects when closing the phone needs bigger restaurant to support all guests, Good food selection very supportive stuff at reception great location comfortable bed 
404795,Glam Milano, The elevators can get a bit slow sometimes during peak hours , Excellent location with helpful staff and comfy room Would love to stay here again in the future if we travel to Milan 
404796,Glam Milano, The hotel restaurant where breakfast and diner was served was small for the number of guests and not very well organised We took a while to find a table , My partner and I reached Milan after a 5 days of traveling in Rome and Florence while checking in we were upgraded to a better room with a fabulous view the hotel stay was very comfortable and we enjoyed it 
404797,Glam Milano, I paid in advance at least 2 month ago to get an room with excellent view when I arrived gave ne a room in the first floor with view to lateral street I spoke in the front desk and change me the room with train station view excellent , Near from the Train Station
404798,Glam Milano, The shower did not allow privacy with see through slats in the normal rooms , Great location at the main railway station Comfortable rooms with good views Good buffet breakfast and dinner with half board The junior suite was well laid out 
404799,Glam Milano,No Negative, It is just in front of the central station and then you can walk to all the sightsing spots of the city Great evening buffet and I would like to praise their effort of minimizing the waste of food by asking people to take only what they are capable of eating Very good sallad and warm food options and you can buy the wine per glass Tea kettle in the room and wonderful views of the central station Very good breakfast with lots of options 
404800,Glam Milano, Nothing, this was my second time booking at Glam Hotel modern hotel with a very cooperative nice staff which you rarely find in european hotels I had a problem with the safety deposit box and the maintenance guy arrived to the room in two minutes the rooms are very clean a bit small but good for european standards half board was a plus good variety of food on both breakfast and dinner easy to get anywhere as the hotel is 5 minutes away from the Milan train station I used to pay a lot for taxis when getting to the city center 120 euros the location of the hotel made it easy for me to get into express bus from MXP Airport for 8 euro per Person would book here again and again 
404801,Glam Milano, Restaurant had small space mostly only have two person table restaurant staff were not quite friendly especially dinner Probably overwhelmed with the number of guest To have dinner guest needs to get a coupon from reception desk sometimes it was asked sometimes not , Front Desk staffs were very friendly We got breakfast and dinner everyday with great variety and taste Room was very comfortable We stayed in 4 person room Junior Suite had a great view to Central Station Walking distance from Milano Centrale Taxi was very easy to get 
404802,Glam Milano, Smell in the room , Very kind staff very helpful Location is great if you have to take the train from Milano Centrale Close restaurants in the neighborhood 
404803,Glam Milano, Beds were a thin mattress on a wood frame the mattress kept slipping off during the night sleeping on the floor might have been softer My only negative comment , The breakfast and dinner buffet were very good with a great selection Location was right across from the train station and one block from the Eurocar rental office Metro station Bus stop and the Hop on Hop off bus were right outside the door 
404804,Glam Milano, Every time I come to Milan I book the Hotel Glam because of his many interesting points very close to all you need very clean reception always helpful the half pension offer is interesting But this time unfortunately and unexpected I was real disappointed Sorry Hotel Glam but this time I have to say it I booked the hotel two weeks before my stay at over the double of it s normal prize and in the days of my stay the prize reached even five times the usual prize This so on the reception because the hotel was almost full and prizes are going up consequently I think this is a real shame because we were at the level of a five star top hotel like the Four Seasons for example The problem is that the service is not better if you pay 5 times but worse Maybe because of the fullness of the hotel the breakfast was not like the other times very poor We get a room where the air condition did not work I needed to solicit two times on the reception and answer the attendant is busy please be patient When he came he told only that some valve is obstructed and that he cannot do anything So we were forced to sleep in a hot room resulting in a sweatiness during all the night No thanks not for this prize For such prize I ve could book a 5 star hotel without problem Dear Glam please review a little your politic I would still like to visit you the next times I m in Milan But not at this conditions , The personnel at the reception like always very friendly and helpful Very close to all in Milan 
404805,Glam Milano, Nothing, This hotel is amazing it is just across the Milan central train station this hotel have a really good location I totally recommend this place to all of you who travels to Milan by train with luggage another plus is this place is exactly at the entrance of Milan metro that can connect you to the milan cathedral it is just 3 stops with the yellow metro line The food is good with good varieties of food We booked a package that included dinner and the dinner is ALSO AMAZING the room we booked was triple room and twin room All rooms are comfortable the bed is comfy the Bathroom is amazingly modern if you need to book anything or even print your tickets or documents our case was 8 pages boarding passes and 8 pages train tickets they will still smile at you and serve you for free this hotel is amazing and we enjoyed our stay 
404806,Glam Milano, Area gets dodgy at night with suspicious characters Hotel has a guard which shows they are doing something about it , Location just outside Milan Centrale Station made it an ideal hotel to be used as a base to visit areas around or close to Milan eg Venice Room clean and staff ver helpful The free dinner was an added bonus 
404807,Glam Milano, The pillow was not really fit for me One pillow was too flat but double was too thick , Just 5 mins walk from central station and metro station in front of the hotel Pretty stylish interior with high ceiling Friendly staff Complimentary buffet dinner was awesome even though the food provided was just average but what can you expect 
404808,Glam Milano, View from the room overlooks a stalled building site No one working there so not an issue because it was quiet Location is good next to Central Station although some may find it an issue because of all the loiters around it, Diverse breakfast and inclusive dinner
404809,Glam Milano, nothing, The view was very good Tea and coffee facilities in the room were helpful and I like the big size of the room Delicios dinner and breakfast 
404810,Glam Milano, Very poor dinner buffet Strongly advice against the half board option Disappointing breakfast also for a hotel of its rating , The perfect location just opposite Milano Centrale Station The room was very nice and the view from the 9th floor was magnificent 
404811,Glam Milano, Our room was a little bit cold No big variety at dinner Everytime i wanted to use the internet i had to login with password , The location was great very close to central train station and the metro was right outside the hotel The room had a nice view and was very clean The breakfast was great 
404812,Glam Milano,No Negative, A short walk from the train station very comfortable hotel which I will be using again the next time I go to Milano Probably the best hotel for my needs in Milano that I have stayed in 
404813,Glam Milano, Instead of an included dinner I wish the room was a little cheaper Didn t enjoy the dinner at all and the hotel seems a little overpriced Also not a fan of the black color scheme in the bathrooms they just didn t feel that clean , close to the train station with nice rooms Very quite from the 6th floor even facing the train station 
404814,Glam Milano, The room is not that big but just an usual size as hotel in the city center , A few minutes walk from Milano Central station Clean room with reasonable price including breakfast and dinner Even slippers are prepared 
404815,Glam Milano, The dinner does not taste as good , Great location The hotel is just across the street from Milan Main Rail Station It is also very convenient to connect with the metro as it is just right in front of the hotel There are many restaurants and shops near by The room is spotless clean 
404816,Glam Milano, The buffet dinner consisted of random dishes and the food wasn t great the restaurant staff weren t friendly either Breakfast was acceptable though , Clean room
404817,Glam Milano, A booking option without breakfast and dinner at a better rate is a good idea Did not have a chance to either have breakfast or dinner at the hotel Cannot comment quality of breakfast or dinner as we did not try them but with all the amazing restaurants in Milan an option without breakfast and dinner at a better rate could be useful , Location is perfect Right next to Central rail station which you can reach from just about anywhere Metro station at the front door of the hotel so reaching any point of Milan is an ease 
404818,Glam Milano, Glam Not really a bit tired feeling actually like someone who was glam in a tarty way a few years ago but hasn t moved on The breakfast buffet hot food was a bit painful The scrambled eggs were half cooked literally some cooked lumps with uncooked scrambled egg mix slopping round them and the bacon was most odd Nothing like the decent thick rashers of back bacon in the UK Plenty of fruit though and pastries sweet cakes cereal etc if that is more your thing you would be quite pleased No parking but public car parks nearby were OK although you had to leave your keys with attendant which feels uncomfortable Another cost too compared to parking in hotel s own car park Guess it is just the nature of a city centre hotel , Cool location overlooking square in front of main railway station Great balcony on 9th floor with a view over square Free hot buffet evening meal looked pretty OK for free food but with one night only we wanted something a bit classier and went out to excellent Argentinian steak restaurant about 15 minutes taxi away 
404819,Glam Milano, When we arrived at the property we found our toiletries been used by others and just left there without being replaced The balcony had no chairs to sit Food in the restaurant was tasting the same no matter what you eat Also I suspected some of the food had high salt content , Excellent location near Centrale FS Central Railway station and all transport amenities are within 3 mins walk airport shuttle bus stops behind railways station City Cightseeing bus stops right in front of Central station bus to Serravalle Designer Outlet stops on the City Cightseeing bus stop Friendly hotel personnel Room was modern 
404820,Glam Milano, Increased graffity and pickpockets around the hotel You see random people walking towards you with earphones in their ears After few minutes one will run behind your back trying to steal your purse or belongings It was an Omen of what was to come they tried to steal my girlfriend purse at the hotel gate and unfortunately the security stood there watching , The view from floor9 unrestricted view
404821,Glam Milano, the sounds during the nights people live right outside on the street and the sound isolation is obviously thin The shower was hot or cold hard to find a balance and the room was a tick cold The food buffet experience was overrated and lifted my expectations too high The price is clearly for the location Still overall a good hotel , The location is great Good size rooms good beds lobby and reception personnel great 
404822,Glam Milano, No make up mirror High step in shower bath Low shower water pressure 8am No mattress pad Cold Pirelli tire like poached eggs Disorganized evening buffet w poor quality cold food Poor service w no beer glasses Poor reading lights, Spacious room modern facilities Queen size bed Mini bar Safe Flat screen TV Wi Fi Closet drawer space Bathroom towels Convenient location for travelers
404823,Glam Milano, I never like to complain because I feel we all have our own personal qualms and some may find that you are maybe being a little petty , The property was right opposite the central station This was the reason we had chosen this hotel because we had booked morning trains to go one day to Venice and the next Verona Otherwise the M3 metro line was only 4 stops to Duomo The bed and room temperature were just fine for a very comfortable sleep 
404824,Glam Milano, There was a disruption to the hot water supply on one of the days very inconvenient , Modern quirky decor Quad room for a family of four rarely found but highly appreciated View of the Central Station and the plaza in front of it beautiful Included dinner with a selection of Italian cheeses cold meats salads and olives together with soup hot dishes in bain marie fresh fruit and deserts all surprisingly tasty dinner service starts at 7 30 pm and there is a bit of a stampede at that time Breakfast also included in the room rate was excellent provided you stuck to the continental selection croissants were exceptional 
404825,Glam Milano, I loved the idea of a free buffet in the evening Unfortunately drinks are not free in contrast to the breakfast and prices for water soda beer and wine are incredibly high As the food is quite salty and probably intentionally so I spent on drinks what I would have spent on a dinner in a restaurant elsewhere Though this does not mean that the quality of the food isn t good In fact it is very good , The breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen 
404826,Glam Milano, The shower room s a clear glass wall It s not really suits for a group of friends , Very recommend The food are just awesome Both dinner and breakfast Staffs were so nice helpful and friendly plus the room was sooo clean quiet and comfortable 
404827,Glam Milano, The dinner buffet was not worthwhile , Good location felt safe Large room easy transportation access nice lounge area good breakfast selections fun vibe 
404828,Glam Milano, Even though a good location the surrounding areas could be a little spooky at night , Excellent breakfast and buffet dinner drinks are not included there are a little pricey 10 euros for a spritz 5 for a 75 cl bottle of water Good location in front of Milano Centrale so easy to get on trains and aeroports 
404829,Glam Milano, Nothing Everything was better than we expected , Our stay at this hotel was perfect The room and the design of the hotel was really nice Also I really liked the fact that the dinner was also included really tasty by the way The staff was extremely helpful I would recommend this hotel to everyone 
404830,Glam Milano, Weird colors everywhere given the name and style felt like a one night stand last resort before you catch your train in the morning , Right next to train station Food was good provided free dinner as part of promotion Very friendly staff
404831,Glam Milano, The room rates were jagged up three times more than the rate shown on booking com without asking we want to proceed with the booking The room rates were charged to our credit card before we arrived without any explanation on why and what it is for If the room rates were increased an email should be sent to us to ask if we want to proceed with the booking or choose any room with similar room rates as Glam Milano originally stated We paid for the room without a chance to reject It is cheating in my view ,No Positive
404832,Glam Milano, The only thing that wasn t ideal was the size of the rooms they were a little small, In my experience the food in Milan hotels is great but this bested all my expectations The fact that dinner was included was outstanding Staff was very friendly and helpful 
404833,Glam Milano, No Hot Water and staff were not upfront the about the situation There was a notice about short interruption potentially affecting water for 3 hours from 12pm day we arrived Next morning we found we only had cold shower on ringing were advised would be fixed in an hour when we checked out still not working updated message elevators advising potential problem with water that would be rectified shortly They didn t want to give any refund but finally agreed to waive 10 euro city tax when we checked out , Excellent location short walk from Milan Central Railway Station Modern facilities good Wifi 
404834,Glam Milano, Nothing, The breakfast and dinner was included on the price it s an excellent choice to stay in Milan In front of Milano Centrale The view s room is wonderful 
404835,Glam Milano, TERRIBLE COLOURS ON WALLS AND THE MEALS WERE INEDIBLE ESPECIALLY THE DINNER WE PAID FOR BREAKFAST AND DINNER BUT AFTER THE FIRST DINNER WHICH WAS TERRIBLE THE MEAT AND ROLLS WERE INEDIBLE WE DID NOT EAT THERE AGAIN SO WASTED OUR MONEY , THE ROOMS WERE CLEAN ALTHOUGH SMALL 
404836,Glam Milano, No water in room Tv had no English movie channels Breakfast hall difficult to get table , Almost everything Nice Room well designed comfy bed Nice rain shower in bathroom Great value I got it for euro 125 for half board Breakfast and dinner were excellent I stayed in 9 hotels during my Italian trip and they had the best breakfast choice Location can t be beat if you need near milano centrale station 
404837,Glam Milano,No Negative, Breakfast is well garnished and good You can ask espresso to the staff as it was only instant coffee at the buffet But we are in italy so no problemo 
404838,Glam Milano, No water in the shower they fixed it real fast No electricity later in the night I called them at 6AM they said that they would take care of it but they didn t I called them again at seven and only then they started working on it and it took them sometime The shower is completely dark without lights Don t take room 622 It s probably jinxed , Dinner was good Many kinds of cheese to choose from They cahrge a lot for the drinks Breakfast was acceptable Polite staff A spacious and nice room The bed was comfortable A very convenient location The metro is just in front of the hotel and the central station just across the square 
404839,Glam Milano, The canteen like atmosphere is the restaurant , The room for disabled people is really comfortable and practical for wheelchair users The buffet at dinner time is a nice idea i e for late arrivals You can get some Italian food in the evening without going to a restaurant 
404840,Glam Milano, small place for breakfast dinner no big variety of normal hot food at dinners just cheese and ham very cold in the bathroom, view out the window whole design of the hotel food friendly staff stylish and quiet room
404841,Glam Milano, What i didn t like was the tub in the bathroom Too much hurdle to get into and out of the tub as the edge is very high from the floor I am not an old person but am sure it is not too practical for older people I also felt the bathroom was too dark as the walls were black Does not give a sense of cleanliness , the staff was very nice the breakfast is very delicious I loved the quietness of the rooms I did not hear one single noise from the outside 
404842,Glam Milano, No food options for vegetarians , Specious rooms with very clean and comfortable beds Very good to stay at during business trips as well as with family Location is wonderful and outside view is great One must inform at the time of check in for the rooms with front view towards Milano Centrale station 
404843,Glam Milano, Nothing, I was already several times in the Glam Hotel of Milan As always I was satisfied by my choice of the hotel Glam The hotel is quiet new very cozy and clean perfectly linked to all the public transportation in front of the Central Railway of Milan Personnel very gentle and helpful the offer of half pension is great As always a very good stay in this hotel 
404844,Glam Milano, There is no spa or any sport room inside Breakfast and dinner were included but I don t recommend it , Hotel is right opposite to Milano Centrale station it is a good place to start trips by city or go to other italian or swiss areas by train Rooms and bathroom were very big and clean Good beds and noise protection 
404845,Glam Milano, I feel the public safety around the hotel was not good , A small but practical hotel Just infront of centrale station Nice breakefast and clean room 
404846,Glam Milano, I woke up on my second night that the power in my room is not working but it was quickly fixed , Excellent location as it is very near Milano Centrale Statation Comfortable bed and room size is good enough 
404847,Glam Milano,No Negative, We were upgraded to the penthouse suite upon arrival A very memorable end to our two week holiday in Italy Grazie Mille Kids loved the buffet dinner and breakfast 
404848,Glam Milano, Room quite warm and couldn t open windows Drinks including water were quite expensive , Spacious room and comfortable bed Bathroom a good size with a bathtub and rain head shower Room was very clean Large windows with a decent view We were situated right in front of a lift but room was completely soundproof Breakfast and dinner provided which was a bonus Breakfast had choices of eggs bacon toast etc as well as a range of muesli and cereals fruit and other condiments Dinner there was a good variety to choose from including an amazing cheese and cold meats section hot foods inc pasta risotto vegetables salads fruit and dessert Staff were welcoming Hotel located right near train station which was very convenient 
404849,Glam Milano, The staffs near the reception could have been more friendly and smile at the guests , The location is superb We booked the half board room Breakfast and dinner selection was good Room was a bit small but the size of the toilet is good 
404850,Glam Milano,No Negative, clean comfortable and modern rooms the place is quiet and safe bathroom came with nice smelling toiletries wide variety of food for dinner and breakfast walking distance from milano centrale like it is in front of the station so it is really convenient if you use the train it is really a good value for your money overall 
404851,Glam Milano, I found the beds a little hard and the coffee in the room was only ok but the coffee machine at the breakfast buffet was superb, We enjoyed the dinner and breakfast being included We were passing through for the night and the meals were a nice addition and a good selection for both The metro is right outside the door so we easily got to the main sights 
404852,Glam Milano, Nothing , Top location besides the metro and central station Easy to airport and all around Very modern and design hotel Excellent breakfast Street quiet on top floors Nice surroundings 
404853,Glam Milano, There is no bathtub Shower area is too small and separated from dry area with just curtain , The hotel location is excellent Just opposite Milano centrale Easy to go to Malpensa Airport or to Milan Duomo Room size is quite big Clean and comfort Staff is very nice and helpful The room rate was included breakfast and dinner and the quality of food was good 
404854,Glam Milano, Location was good for me but it is a little far from the action However the hotel is right by what underground so everything is accessible in minutes, Very good hotel with everything I needed Very close to underground and train station Location was great for me to be close to the train sttion
404855,Glam Milano,No Negative, We appreciated that Alberto from the front office helped us book a private parking spot just across the hotel We also loved the variety of the breakfast and the fact that in the room s price was included the dinner The whole hotel has a modern and fancy air we really liked the well thought little touches like the night light in the bathroom 
404856,Glam Milano, I only stayed 1 night so nothing to complain about , The hotel has an excellent location next to Milano Centrale and the metro station is basically right in front of the entrance Rooms are big clean and modern spacious bathroom with an excellent shower Slippers tea making facilities good view from the window escpecially if you have a higher floor Good sound proofing Dinner buffet is a nice touch in case you did not have time to find a good restaurant They bring cookies to your room in the evening 
404857,Glam Milano,No Negative, A very nice modern efficiently run clean hotel right by the Milano central train station and close to all other public transportation Extremely convenient to those needing the train proximity but also within 30 minutes pleasant walk to the historical center 
404858,Glam Milano, Nothing , Dinner was included which was a surprise Nothing amazing but quite satisfactory at the end of long day Overall super stylish super modern and great location in terms of accessibility My room had a view of Milano Central which was lovely but I imagine that some of the other rooms facing other directions may not have had as nice a view looking at other nondescript buildings 
404859,Glam Milano,No Negative, Nice rooms with a modern design nice facilities and had a nice modern feel to the overall environment Great location as it is across from Milano Centrale station as well as next to the metro and tram lines 
404860,Glam Milano, absolutely nothing, I had an excellent stay Hotel is conveniently located right in front of Milano Centrale Metro and bus tram stations next door as well Hotel staff is extremely friendly and professional rooms are big quiet and impeccably clean bathrooms are very nice Strong WIFI signal Breakfast was excellent I believe dinner too but I have missed it unfortunately I think I had my best stay in Milano ever thank you Glam Milano I will definitely come back 
404861,Glam Milano, Only few things 1 When we came to the hotel our room was not clean But next morning after serving time it was shining 2 Restaurant area is not convinient because of many corridors and small space And too many young people in the restaurant staff no experience , This hotel is near the trainstation It is convinient to get from to airport by train Subway station is in front of the hotel Also it is 25 minutes far from center of the city to walk Bus to the Serrowalle outlet willage is also starting its way in front of the hotel Rooms are modernly furnetured bathroom is good very clean in the room our cleaning staff was very accurate Nice view from our windows to the central station Good food during breakfest and dinner 
404862,Glam Milano,No Negative, Great value for the money Close to centralstation Both breakfast and dinnerbuff inkluded in the price And we were upgraded to miniswith with fantastic view 
404863,Glam Milano, Breakfast seemed to work fine but there seemed to be a big rush for the evening meal Regardless of the time we picked the dining area is busy and the goodies disappeared fast For example the meat and the dessert They were replenished but not quite quick enough , The location was ideal for both airport transfers and easy access to the historic centre The metro station is almost at the hotel entrance and we overlooked the Central Railway Station where we picked up our Airport bus transfer The hotel itself was very modern and comfortable and would consider it again or recommend to friends 
404864,Glam Milano, There was only Italian TV channels Would of been nice to get an English speaking CNN for news of the world, Convenience to the Centrale Stazione Breakfast was amazing so much variety
404865,Glam Milano, the windows in the bedrooms don t open I really didn t like not being able to change the air in my room , great breakfast SUPER close to train station
404866,Glam Milano, Too expensive for the quality WiFi was disconnected the check out day at 10 00 am Restaurant just normal for the price and crowded Drinks are not included in the buffet and are expensive Small glass of medium low quality wine 9 I needed a split of the invoice that they were unable to make , Comfortable and nice Tidy rooms 
404867,Glam Milano, Stayed 5 nights changed rooms once but nothing solved and an extra happened Changed rooms because the switch of the shower in the first room was missing the one in the second room remained but didn t work At the last night there was a blackout at midnight so that I had to call the counter to have light back ,No Positive
404868,Glam Milano, also breakfast ist really not interesting and very crowded Also we had a hotel confirmation and they tried to send us another hotel Never again Glam Hotel ,No Positive
404869,Glam Milano, The bed was quite uncomfortable and hard for us We had there three days and all breakfasts and all dinners are same Could have been even a little vary Waiters had problems with filling the dining tables Quite often had to wait for meals , Location Staff was friendly Breakfast was quite tasty Dinner buffet dinner are also OK drinks for extra money 
404870,Glam Milano, Breakfast dinner very basic and repetitive , Great location Clean and quite hotel Efficient front desk Superior room external view very pleasant 
404871,Glam Milano, The lights were not bright enough the room for 3 was quite small, Locations was super near to central station restaurants The staffs were friendly helpful Free dinner was also plus point for staying in this hotel
404872,Glam Milano,No Negative, Great personnel always helpfull ready to assist with any questions Everyone is friendly cheerful and positive Very clean very quiet rooms in spite of location which is convinient by the way The buses to Serravalle depart from a nearby trains tp and from Malpensa arrive and depart from Centrale 2 metro lines Duomo is in 20 30 min walk Corso Como and Porta Garibaldi in 15 min Personal note if you plan to do a lot of shopping very easy to commute to and from hotel to a number of destinations with luggage shopping bags etc Especially when leaving 1 min to the railway station to the airport Breakfast is good and rich although almost the same every morning The dinner is great as well A lot of different options that change from day to day A great selection of wines at dinner 
404873,Glam Milano, A few hotter items at breakfast and dinner would make it even more perfect , Stayed twice in January in the same panoramic room with a wrap around small balcony The unobstructed view of the train station and surrounding was exceptional Room was modern new and very comfortable Great wifi The full buffet breakfast has many items to suit various tastes Best of all was their very helpful and professional staff especially Ms Ilaria who went out of her way to help me recover a treasured item I left at a nearby restaurant after I left Thanks to Glam for a lovely memorable time Expectations were truly exceeded 
404874,Glam Milano, Booked a double room but got a twin room i e two single beds instead of one queen king bed I was arriving late and too sleepy and tired to go back down argue etc so had to live with that The room was not properly cleaned there were someone s long hairs in the bathroom and something sticky on the tea mug and teaspoon The breakfast is okay but not impressive At this price and given them claiming to be a four star hotel thing could have been much better Otherwise and up to me it is a decent three star hotel at a very high price , Perfect location just across the street from the main train station modern ro design and nice view from the window overlooking the square and train station Wi Fi is pretty good 
404875,Glam Milano,No Negative, Wifi clean rooms breakfast and dinner it was just great Location is the best in milan 100m to central station 4 stops from yellow line to duomo thank you glam hotel 
404876,Glam Milano, the variety of food at dinner is poor Although I was in the 6th floor I still hear noise from the street The restaurant is small and staff is not covering the whole number of people and many items at breakfast and dinner run fast and they took a lot of time to recover with additional quantity , Location is great and near to metro and central train station WIFI is good Staff is great the furniture is good new and modern space of room
404877,Glam Milano, Breakfast and dinner were very crowded All bookings has to include the half board but the food of dinner were really not as good as expected So we decided to had dinner somewhere else in the city on the second day , Very good location Just 5 minutes maximum from the station 1 minute from the Metro entrance If you have a lot of luggages to from the station This hotel is one of your best choice 
404878,Glam Milano, The food was good but perhaps they have to change the system of the dinner Since there were a lot of people there were not enough seats to take place ,No Positive
404879,Glam Milano, The weather brrrrrrr , Stunning modern hotel more or less at the entrance to the beautiful Stazione Centrale I have stayed in many hotels in this area and the Glam is by far the best Most hotels in and around the area are traditional and therefore lack the modern amenities that the Glam offers Super friendly staff and a good breakfast help makes this arguably the best hotel in this area 
404880,Glam Milano, Just wonderfull , Visiting for the seventh time Milan in the last years we discovered now GLAM Ideal positioned near Stazione Centrale with metro stop right in front of the hotel Easy to reach the airport and the center town A very kind and friendlly staff at frontdesk and bar New and modern interior Rooms are big with a nice view over the city a wonderfull comod bed Rooms are fitted completelly for a real 4 stars Fast free wifi The Breakfast and dinner included in the price are very convenient and enough diversified for every taste The price over quality and offer it s absolutelly great This hotel deserve for sure a big 10 and we will come back here for sure next time in Milan Thank you GLAM for everything 
404881,Glam Milano, Dining Area is not that Good, Location 2 Min walks to Milano Central station lots of Metro station near by if you prefer walking simply you can walk for Approx 15 Min to reach Duomo Cathedral 
404882,Glam Milano, The food was average at best and if we stayed longer than one night we would have been eating out , Staff were helpful and friendly and our room was fairly spacious This hotel is really close to Milano Centrale Station so its great if you are catching trains 
404883,Glam Milano, booking includes dinner but I don t have a pleasant experience in dinner since the buffet selections are not that great and it is not refilled as often as it should , Just across Milan Central Station 
404884,Glam Milano, No hot water for shower or sink best case scenario you get warm water for short periods , Great access to metro station right in front of the hotel Parking garage very close not included Fair breakfast and dinner included in room rate 
404885,Glam Milano, The buffet style dinner is good but to manage guests to have a better balance in the amount of people in the restaurant probably something the hotel can do to improve the service , The location is great for one who needs to use the central station And the included dinner and breakfast are absolutely a bonus for me limited time to explore 
404886,Glam Milano, There are sertain issues with the lack of food during breakfasts and dinners The waiters should be more aware of the food availability as the restaurant runs of it extremely fast ,No Positive
404887,Glam Milano, I didn t like that the junior suite was so good that we didn t like to go outside for sightseeing , Quite a view from the room good breakfast and dinner Excellent location to the central station The view from the restaurant is great too 
404888,Glam Milano, The area around the train station was a bit tough but we also saw homeless very near the Duomo We never felt unsafe, Great location right at train station and near metro entrance Free breakfast was good and dinner was fine we snacked there one night because we had a late lunch The staff was very nice and accommodated our dog for small fee 15 euro 
404889,Glam Milano, we asked for quadripule room its was for 3 poeple when i talk to them they brought a supplement bed very small it made the area veey small we couldnt move in the room, easy check in the location its next to centrale train station and the metro just 2mn walking
404890,Glam Milano, Tap in bathroom was broken and not fixed for the three days we were there staff informed Reception did not answer the phone several times we had to go down to ask them for information , Great location near station metro Room was a reasonable size Half board is good value if can take a piece of meat fish with cold salads every night fruit for desert you have to pay for all drinks including water 
404891,Glam Milano, Buffet evening meal was a scrum and not very hot , Location near to Milan Central Station and other local transit Very comfortable rooms great breakfast great value for money
404892,Glam Milano,No Negative, The Location was less than 2mins walks from Milan station Dinner spread was good We told the staff that we will miss bf as we are talking the 7am train to Switzerland they were so kind to pack bf for us 
404893,Glam Milano, Wifi connection is easily disconnected and has to input the code from time to time , Very good breakfast and dinner So convenient just in front of the central train station and metro 
404894,Glam Milano,No Negative, Location was great Hotel is beautiful and staff are very helpful Buffet was pretty good but crowded a lot of the time However enjoyed my time there immensely 
404895,Glam Milano, A tiny bit noisy street noise and trains but alright if you bring earplugs , Nice staff very comfy bed Loved the tropical shower Very clean good breakfast and dinner buffet Staff was very quick to replace anything that was empty Conveniently located next to the central station 
404896,Glam Milano, Hotel staff is not properly trained we had to remind about a safe to be unlocked after being promised that it would be done right away but waiting in vain the same story happened when we asked for a bottle opener they just keep forgetting about guests requests Another annoying factor was that our room was too hot and we were not able to bring the temperature down with air conditioning whilst windows could not be opened Because of heat and stuffiness we were not able to sleep well, Location just across the street from the Central Station busses to all airports and in two steps from metro Great choice of food at breakfast and dinner being included in the room price all yammy Modern design and comfort of the bathroom with full set of toiletries not always a case even in 5 stars beautiful view from ceiling to floor windows 
404897,Glam Milano,No Negative, Very close to the train station and about a 20 minute walk to the Duomo Breakfast and dinner were included in our rate but we tried to eat out to absorb the local culture The rooms were very comfortable and the bathrooms well furnished 
404898,Glam Milano,No Negative, We stayed 3 nights in this comfortable hotel in the same square of the central station in Milan The staff at the reception is friendly and helpful for everything do you need The room was clean modern comfortable and very quite during the day and night so we can sleep wery well without noise This hotel has half pension included in the price that make a good value in a city like Milan The breakfast and the dinner buffet are well presented fresh good taste and thanks to the special staff Stella Michela Dalila Andrea and more that make your stay at restaurant agreeable A special thanks too to Kevin at Bar for his help Thank you so much and arrivederci to next time Ciao dai 2 ragazzi del pane 
404899,Glam Milano,No Negative, Great hotel with amazing location right next to Milano Central Station and Centrale metro station friendly staff very comfortable beds sound proof rooms and very nice half board with variety of food Would definitely come back 
404900,Glam Milano, Shower at times had extremely low pressure made it impossible to shower mostly at peak times in the morning , Great Location near the main train station metro stop making access to city very easy 
404901,Glam Milano,No Negative, Staff were brilliant and efficient Went out of way to help us out and nothing was too much trouble Buffet was great and location fantastic if you are travelling by train Rooms were large and comfortable beds and pillows also high quality Excellent value for money Very happy with our stay 
404902,Glam Milano, There was a variety of cooked food available at breakfast such as scrambled eggs mushrooms bacon etc and vegetables such as spinach and brocoli These tasted fine but tended to be cold , Overall the beakfast was plentiful and had everything one could want including fresh fruit juices and bakery items All the staff were polite welcoming and attentive The room was a good size very clean and the queen sized bed was extremely comfortable The bathroom had an excellent shower The wifi was very good 
404903,Glam Milano, We had half board was not enough table in the restaurant as should be Was crowded and many people had to wait sometimes with plates in hands as specially at breakfast The hotel should solve this if do not want to lose returning guests The waiters were too buisy we were not asked what wanted to drink to the dinner 2 evenings , Was quite right clean comfortable 
404904,Glam Milano,No Negative, The Staff was very passionate and helpful both of concierge and restaurant comfortable guest room with a big glass window I had a pleasant staying experience muchas gracias 
404905,Glam Milano, Very unpleasant approach of some staff Twice I asked for an early breakfast for the next day but in the morning it turned out that our demand had been ignored The staff informed us about that adding that they cannot do anything It took me 30 minutes to explain them and it was not due to language deficiencies that they should provide us with a discount for the missing breakfast or prepare a breakfast to go They also refused to contact the manager Finally they provided two boxes of very poor breakfast it all took 45 minutes At the end we did not even hear we are sorry and they did not even pretend that they bother Well if this is an approach of hotel then I would suggest to book a hotel they tend to care more about their customers ,No Positive
404906,Glam Milano, organization of restaurant area is not really good visitors need to spend time to find table after to wait for food, location is good quality of food for breackfast and dinner staff
404907,Glam Milano, Could have given dinner buffet a miss Nice option gesture but I d rather pay and enjoy my meal , Excellent location and a spacious room Nice staff They also had a dinner buffet included in the price It was a little hectic and good continued to run out but when it s free you can t really complain Was very generous 
404908,Glam Milano, The Glam Hotel in Milan is a nightmare We booked the hotel on their website which at that time said Oops our staff is busy please try again We tried twice with the same result and then went on booking on Booking com What happened was that the hotel charged us three times I spent two days on the phone and I had to talk three times to the IT company used by the hotel sic which acknowledged that the problem on the website was theirs and it was only then that the hotel admitted that there was a problem No excuses from the hotel still We are now waiting for the credit card bill to see if they finally deleted the web reservations The hotel room itself was small but ok The breakfast and dinners were overcrowded and the staff did not manage to keep food on the buffet table so that everyone could get at least something The hotel has a garage but it was full and they gave us a discount ticket to a near by garage There one needs to leave the car and the keys and they don t even give you a receipt where it would mention the make or number plates We refused and after a long negotiation left the car but kept the key We definitely do not recommend this hotel , Too few things to mention This hotel is seriously not recommended 
404909,Glam Milano, everything a perfect , The location is perfect both for the city of Milan and for travelling to other cities in Italy The staff are great half board was fantastic value and the food was really tasty everyday The room was perfect the wifi great and I would highly recommend this hotel for any one planning a trip to Milan 
404910,Glam Milano, Nothing, Couldn t fault Clean comfortable and modern hotel across the road from the train station This property has all the facilities you would expect Outstanding dinner and breakfast and excellent value for the price Easy walking distance to central shopping Staff pleasant and helpful Would definitely stay here when in Milan 
404911,Glam Milano, Shower room n tap are big problems All floor wet when shower So heavy tap n not adjustable Can t relax when I m shower totally No space for luggage , Comfortable bed n cover 
404912,Glam Milano, Not value for money Facilities are basic and not good at quality Cannot imagine the breakfast could be this bad in Italy And PLEASE pay attention to your bill when check out as they will SECRETLY CHARGE you on something you never order Not only happened to me However the best choice is NOT to stay here There are tons of hotel around central station , Location next to central train station 
404913,Glam Milano, Dinner is an easily forgettable meal We got upgraded to a disabled room which had a really distinctive unpractical disabled bathroom , Breakfast was nice Room was big Location is really good close to the tube railway and buses Modern contemporary hotel with some nice touches 
404914,Glam Milano, Dining area Not enough places available for the size of the hotel and the layout was not very user friendly No labels on items so you didn t necessarily know what was in a dish Example the potato salad had ham in also food not in logical places e g a small salad item in glasses in the desserts, Mostly everything
404915,Glam Milano, For 140 euros I expect to have a table to sit during breakfast Breakfast was sufficient but limited dinner that was included in the price was rather poor Don t bother eating in the hotel in the evening there are plenty of nice restaurants in town The room was way too warm even when putting the temperature system on 18 it stayed 20 21 degrees during the night Girl at check out didnt ask if I enjoyed my stay thanked me though as soon as I paid, Location is fab being right opposite Milano Centrale train station Room on the 9th floor had a great view Room was clean fantastic rain shower and bed was comfy Staff upon check in very friendly 
404916,Glam Milano, I liked everything May be just a small remark Poor lighting in the room and the lack of indoor pool , We enjoyed excellent breakfasts and evening meals impeccable service and a very convenient location In Milan we will stay only here 
404917,Glam Milano, Difficult to get a night sleep as curtains transparent and too many lights in the air square Bathroom with poor drainage with a smell of mould When highlighted issue with reception they twice ignored They throw away a free buffet meal avoid poor level of food and drinks sky high a glass of wine 8euros , Good location lcose to train station Modern room comfortable bed generally clean Adequate choice of breakfast 
404918,Glam Milano, We had to wait a long time in the bar to get a drink as there were nobody there We let them know at the front desk but it still took a long time before the barkeeper turned up , The location was perfect right by the central station with easy access to trains metro busses and trams just outside We were given a nice big junior suite on the 7th floor and had a very lovely view Very good breakfast and dinner buffet included in the price Very good value for the money The hotel is very clean new and modern 
404919,Glam Milano, Nothing, Perfect location very friendly staff modern clean and comfortable Room was Well insulated from sounds of the busy streets opposite the station The most powerful shower I ve ever been in an amazing hot waterfall D Metro station entrance right next to hotel entrance 
404920,Glam Milano, The half board dinner Not really Useful as Italy is well known for it cuisine and there are many nice eatery around the hotel , The only hotel to have rain shower for all the hotel I book in my trip 
404921,Glam Milano, The only thing to point out is that during my stay the staff got in my bedroom abruptly 3 times The dinner could be improved The food had very poor quality , The hotel is very convenient located just opposite to Station Centrale with fast trains to and from the airport and a very short tube ride to the city centre The rooms are comfortable and have a very decent size Breakfast is good 
404922,Glam Milano, None, Excellent location especially for those catching flights to any of No man s 3 airports I was upgraded to a junior suite with fantastic views of the Milan Central Station Very friendly reception and great value for money 
404923,Glam Milano, Room was overheated and couldn t open the window but hotel were very good at resetting the temperature in our room , Providing an evening meal as part of the deal 
404924,Glam Milano,No Negative, We booked a normal room but instead they gave us a double suite for the same price With great view also Room was clean food was good everything perfect 
404925,Glam Milano, The food was not very hot the counter that s keeps the food warm was kept at a low temperature, The rooms were clean tidy and modern very comfortable
404926,Glam Milano, Check in process was poor A long wait while one agent dealt with a concierge style request and the other answered the phone The room was very poorly lit with no light at all over the desk or make up table , Location short walk from station Plenty of restaurants near by 
404927,Glam Milano, Bathroom a bit too dark Dinner was ok but there is not enought places to sit and the self service part was crouded , Location was perfect The rooms are nice and clean cool bathroom Breakfast was great staff super nice the check in was really fast I would deffinetly stay again 
404928,Glam Milano, No free welcome water in the room Cosmetics soap not recharged after 1 night , Excellent location professional staff very comfortable bed great breakfasts and very good dinner how can anyone complain about food of this quality included in price Moreover very clean decent view honestly one of the very best hotels I have recently been in Europe 
404929,Glam Milano, Would have been better if it had leisure facilities didn t upset my holiday without it though, Loved the whole experience great to have half board facilities for what I had planned to pay for B B
404930,Glam Milano, Dinner was included in the room rate but drinks are not included and overpriced Staff in the restaurant was a bit too keen to push drinks , The modern stylish decor cleanliness and good wifi connection 
404931,Glam Milano, Worst experience after taking shower the water flooded to all the room all my luggage and clothes where wet I called the room service they came and didn t do anything when I checked out they didn t mention about the problem When you take the room they don t offer one bottle of water free of charge , Worst experience after taking shower the water flooded to all the room all my luggage and clothes where wet I called the room service they came and didn t do anything when I checked out they didn t mention about the problem 
404932,Glam Milano, Their handling of buffet dinner was poor They do not have enough seating Food gets over very fast and is not replaced quickly Very limited vegetarian options , Nice room
404933,Glam Milano, Not much of shopping nearby but there is metro taxi s No free drinking water bottles but gave us free breakfast dinner which was nice, Modern design clean near a couple of restaurants cafe supermarket metro friendly staff Junior suite took the 4 of us with comfort Free breakfast dinner good buffet
404934,Glam Milano, there was few choices of drinks on dinner , excellent breakfast The bedroom view was amazing Righ next to the milano centrale with luggage room so you can go and see a little more of the city and then pick up you luggage to go straight to the airport 
404935,Glam Milano, The breakfast buffet was not great The hot food was warm at best , We arrived very early to the hotel 11am and the receptionist went out of her way to find us a room On both nights we asked staff to recommend restaurants for dinner both recommendations were excellent The hotel is perfectly located across from the Central Station 
404936,Glam Milano, I had a very unprofessional and rude experience at dinner A lady restaurant worker cleaned out my table and offered it to someone else while I was serving myself dessert The new guests were preparing to sit on the table when I returned with my dessert and told her I wasn t finished yet She just said It s okay and left after clearing the table I was speechless for a few minutes at the response The guests understood the awkward situation and moved to another table and I finished my dessert without a towel cutlery and in extreme embarrassement Please train your staff to respond better to guests And hey dinner is NOT included in the room price if you re going to charge for water Yes it doesn t cost much at all but this is not about the price it is about the principle My other two stays at this hotel have been good but you know the law of averages always catches up , This was my third time at this hotel the room was comfortable as usual and even though I paid a bit more than the last two times room wise I was satisfied to come back 
404937,Glam Milano, The hotel had requested us to book two rooms to accommodate our family and we had done so and prepaid However we were asked the very same questions at the reception when we checked in and needed to go through all the cumbersome processes we had already done Complete lack of communication and coordination among the hotel staff The reception was allogant and did not even apologize for their repeating of the same questions and processes We smelled a strong sewer like odor when we entered the room 904 and asked the reception whether we can change the room A hotel staff checked the room and awknowldged the order However the hotel asked us to stay in the room overnight as no other rooms were available My wife and kids suffered from the very uncomfortable odor in the room without any compensation All in all truly a waste of money Very uncomfortable check in and stay Although the hotel is just in front of the Milan main station its cost benefit ratio is just too high , Location 
404938,Glam Milano, The overall look feel of the hotel especially common areas entrance hallways corridors etc is slightly off It feels sometimes like a hours motel rather than a glamorous or hip hotel The floor carpet in the rooms has a terrible look looks a bit dirty and really un smooth to the naked feet my suggestion is to change it as soon as possible , The staff has been outstanding Everybody was extremely friendly and helpful As an example there was a small cleanliness issue with my room no need to tell the details stuff that happens and my case was managed fast and professionally I was even upgraded to a better room for the disturbance On the decor except for some color choices that are questionable the decor is up to date and overall has a modern vibe View from the rooms is quite nice also thanks to the very big windows My room was spacious and the bathroom was very good with a very large and comfortable shower Position is very handy as it literally 5 minutes walk from the main station and an underground just in front of the hotel allows you to move around the city easily 
404939,Glam Milano, reported that bath tap was not working and not fixed also kettle did not work unless we put something on to of lid reported that too and not fixed very crowded in dining room , proximity to station and shuttles to airports was great half board and variety of and freshness of foods offered was pleasing 
404940,Glam Milano, Dinner is included in the room rate but it s horrible Breakfast was okay but dinner is really bad so either the hotel should give the option of only bed and breakfast and reduce the room rate or improve the quality of food , The location was perfect a 3 minute walk to the milano centrale There s a metro station right infront of the hotel which takes tou everywhere around Milan Room was nice i would say overall it was the perfect hotel to stay for a couple of days in Milan if you re moving with trains 
404941,Glam Milano, Windows to construction field inside yard no sauna or any facilities at hotel busy lobby with a lot of people, Clean but small room large showerroom
404942,Glam Milano, That it was only for one night, Everything was great staff decoration view breakfast location They upgraded us to a junior suite nice bed toilletries big windows 
404943,Glam Milano, WiFi did not work in room Reported to hotel but not rectified Booked a superior rooms but did not have the layout or views as advertised as not all of the 9th floor rooms do Avoid 904 905 906 Breakfast Room too small and was frequently over crowded Staff slow in replenishing the food Awful coffee from nescafe machine did not think this was possible in Italy , Location was good 
404944,Glam Milano,No Negative, Perfect location just across the street of Milano Centrale the room was very comfortable the staff nice and helpfull I recomend this hotel is the best in the area also includes breakfast and buffet dinner 
404945,Glam Milano,No Negative, Excellent breakfast and good variety in buffet dinner The size of the room small but ok A 30 minutes walking far from the center of Mil n but with the metro in front literrally from the hotel is easy to move for all the city 
404946,Glam Milano, Staff need to be trained how to be professional and friendly breakfast was poor Resturant was crowded Late checkout is not possible without paying extra , Location is central although noisy 
404947,Glam Milano, This hotel was oppressively warm with no opening windows and only 2 degrees tolerance on the aircon which left on all night gave you a very sore throat Claustrophobic small rooms dark walls poor lighting Oxygen may have made this very different , Location was chosen due to close proximity to Milano Centrale station 
404948,Glam Milano,No Negative, Lovely hotel 2 minutes from the station by subway from downtown on foot 20 30 min Very comfortable beds Every day cleaning and changing towels Perfect breakfast and a lovely Italian dinner very rich dishes meats salads desserts I dream about the delicious and rich dinners Wonderful chef I ll go to Milan in Glam hotel
404949,Glam Milano,No Negative, It was our first time in Milan but we have been earlier about eight times in all Italy but it was the best accomodation what ever had in this country Everything was really professional extraordinary and perfect The half board had a really good quality and service Definitely we ll come back to Milan and to this decision this hotel is one of the reason 
404950,Glam Milano, Location But then one would not get the great rates Maybe they could have a gym , The breakfast was decent busy The hotel is new modern close to the main subway has cafes on the same street a Carrefour express a few blocks down There is a deep dish pizza next door Must try 
404951,Glam Milano, The cleaniness in the bathroom I stayed in room 610 but compared to 712 that I stayed on the previous week that room and bath are not so clean It smells of urine in the bathroom and hairs on the walls But I didn t not file for a complaint though for it was only a short stay , It s the second time I stayed in Glam Excellent and very helpful front desk staff small guy who speaks Spanish 
404952,Glam Milano, Nothing to dislike , This is a fabulous hotel in every way location food stylish comfy loved our stay 3 11 16 to 6 11 16 food great good variety and always hot and varied So central for the train trams and metro fab place
404953,Glam Milano, The food was dreadful clearly leaning towards Asian clients the decoration and the design of the rooms was pooe, The location very near the central station nothing else
404954,Glam Milano, Restaurant space was sometimes a little tight , Great location near the main train station Comfortable modern room Good breakfast and surprisingly good dinner 
404955,Glam Milano, The only thing I can think of that I didn t like is the fact I had to keep logging into the wifi It seemed log itself out a few times and had to return to my room for the code , The staff were really friendly and helpful the hotel is warm and comfortable yet modern and stylish I got upgraded free of charge making my last night in Milan a special one The view from my room was amazing Will definaltely be making another visit to glam 
404956,Glam Milano,No Negative, The location of the hotel was perfect just across the street from the Milan central station and few steps from the Metro 30 minutes walk from the shopping areas and city center hotel is clean comfortable and the buffet breakfast and dinner were excellent with lot of choices and the speed in refilling the buffet was amazing We got a junior suite with a perfect view of the station and the street the staff were amazing helpful and smiling even though we got an electricity problem but the staff was so quick in responding and fixing it even at 3 in the morning i definetly recommend Glam Hotel
404957,Glam Milano, Breakfast area too narrow and crowded Difficult to get around the buffet The bathroom has an awfully dangerous access to the bath Whoever designed it wasn t thinking of using it but it could be very easy to have an accident getting in or out of the bath Also as it happens too often in hotels these days the bath screen doesn t cover completely and it s impossible not to make a mess and flood the bathroom while having a shower , Great location for a 3 day stay right next to underground tram buses or trains to go anywhere you need to visit Milano or go for a 1 day trip to lake Como Overall decoration of hotel very nice 
404958,Glam Milano, The hotel style is strange colors are dark coridors are in red and black the entrance in dark gray I didn t feel very well and comfortable I won t go again for sure , The location is grate The view on the central station building and the plato in front of it is very nice The noise protection is good 
404959,Glam Milano,No Negative, Great location just outside of the main station We also walked to the centre That took about half an hour at a leisurely pace enjoying the buildings and shops on the way Hotel itself was nice modern and rooms cleaned daily
404960,Glam Milano, The rooms were too dark at night to work very effectively The interior flooring and walls of the rooms need a refresh , It has an excellent location very near Milano Centrale train station The hotel staff was very nice The dinner buffet was very good 
404961,Glam Milano, Forced to buy water at included dinner Any meal should include water In Australia it is in NSW anyway illegal to charge for drinking water Refusal to supply town water attracts a hefty fine Do not claim town water is not drinkable Italy is not a 3rd world country , Interesting and enjoyable view over station seriously 
404962,Glam Milano, Not a thing, Everything Very easy access from the train station Two minutes walking distance All staff were helpful and fantastic Came from USA to find they upgraded us to a junior suite Made for a wonderful good nights sleep Room was fabulous with a wonderful bathroom with walkin shower The evening free meal was excellent and well done Breakfast very nice Will definitely return
404963,Glam Milano,No Negative, The breakfast was nice and had a decent selection to accommodate anyone Gluten free rolls were available if you ask server The area to get to the buffet is very congested and annoying Good location for access to Centrale station 200m but a bit far from most attractions Done up well average furnishings and finishes with each floor decorated in a different colour scheme Big bathroom and bathtub Staff was professional and polite And every staff member greeted us when we walked by There was a mix of guests Plenty of tourists and tourists with kids Did see quite a few gentlemen with their nieces which was unexpected We had booked online for 3 nights and asked to check out early after day 2 but were told that we would be charged for the 3rd night Thought that was a bit rough since we had already stayed and paid for 2 nights I would not choose this venue upon another visit to Milan as it does not suit us But I could recommend to friends 
404964,Glam Milano, The evening meal was very basic and some of the food was cold, Great room with a view modern functional very comfortable lovely bathroom shower Easy links to the rest of the city and airport 
404965,Glam Milano, Aircon a bit loud No real muesli for brekkers , Majestic location overlooking grand square at Central Station though the main action in Milan is at the city centre Excellent service and comfort Modern throughout 
404966,Glam Milano, Staff was not super friendly Food and breakfast area not very good , Location was perfect for reaching the train station and the airport Interiors were fine 
404967,Glam Milano, Only stayed 1 night wish it was longer , After staying in some very rustic places along our journey this hotel was a welcome sight Large rain shower modern room great views convenient location Across the street from the train station Caught the morning train that took us right to the Milan Malpensa airport No traffic issues Oh and excellent price Breakfast dinner included Wow 
404968,Glam Milano, In the night there are lots of homeless people around the Centrale train station and therefore also a bit around the hotel Hotel staff told me that there is no need to make a reservation for a certain restaurant although I asked for it and it would have been better , Nice and new hotel opened 2015 very close the Centrale train station therefore a very good location when arriving by train Metro entrance is just in front of the hotel entrance Corso Buenos Aires shopping and district Isola Porta Garibaldi Porta Nuova and Brera can be reached by foot 
404969,Glam Milano,No Negative, Close to the train station in the city centre serve dinner as part if their basic package new and clean rooms and facilities fashinably designed Friendly Mostly reccomended
404970,Glam Milano, it was super OK for me , For a first comer in Milan this hotel was very appropriate It is located very close to the central rail station it has an entrance for the metro just in front of it and it is only 4 stops away from the Duomo and all the commercial streets in the center Besides of its good location it is a new hotel very modern and comfortable It has coffee and tea facilities in the room Breakfast was quite good 
404971,Glam Milano, Nothing Everything was fine , Every thing was fine perfect location friendly staff hood customer service highly recommend it for everyone will come back and stay at the same hotel
404972,Glam Milano,No Negative, This hotel was perfect for a 1 night stay I was travelling to and from by train and the hotel is extremely convenient located just across the street from the main station The room was clean and basic and looked like it was recently remodelled The bed was fine A little bit of street noise nothing unexpected One particularly nice thing was the half board which means buffet dinner and breakfast included If on vacation I m sure many people would prefer to check out some of the local cuisine but for a quick stay or work trip this is very convenient There was a good selection with options for people who don t eat dairy or wheat It wasn t advertised as such but they were there I would stay again 
404973,Glam Milano, The charge for dinner if you left leftovers No ironing board or iron in room Reception didn t have a spare adaptor plug No English tv channels, Perfect location Being on top of centrale fs station meant it was a one minute walk to the M3 metro line which we needed to see all the sites Staff were really friendly and helpful Rooms were spacious and bathroom was nice
404974,Glam Milano, My only complaint is that the hallways are dimly lite and the lack of no patio chairs on the balcony Other then that it was a good hotel better then average and the staff was very polite and helpful The location is fantastic if you want to be in close proximity to the Central Milan train station it is directly across the street Although I must worn women traveling alone or with just girls to be extremely careful This particular area in the evening becomes sketchy and handfuls of homeless people huddle around every corner When I was walking from the McDonalds McCafe to the hotel directly across the street at around 9 00pm an extremely intoxicated homeless man became very belligerent when I told him I didn t have any money He stumbled behind me until I crossed the street Obviously it was an uneasy feeling being a female alone at night but nothing became of it thank goodness Another drawback for me was the cleanliness of the area For whatever reason this area has drawn many artist thugs however you choose to view it to spray paint graffiti on every building wall sidewalk etc Some consider it art but this particular area looks vandalized and local officials have lost the battle to stop it It s truly shameful to see gang graffiti on historical buildings In my personal opinion I view it as disrespectful and a criminal act Some locals told me they didn t mind the graffiti because it made their town feel lived in and not sterile like Cannes or Lugano Therefore to each it own Overall A well run hotel with a fantastic staff , The curtesy of the staff was wonderful It was an added perk that the majority of the staff are bilingual multilingual I noticed every language being spoke from German French Chinese to English There was no language barrier for the majority of hotel guests Kuddos to management for hiring such amazing diverse staff As a hotel owner myself in Charlotte North Carolina I m truly sad to say this is something we lack and should be addressed 
404975,Glam Milano, Having promised and confirmed that a baby cot will be at the room before arriving Milan and assuring at check in if its in the room already AND when we were at the room it wasn t there and couldn t get it that night which was a huge dissapoinent for me , Location is next to the main train station is an advantage Although the food wasn t high quality but having a half board was also an advantage It is clean and stuff were friendly and helpful Had a baby cot without any extra cost although my daughter was over 2 years 
404976,Glam Milano, They offer you a free dinner what looks like great but you have to pay the beverages and a basic water costs you 5 euros and the food is really really basic Does not make any sense is the worst food in Milan , The location is perfect if you arrive or leave by train 
404977,Glam Milano, The room near the street is noisy late at night and early in the morning , Modern decorated room and everything is plenty new Breakfast is great Location is perfect to catch up the train 
404978,Glam Milano,No Negative, This hotel was so close to central station you can see it when you come out of the station The bathroom was heavenly Location location location excellent 
404979,Glam Milano,No Negative, Beautiful design hotel in a great location Very friendly staff The hotel is very close to the central station but the neighbourhood is still quiet and nice I would definitely stay here again 
404980,Glam Milano, No mirror behind dressing table only Flat TV Only net curtains so street and car lights a distraction, Lovely modern comfortable room and spacious shower en suite Breakfast excellent and staff very professional and friendly METRO stop outside avoids the rain 
404981,Glam Milano,No Negative, I was upgraded to a wonderful room at the top with a balcony and view over the piazza The breakfast and dinner buffets included in the room rate were very good much better than I expected 
404982,Glam Milano, Water had to run for a very long time to get warm water to the penthouse for showering Wonderful once it arrived on the 10th floor , Great location with wonderful restaurants very close We were a late arrival and they upgraded us to a WONDERFUL room that was so unexpected Very nice touch Glam Milano I will be back and tell anyone I know to be sure to stay with you when they go to Milan Italy
404983,Glam Milano, Breakfast and dinner were limited and foods were cold , room was nice clean and comfortable Location was very nice and near all transport Internet was good 
404984,Glam Milano, I couldn t get onto the wifi though I didn t pursue it very hard , Great location and very comfortable Very helpful staff Upgarded us to a bigger room 
404985,Glam Milano,No Negative, Location was excellent if you want to be near the station Two metro lines were also right by the hotel so easy to get around to other parts of Milan The room was nice and modern good bathroom and I was impressed with how quiet the rooms were 
404986,Glam Milano, The half board rate includes a simple dinner buffet very handy for late arrivals or those in transit However all drinks including water tea coffee are extra and the cost is somewhat inflated , The location opposite Milano Centrale is perfect for short stays or for travellers passing through Milan 
404987,Glam Milano, Some hot items on breakfast buffet were not kept warm However dinner items were much better , King size bed and a large 40 inch flat screen tv Bathroom is large and modern with awesome shower and a full size bathtub 
404988,Glam Milano, Room was small for standard triple room also inability to open window was something that we did not like then when we upgraded to superior room the shower is covered with a glass wall that is not suitable to use if you have older daughter or Son so it lacks privacy but for couple only it is nice , first of all I want to thank all persons working at the reception specially Tiziano he was very nice and cooperative which is very important after long flights to meet nice people like him at Glam Hotel you will find all people working at the reception smiling most of the time and happy to help in any thing and I think this was the best thing at Glam hotel beside the location is excellent also half board with dinner is an excellent add on because it really save much money in milan with many expensive restaurants although varieties are not much but still good quality food with Italian dishes and fish every night was very very good for people who wants to avoid meat and chicken 
404989,Glam Milano, not a lot, nice rooms with a good view the guy in the bar was helpfull with nothing being too much trouble the bar snacks were nice too We enjoyed the two meals we ate there and would stay again if visiting Milano 
404990,Glam Milano, I reported a theft of 4000 Euro from our room U did nothing I talked to my embassy in Rome They told me that the hotel administration should call the police to file a report and start invistigation U did nothing We lost our money in our 25th anivirsary of our marriage I must till the whole world about that ,No Positive
404991,Glam Milano, The room s bathroom was terrible When you shower the water splashes all over Getting into the tub to shower was like trying to climb the Spanish steps in Rome , The hotel location which was near to the Main Central station The rooms were nice but not spacious The triple room for my children has two bathrooms The staff at the Restaurant was really friendly and accomodating as well as the Reception The Buffet breakfast and dinner was excellent 
404992,Glam Milano, general size and quality of apartment definitely 3 Bed too short Sofa uncomfy TV not good Cutlery croc not well maintained, View was beautiful Nice welcome pack great pub next door 
404993,Glam Milano, It would be helpful to have the hotel name logo a little more prominent so that you can see it when you get out of the train station , Location was excellent just across from train station and Metro was just outside Room was spacious clean and comfortable Couldn t ask for more
404994,Glam Milano,No Negative, The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful The location was ideal with respect to the central station of Milan The room was clean quiet and attractive The buffet dinner included in the rate was a pleasant surprise for a weary traveler I am very glad that I stayed here 
404995,Glam Milano, The restaurant is way too small for the size of the hotel Prepare for chaos at breakfast and especially the dinner buffet , The location was wonderful with easy access to the train station
404996,Glam Milano,No Negative, Modern unstuffy clean and fresh Excellent location opposite train station and next to metro Very friendly and helpful staff Small well equipped room with great power shower Good breakfast with lots of choice 
404997,Glam Milano,No Negative, Staff Gianluca Alberto Diego and the female staff at front desk along with all the restaurant bar staff were superb Polite well spoken always available Could not ask for more I only intended in staying one day because I enjoyed it so much I booked another day 
404998,Glam Milano, The room was modern but small dominated by a kingsize bed which is not neccessary really No lights for the writing table Bathroom too exposed to the bedroom with no privacy door Also bright lights from the basin mirror made it difficult for one partner to sleep while the other uses the bathroom No rails or hooks for the towels there were located in the toilet instead It will be nice if the basics are attended to first before the glam that this hotel claims , Excellent location a 5 min walk to the Milan Central Train station Excellent breakfast and dinner 
404999,Glam Milano, 1 It took me 4 hours and multiple calls to the staff to get me what i needed after checking in first night 2 Housekeeping clean the room very late One day they didn t even clean 3 The bathtub side was leaking water every time i shower filling the bath floor and out to the room Staff were informed but did nothing about it 4 No slippers paper notes pens in the room Those essentials needed a call to be brought up to me 5 They made me sign a paper that i have to return back the room access card First time ever for me 6 Few staff were friendly and helpful but the majority were not, 1 Great Location 2 Proper size room nice looking furniture 3 Good variety buffet for the breakfast and the dinner 
405000,Glam Milano, We stayed too short to enjoy the chic bar in the ground floor We will keep it for next time , Amazing new hotel at best possible location Stylish trendy comfortable and very cozy Even though windows overlook Central Station square the room is very quiet and you can fully relax and enjoy the designed bathroom and pleasant interior of the room The breakfast had a variety of choices and was very tasty Italian ham cheese but also standard but quality continental choice We definitely enjoyed the stay and would recommend it to anyone visiting Milan as one of the best values for money you can get 
405001,Glam Milano, No ventilation while the window is locked , Location is few steps from the central station of Milan Nice view from the room Hotel staff are friendly Breakfast and dinner are varied and delicate 
405002,Glam Milano, The dining area is a bit confined with tables close together and not especially comfortable but not too bad on the whole , View of the station from the room was lovely And the room was very comfortable 
405003,Glam Milano,No Negative, Everything was amazing I changed from another property to this hotel just a few days before arriving I had a feeling this one would be better and so glad I did The nicest hotel we ve stayed in in Europe and we ve stayed in many

405005,Glam Milano, Nothing really , The location is ottimo Buffet dinner included was good value Staff speaks good English and always smiley Would definitely stay again next time when I transit in Milano 
405006,Glam Milano, AC be aware of pocket pickers around the central station keep your eyes on your stuff , location staff breakfast fast wifi clean room and nice bathroom 
405007,Glam Milano, Did not get refund for the last night which we had to leave since our kid got sick Decoration is depressing Breakfast room is very small You have to enter wifi password everytime you connect Wifi not fast enough , Free dinner and breakfast is ok but may be better Rooms are wide enough Location is good right accross the main station 
405008,Glam Milano, The standard double room is much smaller in fact than it looks online the declared 23 sq m are actually the room with bathroom rather spacious and entrance hall which leaves not more than 12 sq meters to the bedroom itself The restaurant is really small for the hotel like this and not comfortable so sometimes you might not even be lucky enough to find a table dinner beverages are not free of charge and are quite costy and the dinner selection needs to be better the robe and slippers are to be asked for those are not waiting for you in the room some windows at least those in rooms numbered from 04 to 10 have look right at the office building across the road not all of the standard rooms have bathtubs but those that have a shower are a bit bigger in its bedroom part all TV channels are in Italian the AC system is settled at 19 C and the only way you can actually fix it is to ask reception to reboot your room you can manually raise it but as soon as you leave the room the temperature drops back to 19 , Helpful staff I came after midnight and was checked in into a room with a poor view requested for another one and was moved into the room with a great one all of requests were met and satisfied almost immediately I requested a breakfast box and it was waiting for me at the reception and many other things Proper cleaning and neat environment over all Big beds really comfortable though and very nice bedding Very good breakfast fast service and welcoming staff You can get a good coffee all kind of eggs by order but no extra charges fresh pastry salads etc you name it Location is really good it s not really close to the center and it takes about 40 min to get to Duomo but the subway station is literally 10 steps away from the entrance door WiFi is good and fast and you can join up to 5 devices though you ll have to log in a bit too often Rooms are soundproof and no noises bother you neither from your neighbors nor from the street On line check in is a good idea
405009,Glam Milano,No Negative, The location was excellent with transport to the Metro right on the doorstep The breakfasts were delicious and the evening meals were good The beds were very comfortable and the staff were very friendly 
405010,Glam Milano, The shower head over the bath was difficult to use and not easy to maintain as water goes everywhere , This hotel was even better than it s website images Food buffet for dinner and breakfast was superior The half board was an excellent idea in a very pleasant setting 
405011,Glam Milano,No Negative, We had a pleasant stay The breakfast was very good The location was great near to the railway station My openion is it was the best hotel in Milano We would love to come back again 
405012,Glam Milano,No Negative, Right next to the central station and its easy nice walk from there hotel to the center of Milan where the attractions are there is a metro line right outside the hotel the hotel and the room had a nice modern look so comfortable 
405013,Glam Milano,No Negative, it was very modern and clean The staff were lovely at check in and as we had arrived early they were happy to hold our bags for us until our room was ready We hadn t realised we had half board with our booking so that was a lovely extra bonus and the food was very nice The location was a plus for us in getting to the airport and around the city in such a short time frame 
405014,Glam Milano,No Negative, The location was exceptional Directly across from central station The inclusion of dinner was super convenient Midday checkout is very unusual and appreciated Nice modern simple and clean it was a winner for me 
405015,Glam Milano, Larger sign with the name of the hotel on the exterior would have made it easier to find , Excellent location across the road from Milan Station Metro at the door meant 4 stops to Duomo and all the sights of Milan We had a very spacious comfortable clean room on the 8th floor with amazing views over the station and the forecourt The dinner and breakfast buffets were excellent with lots of fresh tasty choices Staff very friendly and helpful Great value and would definitely stay there again 
405016,Glam Milano, Wifi was ok but would have been nice to be a bit faster , Very convenient location to the main railway station You can see the hotel from the exit and it is a simple 5 minute walk Modern room with well thought out layout Fantastic staff service Very comfortable stay 
405017,Glam Milano, Hope To have slippers , Excellent location Could find it at once even though it was 9at night Clean Good breakfast Nice staff Definitely visit it again 
405018,Glam Milano, Room could be cleaner Very good location if you don t have a car main train station and also metro are basically in front of the hotel door , I had a free upgrade to suite so I can t complain Stuff was amazing Very friendly and cooperative and fast Wonderful view from suite balcony 
405019,Glam Milano, Room was very small not possible to open the windows only air condition the shower did not work properly the light in the room is very dark and the pillows very poor , Stuff was nice breakfest and dinner also ok 
405020,Glam Milano, Breakfast buffet was limited There should be an option to NOT select the dinner half board We didn t eat for six of the eight days we were there , Staff were efficient during check in and check out Excellent view of Centrale area from our window Location was convenient since train station was 5 min away but Duomo was 35 min away
405021,Glam Milano, Not being able to stay longer , Awesome food great staff comfortable room Even though we arrived later than planned the lovely receptionist upgraded us which absolutely made our day Thank you so much loved our stay Wish it were longer 
405022,Glam Milano, Greater attention to the quality of the meals and ensuring that hot food was warmer rather than passable Ditch the scrambled egg it looks positively radio active These matters are not unique to this hotel in fairness , Location excellent for station metro and trams The value it offered and comfort of the room was most welcome If you have a room overlooking Central Station it is fascinating Do try the trams they are much better than the metro 
405023,Glam Milano,No Negative, I think the criticisms of the hotel are ridiculous It s great value excellent service and unbeatable convenience The half board option is included in the room rate The breakfast is above par The dinner is ok but what would the miserable complainers be paying outside A minimum of 18 euros for wine and a primi Sample your amazing Italian food for lunch But really this hotel offers excellent value Those who say otherwise are inexperienced travelers 
405024,Glam Milano,No Negative, The hotel is situated near the Central station a great location to explore lakes the region near Milan even Switzerland It is about an hour to go to Lugano by train The room was spacious clean and comfortable The staff was very friendly and helpful There is a metro station nearby the hotel an easy way to explore the city 
405025,Glam Milano, Don t bother with the buffet dinner Dining room feels a little more like a corridor than a comfortable place to eat , Great location and a surprise upgrade Very helpful friendly staff
405026,Glam Milano, The dinner options could be better we had to reserve a table for dinner but there was so much chaos when we got to the restaurant We dint get a table for over 5 mins then when we got back to our table after picking up food from the buffet someone else had occupied it It was quite badly managed at the restaurant few staff could be more helpful , We stayed here for 2 nights Excellently located from the train station ultra chic modern look very friendly staff at the reception large comfy beds great bathroom facilities good breakfast selection Spacious storage in the room Definitely recommend for a short stay 
405027,Glam Milano,No Negative, Loved the room Very well thought out Worth the little extra to get onto the top floor Great breakfast We only took advantage of the dinner once as there were other restaurants to sample during our stay Everything was very clean Location next to the Central Station was perfect for us Would definitely stay again 
405028,Glam Milano, Would have liked the incredibly good news at how close it is located to the Milano Central station and how it is literally across the piazza to reach it A three minute walk , Perfect location great staff courteous service delicious food choices comfortable room good AC price is right for all it includes 
405029,Glam Milano, The variety of the dinner is greatly decent but the dishes should be labeled or at least mention the ones that contain pork meat , Location is very appealing only few steps to milano centrale station The hotel is new only one year old the rooms are clean and spacious The hotel is providing reservation on half board scheme few hotel in Milan provides this service it s imp to have decent dinner after long journeys to Venice Como etc You will definitely love it 
405030,Glam Milano,No Negative, Amazing location opposite the train station and a few metres from buses and local train Half board option great value with plenty of variety for breakfast and dinner Friendly staff what more could you ask 
405031,Glam Milano, Nothing , Clean and modern room Nice restroom Breakfast is good and there are an assortment of food for the dinner which is really nice Very near to the central station Everything is so good 
405032,Glam Milano, The only complaint I have is that there could be more English language channels on the tv for when if you are relaxing in the evenings and if that counts as my only complaint that sums up the near faultless standard of the hotel , The hotel was absolutely stunning and the staff were extremely accomodating and very friendly Staying here made the trip that little bit more special and gave it that elegant edge that you expect in Milano I will definitely return to Milan and the future and I wouldn t consider staying anywhere other than Glam Hotel 
405033,Glam Milano, Nothing , Buffet supper was an awesome spread many healthier options and tasty options Very happy with the food and the efficiency of the staff in dining area Reception staff were extremely helpful and the hotel is located right across from train station Room was large and clean We requested early check in and the hotel accommodated us made the stay extra special 
405034,Glam Milano, I think at least water could be included with dinner and other drinks maybe paid, Location staff food anything you want just name it A perfect hotel with excellent service 
405035,Glam Milano, The cleaning services were not great even bathrooms have smell and stains on the floor although the hotel is relatively new I don t know about other rooms I parked my car next to hotel in public parking and the glass was broken and they stole our laggauges I didn t receive any warning from the staff about the location , Good location nice air conditioned rooms 
405036,Glam Milano, I had asked for a quiet room but you could hear all corridor conversations and the neighbours kept waking me up and didn t go to sleep until 04 45 but that probably wasn t the hotels fault, The staff were great and the location amazing
405037,Glam Milano, Food is not fresh and you have to pay for the drinks , Location of the property is great almost near to all attractions with convenient transportation to and from the airport by bus 
405038,Glam Milano, Free buffet was very rushy atmosphere not very personal cleaning staff forgot to refill one glass for two persons etc Broken lampbulb which looked and smelled dangerously , Room was very quiet
405039,Glam Milano, AC was broken and we couldn t shut it down we spent a very cold night in August in Milan, Very close to train station and metro No decent restaurant or cafes nearby
405040,Glam Milano, Our bed was covered with someone s else s hair the toilet seat had urine on it and no handles or locks to Windows which had been left open When reported the bell boy asked what would we like to do Well that s a first when you find that your bed has someone else s hair in it He finally changed the bedding and no apology offered Stayed at Lagare Milano and this would not have happened there Not really bothered about sorting out issues or making sure that issues have been resolved Over priced drinks offered during buffet dinner , Location 
405041,Glam Milano, air conditioner was working on 19 degrees when we were out of the room and there was no way to change it, Location breakfasts friendly and helful staff stylish and beautiful rooms
405042,Glam Milano, can t think of any , The location is perfect located just across the main train station Bus and metro stations are just a step away from the hotel entrance We appreciate it very much that we got upgraded to a junior suite that has an awesome view of the main road and the train station Our rooms had a floor to ceiling glass window which gave so much brightness to the room We loved it that the front desk staff are very helpful and accommodating also the waiters at the breakfast and dinner room We forgot to get the name of the very warm and friendly waiter who looks like Chris Evans Other than very good looking and well versed in english he is very hard working he never stopped moving Everyone seem to speak english well We loved the modern and cool design of this hotel too Our daily room rate includes half board meals breakfast and dinner buffet which we found very economical and convenient needless to say delicious too Will definitely consider this hotel next time we come back 
405043,Glam Milano, The lifts were a little slow but nothing else , We were travelling in and out of Milan by train and it was very convenient apart from being an excellennt hotel for the money 
405044,Glam Milano, Many parts of the room were dusty or not fully clean These included the upper bar of the closet extremely dusty and the countertop of the bathroom sink apparently there were some small pieces of paper on it Also I felt like the air from the air con fan was polluted Breakfast didn t include a real espresso or cappuccino made through a professional machine only through a self service one Finally the complimentary dinner which was included in the price of the room was no more than a self service gathering of uninspiring food In fact as soon as I walked in I decided to leave to a real restaurant outside the hotel , Position is very convenient just in front of Central Station I liked the view of the Piazza from my room 
405045,Glam Milano, The fact that we were put in a room for disabled persons with out been told ahead of time The problems were mainly in the bathroom Stool in an already small shower high toilet seat for a young child to sit on , Very quick service to fix a problem with the safe 
405046,Glam Milano, The dinner buffet started a bit later than we would have preferred at least we got the first slot and it worked well , The included buffets at both breakfast AND DINNER were great This has great value Just walking across the plaza outside the train station makes the location perfect when on the train We had a room with lounge that fitted two beds for the kids so they 2 got their own beds 
405047,Glam Milano, Earlier breakfast Dinner great that it was included in the rate but it was too busy with food running out, Location we need to get to the airport fairly early from Milan Central station which is opposite the hotel Helpful ness of staff Comfort room shower bed
405048,Glam Milano, The dinning room is very crowded and confusing even though the staff is excellent They are young and very helpful When you do the check in ask not to be given the rooms that have a tub The tub is absolutely very uncomfortable and dangerous The superior rooms have a very uncomfortable layout the shower is in front of the bed separated by a glass The normal rooms are much better We have been there several times and have been in all types of rooms , Breakfast is very good so is dinner which were included Good quality food The location is excellent Rooms are fine tipical European size quite small but fine The hotel is new so it is nice the reception sitting area is quiet and nice music It is in front of the train station so very convenient The hotel has a good security staff 
405049,Glam Milano, Location had its pros and cons It s conveniently located a minutes walk from the Milano Centrale and the metro entrance is right besides the hotel building The only downside seems to be that it s located near a rather shabby neighborhood I had two incidents two nights in a row one involving a confrontation with a drunk homeless guy trying to pick a fight while I was minding my own business taking photos and the second involved being approached by a man trying to offer female services again while I was minding my own business trying to enjoy a nice cup of cappuccino at the restaurant in front of the hotel Bar these incidents which the staff claimed were a rare occurrence the location and overall experience was great It isn t the hotel s fault that I experienced these issues which I kept trying to explain to the apologetic staff , Clean hotel helpful and friendly staff Most amenities are available The half board was very convenient and the variety of the food was great 
405050,Glam Milano,No Negative, It was a great stay for a short visit We booked a triple room with breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by complimentary Dinner also being offered when we checked in The food was surprisingly nice for a complimentary buffet dinner The breakfast was nice too Lots of selection All staff members we met front desk restaurant were amazing super friendly and helpful Location was great for us because it was just a short stay before our next train ie just across the street from Milano Central but is not a walking distance to the major attraction However it was easily accessible by metro which is just outside the hotel Definitely will stay again on our next visit Great value for money no doubt 
405051,Glam Milano, Small and Dull rooms Poor breakfast and dinner They made me pay 30 euros per night for my 3 year old, Location next to the train station Comfortable beds 
405052,Glam Milano,No Negative, The location is excellent Right next to the Milan central station Staff are friendly especially the young girl named Stella in the breakfast room She tried her every best to serve the guests and always wears a big smile on her face The dinner included is nice 
405053,Glam Milano, We had a half board booked with Breakfast and Dinner We ate dinner once and were absolutely disgusted Not clean at all We went to go get dessert and left our coke drink on the table came back and found that the table was cleaned and our drink was taken When we asked where is we were not done the reply was very rude and no apology just a sit sit gesture Also we asked to get our drink he brought it back half empty with two used glasses We asked him if this was ours he was like i dont know This really got me angry cause for all we know we could be drinking a coke that another table left over and random glasses picked up from the to be washed sink He then gave us another drink but accused us that we had already finised our drink Extremely rude and not polite Also the lady in charge of the resturant was picking up fries that were tossed aside on the buffet table with her bare hands and putting it back part of the buffet which i found extremely non hygienic Overall disgusting and do not recommend taking the any meals in Glam Milano, Room was comfortable and did the job Receptionist was great and friendly as well as supportive 
405054,Glam Milano,No Negative, The location is very nice Although the position around main train and bus stations are not usually the best locations to be around this one is excellent 
405055,Glam Milano, Very small restaurant It is more like a hallway with very small tables Dinner should have more choices for the main course Very limited dessert buffet , Bed was very comfortable Staff is great Very delicious breakfast Perfect location 
405056,Glam Milano,No Negative, It is in a GREAT location In front of the train station The beds are amazing and the bathroom spacious The staff super polite and they even spoke spanish for my daughter and me 
405057,Glam Milano, Can t think of anything , An extraordinary value Excellent location very nice rooms with comfortable beds The staff was excellent and helpful Room rate includes breakfast and supper Beautiful view from the room Outstaning 
405058,Glam Milano, No complimentary water, Clean and crisp modern hotel Excellent breakfast and evening Buffett Staff helpful and could not do enough to make you comfortable Would be nice to have an outside relaxation area Would stay again
405059,Glam Milano, There is not parking and swimming pool , Breakfast and dinner buffet was great The staff were really friendly The hotel is very near by metro and railway station The cleanliness is very high There is a good signal of wi fi internet 
405060,Glam Milano, NOTHING Just perfect , EVERYTHING I booked a triple but there was something wrong with the room so the hotel upgraded me to a junior suite which has a perfect view of the Milano centrale station The half board surprised me and saved me some money too The staff is so nice 
405061,Glam Milano, View as at back of hotel view of another tall building and building works so not much natural light , Great selection of food at breakfast Half board option provided a buffet evening meal of very nice quality Large room good look and fantastic shower wet space All staff were very polite and helpful Very clean and location is superb for trains airport transfer buses and right outside Metro station to get quickly to tourist sights Only a couple of stops to Duomo Trams also pass in front of hotel 
405062,Glam Milano, Said breakfast box was a bit of a sorry affair But hey lovely gesture , GREAT view from my window although it can t be opened over to Stazione Centrale Nice that the hotel staff organised a breakfast box since I was leaving before the buffet opened 
405063,Glam Milano, Nothing to mention , The location is great if you plan on moving around by public transportation like metro or train The breakfast offers an ample variety of items for all tastes Dinner is also good My advice would be to avoid peak times because people tend to annoy and to behave like the hotel will run out of food or something similar Having either breakfast or dinner at later hours would save you from feeling in a the walking dead scene since people tend to fight either for tables closer to the buffet area or for food The service at the bar was outstanding The man was so polite and served us the best coffee we had in milan 
405064,Glam Milano, Awful glass of wine at the bar and the barman disappeared Average breakfast no real coffee , Clean simple comfortable room close to the station Excellent value for money 
405065,Glam Milano, Nothing, The location staff and cleaness Alice and Guise in the reception were great also Juri Cassini and Maher in the restaurant were very helpful They let me enjoy my stay in Glamis Milano I will definitely book here in my next visit to Milano 
405066,Glam Milano, Nothing, The staff was very friendly and helpful For example they knew the closest Vodaphone vendor and their hours as I was looking for sim chip for my phone Location is very convenient to Milano Centrale If you are flying into Milan and taking train out it doesn t get any easier than this Dinner was included in our stay and was fairly priced for a buffet for a jet lagged couple this was appreciated Beds were comfortable and we lucked out and got a great view of the train station 
405067,Glam Milano, Restaurant looked like school canteen paid for halfboard but wouldn t give this 4 star rating Expected more , It was clean spotless and comfortable but very basic nonetheless
405068,Glam Milano, They need to put up a more visible signage, 1 Just across the street from Milano Centrale 2 Helpful front desk officers smooth check in out 3 Decent breakfast dinner buffet for a family of 3 the half board option was a good value for money
405069,Glam Milano, 1 Staff blamed customer on the problem of the hotel itself 2 Poor management on emergent case 3 They made us feel like we are not paying guests but prisoners that they could provide whatever service they want I m talking about the supply of electricity in 21th century I tried to think of something nice to say but I was furious during my stay All the sockets in my checked room had no power when we were back at round 10pm Three staff came up and no one could fixed it We waited for more than an hour and requested to change a room but were told they were fully booked We tried to explain the importance of electricity can t believe this needs to be explained and they finally reluctantly brought us to a new room I was not mad before when the sockets found out to be nonfunctional but it was at that time I realized they had an attitude problem when they kept complaining that they didn t have an electrician to fix this at late hours so they don t want to solve this problem I felt like I have to push hard to ask them to provide a regular room The reason why they didn t do it in the first place was that the new room was an family suite one queen bed in a separate room and two single beds stuffed in the small entrance After 20 mins in the new room there happened a black out in our room We called to ask someone to check the room the receptionist said that he couldn t listen well and request us to go downstairs When I told him there were no electricity at all in my room he even blamed this problem to my laptop and my cell phone SERIOUSLY Considering his attitude I understand I can t rely on him to solve the issue so I requested a new room card to try again The next day I found out that it was because of the electricity card slot was installed the way that the card has to be inserted horizontally therefore the card will slip out if you didn t push it too hard into the wall due to gravity , Location is good if there was no bomb threat incident in Milano Centrale that caused the suspension on subway lines passed through it 
405070,Glam Milano, I arrived and the place is chaos Tons of families people running everywhere and 2 slow elevators that took FOR EVER Then Key card didn t work to get in room twice The hotel had some electrical or computer problem and none of the new rooms were working Took over 30 minutes to get in my room and I had no idea when I would while I was waiting I demanded my money back but because I paid on booking they said it was impossible Facilities are far from glam Basically furnished with cheap Ikea like furniture One power outlet in the room Breakfast was very mediocre Business travelers should stay next door at Best Western Atlantic Not glam but easy and comfortable enough , Location
405071,Glam Milano, Nothing, Excellent location hotel is new and value for money especially free buffet dinner every night The recept allowed us to check in even though it s only 11am 
405072,Glam Milano, My key card stopped working and I was locked out of my room twice It was all resolved within 15 minutes each time but it was annoying especially on the second occasion when I was due to leave within a short space of time Also there was big problem with the water when I was there On the first night I couldn t have a shower at all when I rang reception I was told that an engineer was going to sort it but the problem was still there all of the next day with a lot of rattling in the pipes I understand that this happens but the communication of the problem and when it might be fixed could have been communicated better even with a note underneath the door to guests , Nice breakfast and a handy location for the conference I was attending The room was nice and the staff very friendly 
405073,Glam Milano, The staff weren t proactive we asked for an early breakfast but it was not served when we told another employee he was not concerned at all, The cleanliness and food
405074,Glam Milano, Everything, We booked this last minute because of the Trenitalia train strike and its location near the main station We were not disappointed Staff so friendly even though our backpacks did not go with the look of the hotel We were advised on check in that we had been upgraded to a suite wow that made us happy as we had to forfeit a night at Monterosso The room was to die for and for 107EUR a night with dinner and breakfast included best money we had spent Selection of food great and metro right outside the door and directly across from the Milano Centrale
405075,Glam Milano, I feel cheated by the Gram Milano I made a wrong date reservation on July 17th at 23 27 for the same day at first the system shouldn t accept to make a reservation 33 minutes before the end of the same day I became aware of the mistake one minute after and I cancelled the reservation at 23 28 and made a new one for July 18th They charged me the full day because of the policy I made a claim and the answer was no My first review was even worse I ve been obliged by Booking to moderate it in order to publish it , Not too much when you feel like this 
405076,Glam Milano,No Negative, Central Location Modern beautiful view clean AND we were upgraded up a bigger room which was a bonus So convenient after getting off the train Breakfast excellent 
405077,Glam Milano, I was stuck with an extra small room on the corner of the floor which I couldn t change despite all efforts And for some reason there was a water shortage for two days ,No Positive
405078,Glam Milano, The air conditioner was hard to tune either too clod 19 C or no ventilation at all , Half board was included The food is quite delicious The bed is soft The location is just great 
405079,Glam Milano, I had a room that included dinner and the food was quite good but 4 per person for water Come on don t nickel and dime me on this kind of thing , The location is great You can t get closer to the train station and the walk to major sites is doable Very quiet and comfortable room too 
405080,Glam Milano, Cleanliness room size lighting food cleanliness of restaurant , Nothing What a dreadful hotel Do not stay here The room was so small with no room for suitcases What do people do with suitcases when travelling I ask Leave them at the train station The bathroom was disgusting It was a big dark black cavern with appalling lighting and not clean Please book somewhere else to avoid disappointment 
405081,Glam Milano, Nothing, The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was good The employees were very nice Very close to the train station and the Metro Very easy to get tot he Duomo and shopping area 
405082,Glam Milano, There was no water for two nights for the upper floor not even for washing your hands and brushing your teeth We have to go down on first floor if we want to take shower or going to toilet The room is a bit hot and very small We booked a superior room but they gave us standard room then we have to keep on asking them to change our room to the one we paid Very bad service what a shame its a new hotel They even want to charge us for late check out after all the hassle we have Same breakfast everyday Its a ripped off not worth it , New hotel and its location The assistant was nice he would open the door for us everytime we pass 
405083,Glam Milano, nothing, Location so close to the central station and metro particulary for us staying overnight before flying out in the morning Easy to get into Duomo area The hotel included half board and the buffet dinner provided was of high quality 
405084,Glam Milano,No Negative, We stayed here for the last night of our trip to Italy for easy access to Milano Centrale Train Station Room was very clean bed was comfy and the breakfast buffet included many delicious choices 
405085,Glam Milano, far away from the center which we did not mind because we like to walk it seemed crowded during the breakfast and dinner time , we had a half board during our stay clean and nice hotel 
405086,Glam Milano, Bar closed early no evening drink , Perfect location for train travelers Our view was beautiful Breakfast was very good And all service staff were professional Very nice boutique hotel 
405087,Glam Milano, Staff at reception was rude non polite and with poor communication skills Room booked was superior triple room but was very small and can t be ranked as superior room Dinner was included in our booking and timing was till 10 30 pm at 10 00 pm serving staff refused to refill the items finished like main course fruits desserts Serving staff were very rude and unprofessional Don t have even sense how to talk to the guests To our surprise there was NO WATER in the toilet Once complained we were informed that technician is working will be fixed in 15 minutes Water was restored at midnight Kids went to bed without even brushing teeth Once awake in morning same issue no water in toilet After heated argument with the reception they provided key for room in lower level so that we use toilet and get ready to catch the flight Asked about the manager but in vain Neither met him nor they provided his mobile no Si I could speak to him Simple answer from reception Manager is not available Very bad experience last night of our vacation was ruined by glam This hotel cannot be ranked even 2 star , Location if one is interested to stay close to station 
405088,Glam Milano,No Negative, Beautiful I stayed at the Glam for one night for a concert The hotel was amazing great central location to central train station and also metro station The staff was very friendly the hotel was beautiful and the food was great I will use this hotel again
405089,Glam Milano, Every time you need to enter the wifi password, All the facilities are superb easy access to all the location Just in heart of the city Wonderful view from the hotel windows
405090,Glam Milano, the room was a bit small but was okay Didnt really need the dinner to be included to the price but had no choice nor option, near the station reasonable price clean breakfast was good
405091,Glam Milano, There is no provision for soap and gels in the bathroom Room abit small Felt the TV was too close for comfort and we hardly viewed it , Extremely friendly and helpful staff Comfortable beds Clean and playful decor 
405092,Glam Milano, We had dinner and breakfast included in our room rate both were OK but no better than that At dinner no member of staff offered us a drink and there wasn t even any water included A soft drink was 5 While the suite we had was lovely some things were a little impractical like no shelf in the bathroom to put your toiletries Minor but annoying There isn t much going on in the local area , We got upgraded to a suite which was amazing Bigger than our flat at home with access to a roof terrace overlooking the station which was lovely The location is very convenient if you re arriving into Milan central station Hotel looks very new and modern Check out time was fairly late and the hotel stored our luggage for us 
405093,Glam Milano,No Negative, Very nice staffs the room facilities are wonderful but the room is a little bit small Location is good just next to the Central Station Breakfast is very good with many choices of vegetables 
405094,Glam Milano, Nothing everything was great, The location of the hotel is the best I ve come across in my travels The view from the room was perfect as you could see the Milan central station as well as many people everyday passing by below The rooms were perfectly sound proof The breakfast and dinner were perfect and had good selection The room facilities were ideal for a business traveller with enough power points as well as good wifi network Staff were very friendly and helpful Definitely a place to stay again 
405095,Glam Milano, Didn t like decor but that s just personal taste too much colour going on Staff efficient but not great for non Italian speakers morning staff better than evening staff Bit hard to find straight from station as not well labelled, Location was excellent It was clean with good amenities Comfortable bed good shower and bathroom Breakfast was good but busy
405096,Glam Milano, the hotel room was really cold and the hot water took forever to come especially at night , the open buffet for breakfast and dinner was really nice open buffet dinners are really rarely served in european hotels Different meals chicken fish meat pasta fruit and sweets were served every evening 
405097,Glam Milano,No Negative, I loved everything about this place it s right opposite to the train station it is new and has a cool vibe to the ambience and room decor the staff were great I dropped off some bags at the concierge and they offered to leave it in my room things like that decent dinner and breakfast although I only had breakfast which wasn t a big spread but good enough I didn t stay there long and I wished I did I will definitely stay there when I go to Milan again 
405098,Glam Milano, Please take care of the hot water problem instantly Water from the tap comes warm and not hot This is below the standard , Everything except the hot water problem
405099,Glam Milano, nothing to complaint will be there again , the toilet inside the room is super big and nicely arranged location is perfect close to train station and metro yet quite love the breakfast too 
405100,Glam Milano,No Negative, very close to Milano Centrale Station modern hotel quiet room even on first floor overlooking road early check in was possible wi fi worked fine Attentive staff 
405101,Glam Milano,No Negative, I loved the half board option at this hotel I am a coeliac and I find it difficult to find the right food for me in Milan This hotel made it so easy I ll be back 
405102,Glam Milano,No Negative, I was 100 happy All clicks here style location bed linens towels toiletries showers slippers and robe and the choices at breakfast Best are the staff at the front desk and the doormen who always remembered to greet me 
405103,Glam Milano, As we travel with my 7 years boy and 7 months baby the baby must counted as 1 person I must take a room for 4 people but they not provide us a cribs instead give us a single bed Staf is very stiff to their rule, New Hotel
405104,Glam Milano, The breakfast food could have had more variety, The rooms on the 9 flour were lovely and had lovely view ALESSIA at the desk friendly and an asset at the Glam Hotel
405105,Glam Milano, Rooms were a little on the small size but comparatively similar to other European hotels , Wifi was good breakfast was good dinner was included and was a nice alternative to going out to a restuarant after a day of traveling Bathroom and showers were spacious Staff was very helpful and courteous Location to train station great 
405106,Glam Milano, rooms are pretty small for that price I requested room for one person and I got a room with two narrow twin beds instead of one queen bed Breakfast not very good dry cold scrambled eggs soaked mushrooms poor selection terrible coffee Also the restaurant where the breakfast was served was very small and crowded some of the tables located in the passage between the rooms and near to the elevator it wasn t cozy at all Lack of iron and ironing board , very nice staff hotel is in a great location very close to the central station 20 30 min walking from the Duomo despite the fact that my room faced the central station and the street room was pretty quiet Rooms were very clean with nice design Air condition working well 
405107,Glam Milano, Booked Double room but Twins room was provided actually not a big deal however I was not informed during check in As a 4 star hotel NO post service That means they won t help you to post a postcard without stamp even I willing to pay for the postage and handling fee I just wonder many other hotels perhaps not in Italy p would do such little favour for guests P S I had tried to buy a stamp at Post Office before asking for this at the hotel but was unable to wait for 30min or more for just only a stamp and must heading to the airport express , Dinner was included in the room rate and there were many choices Breakfast was good and I was full enough Room is cozy and modern decorated The view from the glass wall is amazing can look over the Central station and have people watching Location is perfect the tunnel to both metro central station is just next to the hotel front door 
405108,Glam Milano, The ambiance of the area around the train station is not very nice at night but the hotel is still great as gateway if you travel by train also 2 metro lines give easy access to duomo castello navigli etc , New clean beautiful design great staff good breakfast buffet
405109,Glam Milano, Wifi issues lack of bathrobes power outlets seemed damaged , Very well placed right across the square from the central railway station Stylish design 
405110,Glam Milano, Every thing is excellent, In the time of leaving the hotel I have already told to hotel s staff we are really satisfied from the behaviour of hotel s staff from quality of breakfast and dinner and location of Glam hotel I do suggest Glam hotel to my friends when ever we come to Milan no doubt we shall come to Glam Hotel 
405111,Glam Milano, Unfriendly staff Terrible dinner and limited options for breakfast The hotel is overpriced and the beds will KILL your back We had to carry our own luggage upstairs even though there seemed to be plenty of staff in the foyer We even asked for directions to the city and were sent to ask the metro staff NEVER going there again , Great Location directly opposite central station
405112,Glam Milano,No Negative, I was surprised by the dinner buffet and breakfast Very good salads and pasta There is really nothing to complain about It is ideal if you arrive by train since the glam is right across centrale 
405113,Glam Milano, The food wasn t great as it was never warm I did tell reception after the first meal but it never improved It s because the air conditioning was on really cold and some of the food didn t have heaters underneath ,No Positive
405114,Glam Milano, The staffs looked very busy and in a hurry although still servicing with smile they were barely helpful if we ask for information , Location is across the Milan Central Station Metro subway is in front of the Hotel Walking distance to many restaurants and shopping Room is comfortable and modern with minimalist style good value for money 
405115,Glam Milano, more food choice for dinner , location is pretty good just face to the central station square room is clean and nice breakfast is good but dinner is less choice But the price is worth so will choose again if next time go Milan 
405116,Glam Milano, At check in one of the reception staff was very rude and has a surly face which gave a bad impression on the hotel , I recommend this hotel It has a great location and close to the central station 
405117,Glam Milano, Junior suites were dingy staff very rude food was included but cold absolutely horrible and to make matters worse they claim to charge FINE you if you leave your food uneaten Well we couldn t eat garbage and challenged them to fine us It was just myself and wife and paid for a junior suite but were forced to pay extra 100 euros for our 6 year old daughter We had clearly indicated during reservation that we were a family of 2 adults and one child and PREPAID OUR BOOKING AS BILLED We paid because we arrived late and had no where else to go THIS is in my opinion the worst hotel in Europe and most certainly our worst hotel experience , ABSOLUTELY Nothing except the location This hotel was our worst experience in 30 years I will not recommend this place for my dog to stay 
405118,Glam Milano, Absolutely nothing , The location service room comfort and lovely fresh meals included made our stay in this modern hotel a very enjoyable experience Thoroughly deserve a good star rating 
405119,Glam Milano, Should provide an extra blanket for cool AC temps Looking forward to some better signage outside the hotel to help find it coming from train station Desk clerks had conflicting info about airport shuttles to Linate which added to stress of my very early morning flight , The view from my room of the train station was fab Loved the discounted rate for my late booking Playful decor is fun and quite refreshing 
405120,Glam Milano, The room we were given didn t over look the square but a side street we were disappointed with that The bar area could have been staffed better On our departing morning we arrived at breakfast at the opening time We had little time for breakfast and had to go without due to nothing being ready and having a train to catch , The room was a good size The hotel is really close to the central railway station its easy to get to the tourist attractions the hop on tourist bus has a stop just outside the hotel The buffet dinner was a surprise the selection of food was good and it was fresh and hot We did get in early and I could perhaps see things running out towards the end of service 
405121,Glam Milano, Although new the premises were already damaged toilet did not stop flushing properly shower tap switch was detached from the wall a chair was broken Breakfast selection was wide but quality of products served wasn t good Imagine melon tasting of onions Dinner was okayish but having it once was more than enough The personnel did not seem to want much contact with customers ,No Positive
405122,Glam Milano,No Negative, The location in excellent the metro station is just in front of the hotel 4 stations to the Dome Breakfast and dinner were great good variety of food especially at dinner 
405123,Glam Milano, We purchased accomodation with half board don t think I will do that again I have no complaint about the menu the food was good but perhaps the menu was a little narrow in variety , Position was excellent directly across from the railway station 
405124,Glam Milano, Nothing in particular, We got an upgrade in our bedroom and we stayed in a junior suite Everything was excellent and clean Good buffet dinner and breakfast 
405125,Glam Milano,No Negative, If you are looking for a modern and spacious room next to the train station this is the place Just steps to the station and the staff is very welcoming The half board is excellent with a bountiful banquet offered at both breakfast and dinner We were simply passing through Milan so are not able to comment on proximity to shopping and sightseeing but certainly if you are travelling as we were this was an excellent transit stop Highly recommended 
405126,Glam Milano,No Negative, Wow Amazing hotel You start feeling the refreshing ambiance as soon as you enter the property Perfect lobby with smiling and professional reception staff Swift check in and check out the best breakfast menu variety I ve ever seen seen quite a few Dinner was nice too Now if you are lucky enough to get a upper storey room facing Piazza Duca d Aosta and Milano Cntrale railway station you will get the most amazing views of the area I was seriously tired but just sat near the window for about two hours enjoying the view before going to sleep at night The pics are attached The room itself had all modern and fantastic furniture and fixtures Metro stops and tram stops are right next to the property You can t find a better location to stay especially if you train travelling
405127,Glam Milano, The bar and restaurant were a bit cold they looked cool and were nice but could do with a bit more atmos , Upgraded and has wonderful views Staff were knowledgeable and friendly Smart hotel and not overly priced Great location for catching our train to the airport in the morning 
405128,Glam Milano, The food Even though half board was being offered the food is not that nice The staff especially irresponsible kitchen staffs who threw my stuff lots of food from my country which we agreed beforehand to put in the kitchen fridge , The location 
405129,Glam Milano, none, The location is next to Milano Centrale Station The staffs were very helpful They served dinner for free of charge except beverage cost 5 per person Modern hotel with new building
405130,Glam Milano, The shower was great but the water leaked to the bathroom floor and there was no way to dry or clean it , The location is really great easy to get around the railway station was right across the street as well as the bus station The subway was right outside the hotel entrance The rooms are nice and clean Breakfast and dinner included various foods The staff is friendly Good value for the price 
405131,Glam Milano,No Negative, Perfect location just steps away from Central Station subway station for lines M2 and M3 in front of the hotel Very clean and comfortable room friendly staff I will stay with pleasure again in this hotel when coming to Milan 
405132,Glam Milano, There were only two things we didn t like the bathtub that was high and about 30 40cm thick so it was very hard to get in and out and I am afraid short and old people can t get in and out and it might be dangerous Having experiences in hotels in Europe I might say that sometimes there are beautifully designed bathtubs sinks faucets showers but when you use them you want to cry I wonder why designers and of course buyers don t try to use them first The other problem was light It is strong for eyes and make strange brightness so that I couldn t do make up in the bathroom but at the window Light around the mirror is strong but makes only shades on the face and make you half blind The first day we were more than satisfied with the breakfast so we were much more disappointed the second day When we arrived at 6 30 there were just some croissents filled with cream and jam and some cheese and ham We couldn t eat croissents filled with jam with ham Some people who might have been in a hurry had only coffee and left the hall The breakfast was ready at 7 00 when we had to leave Leaving the breakfast hall I asked the lady what time the breakfast started because we were thinking it might be a special national holiday She said 6 30 and when I said it was not ready at 6 30 she said Wasn t it That made me angry and I wanted to say more but I didn t want to spoil my day It was too bad that I didn t take a picture when we arrived to have a proof Just a simple excuse for being late would made us leave the hotel in better mood That staff should be fired if the hotel wants to keep old guests and get new , We came to Milano by train only for two nights so we decided to stay in a hotel near the central railway station There are many hotels so it was hard to decide We always stay only in 4 or 5 star hotels but we know 4 star isn t always 4 star I think we chose the best hotel among 4 star hotels in this area Hotel was built just one year ago what means it is very clean and in the best condition The ROOM was not so large but big enough to open big suitcases It s built in modern design with unusual but wonderful colour combination BEDS were firm and very comfortable There s a kettle in the room with complimentary coffee and tea and air conditioner was working well BATHROOM was large enough and there was bidet too Towels were big and of good quality There was a pair of slippers but we missed bathrobes The Etro bathroom amenities were very good The best things of the hotel are location kind staff and complimentary light dinner STAFF at the reception were very kind what make your day when you check in At dinner we liked GIOVANNI who was very kind and helpful with a smile on his face and a housekeeper was very kind and helpful and did all what we asked her for The LOCATION of the hotel is really the best The entrance of the very convinient subway is just at the entrance of the hotel and the railway station is just across the street You need less than 10 minutes to the center or popular Via Montenapoleone and the subway is very easy to use We just came from New York where we were shocked at very dark subway The subway in Milano is clean easy to understand and safe The BREAKFAST was good and the light DINNER that is included was much more than we had expected Really great dinner with many kind of dishes and a lot of vegetables meat seafood fruit cakes Really great If we visit Milano again we will stay here and I would recommend it to everybody I think we will visit Milano just to stay in Glam hotel 
405133,Glam Milano, Rooms are small compared to hotels of same category prices , Good breakfast Great WiFi connection Good and friendly staff Brand new hotel Close by the main train station 
405134,Glam Milano, WIFI is slow and limited number access We have the whole night can t log on to it There is no Business center, Convience to central station clean and it is half broad so nice to have late dinner 9pm after shopping
405135,Glam Milano, Water pressure and temperature in the shower could have been better , Great staff always super friendly Great food breakfast and dinner were really good great selection and very good value for the money Also very convenient to have a metro station and central station nearby Beds really comfy 
405136,Glam Milano,No Negative, The location opposite Milano Centrale train station was ideal it was great to check in within minutes of arriving at the train station and it was also really convenient for catching the airport shuttle bus from just outside the train station Staff were very helpful and found an available room when I arrived earlier than the usual 2pm check in The room was very clean the shower hot the bed comfortable and the wifi worked well I was also pleased to find a kettle in the room to make hot drinks Having dinner included in the deal was a nice extra The food wasn t particularly special but it was nice enough and there were plenty of options Likewise breakfast had lots of options although the quality was fairly standard All in all a great choice for a night or two in Milan 
405137,Glam Milano,No Negative, Superb location within 15 minute walking distance to everything and across the Milan centrale station so no trudging bags around long distances Largish rooms with designer cosmetics from Etro Bed was super duper comfortable Very stylish hotel without going overboard on design Would stay here again in my next trip Breakfast was excellent Dinner was fair considering it was included with room and with the rate paid if you find something interesting elsewhere you don t mind missing it 
405138,Glam Milano, The cleaning lady should check the balcony they forget to clean it There was not enough hot water all the time but I think it was temporary problem The prices are high despite everything , Excellent location excellent staff Next to the train station and the sightseeing bus stop 20 minutes most by walking to the Cathedral Professional and nice staff at the reception and in the restaurant always smiling ready to cooperate with a smile Great view from the 9th floor Comfortable rooms Food at the restaurant was good 
405139,Glam Milano, Stayed here for nearly a month This hotel offers half board but the food is not that good I end up having dinner outside everyday The housekeeping is not very satisfactory Room is not very clean even after housekeeping And I have to call every single morning to request for laundry bag and the form to fill in although they should put a new one everyday since I always send my clothes for laundry The WORST thing is the kitchen staff threw my things and frozen food which we have agreed to put in the kitchen freezer during my stay I even put my name and room number on the packaging and I brought all the frozen foods all the way from my country for the fasting month My family has prepared and gone through the hassle to pack all those things for my long term stay working in Milan Kitchen hotel staff can t just threw away guest stuffs as they wish This is very upsetting and unacceptable I check out the next 2 days and now am staying in a much better place for the next few months Now that I think about it I should have asked for compensation , Location 
405140,Glam Milano, too much expensive price for value poor area a lot of fear in the evening for the homeless who sleep outside hotel a lot of noise from room to tramruns out of the hotel so many drunks and people who make their needs under the hotel horrible experience seen live arcades in carpet stained rubber shower without slip is sangerous soap the room not in line with the amenties of ETRO there are no wash cloths and other amenties for hygiene There are no complimentary water bottles there is no gym there is no an iron for ironing very small closet and very dark Each floor has a different color the firs floor is red is like a nightclub very small room no possible for stay in two minibar noisy and almost empty there is food inside of other guest You can not open the window noise of the other rooms when they enter in Television very small Internet wifi very slow slow slow elevators no mirrors in the elevators scent in the lobby nausante restaurant as a soup kitchen hotel reception staff inexperienced too young without experience Staff of adult men not nice in restaurant 5 for a small bottle of water at the restaurant air conditioning turn on all night can not turn off because there are no windows that open and then only by area change system is air conditioned accessa all night the blackout curtains do not darken enough from outside the person fied see into the room if you are not careful to close the curtain no privacy there are no shared outdoor spaces from the outside it is a very unpleasant palace of a brown color without opening windows incredibly high price I ve ever stayed more,No Positive
405141,Glam Milano,No Negative, The dinner was included in our room rate and was surprisingly excellent The wine selection was very good and at a great price Staff was extremely helpful and friendly The Bartender in the evening was creative and also very interactive 
405142,Glam Milano, I check in for 4 nights from May 8th to May 12th room No 710 and 714 On May 10th when I returned room I found a bottle water putting on the table and I didn t know why they put the water I ask my colleague if he got a bottle water or not So I checked the refrigerator again and found that the bottle water inside is opened and drank a half It s weird if that s not I drank it then who will be So I tell the reception and they send someone to check and also they didn t know why Maybe next time when I check in for the first night I should double check the refrigerator and took a picture to make sure that I didn t drink or eat anything in the mini bar , Convenient location just go cross the road Milan Central Station is 3 mins walk 
405143,Glam Milano, all ok , Everything was fine lot of choice for breakfast no fish but everything else one could wish for even ginseng coffee customs orders possible from the kitchen very friendly restaurant staff as well coffee tea facilities in room nice design of rooms excellent shower etc Great 
405144,Glam Milano, Bedrooms were a strange layout and colours Single beds were small and I think for the price should have been wider Possible lack of staff in the restaurant They worked very hard, Quite central position near the station Staff very helpful Free evening buffet pay only for drinks very good for a business traveller Breakfast could have been better but clean cups and food constantly brought out Quiet at night 
405145,Glam Milano,No Negative, Location right next to the station We stayed here for 1 night only after being in Italy for 6 weeks some times in apartments other times in hotels This place ticked all the boxes for me Had Large bedroom with sitting room furnished with a divan sofa coffee table 2 comfortable chairs great bathroom Loved the vibrant decor Buffet breakfast was wonderful the included buffet dinner was excellent Could nt have asked for more Great value for your money Those people with negative comments should have maybe chosen a more expensive hotel There are plenty in Milano 
405146,Glam Milano, Staff were quite surly and rude not accommodating at all Everything was just to hard for them Argumentative on check in and no apologies given when they were proved to be incorrect ,No Positive
405147,Glam Milano,No Negative, They really made us feel welcome and made sure we were comfortable and well informed about the city during our stay The room was so lovely that we really wished we could stay longer and even tried to cancel our reservations in Como for the following day So will definitely come back Amazing value 
405148,Glam Milano, No thing, The location of the hotel is near to central station easy to travel buy train Clean and comfort rooms I had dinner and breakfast at the hotel i love the food and the lovely pretty waitress Front desk very professional 
405149,Glam Milano, We came back to our room late one day and found the door unlocked and visibly not properly closed This is the first time this has EVER happened to me in all my years of holidaying and business travel and is completely unacceptable On complaining to the reception who were apologetic we were offered a drink at the bar as by means of an apology which we were then charged for when we checked out Another annoyance was the amount of beggars outside the hotel who were annoying my partner outside for a smoke in full view of the hotel security staff they did nothing to intervene Very unhappy with our experience here , I ve been harsh on the scores for this hotel on purpose I would have given this hotel a more glowing review as everything else was more than satisfactory but the incident with the door and later being charged for an apology drink has massively soured my experience of this hotel 
405150,Glam Milano,No Negative, DBB was certainly a bonus Close to Station and Metro Beware we were pick pocketed in the Metro Leave your passports and most money in the safe Hotel really nice place to stay We took day excursions and this hotel is close to all transport 
405151,Glam Milano, They gave us a very bad room the first night which was unlivable Bedside light did not work as well as the safe The bathroom was terrible They changed the room to a better one the next day which was good as otherwise we would have left the hotel Still there is a major problem with the lights which are very poor throughout I had to use my iPhone flashlight to read in bed which was pretty ridiculous The prices of drinks at dinner are not included and are very high The charge 4 5 euros for a small bottle of water , Location was great The breakfast and dinner were very good Wifi worked very well
405152,Glam Milano, My only problem was that there was not a way to open any window as the windows were actually walls They gave a perfect view but I feel bad in a space without any possibility for fresh air Anyway the ventilation was perfect , Excellent location excellent view rich breakfast very kind stuff on the reception 
405153,Glam Milano, Nothing in particular that we did not dislike, We were given a room upgrade The location staff and the overall experience gave us a very pleasant stay 
405154,Glam Milano, Would benefit from signage visible from Milano Centrale exits, The reception staff were excellent The inclusive dinner was well above expectation After a long flight this was the perfect hotel in terms of location and experience
405155,Glam Milano, The whole property was too cold This meant the hot food on the buffet was only lukewarm to start with and cold on my plate within a minute My bedroom was cold I was there in April I did tell the head waiter and the reception desk ,No Positive
405156,Glam Milano,No Negative, The position near Milano Centrale is extremely convenient for short time stays before after flights to Malpensa and otherwise Very convenient connection to the centre The rooms are designed and furnished with style Excellent quality price ratio for central Milan I paid 125 euro for mezza pensione including stay buffet dinner and breakfast The drinks were extra though and not particularly cheap But that s OK since the buffet dinner itself was exquisite Prime selection of fine Italian food salads vegetables antipasti soup 2 first courses 2 main courses cheeses sweets fruit 
405157,Glam Milano, Drinks service at the buffet was a bit slow , This is the best location if arriving in Milan by train Just across from the Centrale station and above the underground and close to tram stops It is a modern efficient hotel The half board option is a good value evening buffet 
405158,Glam Milano, Water leaking to the room when taking shower The bathroom of standard double room black tile with bathtub was a nightmare First the bathtub is too high for petite people Then the wet and dry separation didn t worked at all The glass door seal of the tub is aging which would let water leak to the floor And there s no floor drain So the water kept leaking to our room and finally soaked the carpet We stayed for just two nights so we didn t ask for changing a room I just can t understand why does a great 4 star hotel make such a stupid design like this , Location is great Breakfast and dinner are quite good additional beverages are over priced Staffs are friendly And room is modern styled and clean Actually I m satisfied with everything except for the bathroom 
405159,Glam Milano, Room was small Temperature was too cold in room and hard to raise it comfortable degree Telephone in room did not work Drain in shower seemed clogged, Location Dinner and breakfast incl Modern clean Pretty soundproof thick windows 
405160,Glam Milano, no sign visible on outside to know whichis the Glam lighting shocking in room particularly resturant hung too low need to be up higher, loved the location meals lovely freshfood
405161,Glam Milano, If I should find something to improve I would advice to take care more about the bread in the breakfast buffet There is only the white bread no other choices As I don t eat wheat flour I had no choice for bread Please improve this point For the rest it was a perfect stay in the hotel , The hotel was a pleasant surprise to me It s positioned perfectly near to the central station to the underground metro and to all the public services Hotel room is comfortable and very clean internet is working well the personal is always very friendly and helpful The formula with buffet in the evening is real interesting The buffet is always rich and fresh Well done 
405162,Glam Milano,No Negative, Very friendly helpful staff They upgraded my room to a suite with a great view over the square and the railway station The location was exceptionally good for my purposes I came in on the train and then had to go to the airport the following day It s walking distance to the station and the buses to the airports depart from the station This avoids having to get an expensive taxi to and from other more traffic choked central parts of the city There was some confusion on my part with my bill and the hotel followed up very quickly by e mail to clarify The d cor in my suite was striking in a modern way Wi Fi was good and reliable Altogether a very good experience I would most certainly stay there again 
405163,Glam Milano, The restaurant was overcrowded both morning and evening and the hot food tended to be lukewarm , Staff were charming and helpful and the room was very quiet despite overlooking the busy station 
405164,Glam Milano, Brochure inside our room said that breakfast is supposed to start at 6 30am during weekdays One day we had an early morning train to catch so we came down to eat at 6 30am and the staff was still putting out the food We ended up leaving at 6 45am and half the food was still not out in the dining area Also the breakfast dinner area has these stylish red lights above the tables which are made out of metal and are so easy to hit with your head when you get up from the table seen it happen twice So maybe a suggestion would be to raise these lights up a bit so the people don t hit their heads , The entire hotel was built very recently so all the rooms feel fresh and clean Everything inside our room worked too Very comfortable bed Room has electric kettle minibar and safe Great view of the central station Good shower and plumbing Very fast and reliable WiFi The staff was very helpful and very friendly Food selection and quality during breakfasts and dinner was very good as well 
405165,Glam Milano, Absolutely nothing , Front desk personnel extremely helpful in helping us find our way around Milano Tiziano was especially courteous and patient Rooms were clean and very modern Luggage storage during the day was appreciated 
405166,Glam Milano, Because of location there can be some traffic noise but room windows are well soundproofed and we found noise insignificant, Ideal location directly in front of Milano Centrale Station with Metro line to Duomo 4 stops right outside Modern clean comfortable room Fast WiFi Excellent breakfast and surprisingly good free buffet dinner
405167,Glam Milano, booked a room with half board option frankly not worth it rather bland go for breakfast only as the difference in price will buy you much more memorable meal in milano , excellent modern hotel next to the main railway station 
405168,Glam Milano, Nil All are perfect , Nice buffet The room is decent and tidy Perfect location with just 5 mins walk from central station Service of staff is very good too 
405169,Glam Milano, The noise insulation is not the best specially bathroom to room Could hear my love taking shower wile waking up better then him Hotel parking would be amazing to have next door and not a convention parking like now , Clean kind and welcoming hotel staff great view floor to sealing windows I loved it 
405170,Glam Milano, First night AC did not work properly reception made sure the rest of the stay was nicely cooled tight dining area dinner is okay for salad recommend to eat outwards , Near centrale metro station new and clean rooms helpfull reception and housekeeping
405171,Glam Milano, For a four star hotel l would expect things such as the complimentary hot drinks in our room to be replenished daily Not the case Although our room was serviced daily not once did we receive replacement coffee tea We never received any milk to go with the single sachet of coffee we did use I would have to add that in such a highly rated hotel l was disappointed our food was not hot on any occasion Lukewarm would best describe the state of the food at each of our meals and on one occasion I returned a beef burger as it was not fully cooked Minced beef should be thoroughly cooked in order to kill off any nasties which could cause an upset or worse tummy The meal was replaced but no apology offered nor any sign of a concerned chef I reiterate food service standards in my experience of such highly rated hotels is a visible transparent process carried out by the establishment chef or their deputy not so here I am afraid Hence the reason I cannot give the Glam a five star rating Sorry , The hotel is in an excellent location for the holidaying visitor We have stayed in Milan several times and this has been by miles the most convenient location the holiday maker could require The hotel itself was very comfortable and the staff are warm friendly and accommodating Our room was well serviced and comfortable Despite the expected traffic noise etc our room seemed cocooned from this environmental noise Food was fresh plentiful and served in a pleasant dining area 
405172,Glam Milano, I am sorry I liked every thing AVERY pleasent, The staff is excellent Ready to help always The food was very good fresh and the idea of supper is also very good the hotel is very clean the rooms are big enough One get full value for money 
405173,Glam Milano, Far from domo cheaper if u do ur booking from booking site they did t give same prise , Good loction just 50m from train centraly 1500m from boinesireas st 3000m from domo
405174,Glam Milano, Black colour scheme in bathroom Difficulty in locating position of hotel in piazza on arrival because only signage hidden behind columns , The evening buffet included in half board was excellent as were the breakfasts
405175,Glam Milano, Although the food was quite nice the dining room was very small and it felt a bit like school dinners it even said you can eat as much as you like as it was a buffet but could be charged 10 euros if you left a piled up plate Fair enough for those that waste food I guess, Nice and clean and mpdern
405176,Glam Milano, the only thing missing is a large sign visible from the station, very good superior room 906 very good wifi amenities excellent breakfast proffetional staff
405177,Glam Milano, View from the room Works currently taking place outside however no work men during visit so didn t hear anything, Location was great Right beside the train station and hop on hop off bus stop 
405178,Glam Milano, The light both in the room and bathroom was very poor You could not read or make up, Big quiet room with comfortable bed and nice view For breakfast just few options but for dinner several choices
405179,Glam Milano, Poor food quality at dinner at least , stylish and good location Regardless the location they gave us a very quiet room and we could sleep very well 
405180,Glam Milano, cold shower room was cold no space for breakfast with only 30 40 seats for a 7 floor hotel Poor variety and run out really fast Waiters couldn t cope will all people coming to have breakfast and were panicking Overpriced for what it offers , location Facility
405181,Glam Milano, At times the restaurant could get a bit busy for diner but nonetheless the staff does an excellent job to try to accommodate everyone The overhead shower in the bathroom has a tendency to flood the room which can be a little messy and inconvenient The hotel does not have a fitness or real business centre , The reception staff bar staff and restaurant staff are excellent at the hotel The half board provides excellent value and for a hotel the food and the wine selection are good The hotel has excellent WIFI and the standard double room is clean and is large enough for two people to be comfortable The hotel s location next to the Central Station makes it very easy to get around all over Milan Furthermore there are grocery stores and many good restaurants that are within walking distance of the hotel There is also an excellent bar and waiting area that is great if you are in Milan for business as it allows for a great meeting place 
405182,Glam Milano, Booking said you don t need to pre pay anything okay I made the booking and 5 minutes later got a message saying that there was a problem with my bank card I then flled out ALL the bank card information on the webiste and the hotel took full payment immediately Also the restaurant staff are terrible don t care don t make eye contact for breakfast I never did get served coffee after being there for 15 minutes no one even spoke to me for dinner an old waiter sat me down opposite the elevator and next to a dirty table because it was closest to him , Location accessibility view breakfast and dinner were wonderful minus the servers 
405183,Glam Milano, I m not sure what issues the hotel has experienced to require guests to leave IDs at the front desk but this practice is from another time and should end , The hotel is very clean and well appointed

405222,Glam Milano, Internet wifi to room mainly slow in connecting , Location room layout and location free upgrade to corner junior suite with great view service hotel staff low noise half board on restaurant
405223,Glam Milano, Porbably the culture of Italy people are rough and non friendly as Asian The restaurant waiter was rather rude when we tried to take a bottle of mineral water for 7pax she grab my bottle away and said it very unfriendly that we should pour into a cop instead of taking the whole bottle , Location and cleanliness
405224,Glam Milano, Hote policies are stupid and inflexible The management is inflexible and they simply don t care about client s requests Most important their way of answering to requests is disrespectful , Good location bor both business and leisure The rooms are quiet and nice 
405225,Glam Milano, The staff were rude except one member of staff at reception who was friendly and helpful Restaurant staff was extremely rude , Location was Great rooms were clean and modern Bed was very comfortable Good variety of choice at breakfast and dinner

405227,Glam Milano, Being on the 9th floor i do not understand the logic in having double paio doors that open fully with only a small low railing protecting you from a fall A half window would have been fine , Room was very good size breakfast excellent dinner excellent I have stayed in many different hotels in the area over many years visiting milano this is by far the best hotel by far 
405228,Glam Milano, The fact that the taxi the hotel booked for me charged me 120 euros from the hotel to rho fiera, Cleanliness and the location of the hotel food was excellent Fantastic customer service from the staff 
405229,Glam Milano,No Negative, Nice position near train station The metro just near the hotel gate The position of the hotel is perfect Nice room nice food everything looks nice 
405230,Glam Milano, The safe was locked and could not be accessed , I thought that this hotel was a little out of the ordinary run of the mill large city hotels with some interesting stylish features It is very convenient for anyone travelling by train and arriving departing from the Central Station and the metro is just at the front of the hotel and only 4 stops to the Duomo The buffet breakfast provided a superb choice The front desk staff were all exceptionally helpful Noise was not a problem 
405231,Glam Milano, Everything was fine in fact , Location is perfect The hotel is new rooms are relatively spacious and very stylish Breakfast and dinner is included Check in and check out took me less than 2 minutes 
405232,Glam Milano, No dedicated exercise facility , Location Facility Nice staff Dinner buffet Nice bar Loads of room to study or read or look at the square Good food Good wine Nice selection of channels and information about the city 
405233,Glam Milano, Rooms are quite small for the price My room was facing the main street and the main railwaystation square and the noise was significant even in the night I could not manage a decent sleep for both nights Ask for a room on the rear side of the building Safe box was locked and could not be accessed During the dinner waiters were pushing the drinks paid additionally at a very high price quite aggressively, Excellent staff they are willing to go the extra mile Location is very convenient to go to the airport or to the city center metro stop just in front of hotel Decent breakfast Free dinner buffet included Fast free WiFi connection
405234,Glam Milano, The restaurant is convenient and value for money as it is included in the room rate However service is short staffed One waiter serving is insufficient considering the turn over of guests for quick meals Dishes from other guests left on tables for ages Incomplete table settings Slow service to request and receive drinks Otherwise fine , Location right opposite Milano station Demi pension breakfast and dinner service convenient with great variety of buffet foods which are relished continuously bottles of cold flat and sparkling water freshly squeezed orange juice in large tumblers view over Milan streets and train station decor Completely sound proof rooms comfortable beds and duvets amazing bathroom with great shower head Staff at Reception very helpful and courteous 
405235,Glam Milano, The half board option is theoretically a good idea in particular for business travellers but the quality of the food in the evening was very low Also the staff in the restaurant was unfriendly and cocky , The location with the Metro right in front of the hotel was convenient Like in many other cities central station is always a bit of a dodgy area 
405236,Glam Milano, 1 The breakfast is horrible The food is not good quality and it doesn t taste good The breakfast room is too small for the number of guests and we were there in low season Very bad managed the staff had no idea of what they were doing and not because they were bad it is because there are too many people in a tiny narrow room There s always something missing and they take a while to refill I was standing in a corner for a good 10mins waiting for someone to bring extra spoons and cheese The coffee is horrible and comes from a machine I flew with easyJet and trust me the coffee in easyJet is better than the one in this hotel The coffee cups are very small not regular size if you like to drink coffee you better be ready to get in the queue patiently 2 Don t pay for half board you re in Italy and this hotel location is great you can find so many different places to eat and with better food quality We only used our half board once because it was just horrible and it was the same disaster of the breakfast same room same problems And they overcharged in the prices of the drinks because they are not included This hotel is great if you just want to sleep in a clean tidy place and catch an early train to the airport Otherwise forget about the breakfast and half board included it is a con and go find somewhere else Plenty of options 3 They forgot it was my birthday They didn t put a cake and a bottle of wine in our room like they said they would Horrible service My wife tried to call twice the reception room nobody answers , Great location Right Bst places to be if you are using the trains from the airport and easy to go around the city Very clean and happy with my room upgrade 
405237,Glam Milano, Music in public areas was for a younger crowd I don t like that euro beat Breakfast room staff were young and seemed nervous and dropped cutlery and a whole tray of dishes which was quite loud on the stone floor , Bed was comfy Breakfast buffet was good Location was central and fairly convenient Reception staff were friendly and knowledgeable Loved the paint colour on the room walls 
405238,Glam Milano, The air conditional in room is bit warm Same type of food for breakfast everyday Dinner couldn t meet the expectation , Great Location comfort environment 
405239,Glam Milano,No Negative, Very good location just two minutes from Milano Centrale train station staff is very nice who proposed us a free upgrade to junior suite room Breakfast is also good and the breakfast room gives a nice view on the train station square 
405240,Glam Milano, The illumination of the room it was difficult to have enough light to read , All was correct staff room lunch and especially the ubicacion near the Central Station and next to the underground 
405241,Glam Milano, For a half borad stay there was room for improvement Due to limited seats in the dinning area we had to begin our dinner at 9pm even if we made reservation around 5 pm Also the table was on a aisle in front of the lift which made the dinner a bit uncomfortable , Excellent location modern and clean room Equipped with a electronic kettle to boil water 
405242,Glam Milano, very minor niggle staff over breakfast should have smiled a bit more, 2 mins from Central Station Buffet Breakfast quiet room despite being on 1st Floor new furnishings decor nice giant shower head
405243,Glam Milano, nothing, The nice hotel will definitely stay here next time I mostly liked the view to Milan Central Station from my room window and breakfast as well as dinner Thanks guys 
405244,Glam Milano, The dining area too busy and too few staffs I had to ask the staffs a couple of times and it took me about 20mins for just a glass of paid wine Staffs were nice but they were awfully busy , The design the reception staffs the half board package and of course the location 
405245,Glam Milano,No Negative, Free buffet dinner friendly and helpful staff they provide me gluten free bread and cookies for breakfast modern building and confortable room located near the central station
405246,Glam Milano, We had big problems with the food which was served for breakfast and dinner It was good and delicious but we don t eat pork and there was no ingredients declaration or even name on the buffet dishes Please make it better , The Hotel is next to the main railway station and near the metro It s a very good and modern hotel The staff is nice and everybody speaks English 
405247,Glam Milano, No ironing facilities in the room You have to use the laundry service This was quite inconvienient due to the timings and cost of this service Also the rooms tea and coffee kits were not replenished during my entire 3 night stay even though the room was cleaned everyday I had to ask for more on the final night which was brought up straightaway but I was only given two decaff coffee sachets I thought this was poor service The Restuaruant Even though there seemed to be two large dining rooms these weren t in use Instead a smaller room was used with a buffet at one end and limited seating then tables extended into the corridor right infront of the lifts that people use to enter the resturuant I thought that was quite bizzare really I get that maybe it is out of season so the rooms weren t used but sitting next to a lift door opening were confused dinners are getting out wondering were to go was quite off putting waiters should really be greeting guests and seating them instead it is very hard to know if you should find your own seat or wait to be seated This isn t really communicated , The staff were great Very friendly and welcoming The hotel is very modern and clean the room was very comfortable Location is great if you need regular access to the metro and central train station The dinner and breakfast was generally great too 
405248,Glam Milano,No Negative, Very clean and modern hotel The view from my room was spectacular Rooms are soundproof Great shower and excellent toiletries Breakfast was superb Walking distance to Central Station 
405249,Glam Milano, TV was a little temperamental Poor signal , Range of good food for breakfast and dinner both buffet style Cocktail bar Great view of the train station Free wifi Friendly helpful staff If travelling by train as we were perfect Metro right outside with 3 stops to Duomo Metro so easy to use 
405250,Glam Milano, There was false alarm happened in mid night of 1st night of my stay However the hotel did not have proper apologize regarding this issue , I like the breakfast very much wide selection and have freshly made omelette and juice 
405251,Glam Milano, The sophisticated electronics controlling many features are sometimes not properly working , Convenient even if not fashionable location Excellent breakfast and good complementary dinner 
405252,Glam Milano, To be really picky the hotel could be a bit more organised and careful I had to proove my booking was for 3 days as they thought my reservation was for 2 they slightly mixed up dinner reservations we got a wake up call we didnt ask for, Trully excellent location really handy for trains airport travel and subway Brilliant staff very kind helpful polite and always smiling Room was very clean and comfy and had a great view over the central train station 
405253,Glam Milano, Booking and cancellation rules and the way the staff handled issues totally not customer first And the food in the restaurant wasn t good , Location except it s right next to where a lot of homeless people are And there s no proper driveway 
405254,Glam Milano, no complaints at all , Perfect location right at the beautiful train station very modern interior rooms were spotless rooms came with half board which made the room price very reasonable place felt brand new
405255,Glam Milano, I can hear the street traffics dinner and breakfast are very poor my room was very cold during the night checking in was slow, they upgraded my room free of charge nice view room has a very nice view stuff are nice
405256,Glam Milano, The dinner buffet was very poor Salad pasta and not much more Not even desserts Lots of people and very little food It was not what you expect from a 4 hotel , We arrived very early at morning but they had a free room and we could check in to the room Reception staff was very kind and helpful 
405257,Glam Milano, The worst thing happened at 2 am the day we were supposed to leave Some Muslim was smoking in a room and it activated the alarm in whole hotel Everyone except him and his family run down to the reception some children were scared and crying He also stole a bottle of water during dinner So pathetic , We arrived to Central Station from Bergamo and the hotel is right next to it 2 minutes walking The staff was okay our room was clean and quite spacious for the standard size Breakfast was same every day but quite delicious Green Metro station in front of the hotel yellow line was about 2 minutes away so it took us max 10 minutes to get to beautiful amazing Duomo Cathedral 
405258,Glam Milano, No complaints not my favourite neighbourhood in Milan but convenient Maybe a gym would be nice or did I miss that , I ve been saying at this hotel 4 times now My main reason for choosing it is the convenient location and the clean comfortable rooms It s a new hotel and that makes a difference I recently discovered the half board offering and I am very pleased I read a few negative comments regarding the food which I don t understand maybe because I m Vegetarian There are plenty of choices of warm dishes salads and vegetables fruits and cheeses for the price of this hotel you would normally not get half board For a business traveler it is great for someone looking for a romantic dinner with table service don t expect that here but explore the cities options I also like the breakfast and the option of soy milk yogurt 
405259,Glam Milano, I didn t like dinner at all and restaurant there Dinner was included but food wasn t tasty and enough Sometimes the plates even were empty and you had to wait when at list anything will appear at Sweden table The staff at restaurant worked like you are not there or not important they spoke loud about their own interest and could tell you not to sit at some tables and wait when they will clean another , I liked the room and view Clean and nice At reception everyone was friendly helpful and polite Hotel is new and everything is in good condition 
405260,Glam Milano, We arrived and the floor in our hotel room wasn t cleaned properly Not a big deal as we notified the front desk and they took care of it immediately , Beds were comfortable view was nice and the location fantastic 
405261,Glam Milano,No Negative, Very good location Beautiful view from the window very friendly staff many thanks to the chief of their restaurant the meals were really tasty Definitely recommend this hotel 
405262,Glam Milano, the breakfast wasn t bad but they don t always put whats the meat they use pork or beef or other and as its hard to tell and i don t eat pork i had to skip meats and be vegetarian the dinner is for free but you have to pay for your drinks food in dinner wasn t good at all even though they give it for free , the hotel is beautiful the location is amazing metros and main station is 3 5 min by walk can easily go to any place by metro amazing view to the staziono centraly the main train station to travel to any city in italy is very easy the rooms are big clean and nice furniture in rooms the staff are very friendly and the ladies who work there are all beautiful 
405263,Glam Milano,No Negative, Stayed here with my Sister for my birthday celebration last weekend Everything was brilliant at the hotel from start to finish Federico recommended and reserved us a table at an excellent restaurant too Mamma Rosa When we got there we were treated like VIP s Will definitely stay here next time I come to Milan Grazie Mille 
405264,Glam Milano,No Negative, Specially bigger rooms are perfect services are good hotel location is very good too Metro is 10 steps far and also easy to reach to Malpesa by buses 8 from hotel to airport So everything is positive with hotel so far Try it 
405265,Glam Milano, Bit crowded during peak breakfast hours No English TV channels, Pefect location minutes walk to main train station Metro stop right by the hotel Modern rooms
405266,Glam Milano, I like the modern set up of the bathroom however the bathtub shower may be a little difficult to get into if you have some mobility issues as it would be helpful if there was a step Also the setup of the shower door does not work very well because if you take a shower and use the overhead showerhead the bathroom floor will likely be full of water Also the hotel is missing a business as well as a fitness centre however if you need documents printed the staff at the front desk is more than willing to accommodate your needs , The hotel is a relatively new and is conveniently located near the Milan central station I stayed in the Standard Double Room which overall I enjoyed The room is a good size and the setup is nice as the bed is comfortable and there are plenty of electric sockets and lighting throughout the room The room also has a flat screen TV which has CNN and some other English TV stations Other things that are important which I enjoyed about the room is that the heating and air conditioning worked well it has nice big windows the bathroom had heated towel racks and the bathroom products are of good quality I found all the staff to be excellent from the reception to the doorman to the people who work at the bar and restaurant more specifically I found the staff to be young energetic attentive and nice Another great thing is that the WIFI worked well throughout the hotel as it is fast and easy to log onto which is important especially if you are travelling for business The breakfast buffet has a good selection and is convenient because it runs until 11 30am furthermore if there is something that you want that is not part of the breakfast buffet the staff is there to provide you with what you want directly from the kitchen Overall the hotel offers great value is clean and has a modern look and feel I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again as I am a frequent traveller to Milan and have stayed in many hotels there 
405267,Glam Milano,No Negative, very nice hotel recently refurbished very close to central station and not far from city centre 20 mins walk or 5 mins by tube staff very friendly and professional very nice breakfast and the nice plus of a free dinner drinks excluded included not sure if it was a promotion or not but still a nice plus we however didn t take the benefit as we were arranged elsewhere already 
405268,Glam Milano, Noise in the bathroom heating system Very noisy room service we ordered chicken sandwiches and we got ham we told them about that mistake they told us they re out of chicken and decided to give us ham instead Then we ordered tuna toast but we got eggs and salad Anyway if you like to eat NEVER ask the room service Just go out somewhere , Location and breakfast
405269,Glam Milano,No Negative, They remembered me from coming once a few weeks earlier and upgraded us free Alessandro at breakfast was considerate and attentive as usual bringing my friend cake when there was none left at breakfast Really lovely hotel with a stunning suite with view on statione centrale Highly recommended 
405270,Glam Milano, Downstairs bar as per information found in the room closes at midnight but at 23 30 we couldn t get a drink as we were told the bar was already closed , Location is excellent and hotel is quite new
405271,Glam Milano, Nothing, Loved it The locations is really perfect just in front of metro and train station Perfect furniture and breakfast dinner included I advice all ppl to stay there
405272,Glam Milano, We were half board but we had to pay for drinks even just a bottle of water One glass of wine was 10 Euros Very expensive for the services offered in my opinion , Location was perfect Right across the train station We had a free upgrade so that s a plus 
405273,Glam Milano,No Negative, Location next to Milano Centrale station Few steps to the train station metro Milano Central Spacious room and comfortable bed We love the view from the room Staff were very courteous
405274,Glam Milano,No Negative, The location was great The entrance for the subway was right outside the front door and the Central Station was across the street The hotel is only 4 stops about 5 minutes from the Duomo 
405275,Glam Milano, stayed half board and the evening meal buffet was cold, Perfect location straight across from the Milan Central Train Station and right next to the metro stop which takes you to the Duomo in 10 mins 3 stops away 
405276,Glam Milano, Would be perfect with fresh orange juice for breakfast, Friendly and fast check in great room very fresh and clean The best value for money in Milano I have ever experienced Keep up the great level will stay again Special regards to the reception staff and consequent regards to the manager you have a great team 
405277,Glam Milano,No Negative, The receptionist is very patient when I asked many questions she let me forgot how hard to find the hotel as the first time there The room got nice view but it was embarrassed me that I shared the room with my couple friends when taking shower Breakfast was nice too 
405278,Glam Milano,No Negative, Very modern and cozy rooms We got the corner room on 9th floor with a huge balcony surrounding the entire room on two sides Breakfast staff were very attentive and the spread was great Just across the road from Milano Centrale train station We loved our stay and will definitely be back 
405279,Glam Milano, Nothing Everything was perfect , The staff and location were amazing When we mentioned that we were honeymooners they sent us a complimentary cake to congratulate us They also accommodated to all of our requests with pleasure The location is perfect Literally the first building you see when exiting the central metro station The view at night was also very pleasant 
405280,Glam Milano, The location is not good at all if you are looking for shopping it will take about 20 25 minutes to get to stores And also it is not great to live in the hotel near the railway station , The staff is great
405281,Glam Milano, Breakfast was a tad cold however we did get there a little bit later for breakfast so that may have been why , Location was excellent and great to get around the rest of the city Rooms were clean tidy and modern Wifi was also great 
405282,Glam Milano, It was pretty chilly in the room and AC seems to work with delay Smell in the room bathroom was strange and made me impression room was not properly cleaned I had bigger rooms at similar hotels price in European cities Rooms for breakfast are pretty small and it can get quite crowded if hotel is busy Leave me somehow the feeling of a transit hotel , The staff was very nice and trying to do the best given the circumstance It was pretty crowded at breakfast but they were trying to accommodate everyone Good location especially if you plan trips by train Breakfast pastries 
405283,Glam Milano, Nothing at all, Breakfast and location were definitely great We stayed in a standard room which was adequately big enough nice shower The personnel are all kind they try to help you with everything 
405284,Glam Milano, cups in the room was quite dusty so i think the cleanness should be taken more care of our door lock had some problem and was not closed properly if you do not pull it There were two days we found our door open after returning because the cleaning lady did not close it properly Although we did not lose anything but it felt unsecured , super convenient for taking public transportation Hotel is nicely decorated Breakfast was generous 
405285,Glam Milano, The italian shower was flooding the bathroom because of a used joint in the cabin I wrote them a note and call the reception and nothing was done about it Receptionist was rude And the room was a bit cold too before heat turns on Wish i had the view on the trainstation and not the homeless people out on the street Its the last time i book online because i feel like hotels hate you , The bed and clean
405286,Glam Milano, we were a couple 6 years child and we had booked a double room for 5 nights considering that beds are large and our child could sleep with us or in a separate bed which we could order at site upon checkin we were told that we have to upgrade for a triple room coz the child is 6years and hotel policy etc and we were glad with that and we paid the upgrade without any problem however the room wasn t really triple because the 3rd bed couldn t accommodate an adult or lets say the 3rd bed was ok for 2 to 3 stars hotel but to 4 stars and I don t know why the toilet had 3 shower towels and 3 small towels the 1st day we checked in but they removed the 3rd set of towels after the 2nd morning so the hotel charged us for 3 persons 2 adults 6 years child but didn t think it was important to put a 3rd set of towels for the 3rd person I also don t know why they didn t replace any of the toiletries during our entire stay shampoo conditioner shower gel soap and lotion there was 2 of each when we arrived and they used to clean the room when we re gone without replacing any of the above one other important issue is that it takes around 10 to 15minutes of leaving the water running to get hot water which was annoying Finally the breakfast room is too small to accommodate the hotel guests I mean I don t think the hotel was fully booked and yet it was pretty hard to find a table for breakfast without waiting Don t get me wrong the hotel is good and someone has done a good job in putting this package together but somehow they are missing out on few little things which would make big differences for the guests , The location is good being opposite Milano Centrale The breakfast team were great always smiling and caring and they deserve a big Thank you The Breakfast is rich and always being refilled the reception team were also caring and smiling at all times 
405287,Glam Milano, Actual area around the hotel train station isnt the nicest or there didn t seem much to do However a quick taxi or walk downtown sorted that out , Hotel is next to the central train station which is where the buses run to and from Bergamo Airport so very handy for short stays and or those travelling with Ryan Air to Milan as they fly into Bergamo about an hour and a half bus ride away 
405288,Glam Milano, The rooms are a little dark and could use some additional lighting , Beautiful hotel with very modern decor Super accommodating staff they were all very friendly and spoke English Nice little apertivo at the bar full breakfast Awesome showers in the rooms Two steps from the train station if you re traveling around Italy or to Malpensa Would stay again 
405289,Glam Milano, Cooked breakfast tepid but plenty of other options , Great view from bedroom over the Piazza and the imposing Centrale railway station As I was just passing through Milan an ideal location 
405290,Glam Milano, The room is unbelievably cramped It was such a disappointment The property from outside is all great But inside our room was a total disappointment Very badly lit hot water take ages , The Location of the Property Very close to the railway station 
405291,Glam Milano, It was really too laud almost like the windows don t exist I was at 5 floor my colleague in 9 floor but we kept awake at night because of cars and trams , Location is very good nice restaurant in front
405292,Glam Milano, We spent two nights in the hotel Although we were two persons in the room there was only one pair of sleepers There was never added an other one The same happened when we used the bathroom cosmetics never replaced the used items Breakfast not functional at all Too long distance between the buffet and the last tables should be two points Also because in the rush time there are so many people and so little space I can t say that we didn t enjoy our staying but definitely I can t tell that was extraordinary Pay more attention to details , brand new facilities excellent location exactly in front of the stazione centrale cosy room warm atmosphere and friendly staff 
405293,Glam Milano, The receptionists are very slow and not very helpful , The location it s handy right in front to the central station but at night time it s not nice and safe area The hotel is very new and has got a nice view Very silent with soundproof glasses The shower products are very very nice and the beds super confy 
405294,Glam Milano,No Negative, The location of the Hotel is excellent Just a 5 minute walk from the central station Metro entrances are also just outside the hotel from where one can travel on the green and yellow lines The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful which made a lot of difference as this was my first trip to Italy I was on the 7th floor and my room had an excellent view The room the bathroom bedsheets pillow covers and towels were very neat and clean and there was no smell The breakfast was also very nice My omelet was served with very nice and fresh green vegetables on the side every day My flight was at 9 20 in the night and upon my request the hotel allowed me a late checkout till 4 00 in the afternoon which allowed a little time to relax and shop for gifts for my family There were just 3 minor hiccups along the way like my laundry was delayed the first 2 days my room was a little warm and one morning there was some problem with the hot water but all these problems were fixed without much stress so all in all it was a very good experience 
405295,Glam Milano, The lights in the room are generally too dark the bathrooms are black and the light is too weak I like it for relaxing but not for you know makeup , The room with a great view on the station square and pirelli skyscraper Staff is very kind I had also dinner in the restaurant it was very good and not so expensive The staff Provided also gluten free bread and in the morning they remembered I am celiac and gave me gluten free breakfast 
405296,Glam Milano, We were put in an incorrect room even though we paid for a suite with a terrace They tried to persuade me to stay in a standard room and eventually agreed to move us to a suite They would not give us a room with a terrace which quite frankly is very poor as this is what I had paid for The member of staff was sarcastic throughout the whole exchange and therefore we won t be returning , The room was comfortable 
405297,Glam Milano, Nothing to mention, Execellent location Entry to Metro station is just in front of the hotel Easy connections to any location via Centrale LS station and Bust station Restaurants are plenty around hotel Clean good quality spacious rooms Good breakfast
405298,Glam Milano, No not at all , The Glam Hotel has just opened Great location for Milano Centrale and the buses to all three airports Very good Buffet breakfast to suit all tastes Reception staff very helpful and speak English 
405299,Glam Milano, Overpriced rooms badly designed bathrooms badly designed bad lightening design Bad staff services were unable to confirm theatre tickets bookings Unfriendly reception area Cold shower , Proximity to the station 
405300,Glam Milano, Check in was slow only two people at reception No water boiler or kettle in the room and none could be provided on request No tea or coffee making facilities in room No ear buds Expected just a bit more based on the price being charged, Good location close to Milan Central railway station Bright colours in the room
405301,Glam Milano,No Negative, Very clean and new hotel helpful stuff location is perfect and not so faraway from city sights and boutiques Price quality ratio is quite acceptable Gracie mille Piu vederti 
405302,Glam Milano, Slight problem with a payment deducted in Sterling instead of Euro as booked took a little time to resolve , Friendly staff at reception and restaurant Good breakfast great location 
405303,Glam Milano, Lack of mirrors Focused on design but not on practicality of the room of bathroom Not enough space in the room with no desk and too much space in the bathroom,No Positive
405304,Glam Milano, STRESS at Breakfast One woman ist checking all the time the room number this makes breakfast to a stressy situation Breakfastroom is strange divided i think in 3 rooms PLEASE FIRST let guests SIT DOWN and THEN ask for number AND PLEASE be quiet The staff is talking so loud During Day at Entrance there is a security guide i think He is always looking so bad and severe sometimes i felt i come home to a prison ROOMS are too expensive in other cities Prag Paris Vienna you will have better service and Spa and Fitness here is NOTHING , Close to Milano Centrale BUT typical Tourist Area TAKE CARE of Bars some Cappuccino are 4 Euro WOman at the entrance are very friendly
405305,Glam Milano, no kettle and drink in room at all very expensive room service for an americano coffee I ask for a bouquet of flower for my mum s birthday one day before and no one informed me if the flower is bought or not on that day and one day later When I went to ask receptionists they seemed unaware of my request at all failure of passing information between your colleagues , very nice breakfast very convenient location nice and modern interior clean room large balcony
405306,Glam Milano, Hotel s reception gave me a Standard Double Room instead of Junior Suite that I booked even I show them my reservation receipt from Booking When I figured out the deception I called the reception and they immediately upgraded my room to the Junior Suite that I have booked and they apologized but this was unacceptable for a 4 stars hotel The cue at the reception , Perfect location Nice view Nice breakfast Actually on the Metro station 
405307,Glam Milano, when I did the reservation was not show any selective category for how many person will stay in room which asked from hotel reception when we checked in As I know the offer was based room not persons also if the policy of glam hotel based person BOOKING should be note the clients please review the hotel profile due nothing of what we faced with them written there, Location
405308,Glam Milano, Found a big bug in the room I was so scared However I called the staff and they came up and helped me get rid of it , Room is fantastic Location is good Right close to the main station
405309,Glam Milano, Nothing, Superb location Next to main train station Nice breakfast We got upgraded to the room with balcony Thank you for the upgrade The bed is comfortable and facing the balcony overlooking the train station square The bathroom is very romantic but not suitable if there are children with you I would say it is suitable for couples only Hehe 
405310,Glam Milano, Hotel ran out of shower towels on the second night but did manage to find us some after a while it was impossible to take a shower without flooding the whole bathroom although the rain shower was nice since there was no curtain or other partition bathroom was fairly cold towel rack didn t heat up although I assume it was supposed to there were no hooks for towels or clothes or shelves in the bathroom for toiletries Mattresses a bit too firm but that s a matter of taste of course , Very friendly and helpful staff nice and new and very clean convenient location just opposite Milan s main railway station Excellent Wifi 
405311,Glam Milano, Zilch , Everything Even when I got jammed in the revolving door the staff were so polite trying hard not to laugh We usually do not go for the sterile 5 star hotels but this was so warm comfortable The bed was heaven on a stick along with an amazing breakfast Loved loved loved our one night stay 
405312,Glam Milano, Crowded breakfast you must to have a breakfast in early morning to avoid crowd But everythings is superb we will stay here for next time in Milano Chiaos , Location was great just a few steps down to Centrale Metro station A room was decorate in modern style and bigger than another hotel in this location as we ve stayed before 
405313,Glam Milano, Staff could have been more helpful in terms of getting around the city Also I would prefer to have a No not disturb sign but this was unavailable even after asking the front desk , The location was accessible to many trains and metros Breakfast was very complete and was available early 
405314,Glam Milano, If the prices were more affordable we would have stayed many nights , it is exactly in front of Milano Centrale Even the metro exit gets you to the Hotel it was hands down value for money Super new super clean super close to the train station and our favorite Briyani Restaurant in milan Kashmir Restaurant it is a halal cafe From now one we will save money and stay at Glam Milano whenever in we are back in Milan The hotel staff were all nice and the breakfast was good 
405315,Glam Milano, Dark decor made it hard to see anything in the room , Very enjoyable stay Great location right in front of Central station underground access to Metro station right in front of hotel friendly staff good breakfast comfortable room 
405316,Glam Milano, Wifi didnt stretch to the room although I think that was the exception most rooms have it , Desk staff were very helpful accomodating As with all places in Milan during Expo it seemed expensive
405317,Glam Milano, The time spent checking in and out was not ideal with only two counter staff for a very large hotel , The breakfast was superb location ideal and modern smart facilities
405318,Glam Milano, They could add more variety to breakfast it only had eggs bacon pancake basic cheese breakfast is nice nothing to brag about , Nice rooms lots of room the hotel looks great 
405319,Glam Milano, breakfast is abundant but for a 4 hotel I would expect something more sophisticated I would also like to note that there are 3 different breakfast rooms but only the principal one has a full buffet and a nice view ro the railway stationl the rooms could definitely be less pricey I guess they overdid it in view of the Expo 201 which a major tourist attraction , ideal location everything is brand new and clean really helpful and polite staff nice view
405320,Glam Milano, Not really my kind of breakfast Replacing the soap shampoo after using them only once isn t very eco friendly , Very good location and easy access to public transport 
405321,Glam Milano, Internet was poor The hotel had issues with Internet on our first day We couldn t connect to it at all The following days they rectified it However the signal strength wasn t good and it dropped out a quite a bit, Location was good for us as it is very close to the main train station the room was spacious and clean Breakfast was good and it was included in the cost for us 
405322,Glam Milano, The decor of the rooms and parts of the public area is a bit austere The rooms are comfortable especially the beds and just OK in terms of space but the colours of the bedroom makes them a bit dark at night although OK during the day due to full length windows , The staff were very welcoming polite and helpful Breakfast is copious with plenty of choice both hot and cold dishes The location is very convenient overlooking the Piazza Duca d Aosta and facing Milano Centrale station not noisy with underground walkways betweem the station and hotel Metro entrance is just 25 metres from the hotel and it s just a few stops to Duomo or Montenapoleone Restaurants nearby and in the hotel open until late 
405323,Glam Milano, all services was in adjustment at the moment of my stay even tv was not connected and someone had to come with screwdriver to connect tv WI FI was not working most of the time only in lobby was available, Modern looking structure still in period of adjustments best thing about the structure is its location
405324,Glam Milano, The light was extinguished during our stay So we could not take shower or did nothing until the light worked We gotta waited for more than an hour So sicked with that experience Electricity is the most necessary The flashlight shoule be sticked in every room just in case the emergency happened , Location is so good near transportation The room is clean Staff is helpful Breakfast is good 
405325,Glam Milano, Only problem Is the structure of the bath shower area It is very tall im 1 7 m and wide to get over to the bathtub for shower and when taking a fantastic rainshower the water seep through the splash glass panel into the dry area Have to lay a towel over the water puddle after use Hope the management will do some rectification to avoid possible slippage , Next to centrale station and direct link to Metro Very new clean and modern hotel Great breakfast buffet and excellent friendly staffs We booked a standard double room which was in good size quiet despite next to lifts strong water pressure very comfortable beddings great aircon and perfect housekeeping Exceptional value for money given the promo rates we booked in 
405326,Glam Milano, If you have a car this hotel doesnt give any free parking which i didnt like that much, Everything is great about this hotel you can reach every where with the train since its so close to the station
405327,Glam Milano, Poor room service either slow or non availability of many items, Reception staff are good location is just next to Centrale FS station and new rooms all clean
405328,Glam Milano, the room did not have any drawers to put your things in Also it was very disappointing that we went to shower and there was no water We had to phone so that they would connect the water and we could shower to go out Had to wait , the breakfast was great
405329,Glam Milano, Complimentary dinner was magnificent , Only issue we had was that the aircon didn t work in our first room After many attempts to fix it we were eventually moved to a junior suite 
405330,Glam Milano, The room was small and there is no water boiler nor complimentary in the room also they did not change the towels in daily base No iron in the room its good hotel but compared with the price not worth, We stay 5 days its great location with new room excellent breakfast and WIFI
405331,Glam Milano,No Negative, Brand new hotel extremely clean and well appointed rooms Really nice bathroom with a massive shower as well Literally a 2 minute walk from Milano Centrale train station so very convenient and makes for a lovely view as well if you re facing the station Included breakfast was one of the best in Italy as well 
405332,Glam Milano, This hotel would be perfect if it had a few more facilities such a kettle in a room bath robes and a tissue box , The staff was lovely and the rooms are nice and clean
405333,Glam Milano, Bed sheets and pillow cases are made of rough material which gives an almost sandy feel Toilet seat is very uncomfortable , Room is clean with sleek decor Very nice view of the Central train station and the surrounding area Floor to ceiling window makes the view evening more pleasing 
405334,Glam Milano, Shower leaked onto floor but the manager told me that they are going to fix this little problem It was very minor , The staff was really fantastic and get 110 from me Hotel is new and very nice I came on business and would bring my family if we were to stay to Milan I will stay here for sure on my next business trip next month It was much better than I expected Food service excellent Room extremely clean and quiet I travel a lot and this is a gem 
405335,Glam Milano, Very small room very small single bed left me wondering if the location was worth the cost of a single and very basic room, First of all warm welcome at check in and most important for me was location 
405336,Glam Milano,No Negative, It s a new hotel with new furniture and v close to train station which make v easy to travel around the surrounding cities Ms Giusy at the reception made our stay more enjoable
405337,Glam Milano, Wifi was bad however they know about this and it s a new hotel The bed linen wasn t very soft but overall nice, Close to the metro line and very nice amenities Lovely bath Good breakfast and helpful staff
405338,Glam Milano, So many dust in washing room on table a little expensive , It is not very good not cleaning there is dust in many place Not tidy Just good location and breakfirst 
405339,Glam Milano, despite the hotel is brand new and was opened 3 weeks ago hotel felt old in terms of furniture floors and even the color mix is ugly Moreover the reception area is tiny and there is no in room service menu , Location is great very close to the central station
405340,Glam Milano, There seemed to be some repair work going on and the corridor carpet was filthy Staff was generally cold unfriendly and unhelpful Very unprofessional in the customer reception talking loud between themselves about their life while checking clients in Made a mess with our luggage storage They refused to serve breakfast at 10 40 on a Saturday although the room card said it was open until 11 00 Finally they allowed us to have breakfast but everything was almost empty and they did not refill it And they always had an attitude about it , The hotel seems new and the decor is nice The room is not big but has a decent size It is well located just in front of the main train station with a metro station just 10 meters away 
405341,Glam Milano, One thing is bathroom when you are going in shower all bathroom floor becomes wet even pool There are a big gap between floor and doors WiFi sometimes doesn t work And some of staff should learn a lot , Location was good breakfast and dinner was excellent Everything is new but the same time there are a lot of small things to improve Beds are comfortable and really big Toiletries are excellent 
405342,Glam Milano,No Negative, The hotel was excellent from start to finish The staff were friendly and went out of their way to make my stay pleasant We had dinner in the restaurant which was lovely and breakfast the next morning was just as good The location of the hotel is perfect just across the road from the main Centrale train station Quiet rooms with everything you need really like the power showers the Wifi was also brilliant I will definitely be staying here during my next visit to Milan

405346,Glam Milano, First of all i contacted the hotel asked for car they replayed and didnt confirm and we had to take taxi The room was small in size , Hotel looks new and clean Near to the milano central metro Easy to find 
405347,Glam Milano, Not very fast check in at night There was baby cot in room but there was no linen for it It was only one set of towels for one person We need to ask for more There was no baby chair in restaurant , Clean comfortable space room with panoramic view of piazza and Milano centrale Everything is functional and convenient They confirmed and put baby cot in our room Hotel is situated absolutely near station but it s not well recognized Staff was understanding enough about 2 small children in standard room Breakfast is splendid large assortment of hot and cold meal and bakery 
405348,Glam Milano, Staff were slightly stand offish on check in but warmed up when we got chatting and were very helpful even letting me check in a half hour early , The hotel was extremely good value for money and I particularly loved the bathroom toiletries so lush 
405349,Glam Milano, Wifi system wasn t good It kept getting disconnected and all the time new password was generated so had to call reception to get new password, I liked the location design rooms bathrooms breakfast Almost everything was great
