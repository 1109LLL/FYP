40257,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The cold modern aesthetic of the hotel did not appeal to me in the slightest Our 500 a night room was situated across from the elevator and faced a dismal interior court yard The surrounding neighborhood is all high end shops not charming markets I would not bring children to this kind of hotel , Well located property
40258,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, There were many points that we didn t like as follows 1 The hotel has confirmed that they could arrange not a Duplex room to us prior to our arrival but unfortunately we got a duplex room 2 Regarding the duplex room there was no mirror and wardrobe on the upper floor whereas the shower was located on the upper deck i e after taking a shower we have to get change downstairs 3 There was no electric socket for the use of hairdryer in the shower room 4 The air conditioner vent was facing the pillows and we have to switch off the air conditioner when we went to bed 5 On our 2nd stay morning there was some muddy water flushing out from the shower head this was ridiculous and at the end we were late for our meeting 6 There was limited choice of the breakfast and the services was bad We ve ordered the salmon bagel and end up getting some bacon Besides my husband ordered a boiled egg for each of us and at the end 2 boiled eggs was served for each of us The scramble egg was dry and tasteless 7 My husband felt sick and we asked the reception to call for the SOS doctor and replied to us the expected arrival time of the doctor After 15 mins no reply and we have to call back the reception to follow up with them 8 After arriving I was unpacking and my husband was taking a shower on the upper deck of the room We heard someone came in and out of our room freely for a few times downstairs We were flustered locked the door and put the Do not disturb sign out immediately All in all I was very surprised that this was claimed to be a 5 stars hotel and extremely disappointed of this hotel There were a lot of rooms for improvement and this is so far the worse hotel that I had ever stayed ,No Positive
40259,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, I had read a review from another reviewer that said their shower was leaking and water would leak outside of the door This happened to us in our room as well No matter what I did the water from the shower spilled out into the toilet area and there was nothing I could do to prevent the water from going out of the shower I agree with the reviewers that state this hotel should not be considered 5 star I have stayed in MANY 5 star hotels and this is not 5 star level in my opinion , Great location near the Metro 
40260,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es,No Negative, A great hotel the location is perfect and all the stuff at the hotel are very interested in the comfort of the guest i will always stay in this hotel 
40261,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The elevator is small hardly fit 2 people but there s another luggage elevator to use , Staff cooperation from the moment I made my booking Clear and friendly communication all the time The Eiffel tower view was beautiful from the balcony 
40262,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es,No Negative, everything was really great in the hotel and would like to thank all the front desk staff for being so helpfull and supportive who made our trip enjoyable Thank you great ladies Marien and Ariane
40263,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, they don t have a gym they could probably combine the lobby and the bar to make it feel like there is more common areas to hang out in , Breakfast was great cooked and continental options and available til noon for room service Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful they were the best 
40264,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Everything else Air conditioning size of the room extremely slow elevator no view at all extremely expensive for what i thought i will get while booking on booking com , Generous mini bar 
40265,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Fire alarm going off at 2am for technical reasons and being offered no compensation Although the rooms were very well designed they were very small with minimal storage space Clearly central Paris is expensive but 2 000 for three nights bed and breakfast in two adjoining rooms still strikes me as dear , Location quietness The showers and baths were fantastic Having two adjoining rooms was very useful and hard to find these days The staff were pleasant and helpful 
40266,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, I thought the breakfast of 40 person per night American was a bit exaggerated for what you got For that price I would ve assumed it would be a bit more maybe some cheese vegetables for the bread and not only marmalade The fruit salad was very small as well It would ve been nice with some berries like strawberries raspberries We tried it once then we had breakfast elsewhere The only other thing that I didn t like was that I asked for a late checkout we had to leave the hotel around 3 30 4pm so I emailed the hotel and asked prior to our arrival They said it wasn t possible with a checkout later than 1pm and if we wanted to stay in our room we had to pay 490 for a whole night which is a significantly higher rate than we had on booking We did it because my mom wanted to stay comfortable in the same room and not leave the luggage in the hotel when we walked around until we had to leave for the airport But of course it feels a little weird paying 490 for basically 2 and a half hours more in the room even if it s a luxury hotel So I would advise anyone to look this up further if you want a late checkout if you don t want to pay this amount I understand that you have to pay for a late checkout anyways which is totally fine But I don t think it would ve cost 490 for 2 and a half hours in any hotel , The location is amazing and in the middle of everything yet it s a calm street so not much noise which is perfect Our room was wonderful Deluxe Eifel Tower View and we spent lots of time on the balcony enjoying the views because the weather was amazing when we stayed there The bathroom and shower is spacious I would absolutely stay here again in the same room 
40267,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es,No Negative, I stayed in Marignan for one week Staff was amazing Quick and professional services Very very friendly environment Not my first time in Marignan and for sure won t be the last And btw Location Location LOCATION 
40268,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The smaller room was a bit tight on space , We reserved 2 rooms one of them was slightly larger than the other and had an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower very close to Champs Elysees and a metro station Incredibly friendly and helpful front desk staff 
40269,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Unfortunately there wasn t a gym or spa , Great and accommodating staff Good sized rooms with fully equipped bathroom Our family of four enjoyed the private cinema great breakfast and proximity to all of the major sites restaurants and high end shops We would stay here every time we visit Paris 
40270,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, By far the worst experience I ever had in a hotel I booked this hotel convinced that it was a great deal for the location and the quantity of stars which most of the time equal comfort and relaxation Big mistake I was welcomed by an unfriendly and full of attitude staff I had to order three times in order to get a quick breakfast juice and a toast just because it was late 11am and they were getting ready the tables for lunch Together with my friend we arrived quite late in the room after a whole day of tourism The room was stuffy smelling of sweat small and with an insect on the bed We complained and they gave us another room bigger but with no heat because they said the AC was broken The linen was rough and unaired and the room seemed like a 3 hotel room than a 5 We were really cold over the night and I personally had the worst sleep in a long time In the morning we tried to ask for some towels and water but we were attended by a staff that were hanging up the phone before even us finishing the sentence Over all I would definitely not recommend this hotel , The location of the hotel 
40271,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Got the Eiffel Tower room with a balcony Wasn t what I was expecting You just get the tip of the Eiffel tower and a balcony without the a table Really expensive for that , Lovely place great location Lovely staff Great location Lovely restaurant down the road 
40272,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Almost nothing but the quad room fitted us enough 2 adults 2 kids for only 2 nights not suitable at all for 4 adults which we paid for or for more nights , Breakfast in room no extra charge location of course and the attitude of the stuff I really loved staying there and would come again for sure Totally 5 stars 
40273,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The breakfast was sooo limited no selection of food for example there were only one type of cheese , All the staff were very friendly and kind The hotel is very clean The location is perfect I would suggest the hotel to my friends 
40274,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Nothing , Staff were great they were a real asset to this property extremely friendly helpful and always cheerful Room was nicely laid out great amenities 
40275,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, the rooms without view located in the middle of the building and no kind of view at all No ventilation so you better book a room with view the elevator is so small and only single elevator i cant understand why they claaified it as five star hotel with this very limited facilities , very clean excellant location
40276,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, There was a mistake on our booking and they weren t able to make the adjustments we would have preferred but they went above and beyond to make us feel confident in their service and comfortable during our stay and they threw in a bottle of champagne , Loved how modern and fresh the hotel is Very sophisticated which wasn t the best thing for kids but they were overwhelmingly accommodating 
40277,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, I didn t like to leave, Perfect location very clean hotel friendly and efficient stuff very helpfull Good taste of food Everything was perfect 
40278,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The bar had been booked for an event But I was told I coul d be served a gin and tonic in the lobby The barman brought my drink and made a point that was it was not the norm to serve drinks in the lobby but did so with little grace It gave the impression that I was putting him out , Choice of breakfast was sublime
40279,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, I didn t care for the receptionists checking us in She actually discouraged me from reserving with booking com in the future stating that I would have benefited more from booking through the hotel directly I just doesn t make any sense to discredit my buying decision now that I m checking in If it wasn t for a reputable site like booking com I probably would have overlooked Hotel Marignan They should be grateful for their partnership with the online booking site Also the room I booked was not the room I received I booked a room with a king bed and separate twin bed I got the room with two queen beds stuck together Three major problems with this hotel 1 No public access to the view that s so widely advertised on booking com Unless you book the room with the view you will not have access to the patio 2 The air conditioning is non functioning I get that it s cold at night but there needs to be some kind of ventilation in the room The only way to get air conditioning is you have to call the maintenance and they will turn on the air for the entire hotel If another guest complains of the air circulation they will turn it off 3 The shower was horrible Despite our best efforts not to splash the water quickly spread everywhere on the bathroom floor Our towels were drenched from trying to build a barrier to not let the water seep through When we tried calling for additional towels it was a huge ordeal with the housekeeping staff The toiletries are old the formulas are practically separating I wouldn t recommend staying in this hotel especially if it s your first time in Paris It will just piss you off , The breakfast here was delicious Thanks to some of the other reviewers we quickly learned to ask the staff for freshly prepared eggs All the breads were delicious and the grapefruit juice was very fresh Also the doormen at this hotel are EXCELLENT Some of the nicest and professional doormen staff we ve met throughout all of European vacation 
40280,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The window had a broken lock room services staff entered our room twice while we were in the room do not disturb light was turned on, The location of the hotel is excellent the duplex style of the room is amazing especially in Europe where rooms have limited sizes
40281,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, I booked a room suppose the Terrance can view the Eiffel tower However I can only view the tip of the tower which didnt match the descriptions very disappointed of this, Location is excellent Staffs are nice and helpful Room is clean and quite spacious 
40282,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es,No Negative, The staff was amazing very friendly and helpful with recommending nearby restaurants and procuring tickets last minute for the Eiffel Tower and Moulin Rouge The location couldn t be better on a quiet street right off the Champs Elysees The breakfast was very good and the bar is very cozy 
40283,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, We were made to wait our room to be ready for 1 5 hours Safe in the room was broken and we were not able to lock it Shower is leaking and that results in whole bathroom soaking in water Wifi password did not wor for me Payment for services got reserved twice on my card and only by my strict request staff agreed to not book the payment for third time , Location is great
40284,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Although breakfast is quite up to standard but the system is new for us You should order all food other than croissants No cheese or ham are displayed I do not think this will take lot of space, Food was good Hotel location is in a nice area and next to major luxurious boutiques Very friendly and helpful staff
40285,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, I asked for coffee as I was waiting for my taxi in the lounge area Staff where astonished at my request lady looked at me as if I had 2 heads Unreal that a 5 star Hotel couldn t serve a simple a cup of coffee during the day On the contrary I m astonished ,No Positive
40286,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Sink was clogged Breakfast buffet is with no cheese or ham etc only breads and yoghurt We were late one day and called them and were charged full three days they could ve sent us a basket of fruits etc , Staff friendly Bed comfortable
40287,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Rooms were a bit small , Amazing breakfast and great location Rooms were small for the price I paid but great bathroomservice and amazing mini bar selection Loved that we could borrow umbrellas when it rained 
40288,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The bed and pillows were uncomfortable We had a terrace but no real view to speak of If you want nightlife at your hotel this is not the place for you However if you want a clean modest place to stay in Paris I would recommend this hotel , The staff was very pleasant Great location if you like to shop 1 2 blocks to Champs and George Ave A great little neighborhood 
40289,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Nothing, What you can t like about this hotel Absolutely nothing great location designe comfort and amazing hospitality Prompt check in They made sure we have everything we need We will definitely go back and recommend it to friends and family It feels like home 
40290,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, We were informed it would be a king sized bed Not 2 beds pushed together Not exactly comfortable They couldn t even be bothered to clean the room When we moved in there were another ladies fake nails lying in the bathroom and all over the rooms floor Underneath the bed certainly hadn t seen a Hoover in as many weeks it was disgusting Inside the wardrobe Al though the disgusting habit of another Probably previous guest had left chewing gum stuck inside the wardrobe All above was raised in a polite manner with reception They informed us they would have the room cleaned immediately When we returned they had presented a nice fruit platter a bottle of wine and an apology note which was a really nice thing to do But they had actually forgotten to clean the room It would have been nice to use the complimentary coffee and machine they provide for guest who pay the extra for the prestige room But as above not only do they forget to clean your room they forget about the coffee station also So not only unkept but un replenished The breakfast hours are fantastic 07 00 till 11 00 We thought this would be great unfortunately the breakfast area is only big enough to accommodate maybe 10 rooms at 1 time So best try and get there early as you may not be able to sit for breakfast or they may not be anything left After day 2 we decided to eat out for breakfast It was just a disgrace , The location was good Although I feel we were misled in the fact you can view the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triumph You can however see the only just the top of the Eiffel Tower Not exactly a view Defiantly not worth the extra money as you don t have even a balcony to view from 
40291,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es,No Negative, Incredible staff perfect location great service I was traveling with my wife and five year old daughter It was my first time in Paris and so delighted to say that we had a fabulous experience with the hotel From the beginning and check in they did everything in their power to make sure we re getting the best service There was a confusion with our reservation at booking com and they upgraded us to a better room free of charge for the first night and for the remaining nights we have been offered two connecting rooms which were really spacious clean and fully equipped and they gave us a good discount on that room It was my birthday and they treated us with complimentary drinks at the bar All the girls at the reception Eva and her colleagues whose name unfortunately I don t remember were super supportive and kind They gave us great recommendations on choice of restaurants places to go nearby checking our flight and At the checkout We left my daughter s jacket at the hotel and they emailed us and promised to keep at a safe place until someone comes and get it There was nothing wrong with the hotel and we will definitely go back 
40292,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The terrace and outdoor furniture were not very clean , Everything was basically perfect except the size of the room was a little narrow and tight around the bed Pastry was the best I tasted in Paris the view of the Eiffel tower was amazing of course and the service was exceptional 
40293,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Service of the hotel was a huge issue during our stay we faced a lot of concerns related to the service which was offensive in many ways and makes you doubt visiting the hotel again although they have a good location rooms were nice but very empty like a business hotel and doesn t reflect the French luxury plus no main facilities Restaurant very basic Most of staff is new and they try their best but the much experienced supervisors lack the basics of service and hospitality The only thing that would make revisit the hotel is Ms Morgane who met me at the end of my stay to apologize which I highly appreciate, Location is perfect interior is nice
40294,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, There s nothing I didn t like , Close to Chanos Elysees and Metro yet quiet and luxurious Delicious breakfast lively bar outstanding dinner restaurant 
40295,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, We were given the worst room in our price category perhaps because we booked online Also it would have been nice to have a comfortable chair in the room Just one uncomfortable desk chair for the two of us was not so good , The staff is very friendly and helpful The location is terrific right by the Champs Elysee and right by a Metro stop 
40296,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The washroom in the room was with bad smell initially We asked for another room and they were willing to change for us which was okay , The breakfast was nice with flaky croissants Location was the main thing why we chose this hotel too Staff were helpful and nice 
40297,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Room was well appointed but small The bathroom overhead shower design resulted a mini flood after each use , Staff was very welcoming and friendly Location and breakfast were great 
40298,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Breakfast was on the light side 40EUR for American breakfast was based on choice of egg dish with 1 side only , Great location Very clean room Nice amenities Helpful staff Breakfast croissants were tasty 
40299,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The smallest lift we ve seen but it worked for us French breakfasts are next to nothing so I d rather skip it , Very convenient location just off Champs Elysee Small hotel well kept and managed 
40300,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The place was clearly understaffed around breakfast time resulting in long queues and slow service Not what I expected from such a lovely well thought through establishment , Loved the interior decor and the art 
40301,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, nice room super quality of furnitures and accessories super sheets perfect clima regulation , poor buffet breakfast need to ask nealry for everithing 
40302,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es,No Negative, The staff were amazing anything we asked for was no trouble our room had a big balcony overlooking the tower it was situated just off the Champs Elysees with a metro at the end of the road the bar was relaxed and inviting the food was just gorgeous we really havnt got anything bad to say and we got a clean bed every day for a week 
40303,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, FOOD , The location is perfect Hotel staffs are helpful and friendly especially Julius the cambodian guy and the caribbean guy I d definitely stay at this hotel again 
40304,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, A strange smell coming out of the bathroom of our upgraded room but a quick reaction from the staff to minimize the impact of the inconvenient We hope the reservation will remember us next time we go there since we ll get back there for sure , Very friendly and well trained staff Very well located Hotel Modern look but not cold as most of these modern looking hotels usually are 
40305,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, A lot of noise from the street side you can hear the truck picking up trash early morning for about 30mins and 2 times power outage during 4 days of stay Uneven services during breakfast can be very slow depends on who is serving you Also very pricy breakfast with very little choice and supply ,No Positive

40308,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Check in took ages reception always seemed understaffed hallways very narrow to bedrooms bedroom had silly lighting controls poor bathroom design hotel had no atmosphere , Great location just off the Champs Elysee Comfortable 
40309,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, The food is terrible I had to change room because of a leak Found out there are 3 kinds of delux room the first one duplex was big with huge shower and bath and 2 toilets The second has a tiny shower with no bath and bad smell tv doesn t work The third not a duplex with small shower and a large bath The food is the worst thing un this hotel I asked for a steak and they sent me a burget without bun and it was hotrible Breakfast buffet was a tiny table of breads Should be 4 star hotel, The location was excellent Happy with management agree to give me a discount after changing rooms 
40310,Hotel Marignan Champs Elys es, Bedroom too small Shower very uncomfortable would wet whole bathroom Weird location and size of toilet inside a closet very claustrophobic and without a sink , Location
