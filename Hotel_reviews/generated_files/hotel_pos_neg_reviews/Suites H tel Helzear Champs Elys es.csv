194823,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The staff while friendly seemed overwhelmed The WiFi access never worked properly and I saw several other guests seeking help with this as well While the room was lovely the lighting was not effective can t read in bed without getting up to turn off the lights bathroom lighting was not good , The room was comfortable and quiet 
194824,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, 1 The rooms are small They are fine for 2 people but 4 people is difficult especially when the sofa bed is out there is no room There is not much wardrobe space either The bedroom is the bed with 1 ft space all around 2 Coffee The property says it is 4 start but they make you pay for coffee pods Even 3 star properties by the airport don t do that It is a pet peeve because I like my coffee in the morning Also why put code pods for Nespresso in the fridge The Coffie comes out like warm from the machine Beyond comprehension 3 Towels They don t seem to get it that 4 people are in the room Everyday they take away 4 dirty towels and put back 2 clean ones and everyday I have to go to the reception and ask for towels 4 Lighting The rooms are very dark lacking lighting at night Luckily the windows are big so in the day you can see 5 Smoking The website says non smoking property and every night we come back the corridor filled with smoke from other rooms Some of which gets into our room 6 Wifi The Internet is fast but if you have business to do that uses services other than email and websites then you will have to use a VPN connection to get out They restrict the services allowed Annoying but with VPN I was able to do what I needed , the staff were extremely helpful and friendly If the property lived up to the level of the staff I would have given it 5 stars 
194825,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, Stuff are not helpful as I have checked out from hotel and forget my language in storage room I called hotel to ship it to London and lady answered sorry we are not responsible even when I gave my friend to pick up the language they didn t answer , Location is good behind Champs Elys es 
194826,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The room is a little crowded for four people , I travel with my husband and three college age daughters My daughters and I stayed in a room for with a queen bed up in a loft and a pull out sofa bed Very cute design The beds were comfortable but it was a little crowded My husband had a single room on the same floor The staff is wonderful and very accommodating Located just a 5 to 10 minute walk from the Champs Elyesse 
194827,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es,No Negative, Super nice and friendly staff excellent service The hotel was really close to the Eiffel Tower and grand palace and there were restaurants nearby too 
194828,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The walls could be more noise proof , Modern luxurious and very well kept property Well equipped mini bar ask for price list Free tea and coffee Very comfy bed quiet backyard room Great location 
194829,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, I did not get the room I booked and paid for We were in a very small room on the ground floor with a rotten place in the wood floor right in the area at the foot of the bed We were put in a room with a garden view after paying extra for a city view We were moved the next day up to the 6th floor with city view that I paid for The guy then told me I hope you are happy now There was a terrible odor coming from the bathroom so bad that we had to open the window and keep that door closed The sink was stopped up in the bathroom and the shower control fixture was broken The fixture was busted and easy to see that you could not turn on the cold side and the button was missing from the hot side I told two different employees about this and they acted like it was just fine The mini bar fridge had a small container of milk that had expired in Feb and this is mid May My goodness Oh yeah the Hotel staff blamed the booking problems on Booking Com, The property is in a good location IF you want to stay in the prime high priced area 
194830,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, Staff made me pay for things that were already broken when we arrived said coffee was free but charged for it after Do not accept genius perks, Good location clean hotel 
194831,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, If we put the extra bed its hard to pass trough to and from the main room , Its a hotel My room got cleaned up everyday very neat and clean We all got one password for once device for wifi the receptionists were helpful I love the area too big stores in champs elysees are walking distance 
194832,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, Not a single thing , Everything was perfect location was first class with lots of shops and restaurants close by So close to the sites Staff were polite and friendly 
194833,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The junior suite had a double bed but no seats to sit on Two cheap metal stools by the 1 metre by about 800 mm fitted table It did not match in any way the images on their website There was only one staff member to check us in and he was answering phone calls at the same time We had to wait about 20 minutes before we could be checked in The one bedroom apartment had a sofa bed in the eating area but the double bed was in a room so narrow that the walls were touching either side of the bed It could only be accessed by climbing in from the bottom end of the bed , The location close to the Arc de Triumph
194834,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The hotel is on a very busy road and the double glazing is not really sufficient for the noise I gather the hotel must be aware of this as there were disposable earplugs amongst the toiletries ,No Positive
194835,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es,No Negative, Bed is very comfortable even the room is quite small Fully equipped room with everything you may need Staff on the day shift was very attentive and helfpful but not for the night shift 
194836,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The room was so small the bed was wall to wall climbing down the bed to get out An elderly person wouldn t manage it The living area was cramped We had a junior suite and if you put up the sofabed you wouldn t be able to move The staff said we had an upgrade we had asked to for a balcony on our booking but they said we couldn t have one The bathroom towels were like a runner on a table the toilet seat was broken The whole experience was disappointing and the pictures of the room on the website were so misleading , Location
194837,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The bathroom had a very bad smell The early check in policy is ridiculous you have to pay 90 euros so they can try to give you the room by 1 30 p m They tried to charge my credit card during my stay without asking first that s not acceptable , The location was good The room was clean 
194838,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, Tiny facility Bed surrounded by walls Tiny shower Bad smell in bathroom Not clean we found a broken glass and dirty kleenex behind the bed , Nothing
194839,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The room smelled a little but this was solved by opening the large windows to balcony in the living room I would suggest ventilating the room before new guests check in Bedroom in one bedroom suite is small no bedside tables No phones in rooms , Comfortable room well designed in a great location Room has all the amenities aside from phone Good wifi Good shower pressure and temperature Nice to have the small balcony Staff was friendly and polite I had a look at the 2 bedroom suite which would be great for a bigger group 
194840,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, No hangers for clothes outside a very small cupboard not enough space to put the luggage in the small room room was not ready at planned arrival time , In the middle of the center friendly stuff nice decoration 
194841,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, This is a preference my girlfriend disagrees with the location is central to Champs Elysees and the Eiffel Tower certainly a convenience but the high location score made me believe the immediate neighborhood would have more charm However the immediate area was not very busy and the street quiet at least during our weekend stay which was nice especially considering the crowded sights so close by , The staff was very friendly helpful Yasmine and Hamza were especially accommodating and made the stay a great experience We were first greeted in English which was not expected but proved to simplify the process 
194842,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, Unbelievably small room Unable to get out of bed from the side and suitcase has to be in the bathroom Booked for 5 adults and one was on a Fold out that completely bocked the bedroom door When I booked a airport transfer it wasn t there to meet us After much expensive phone calls and an hour later we got a cab Very cold waitiing , Clean and great location
194843,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The size of appartement was ok but the arrangement of the bed and salon making the room very small With very narrow passage The only elevator for 6 floor is very very small The passage between the elevator and the rooms difficult to pass by No fitness center, The location and the view of tha appartement in the charming road of paris Nice wifi connection
194844,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, Apartment suitable for 2 couples but not for more people Sofa bed in very tiny lounge room kitchen There was no dining room table so we couldn t eat in the apartment , Very good location friendly and helpful staff 
194845,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The bedrooms are small very small The bed is in between two walls and no space in between If you want location it is the best , Staff were very friendly especially a young lad called Hamza who took his time to ensure we were satisfied with the overall accommodation He was also kind enough to point out a few things to do in the city 
194846,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The apartments are super duper small We are a family with four little children and we arrived there with three big luggage baby stroller There was literally no room to move in the apartment I had to move furnitures around all the time in order to open the extra bed open luggage etc This was really very uncomfortable Maybe I should have chosen a different hotel , Very good hotel very clean great staff The location is amazing Despite the cons this hotel is great 
194847,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, Did not change the bedsheets daily , The staff are kind and helpful provided us information and things as we requested The room are good Location is good enough Just 5 mins walk from Champs Elysees Easy to grab a cab and Avenue Marceau traffic are smooth 
194848,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, The room was tiny and very dark with poor lighting The shower was tiny I am short and I am normal weight and I kept bumping myself against the shower door which did not stay well closed The shower was a tiny box The radiator in the bathroom got so hot you could burn yourself on it There was no space to put anything in the bathroom The bed was a single bed but I guess that is standard for Europe when booking a single room , I got a deal on a single room which was a great price for Paris The location was great and it was very quiet 5 minute walk to George V metro stop I am not a fan of the Champs neighbourhood I prefer le Marais and St Germain de Pres and would rather stay there next time as I did not go to Paris to see fancy stores Regardless if you want to go the C E area for most of your stay it is very well situated The room was clean People at the front desk were very helpful and nice 
194849,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es,No Negative, Very nice staff I was traveling with my family two children 2 5 and Olivia from reception staff made a very nice check in We loved the design touch in the hotel decoration the bed is good Globally is a very nice hotel for family traveling with a great balance between price and quality The breakfast offer can be improved The ideia of having someone delivering at your suite a basket with bread croissant and chocolate bread is very good but something is missing maybe including fresh fruit but this did not affect our experience Suggestion to the staff continue to make an effort in hotel maintenance and people will love it 
194850,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, Rooms are very small We stayed at 2 bedroom apartment type There was no bedroom in one of rooms only the bed in a box type walls You feel like you sleep in a box We stayed 7 days and They did not change the sheets at all not a once Hotel workers are not helping to carry your luggages Only the lady called Olivia helped to bring our luggages to the room at the check in But at the check out olivia was not there thanks to her she is very helpfull they only watched how we struggle with the luggages Also the day before we checked out I asked a man at the front desk can t remember his name to book a taxi and ask the total price to go consulate first and then airport he asked and tell us that taxi driver said it s 80 euros he spoke in french so I could not understand we accepted Next morning taxi driver came and asked that if we are going to airport we said no he didnt tell you we have to go consulate first ok we went airport finally and he charged us 140 euros and he said 80 is the only airport fee So I don t know who is the liar but my advice is do not book a taxi from hotel , Location is very good 5 10 minutes walk from Champs Elysees Price is good for the location

194862,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, This is really an observation rather than anything else the living space was on the small side so it s not really an apartment to hang out which is perfectly fine when you are using it as a base you should be out enjoying Paris after all Think of it more of a multi bedroom hotel suite than an apartment With the sofa bed in use the living room just disappears For us this was OK at that point we were just there to sleep We would definitely come back on a future trip to Paris, Fantastic location 5 mins walk from the Arc de Triomphe and 15 20 mins walk from the Eiffel Tower Good restaurants nearby check the different review sites to avoid the touristy ones Staff were very helpful to arrange airport transfers both ways and luggage storage during the day after checkout Beds are really comfortable and the apartment was clean and modern

194864,Suites H tel Helzear Champs Elys es, We booked a two bedroom apartment for 2 adults and four children but it was tiny When the sofa bed was pulled out it blocked the doorway to the bedroom It was a tight squeeze but did the job for 2 nights , The location was excellent and we all slept really soundly
