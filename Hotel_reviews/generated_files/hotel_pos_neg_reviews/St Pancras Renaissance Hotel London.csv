320202,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Great location architecture and environment was amazing Went to this hotel for my 6 year anniversary to enjoy all of its facilities spa treatments was great and to wind down Would recommend to a friend Most Definitely 
320203,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I would be happy stay more often if it was a little less expensive but i guess you get what you pay for , I adore the hotel theres really nothing else like it 
320204,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The rooms were a little overpriced for what we got They were more like a standard hotel room rather than a superior room , The hotel building itself is very historic with great architectural features and very relaxing as is the booking office bar and restaurant Ideally located near stations and attractions 
320205,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, the whole experience we were made to feel welcome from the start and the service was impeccable couldn t fault anything , the hotel was fantastic so full of character the room was perfect we staying in the Barlow wing in a premier room it was my partners birthday treat whilst we were enjoying the spa they had a bottle of bubbly sent to our room an excellent touch 
320206,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, There was a party with loud music going on after midnight within the hotel that we weren t warned about and as this was a Thursday not a weekend we felt that to go on so late wasn t appreciated when we had a very early start which was the whole reason for using a hotel so near the railway station,No Positive
320207,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The hotel is wonderful It is a beautiful restoration of a historic property every room and public space is lovely The included breakfast was bountiful and delicious We ate in the restaurant one night and thought it was excellent as was the service Having the train station right there made travel around the city so easy Would definitely recommend 
320208,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No free wi fi is a disgrace for such a prestigious and costly hotel We stayed twice and on both occasions the shower tray different rooms did not drain properly , Great location and fabulous building Surprisingly quiet rooms 
320209,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Only you had to walk through the reception to and from the Spa sometimes in your bathrobe , Sympathetic new extension to old building one of London s great buildings 
320210,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Booked table in Booking Office Restaurant and Bar where we were very disappointed with the service Took 15 mins before a waitress came to the table Ordered bottle of wine which then took another 10 mins to arrive Food order got mixed up by the waitress In all a very disappointing experience , Location excellent Rooms clean and comfortable 
320211,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Bedding had holes in both pillowcase and duvet cover At home I would have disposed of it Horrendous smell of drains on bottom corridor right next to the kitchen Breakfast fresh squeezed juice Straight from a carton Without dispenser being washed Phone calls not being returned , Obviously the location The rooms were beautifully clean
320212,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, A very small room on 7th floor with a very small window looking over the glass roof of the station Very disappointing and certainly not good value for money , Very nice breakfast friendly and efficient reception desk with a Pimm s offered when we were checking in Excellent but expensive dinner at the Gilbert Scott table booked well in advance 
320213,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Service was superb the staff were kind considerate and thoughtful and we never felt condescended to we felt as valued as if we were high paying business customers 
320214,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Bathroom grouting on floor dirty room view poor no biscuits in room both times on check in and out reception staff took ages to do their job They didn t even get it right I had the wrong address on my bill and I was accused of having to two find from the mini bar where as im pregnant and my mother doesn t drink so something fishy going on there with either their sensors in the mini bar which I might add we did not touch or cleaning staff are not honest , The French girl in the hansome lunge was really friendly 
320215,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, A small criticism would be lack of counter space in the bathroom , The decor in the hotel is beautiful Staff were very friendly and efficient Great meal in the Booking Office 
320216,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Staff were really welcoming and friendly Treated ourselves to the Chambers Club upgrade and the afternoon tea and pre dinner canapes were delicious Bed so comfy 
320217,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We were upgraded for our room but we felt that the upgrade wasn t memorable We were put in the newer wing of the hotel so it lacked any character and we didn t think that the room was any bigger or better than the standard room which we had booked Despite having booked the room many months in advance I felt that we were maybe moved for the convenience of other guests who were attending a wedding reception at the hotel on the same night as our stay The room was perfectly adequate but did not represent anything special after being told we were upgraded We were staying for our wedding anniversary so I did not want to raise a fuss in case it spoiled the weekend for us , We took the Eurostar to Paris so the location was ideal
320218,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The only thing I am not happy with is that my 100 deposit which was paid on arrival was not transferred back into my account after five days I am not happy that the money for he room was taken out my bank immediately why was the deposit not returned immediately I will be in touch tomorrow if money is not in my account by end of day , Beds were very comfortable and the staff very friendly and helpful
320219,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The room was very average nothing special and no more than a plain vanilla 4 hotel you would find at an airport hotel Very disappointing for the price You are paying for the foyer and architecture of the hotel from the outside At check in no one offered to help with my bags and when my wife tried to get in the room as she had arrived after me they kept her waiting for 40 minutes because their check in system showed another room etc Overall it was underwhelming entirely and given they were told it was my 50th birthday weekend in advance and other guests were booked in and joining us they made no effort to acknowledge or otherwise i get the impression they don t bother much with booking com clients even if you are paying 360GBP a night booking a couple of months ahead ,No Positive
320220,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Room classed as deluxe Very poorly appointed if so Cheap non functioning roller blind not really appreciate Hotel in general seemed to suffer from poor plumbing Communal toilets on ground floor blocked during whole time we were there ,No Positive
320221,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Fairly standard four star room Bathroom was very small and the shower definitely not five star I have a better shower head at home Mould and sealant missing The bed was comfy and plain not dressed as you would expect for a five star hotel The window was tiny so when they said limited view on checkin they weren t kiddin Didnt like the hidden service charges although they were small it just seemed mean to charge for a glass of water offered at reception We stayed in the modern part which is like every other hotel around If you want to see the fancy bit you have to book the suites This hotel is overrated I ve stayed at much better hotels ,No Positive
320222,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, As above the prices at St Pancras seem to be ever increasing and are now becoming faintly ridiculous Despite liking the place its possible time to look for somewhere slightly less as Bed for the night without breakfast at nearly 400 it perhaps a step too far , With a train to catch at 9 55 breakfast at 8 45 should have been easy but it was much delayed profuse apologies from manager and a free breakfast but a 40 minute weight for corn beef hash not really acceptable 
320223,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, There was nothing to dislike , The location of the Renaissance was perfect for our early departure on Eurostar the next morning I can t rate the breakfast as we had to leave so early We usually travel to France by car or plane but if we ever use Eurostar again I would definitely stay at this hotel 
320224,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The price is too expensive for what is no better room than cheaper hotels You re paying for the location and surroundings , Location is handy for kings cross and st pancras Beautiful building Welcoming staff
320225,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Price and access to rooms bypassing a kitchen where u can smell the bad part of a kitchen, Leading to the lift lobbies a horrible smell coming from the kitchen The shower are weak
320226,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Only problem was the shower drain was blocked but that was soon sorted , We stayed in the Victorian part of the building and it was wonderful to see how the building had been resorted The whole place has a feeling of old style opulence The room was very comfortable and the bathroom huge The staff were very friendly and helpful Loved our brief stay it was well worth the money 
320227,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Mould in the shower around the tiles and shower screen Complained to reception but nothing done to rectify the problem , Beautiful architecture excellent service delicious food comfy bed 
320228,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Outside the hotel looks magnificent Inside beyond the lobby the part of the hotel is was in was very basic in design and the room though functional was uninspiring Although the booking was for a King bed the room had two singles Comfort was OK but not special Similarly the bathroom was functional but not at all luxurious , Not much For the price this was nothing memorable or outstanding I was taking a train early the next day so the location was ideal but I won t be back 
320229,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Shower it was impossible to use without flooding the whole bathroom floor Lack of suitable shower enclosure Hence very liable to slip on floor which could be a problem Lighting poor in the room which had windows looking out over the covered atrium and hence no daylight WiFi did not work, Friendly helpful staff Very good location for Eurostar 
320230,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We arrived to be asked for 100 deposit to be taken at the point of checking in I have never had this asked beforehand by other 5 hotels I have stayed in London I understand there is a need to register a card should you make purchases However unacceptable to charge a customer before even spending anything Also there was no do not disturb signs to put out for the cleaner and consequently we were woken up Despite having booked a luxury room we didn t see any signs of real luxury I felt like we could of stayed in A premier inn which would have been cheaper and had the same facilities The only thing that looked luxurious was the outside of the hotel as you walk towards it Definitely not worth the money I wouldn t stay here again , The beds were really comfortable 
320231,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We requested early entry to room which was not possible That was ok but we couldn t even get in at the time our booking started 3 00pm We were kept waiting another 30 minutes and only when I asked again at reception were we told the room was just about ready The room was booked from 3 00pm so if we didn t get this then contract terms are broken and a partial refund should be given The room was fine but was a disabled room we are not disabled this means lower wash basin and I am 6ft 3inches tall A fairly minor point but we should have been asked if a disabled room was acceptable beforehand ,No Positive
320232,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Beautiful hotel in the perfect location for Eurostar Stunning building with friendly helpful staff Lovely bar areas and lots of other options nearby 
320233,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, You had to pay 7 50 or 15 pounds per day Wifi which I didn t expect considering the amount you pay to stay here Also the rooms were very small and one side of our bed the carpet was soaking wet we informed the reception and it was seen to same day There was no natural light in our room and you couldn t open a window Also there was only powder coffee sachets in the room I ve stayed at hotels a third of the price where you have your own Nespresso machine Also from our rooms it was quite a way to the spa you had to walk through a busy reception area with seating to get to the spa area not ideal in your dressing gown in the early morning , Beautiful building great location 
320234,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Underwhelming rooms for a five star disinterested staff twin beds when requested double small basic room paying for wifi loud corporate space still looked like a station not a hotel poor lighting very poor value for money , History
320235,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Communication with the hotel is difficult Only front desk was helping us My personal experience is regarding my wedding photo shooting in the hotel Weeks before my arrival when I can cancel the booking if the hotel don t allow Hotel email said it s permitted and only a form need to be filled I did send back the form then no reply from hotel One day before photo shooting day Hotel front desk said formal permission is needed I resent the email immediately On the day of photo shooting 1 Email replied fee needed no cheap 2 After talking with front desk permission given When we changed to outside and wanted to take some photos of the hotel building security stopped us said permission needed again We asked him to talk to his colleague in the front desk After wasting our best timing of sunlight security came back and said OK , The Hotel location is great And the hotel building is nice Front desk is helpful 
320236,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No sockets next to bed to charge phone No converters EU to UK system in room Eggs in buffet left under heatlamp becoming dry and overly done Natural products selection could be higher, Great building and atmosphere
320237,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No hot water Even a 30 hostel would have hot water When we informed the management all they said was Thanks for telling us Unacceptable , The buildings were great to walk round and soak up the architecture 
320238,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Room was very very dissappointing for a 5 star hotel room expected a luxurious room we got a very basic room with cold shower and pubic hair in bathroom I asked for a bath but wen we got upgraded we got no bath just a shower it was our honeymoon I was expecting so much more from a 5star hotel at that price iv stayed in nicer rooms at budget hotels wouldn t stay again, Restaurant was great for breakfast staff were lovely and spa was fantastic although we would have liked champagne as we were in spa but no food drink policy
320239,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The room was NOT a 5 star room Need to upgrade furniture carpet light fixtures I wanted to feel special and this room was average nothing special I would rate the room as a 3 out of 5 Stars , Hotel is located at Eurostar Train Station
320240,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No negatives from our stay , Excellent welcome and check in Staff were exceptional Location ideal for Eurostar to Paris Beautiful and historical building Breakfast was lavish and excellent 
320241,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The description i purchased the hotel on from your site was incorrect for the room we had allocated no 37 tv on wall bose radio large bathroom or sitting area I rang booking com up to complain after speaking to hotel Your company was rude and unhelpful The hotel were helpful Please check your descriptions in future,No Positive
320242,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, payment not taken until check in although unrefundable booked last year as a present wi fi not part of package, lively atmosphere beautiful flowers in reception helpful staff understated comfrtable quiet room with all facilities
320243,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, This hotel is a Marriott Hotel and the event team service was terrible We booked this hotel weeks before arrival and sent email request permission to allow me to take personal wedding photo in the hotel the grand stair is a place with unlimited possibilities for great pictures The answer is yes and we just need to fill a form There was nothing regarding charge and fee We thought this is for sort of registration purpose then happily replied the form and didn t consider another hotel anymore And there is no email from the hotel At the night before our photo shooting after asking front desk for the details front desk told us that we need a formal permission from event team We have to send email the form to request permission again In the second day we finally have an email reply from event team telling us now the photo shooting is chargeable However after arguing with front desk the hotel allows us to take photos After we taking photo at the grand stair we went out for photo elsewhere in the city and come back to take the photo of the outside of the hotel building with the perfect sunset right on the clock tower Security suddenly stopped us from taking photo due to permission is required We explained that the front desk already gave us the permission and the security keep stopping us We insist the security need to talk to his colleague inside and finally he did He came back and said he would keep one eye closed and keep talking his own version of story We didn t argue for more because the sun is going down and the sunlight is changing every second At the end we couldn t get any nice picture of sunlight on the clock tower because we were stopped by the security at the best timing I have booked 2 rooms with St Pancras Renaissance hotel for photo shooting and requested weeks before If the hotel told me it s chargeable or reject my request I can at least try other hotels , The Hotel location is great And the hotel building is nice Front desk is helpful 
320244,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Compared to other 5 star luxury hotels at this price I found the room very small It was a very clean and modern room and fine for a single occupant but I think if two people were sharing it would feel a little cramped No bottle opener available to use for minibar beer The breakfast was served in the large old Booking Office which was a lovely old fashioned room Unfortunately the hot buffet items weren t particularly hot I d say they were slightly warm On my second morning I wasn t given any milk with my coffee and also there was no butter available for my toast It took a couple of minutes to actually find a member of staff to rectify both of these very minor issues Staff were very friendly indeed , Room was very very quiet Staff were lovely and friendly Room was modern clean and perfectly maintained 
320245,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I don t like to moan but if I had one gripe it would be the outside traffic noise with the hotel being so old and listed it had old windows and no double glazing , The hotel was a gem one of the best I ve stayed in the staff couldn t do enough for us and the location and the history of the station was fascinating 
320246,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, For the high price I thought the room was a real let down It could have been any chain hotel on the inside nothing that justified the high price We were in the Barlow Wing which is the newer bit and had a great view of a WALL Bed extremely soft There was just no wow factor for the type of hotel it s supposed to be The route to the lifts for the room take you down a long hallway past the kitchen which absolutely stank everyday A mixture of fish bad drains and toilet and this continued onto the lifts so not pleasant at all, Great location and great breakfast It was my wifes birthday so we were grateful to receive some complimentary beers and cake
320247,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, n a, The hotel is conveniently located next to king s cross which I can access the station through a door connecting the two places Staff are impressively nice and polite and I do like how the interior is decorated Everything is perfect 
320248,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We were very impressed by the hotel until the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night These things are sometimes unavoidable however the lack of care was evident We dutifully got out of bed and walked down to the reception area This after all in our mind this was an incident There were no staff to direct us or inform us that it was a false alarm We were met by a chambermaid who rudely said it was not real We had walk down the stairs from the third floor and did not meet one member of staff Returning to our room we were met by an other couple who were on their way down to reception I telephoned reception and was told that the manager would be informed It was two hours before I returned to sleep In the morning when checking out I relayed my story again and was told I should have received a letter and the manager would be informed What effect has informing the manager had This should not be the stock answer What always matters is the customer service These things can happen however it is HOW they are dealt with that is the real measure of service , The day staff gave excellent service very welcoming The evening staff were not very good and the service poor The room was excellent and the breakfast good
320249,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Room was dark and gloomy with minimal furniture or interior design effort A very small window gave a view of the train station roof Fo the very high At price I d expected more , Th foyer restaurants and bars are excellent 
320250,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Very unhappy about the breakfast The pastries were covered with fruit flies and I am afraid my buffet breakfast was cold The manager was very apologetic and gracious but in an hotel with the good reputation that the Renaissance has these events were not acceptable , The bed was comfortable but the room quite small 
320251,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The restaurant was rather overpriced the portions small the food average Charging 15 95 to watch a recent movie release is also pretty steep , Clean and well equipped room good shower for a 6 4 guest like me 
320252,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Terrible check in and management of our booking reception argued that we had booked what we had and told us nothing else was available with no offer of any compensation appalling when you are paying 400 a night , The manager was excellent in dealing with a mess we booked a double deluxe room but were given a small twin and told we d been bumped He gave us a discount and free dinner
320253,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Worn out dirty Service sub par Would NOT return to stay here again This is an expensive hotel yet in almost every detail from the furnishings to the food to the service this was AT BEST a two star hotel A beautiful 1870 s building that could have had a wonderful hotel fitted inside Instead it looked and felt like a cheap 1970 s hotel with bad design worn out furnishings and a menu of over priced and flavorless cafeteria style food The service levels were equally disappointing dated impersonal and careless Walk by this wonderful old building even pop your head in to see the lobby but do not spoil your visit to London by staying here ,No Positive
320254,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Bit dowdy inside The foyer is a bit like an airport lounge, The location is the best thing about this hotel Otherwise pretty standard facilities really 
320255,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Settee in bar was battered and had torn armrest but the prices were sky high Poor signage meant internal hotel entrance was difficult to find from St Pancras concourse , Spa great Room quiet clean and comfortable Very characterful old part to the hotel
320256,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The Booking Office restaurant bar was very noisy with irritating music Mini bar consumption added to my room when I had not even opened the bar in the room Failure to send me the bill by email Rather pricey overall , Clean and comfortable with good size rooms and an excellent location for our friends who left by Eurostar and also OK for sightseeing from Good food in the Booking Office restaurant 
320257,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The on cost for internet usage in your room Honestly for a hotel of this size and cost to not include internet coverage is poor It was free in the lobby If you are worried about costs put up the already expensive room costs by 5 pound and everyone is happy, Staff were fantastic esp Aimee at reception
320258,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We spent over 800 on our stay in a premier king room for our wedding night and it just wasn t worth the money Despite us saying that we were on our honeymoon they gave us a disabled access room with red alarm pullies everywhere and no bath We didn t expect an upgrade but might have expected at least a bath for the amount we paid The room was fairly standard as of a chain hotel The food was great and room service lovely but the room just didn t match it , The location is good and the hotel itself is stunning 
320259,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I could not work out how to use the shower I was in a hurry and did not have time to work it out The bath was too high for someone with arthritic knees , The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff 
320260,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No natural light because we needled to check in early to get to a matinee performance the only room ready had no natural light the window overlooked a meeting room which was very weird , Comfortable bed
320261,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Booking Hall restaurant while good old decor was rather slow in service and the hot breakfast buffet was sometimes barely warm Lighting was too dim also , ambience and location first class and reception service from Alex very helpful
320262,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nothing I enjoyed it all , The friendly welcoming atmosphere by staff The comfortable and quiet room with the comfy bed The delicious meal at the Gilbert Scott Restaurant which the receptionist quite rightly recommended to me The service minded professional and discreet staff who gave me valuable information when I asked for it I had a very enjoyable stay 
320263,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Thought the room was overpriced as it was fairly basic I was expecting more character in the room given the amazing exterior and history of the building I could have been in any hotel once inside the hotel corridor room , Bed comfy delicious breakfast excellent friendly service Quiet room Powerful hot shower 
320264,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We stayed in a superior room but it felt like standard The breakfast was the worst I have ever had in a London hotel Would not stay again , The location and the building are superb
320265,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Room dark air con noisy complimentary tea and coffee barely managed a cup each at 6 00am seemed rude to bother housekeeping no designed facility with light and access to mirror for hair and make up very poor indeed Thought hotels had learned lessons about all gender needs , Convenient location nice and quiet Perfect fir early international connections
320266,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The only thing I was a bit disappointed with was the room one in the newer Barlow Wing pretty average for the price I was VERY grateful to be given a king room but I do think it was a pretty standard Marriot room bathroom pretty small No bath But comfy bed For the 322 price tag I think I thought it would feel a bit more special I have stayed in the J W Marriott in Beijing and so I think I was expecting something like that , This was a big treat for me I have lived in London for 20 years and since the hotel had been refurbished I have wanted to stay here I won some money in a prize draw and thought this was the perfect opportunity to treat myself and my partner First thing to say the hotel is magnificent reception lobby bars and restaurants are all superb We got howling drunk on very inventive and piquant cocktails in the Booking Room Bar Loren helped us with the perfect table Service was superlative 
320267,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Was very disappointed by the buffet breakfast The cooked dishes are cold I did bring this up to the front desk staff at check out they kindly offered to get me some extra food I had to decline the offer as I was already full but do appreciate their offer , Service e g Was very disappointed by the buffet breakfast The cooked dishes are cold I did bring this up to the front desk staff at check out they kindly offered to get me some extra food I had to turn down their offer but this touch of professionalism was noted A welcome glass of champagne on arrival Thick black out curtains Very comfortable bed Great cocktails at Gilbert Scott bar 
320268,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Food was well prepared but menu a bit limited , Staff was absolutely outstanding I travel a lot and have a sort of jaded all big hotels are really alike at the end of the day But this one really was different and special Staff seemed genuinely happy to be working there so their care of guests came right out of that feeling It wasn t a forced plastic I m being nice or I ll get in trouble kind of niceness It was just a really great atmosphere I had fun conversations with several people as well as tips for another trip The hotel itself is gorgeous an well kept renovated Victorian rail hotel I was in 2 separate rooms trip was broken up and the rooms really have personality The one where I could see the Eurostar from my window was really fun 
320269,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The check in was a little slow but staff were very attentive to the wait We couldn t buy the lovely SPR book that was in our room a disappointment because their gift shop no longer existed , We were offered an upgrade to a room in the original portion of the hotel and it was a magnificent experience The room access to the Chambers the drinks and food were fantastic Great individual check in and tour of our area of the hotel One of the best hotels we have ever experienced 
320270,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We didn t stay long enough , We were upgraded by our family to a junior chambers suite to celebrate my birthday so everything was amazing from the guided tour to the free newspaper Bed really comfy and huge large bath and a little birthday cake made it all extra special 
320271,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Our room was rather boring and plain but it was in the annexe My sister and brother in law had arranged champagne and nibbles to be given to my husband as a birthday surprise when we checked in but no one knew anything It took me having to ask two reception staff to check and insisting that the champagne should be here before we were finally shown to a prepared table in the Booking Hall It seemed that food and beverage staff hadn t liaised with reception staff so we weren t on their screen Just as well my sister had told me or it would have been spoiled No joined up communication then in this age of computers , The beautiful old part of the hotel that we sadly didn t stay in Wonderful decor and opulent staircase Our room was very quiet even though it was on a main road 
320272,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I didn t like how the WIFi didn t work so well in the lobby and in the room I decided to sign up for rewards membership in order to get free wifi, the convenience from eurostar to this location Great location for proximity to eurostar and British library
320273,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Liked everything this was my seventh stay at this hotel , The staff is very polite and helpful particularly Ben on reception Bank Holiday Monday Makes such a lovely change to come to a five star hotel and not have to deal with staff members who think its clever to be stuffy and borderline rude 
320274,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The bed is not comfortable for my taste Very hard mattress and it had wheels so that with the slightest movement you end up half a meter from the wall , Quiet room
320275,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Service was on occasions patchy Excellent at best arrival porters and slow forgetful at worst no order taken at table in one of the bars not busy and hot drinks at breakfast took over 10 mins nad three reminders but not on all tables Complimentary wifi in lobby but not rooms so odd in this day and age policy we were told , Amazing lovingly restored historical building in the heart of London Lovely atmosphere 
320276,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Mean with tea and milk on the tea making tray also not even a little biscuit you get these at most average hotels I certainly didn t like the way they take a deposit against using the mini bar they did repay it very promptly but it sends the message that they don t trust their guests I didn t like my view of a brick wall either Expensive but you pay for the location which is excellent as are the cheerful staff , It was a good hotel but not I would say in the ultimate luxury bracket
320277,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The room had a very small window which I was unimpressed with , The hotel s architecture was amazing the grand staircase is something that you must see in the hotel If you have time walk in to the train station its also very impressive 
320278,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We upgraded to the club room which included breakfast afternoon tea and canap s The breakfast and afternoon tea were fabulous but the canap s in the evening slightly disappointing, The room was fabulous very spacious and very clean and comfortable The whole hotel was lovely 
320279,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We thought that breakfast was included in out price but were disappointed to find that it wasn t, Proximity to St Pancras for early departure on Eurostar
320280,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The seats in the Booking Office were low The consomm was wayyyyy to salty The pork cheek dish was wierd the king Edward potatoes soup was dreadful like wallpaper paste Wouldn t go back again Wine by the glass was 10 00 ridiculous even at London prices The view from our room was uninspiring We booked a twin but were given a double even though we checked in early so had to move rooms This hotel was on my bucket list but I found it a great disappointment ,No Positive
320281,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I paid 334 for the room for my sister and her husband on their wedding night and they were constinstly disturbed with the noise and announcements from the train station u cold hear every train been called over the intercom That was the last thing they wanted on their wedding nighthe and not having a ly on in the morning instead they got interrupted, The decore
320282,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Signage to the hotel from Eurostar was good until you reached the top floor via lift then could only see a bar entrance hotel Renaissance is written in small print on a small plaque main entrance is outside the station We ate fish and chips had better, On a return train trip to Spain the comfort of the bed was wonderful luxury room lovely breakfast though would much prefer silver service Beer very good Staff service very good
320283,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The rooms were rather warm and the air conditioning was difficult to adjust as the windows were locked this made it a bit tricky to sleep well , The staff was extraordinarily helpful and friendly very accommodating to our needs we had a wheelchair with us and just fabulous 
320284,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, lovely view over the station very historical building but ultra comfortable and modern comforts attended to Big bathroom wonderful shower though ask at reception if you have difficulty as it s a high bath to get into 
320285,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The room seemed slightly on the small side for a 5 The hustle and bustle of the reception area we found rather too much as we were at leisure It felt more of a business environment , Location great beautiful building room was nice and quiet 
320286,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Lack of interaction by some of the staff Bath towels are too small Hotel pens are cheap plastic and don t work well Spa swimming pool towels only provided Bathrobe and slippers only provided if you have a spa treatment not had service like this in any other 5 hotels , The breakfast room service was fab

320291,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Wifi wasn t the easiest to connect to as we had to have guest services work with my daughter s phone until she was connected I appreciate the extra effort that they took to get us connected though , For us the location was perfect coming in from the Eurostar and having the Tube station right there it made getting where we needed to go easy and quick This is obviously a Marriott property that caters to a business clientele as many business professionals were working in the lobby The check in desk provided excellent customer service and stored our bags for us as we arrived early and weren t able to get into our room just yet The soft bath robes were a nice touch too The breakfast buffet was very good and many choices were offered so we could have whatever we liked All in all a great choice for us 
320292,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, It seems that they tried to rip me off when I left presenting me with a vastly over complicated bill that was full of mysterious unwarranted charges When I challenged them to explain it they got into a fluster they issued me with a new bill that was much simpler and more in line with my expectations They also asked for the original nasty bill so they could tear it up I said no of course Extremely disappointing obviously I will never come here again Check your bill folks , Good job renovating the building

320296,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, After breakfast when we were leaving one of the waiters came running after us to sign for breakfast even though we were checked in and signed in at the reception for breakfast as we came in it was part of the inclusive package When checking out we found that the waiter had charged us for breakfast If we didn t question this we would have been charged So the management of the breakfast process can improve and particularly as we were chased by the waiter it felt as we have done something wrong Not a good experience to start the day Wifi we couldn t at all log on to in the room on 7th floor Concierge staff at the desk weren t as warm friendly and welcoming We wanted a couple of glasses sent to us and the person didn t really want to be disturbed But pleasantly when we got to our room a few mintutes later two glasses were already there , The font facing reception staff and staff at the entrance were very friendly and welcoming Made such a difference and didn t feel that we were on a conveyor belt A much better experience than at the Pullman next door Keep up the great friendly approach We asked for a quiet room and the room on the 7th floor we got was perfect The restaurant staff manager asking for feedback during the meal was so refreshing and really keen to know how to improve the menu and taking in the feedback positively and eargerly wanting to make changes It was so refreshing Breakfast was perfectly relaxing too

320298,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nothing to dislike, The architecture of this beautifully restored building is second to none Junior suite 175 overlooking station platform was the best view The trains did not disturb us Didnt hear them until the morning For the guests who love trains like we too this was the best room would love to return Crudite afternoon tea and cakes drinks all available as part of the access to chambers club which is included in junior suite price To get the full experience from this hotel I would recommend this more to pay but in my view the experience was worth it The little relaxation pool is lovely too

320326,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Explanation of the Chambers club location not made clear to my wife when she checked in We found the Gilbert Scott restaurant rather impersonal and noisy lacking intimacy and ambience A little disappointing Ladies washroom upstairs near the restaurant needs attention My wife surprised to find broken tap and no hand cream in a 5 star establishment , All facilities used were excellent especially in the Chambers Club
320327,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The traditional colours and sheer size of everything meant lighting was generally gloomy throughout e g in Booking hall and Chambers possibly a reflection of what it had been like when lit by gas but would have liked the opportunity for a few brighter spots there was not sufficiently good lighting for applying make up either at the dressing table in the bedroom nor even in the otherwise well lit bathroom , Although pricey it is a wonderful location for a short break We upgraded from the new to the older rooms with access to the Chambers club which was worthwhile staff very attentive and good selection of free to members food and drinks of which we didn t take full advantage Room well appointed and decor and height of ceilings amazing it was also nice that the history came through in for example framed plans of the old building pictures in the room and the coffee table book to look at The Gilbert Scott dining room also has wonderful decor and good if not outstanding food but a very helpful sommelier As the hotel is right next to the international station there are lots of close at hand eateries and shops Well located to visit the British Library or to walk down to other venues such as the British Museum We didn t try out the pool but fitness could certainly be maintained just by the distances walked along corridors and up stairs if one didn t use the lifts

320334,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Unfortunately we were only there for 1 night The writing on the minibar indicating sensors under minibar items needs to be bigger so you can read that if you take something out to look at it then its automaticity added to your bill We had to drink the bottle of white wine , Friendly helpful staff Good sized room Large bathroom Comfortable beds Good location Loved this hotel 
320335,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The rooms were very generic and surprisingly small for a Superior King room Basically very generic hotel room unlike what was expected from the rest of the building and online pictures , Beautiful building beautiful interior lobby fantastic staff

320337,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The setting location staff and the sweets at reception and around club lounge This is our annual family pre Christmas hotel to base ourselves and do our London shopping and then relax before the madness In our view this is the best hotel in London to indulge

320340,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The wifi was only free if you signed up for the Marriot reward program and you had to agree to pay for it then it would be deducted later For a hotel of that price Wifi should be free as standard and seamless to connect , It was a very quick stop over so the main reason for choosing to stay there was the location within St Pancras It had everything you could wish for though comfortable beds beautiful decor and everything working heating hot water proper blackout curtains etc

320348,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Over priced upgraded room 400 a night for the most appalling room, Booked a suite and it was not worth 400 per night I upgraded which meant it went from a standard room 260 to 400 I ve stayed in better rooms in a travel lodge Emailed management and was told it was what it was and they are renovating next year if they knew then why weren t the rooms cheaper 
320349,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, no Bose speaker or alarm clock in the room as advertised and this was a superior room Barlow wing rooms are fairly sparsely decorated for what you pay saunas are not mixed jacquizzi is barely warm restaurants don t really cater for guests who must compete for bookings with the general public which isn t ideal for a hotel of this nature very little natural daylight in room 244, Building is awesome and so are the facilities

320356,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We were unable to eat or drink in the public areas as it was more like late night pub than an early evening aperitif I was staggered to find that you still charge for wifi first time I ve seen this in a very long time anywhere, Bed was very comfortable room well equiped
320357,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The rooms aren t as opulent or as grand as I would have hoped For the price and what I knew of the hotel I didn t expect a room that simply looked like an upmarket travel lodge The breakfast was fantastic but paying extra for it I thought made the room very expensive,No Positive
320358,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, There was only one glitch and that was the drinks service in the lounge when we returned from our night out it was pretty poor for a five star hotel, It was all fantastic the service throughout was great and the facilities five star
320359,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The newer rooms were not very unique or different considering the cost It would have been nice if those rooms were in keeping with the theme of the hotel instead of being typical chain hotel style , The location is superb and the building is stunning Food quality was very good and customer service was excellent 
320360,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The staff went out of their way to make us feel valued and welcome guests and nothing to as too much trouble we upgraded at their suggestion and rather to our surprise it was the very best decision we had a wonderful stay

320362,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, They added a charge for Internet which I didn t use onto my bill but were gracious enough to take it off after I complained This sort of thing happens too often at hotels especially when you book at an extra low rate , Right on top of St Pancras station so couldn t be more convenient Beautifully restored building lively and lovely bar lobby Rooms were well furnished clean and pleasant 
320363,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No free WiFi Come on guys you re charging 400 a night for a room and WiFi is extra Room was an empty featureless box TV didn t work All together a very underwhelming stay in a very expensive hotel Would not recommend ,No Positive

320368,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The main thing was lack of Internet access without having to pay for it This was very disappointing and unnecessary given how much it cost to stay there and the fact that you can go into most cafe s on buses and stay at Premier Inns getting free wi fi , The atmosphere of the hotel the building and location The staff were helpful and friendly Breakfast tasted nice with plenty of variety Nothing you asked for was any trouble 
320369,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We booked a number of rooms and there was confusion between who should be in which one of our group ended up paying for a room that had already been paid for which was a bit irritating A really minor blip though , The service is outstanding the rooms amazing we stayed in the Chambers suites and the location couldn t be better The staff couldn t be more helpful if they tried nothing was too much trouble The building is architecturally stunning the decor sympathetic and opulent it s an amazing restoration job A really great experience We can t wait to come again 
320370,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No swimming pool or spa working Had to move room as wasn t happy with the quality or tiny dungeon like room Was charged for mini bar 70 for champagne which we never had Moved room and was told initially we had to pay extra Noise during the night which kept us awake and other guests also complained over the same issue Moreover every time we called guests services they took over an hour each time to arrive Very poor service and extortionate price for a Travel lodge style room Also paid another 100 cash at check in for extras we never wanted This is not a 5 star hotel and the service is shocking We would have rather stayed in travel lodge Had better nights sleep on a canal boat in Amsterdam Would never ever stay again Totally ruined my birthday Not happy and will be making a formal complaint about our horrendous stay , Breakfast
320371,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The poor management of bedrooms We got moved three times We also got asked to vacate seating area for three ladies even though we were waiting for drinks , The bar area

320373,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No biscuit on the coffee tray , We were allowed to check in early when we thought we would just drop the luggage off after 12 00 Decent room size proper bath comfortable beds and very friendly staff
320374,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We specifically requested a room overlooking the station and were disappointed by the absolute filth coating the windows We fully understand it is an open air station and it s simply not possible to keep what is essentially an outside window sparkling nor was that an expectation However what we experienced was truly unacceptable There had to be 2 cm thick of accumulated filth on the window sill It was so bad I actually wondered if the restoration process simply ignored that part of the building Marriott Renaissance you can and should do better , Several years ago on my last trip to London I noticed the renovations taking place to this historic and grand Victorian hotel while walking to St Pancras to depart on the Eurostar I told myself The next time I m here I m going to stay there I ve long had an appreciation for history and the better parts of those bygone eras Also I feel that if we want to ensure that such beautiful historic places aren t torn down we need to support businesses that invest in their restoration So I was quite pleased with the experience of stepping back through time which was my primary reason for staying here and booking in the Chambers Suites The room was wonderful with a spectacular view inside St Pancras station which we specifically requested and the service was of course first rate Of particular note was the Eurostar transfer service included with staying in a chambers suite The hotel is already literally connected to the station so is very convenient to Eurostar However when staying in a chambers suite the staff comes to your room collects all your baggage escorts you past all the queues at security and takes you directly to your specific coach finally placing all baggage on board for you I simply cannot articulate how smooth and relaxing this made the experience when traveling as a couple with my elderly father I strongly recommend you put this in your list at least once even if only for the one night on either the day before your departure or the day of your arrival by Eurostar 
320375,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, In room dining gave me food poisoning twice I notified the staff and they said they would look into and get back to me That never happened and I was still fully charged , Comfortable pillow and mostly friendly staff

320379,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Free wifi , The bar staff were excellent being very professional while being very friendly The knowledge base on Vodka with my particular barman was amazing He made a great martini too 
320380,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The pillows were too light for my liking but that s more of a personal thing they weren t sturdy enough Also the WiFi situation is a bit of a joke no free wifi and there s two types of connection you can pay for normal and super fast the super fast was 15 for the day Ridiculous if I m honest, Everyone greeted you or said hello from the staff outside welcoming people by car or taxi to staff inside baggage handlers and staff behind the desk Amazing facilities and really clean quiet and everyone is respectful of each other
320381,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The staff were very polite and helpful room was clean and well maintained food in the old booking office was to a very high standard drinks were a bit pricey but ok for London central location ideal for Euston and kings cross underground overground stations recommended by me

320391,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Very poor value for money Prefer the Pullman Hotel next door Here s why 1 Despite the hotel s high prices wifi is charged unbelievable if one does not wish to sign up for Marriot Membership Previously I have only ever experienced this in very cheap hotel chains 2 Staff was very very friendly to me when I was a guest at the hotel I would equally appreciate friendly treatment when I just pass for drinks or a bite to eat even if I may not look like I can afford to stay the night surprise surprise 3 My room only had one tiny window the mattress was hard the heating insufficient asked for an extra blanket the second night but still too cold 4 From my room I needed to cross the very public Hansom Lounge to get to the Spa So for going there in slippers and bathrobe I d have to feel up for the attention , Love the Hansom Lounge In future I will stay at the Pullman next door but keep having my tea and drinks at the St Pancras Hansom Lounge The St Pancras Spa is nice but small 
320392,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I would have expected free wI Fi in the rooms in a prestige hotel it is even free on the bus very interesting room used for the breakfasts but try sitting in the chairs Either the chairs were too low so offering no back support when eating or for the upright chairs there was no knee room because of the thick table top sorry but you did ask Sorry but the breakfast were way below standard cold coffee and cooked food not much hotter Also empty dishes not filled quickly Even the budget chains do a better job, very good location and a really good job in the restoration of a historic building very welcoming and efficient staff
320393,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Breakfast was disappointing The sliced bread did not make good toast the very cheapest bread non seeded was provided The croissants needed heating to be diigestible We found an empty beer bottle in the fridge and had to inform the reception to avoid being charged ,No Positive
320394,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Room 314 superior King room looked out on to a wall so made the room gloomy and claustrophobic expected more for a superior room disappointed, Location cleanliness restaurant

320396,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Free secure wifi in the room would be good I tried to access the free wifi in the lobby to no avail The staff were very helpful with this but eventually I had to sign up with Marriott Hotels which I assume is the intent but as I only travel every couple of years it won t be a lot of help to me unfortunately , The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times The bedroom was lovely and spacious SO comfortable and I slept amazingly well Breakfast was a wonderful array of tempting platters and delicious as well I also loved the architecture of the hotel and would have loved a tour of the property unfortunately I missed the one on Saturday 
320397,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, There is some renovation taking place so parts of the hotel were not in good condition Didn t impact my stay particularly and probably just bad timing I also found it strange to pay for Wi Fi not many places that charge for this nowadays , The staff are amazing really helpful and friendly The bar restaurant had a great buzz and the food was perfect for what I wanted Overall has a feeling of a very grand hotel 
320398,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, All the public areas were very noisy The room was rather gloomy Breakfast was uninspiring and service a bit offhand Had to ask twice for tea though it was practically empty All rather expensive considering , The room was immaculate the bed vast I liked the sophisticated desk and lamp Lots of sockets Deep thick carpet Every amenity you d expect for the price Rapid response from reception when I had a problem with the TV Perfect location for the Eurostar which was the point of staying there in the first place 
320399,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, could have been little bit cleaner in bathroom silicon was coming away from wall in bath room and dirt on shower door, The staff were lovely very attentive and helpful ten out of ten
320400,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Dissapointed with Barlow suite decor drab and dated certainly not worth the money awful view though told would have a view of library I was expecting something special fell very very short , The bed
320401,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I booked this hotel as a surprise for my partner on his birthday We had a great day in London and arrived at the hotel exhausted The noise from a wedding reception outside our room was ridiculously loud and we had absolutely no chance of getting any rest The manager offered us a room with two single beds which was hardly in keeping with the romantic weekend we had in mind Although he arranged an alternative hotel I had to pay the difference in price and then had the hassle of getting back to St Pancras the next day to get the train home ,No Positive
320402,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Paid wi fi No complimentary water in room Bedroom not cleaned when we returned at 4pm we had left at 9 30 am that morning , Booking Office bar and staff were exemplary in their customer service Ambience and amazing architecture Cocktails

320404,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The breakfast was possibly the worst that we have ever had in a London Hotel even the b b s we have stayed in have been better Inedible bacon stale hard overcooked food that had been on the hot plate far too long even at 8 15 a m No advertisement for our travelling visitors and certainly not good for a hotel of this standard We hope we were just unlucky that day , Very comfortable quiet room friendly open staff and wonderful location for travellers We have eaten in the hotel before and had really excellent meals 
320405,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, A cup of tea coffe in the restaurants are 5 00 But I have to stay our afternoon teas was excellent in the lobby area and we did have a lovely breakfast , We stayed just one night at the end of our 8 week Ireland UK trip before catching the Eurostar to Paris and the Hotel was wonderful and worth every that it costs The location the ambiance the very helpful staff the room we stayed in a superior was excellent Highly recommend a stay here and we will definitely do it again 
320406,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The hotel is over priced It needs to remember that part of its function is as a railway hotel and price accordingly for in transit customers Perhaps separate off the corporate business side from the travellers All restaurants were very noisy Bad acoustics one of the restaurants is vault like and with wooden floors the din was unbearable The WiFi rate is very expensive 7 per 24hrs standard rate 15 per 24hrs for high speed broadband Surely WiFi charging my stay at the rack rate should be free , The location Had to catch early morning Eurostar so this hotel is ideally situated Beautiful building well renovated 
320407,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I really can t think of anything I would say is a negative about the hotel, The architecture of the hotel the Victorian staircase which I was told has featured in one of the Harry Potter movies and one of the Spiderman movies movie The staff were wonderful The room was spacious and clean with a big comfortable bed The food was very nice the location of the hotel is excellent with its own entrance into the train station
320408,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We were not given a menu for breakfast but just directed to the buffet would have liked to have know there were other choices available which we discovered after we had eaten Also the air conditioning fan in the bedroom was noisy and it took several phone calls and a lengthy wait during the night to finally get someone to switch it off for us , Brilliant cocktail bar

320416,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The bedroom window was very small for the size of the room and the lighting wasn t great for working , Bed very comfy and a quiet room Staff friendly and efficient and went the extra mile 
320417,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The only downside was that the entertainment system did not work in our room so I was unable to connect my ipod to it Had a couple of maintenance men come and take a look at it but had to tell them to give up in the end because we had to go to dinner A minor pain but it certainly didn t spoil our stay , It looks impressive from the outside and did not fail to disappoint once inside Our room was lovely and the complimentary bottle of champagne it was my partner s 40th birthday that day was a really nice touch Great location and the staff were very welcoming Would definitely stay again 
320418,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The low tables in The Booking Office at breakfast made sitting down and getting up from the table awkward for both me and my wife with the limited leg room knee height available Perhaps a room that is appointed deliberately for relaxing leisurely meetings with young friends over drinks of an evening does not necessarily convert to a comfortable eating experience for the more elderly and physically impaired where seating height and knee space require a different configuration altogether Otherwise I would have given an excellent as the answer to the question on Breakfast , The bedroom in The Barlow Wing was comfortable and well appointed Checking in and checking out was accomplished easily and pleasantly Dinner in the Gilbert Scott Dining Room was an enjoyable experience with quietly attentive waiting staff and good food 
320419,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Because of the historic nature of the building the public lounge is very busy with limited seating A cafe latte is also expensive , The room was spacious with a super king sized bed The bathroom was large and well stocked with goodies 
320420,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Thought the hotel food more expensive than expected The cost of the hotel was more than the value I have stayed here before , Front desk staff was wonderful

320430,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Extremely long check in Air conditioning in room had to be turned off as it was dripping only noticed when we were in bed so a little late to ask for a room change luckily not too hot, Handy location iconic building
320431,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Strange unpleasant odor in corridor leading to rooms extraction in what I guess is adjacent kitchen needs sorting out Rather gloomy and unsuitable breakfast area thought needs to be given to better lighting and seating or perhaps a different location A need to create a more defined and better lit route from hotel to station rather than as at present through the Stygian gloom of the bar , Spacious comfortable room impressive historic building location makes trip to Paris so easy and enjoyable not least because of the adjacent facilities Very pleasant and helpful staff 
320432,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Rooms inside didn t quite live up to the expectations given how nice the building looks from the outside It s a perfectly reasonable hotel room but didn t stand out , Beautiful building very handy location good bar cafe areas
320433,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Expensive Took some time to learn how to operate the lift Others in the lift also missed the very discrete instructions So we went from lift to lift under the impression they had both broken down , The railway station ambiance The wonderful restoration of the building The breakfast free with a Barclaycard The convenience of being close to the departure station

320435,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The d cor in the bedroom didn t live up to expectations We had a nightmare trying to sort out how many nights we had booked for I had confirmation of 2 nights and tried to sort it out on 4 separate occasions which ruined the weekend away , The hotel was beautiful and had many original amazing features The d cor was also beautiful 
320436,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Not knowing how to turn where the main switch on off lights in room were and and howbthey were operated There was not quite enough light in the room for all the moments very low lights , Ambiance Space Views Club area with amazing service
320437,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Temperature of the air conditioner remained at uncomfortably cold despite efforts to adjust it Insufficient tea and coffee provided 2 conditioners and no shampoo in bathroom , Great location right in central London close to transport links shops museums pubs restaurants etc Cuddly robes and disposable slippers provided Lots of room and a big bed 
320438,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, They do find many opportunities to add on extra charges even on the bar bill I am slightly miffed that I was sold a room upgrade on the strength of breakfast included slightly bigger room and the view over the station See picture attached It was very disappointing , The hotel is architecturally amazing Food fabulous including breakfast All the staff smile and acknowledge you as they pass All very friendly polite and helpful

320440,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, They charge you excessively for everything and I don t think the staff communicate with each other We spent a month travelling through Europe and the UK and this was the only hotel that charged for wifi in the rooms Motion detectors in the minibar meant we couldn t keep our babies milk cold then got charged to have some delivered to the room The worst part was at check in nightmare We booked and paid for our 2 rooms months in advance but at check in they informed us they had given our twin room away to a large tour group who had decided to extend their stay thanks a lot It took about 45 minutes to fix the problem missed our reservation at hawksmoor as a result after which our two parties were on seperate floors To add insult the new room only had a queen bed in it we booked 2 singles so they had to arrange a pull out bed which they kindly informed us they wouldn t charge us extra for as if they would Finally we had organised a late check out the night before due to our late flight out of Heathrow so our bub could have her afternoon nap only to be told by the morning staff that the time given was wrong and we needed to check out an hour earlier All in all not a great experience with the reception staff , This is a wonderful old Renaissance hotel Well located in kings cross station so it s a breeze to get to if you catch the Eurostar from Paris like we did The hotel is very well appointed with lovely rooms and a great pool area specific times for kids though 
320441,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I chose to stay at the St Pancras Renaissance as I had seen it featured on several social media accounts and it looked fantastic Unfortunately I was left a little disappointed The hotel is in a magnificent building however my room was in the new section and the room was utterly generic not even a hint of character or any railway age decor I could have been in any hotel anywhere I did take a wander to the other side of the hotel to see the magnificent grand staircase which was wonderful but my section of the hotel both the corridors and rooms was woeful in its blandness I had a dog with me small dogs are allowed in the hotel and I was on the 6th floor some considerable way down the corridor Taking him out to do his ablutions was a massive round trip to the lift down to the ground floor out of the hotel all the way back Not at all easy or convenient It was not at all well thought out but I was hot and tired and didn t want to start switching rooms I was surprised it wasn t more thought about by the person allocating the rooms I was also upset by a conversation with one of the staff who was explaining I couldn t eat in the restaurant with my dog I understand entirely the decision to make the restaurant unavailable to dogs but in a dog friendly hotel I was told I was only able to sit in my room to eat with my canine companion and she kept repeating health and safety It isn t a health and safety issue it is a choice made by the hotel which I understand ,No Positive

320453,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, didnt like the way we had to walk through the reception bar cafe area in our bathrobes to get to and from the Pool area also the room was too hot upon arrival the air con should have been on, Buffet Breakfast was fabulous service excellent
320454,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Paying for wifi at a place of this quality is a bit steep The bedroom decor and carpets looked somewhat jaded now , Super comfortable bed Super efficient staff who refrain from telling you that everything is Not a problem 
320455,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Toilets are located along the corridor taking you to the lifts to the rooms As a result the entire corridor smells badly and gives a not nice impression of the hotel as soon as you are getting to your room The room is a bit dark a bit or refresh and lighter colours would make it more pleasurable The minibar system is awful If you try to refrigerate a bottle of something and to do so you move around the content of the fridge you get automatically charged , The room including the bathroom was spacious Extremely quiet which I really enjoyed Location is perfect for sightseeing and even more if you are in London on business
320456,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Need a extra towel rail or hooks in bathroom Also the Bathroom door doesn t stay open so a pain as getting ready in and out I had to use something to hold it back but that s a minor set back Also I noticed that the Lift area smelt like kitchen food and odd smell in that area in general , Comfy beds and friendly smily staff and fantastic service The room size and facilities are great The decor of hotel rather stunning I have to say

320459,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Your excitement and energy at arriving at this architectural masterpiece is sapped completely when you enter your bedroom which is corporate ultra modern dull and not in character with the fabric of the hotel The hot buffet breakfast was actually stone cold and the breakfast plates to put them on were too No plate warmers , Apart from the bedrooms the hotel is stunning and has been restored beautifully and with consideration The location is good with easy access to St Pancras of course and Euston a short walk The staff are well trained and courteous

320467,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The breakfast wasn t what I thought to see The continental side was much better but the cooked was only sausage streaky bacon beans and an egg in pot There was no mushrooms tomatos I think ideally if you want extra you can ask and they will get it , The suites in the chambers are amazing and is worth paying the extra The hotel has great features and the staff are attentive

320484,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The only issue was that you could hear the underground which runs below the hotel the ear plugs in the amenity kit should have been a clue , Beautiful hotel conveniently located adjacent to St Pancras Kings Cross stations We stayed in a Junior Suite in the Chamber section of the hotel The room was grand and comfortable The staff in the Chamber Lounge area were all excellent couldn t do enough for us The facilities in the lounge were very good and the upgrade to the junior suite was well worth it

320493,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Check in time 4pm not great can t really use the facilities and get around London as well The pool is closed to children from 2pm so thankfully we never told our 3 year old daughter she could go for swim , Grand hotel and the location for getting around was good Beds were comfy and rooms good Staff nice

320495,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The staff were excellent We didn t walk past one member of staff who didn t speak to us with a polite hello It was impressive customer focus and what beautiful location We loved it 
320496,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nothing at all , Peaceful quiet room so close to the Station it was great An early start on Eurostar to Paris made the choice of stay automatic and turned out enjoyable as well Staff were kind thoughtful and nothing too much trouble did things without being asked Thank you I last saw St Pancras 50 years ago before migrating to Australia and was afraid a lovely building had been violated by progress but a pleasant surprise indeed magnificent 
320497,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Bar closed early at night and took a long time to get a beer in the reception area after this , Staff very attentive Great great food Breakfast was unbelievable 
320498,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Very expensive basic room bathroom disappointing , beautiful hotel IF located within the old part Complete rip off if located in the new wing Lovely restaurants good location 
320499,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Arrived 30 mins after check in time but room wasn t ready Took a further 30 mins to be available I had an appointment which I was late for as a result of the delay At breakfast my daughter received half her breakfast other half was supposed to follow as the croissants were still in the oven but then changed to being unavailable and we were told we would not be charged but we were charged in full Aside from the desk staff who did all they could to help the other staff do not appear focused on customer satisfaction and really let the hotel down A 12 gratuity is also built into food drink bills which I can only assume has to be done as I wouldn t tip the restaurant staff voluntarily I stay in London regularly and would not recommend this hotel based on it staff , The hotel is a great building Very striking structure and convenient for tube etc 
320500,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The doorman s attitude when I asked directions to the tube station He was snooty , The old fashioned style of the hotel was charming Desk Staff Wait staff and Concierge were excellent Overall it s a really great hotel 
320501,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Our room in the Barlow Wing was disappointing and was not in my view worth the price Our room was indifferent and not what I would call 5 star The room was just like many other indifferent hotel rooms anywhere in the world If I had understood what the Barlow wing was I would not have booked this room but one in the main hotel Very disappointed The buffet breakfast whilst good was overpriced and extra to the cost of the room , The restaurant was very nice and the food was excellent The entry to the hotel was impressive Staff were helpful to the extreme 
320502,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The history of this hotel was so interesting and the main staircase was amazing Our room was very comfortable and quiet So pleased we were able to stay after our Eurostar trip 
320503,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We were told our room would have a view of the platform but what we had was the view of the roof only with laser vision would we have seen the platform Interestingly I have just been contacted by the fraud office of my bank saying that someone has tried to do a transaction in the USA with my card details there may be absolutely no connection but it might be worth checking your customer payment security luckily no harm done and the bank stopped the payment , We loved being so close to Kings Cross with no arduous journey across town with luggage we loved eating in the Booking Office the banana smoothie offered whilst we were booking in everyone saying good morning the grand entrance and how pleasant the desk staff were 
320504,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Chambers club was boring and stuffy despite free drinks we preferred to use the booking office bar Breakfast in the Chambers room was poor choice and quality Better off charging less for the room and paying for a breakfast with more choice and of a better quality , Staff were particularly polite helpful and efficient Beautiful building nice atmosphere in the Booking Office bar and lounge area Comfortable bed nice bathroom and toiletries our room had everything we needed and more Ideal place to stay when travelling on Eurostar 
320505,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The whole stay was wonderful the staff were very friendly and professional The room was lovely as was the breakfast An ideal location for a visit to London It was a joy to stay in such an historic building 
320506,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Watch out for the shower in the bathtub It is very difficult and downright dangerous to enter the shower Slippery with a sharp edge on the molding built over the tub Be careful , Great Staff good food nice room except for the shower The hotel s setting and transformation of an old building into a work of art is amazing It is also steps away from The St Pancras Train Station and Kings Cross Very convenient 
320507,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I was disappointed that there was no area in the room with a mirror and socket to allow you to dry hair and put on makeup , I liked the ambience of the building and the history it extolled
320508,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nothing , Lovely room with extremely comfortable bed All staff were extremely courteous nothing was too much trouble Loved the Booking Office for breakfast and evening drinks

320512,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Quite expensive for a standard room which was located in a modern part of the complex, Excellent location on stunning restored building Staff were friendly and professional 
320513,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, tired floral beige corridor carpets let it down a bit rather stained n marked in areas wrong base colour for heavy traffic areas , amazing afternoon tea service wonderful everyone so helpful n pleasent made us feel special the 5 star service no one passed us anywhere in hotel without saying good morning afternoon evening or offered help or asked how our stay was lovely linen n comfy beds 
320514,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The room virtually an attic with a small window looking onto a roof The niggardly approach to extras in the bedroom only one bar of soap no biscuits with tea tray etc , The location and grandeur of the old building 
320515,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Bar food prices seemed VERY high even for London 10 for a glass of wine of the day and soft drinks seemed very expensive too went across the road to a local bar instead , Fantastic location excellent staff and wonderful breakfast Lovely lobby area and really nice touch of a book left in the room that detailed the history of the building 
320516,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Our bathroom smelt damp I asked for it to be checked out which was done However the problem was still there a little disappointing , The hotels is fabulous and the location was great for our needs 
320517,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Booked the hotel expecting something special for the start of a special holiday Room was small dark and pokey small window with no drapes just a net No better than a Premier Inn and at 269 a night price was a joke No proper lounge area Check in was not until 4pm so had to wait in foyer where the minimum charge at the table was 12 50 would not recommend, Very little 
320518,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Booked a suite in the chambers wing for my wife s 40th birthday and having made the booking I called to confirm that our room overlooked the station This was the only reason for booking here as she really wanted to stay in a room with a view of the trains The hotel confirmed that it did so of course you can imagine my surprise when we checked in and were shown to a room overlooking the main road The gentleman who showed us to our room was very apologetic so we followed him back to reception so he could try to find us the correct one He went off and got the rather rude duty manager was not so helpful but eventually they found a room albeit a smaller one than booked overlooking the station We were fine with this as the view was what was important to us not the size of the room On arriving at the new room he apologised again and offered my wife a complimentary bottle of champagne and some cookies for our daughter as an apology which I thought was very kind However 30 minutes later we received a bottle of their cheapest white wine and nothing else Now don t get me wrong a free bottle of wine is a free bottle of wine but why offer something more special if you can t follow through with it No doubt the miserable duty manager who couldn t care less about the whole situation stopped him Sadly my gripes don t end here as the windows in the room were filthy to say the least which meant you could barely see through them to the station this defeating the whole object of staying there I could have accepted this more if they were all dirty but those over the public staircase right next to or room were spotless Added to this a stone cold breakfast they did at least refund this and a big scratch down the side of our car which happened whilst parked using their 50 per night valet service and frankly it was not a good experience , Amazing building with great character room very comfortable great location and good evening meal 
320519,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, On a previous visit last year we ate in the very expensive restaurant and I had a starter with croutons scattered and they almost broke my teeth they were so hard so please rethink the crouton situation Apart from that I have no complaints and still have my teeth I mentioned this on my last visit and they said they would report back to the kitchen On that occasion when we stayed we thought they were slow with the puds so we mentioned it and they were brilliant and apolgized and did not charge us The set up is very impressive and the staff are very well trained and professional , It is a truly beautiful building and very historical The openplan foyer is light and lovely and full of flowers and the staff are exceptionally nice smart and polite and very well trained We had a light supper and our waitress was delightful and we had an interesting conversation about Hungary and goulash She was so nice and looked after us beautifully and the dinner was good My fresh fish was excellent and not over cooked The bedrooms are spacious and quiet and the beds and bedlinen top quality There is a nice feel to this hotel you get the scent of the continent as the gleaming trains glide in and out of the station It has a romantic 1930 s feel It s glamorous and very well managed It has the feel of a very stylish film set and is classy and classic rather than trendy I have a friend whose family did the ironwork long ago and the ironwork is truly spectacular I found the Hotel relaxing and restful and I liked the quiet well managed rythmn and ticking clocks It felt a little like a gentleman s club Unhurried and peaceful We loved it This hotel is civilized and in a mad rushing digital world this is a haven of peace and tranquility Do go 
320520,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Signage from the elevator to the inside lobby for registration We were confused as to where to go We asked staff who were very helpful , Proximity to Eurostar and The British Library The Breakfast Buffet 
320521,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Bed and pillows uncomfortable Had to pay for wifi 7 99 per day Tea and coffee making faculties inadequate for hotel of that caliber , Bathroom and toiletries nice Good air conditioning Reported a problem fixed straight away 
320522,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nothing , Lovely building old and new parts Well furnished equipped rooms Efficient friendly gracious staff Great food service atmosphere A wonderful place to stay
320523,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nothing wrong as far as I was concerned If you take the cheapest room as we did you might end up with a view over a wall which is not amazing however we did not care that much for the view so I guess it was a good trade off , Super breakfast super location Victorian style pool Very relaxing If you kept some money aside for a nice getaway with your partner and love London this is a very romantic and practical choice The charm of a hotel located in St Pancras really is unique 
320524,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Customer service was outstanding Everyone was cheerful and helpful The room was well appointed and the location could not have been better Very pleased 
320525,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Well this may be our problem but we couldn t figure out how to adjust the thermostat so the room was too cool for us We of course should have asked the very helpful staff , The location within the St Pancras station was great as we traveled by the Eurostar train from France It is also right next door to the British Library and within easy walking distance to the British Museum The staff were wonderful letting us check in early showing us where the elevators were and arranging for a 5 00 a m taxi to take us to the airport 
320526,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The room was disappointing and did not meet our expectations The rooms complimentaries E g toiletries and bathrobes of which one we found was threadbare and had a hole in Overall we found the hotel less than satisfactory for a 5 property , The building it s is very impressive and the staff friendly and helpful 
320527,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Leaving the hotel , Beautiful building and fantastic staff they couldn t do enough for us We stayed here for my Son s 11th birthday the staff made such a fuss of him my Son said it was his best birthday ever 
320528,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Noisy room as it overlooked the Eurostar terminal Room not as big as in other comparable hotels we ve stayed in , Excellent service Breakfast was delicious Beautiful building and iconic location Big comfortable bed
320529,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The bed was too soft for us my partner said it felt lumpy The more historic parts of the hotel are reserved for those with chambers rooms I was very disappointed that we could not see the grand staircase as this was a primary reason for booking this hotel , A treat for my 40th birthday my friend told the hotel pre arrival of this and we were upgraded to a king size room rather than the Queen we booked which was lovely spacious and comfortable Following an early check in we left the hotel and on our return to the room found a card and slice of cake with a happy birthday message What a lovely touch The hotel is magnificent and sensitively restored We had our evening meal in the booking office which had a wonderful atmosphere relaxed and yet stylish the service was impeccable and the food delicious and great value for money
320530,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Our pillow cases had yellow stains on The head waiter in the ala care restaurant pored someone else s wine in my glass much to the despair of the wine waiter, The location and the hotel is beautiful
320531,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Room was well appointed and comfortable sufficiently large for a family of three unusual for London Great location right next to Eurostar we arrived from Paris dropped our bags and went sightseeing So easy 
320532,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nowhere to put toiletries in the shower other than the floor Over sensitive mini bar that generated charges just by opening the door and looking , Bed very comfortable Room and bathroom spacious Staff generally pleasant and attentive TV and heating aircon easy to operate
320533,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The breakfast was cold even at 6 30 in the morning Did not complain as were in hurry , Bed was large and so comfortable Rooms were spotlessly clean Staff superb 
320534,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, We loved everything about our stay at St Pancras From our beautiful and well appointed suite the attentive but not over the top staff the location the Chamber Lounge it was all perfect We ve already planned our return visit and know exactly which suite we ll be staying in I m already excited for our next stay 
320535,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Staff in Booking Office restaurant at breakfast time were not attentive waited ages for first drink and had to go looking for refills High cost for a relatively basic room , Architecture in public areas was fantastic Staff in Booking Office restaurant in the evening were very pleasant and attentive 
320536,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Arrival and check in was off the mark for such a majestic high end hotel In fact we were largely ignored till finally an apologetic employee told us the room was not yet available and tried to up sell us other rooms , Comfortable and quiet rooms a gorgeous lobby and the lovely booking office bar restaurant 
320537,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The fact we booked a Queen room and yet we did not even get a Queen bed Plus they forgot we were bringing a child so there was no extra bed in the room We had a view of the roof , Particularly friendly staff and fantastic location Plus we were moved to a superior room when we pointed out that our original room was not what we thought we booked 
320538,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I had to phone twice to get coffee etc ordered for my room as cleaner forgot to replace On one day got back to my room at 3 30 to find it had still not been cleaned and had to request it being done and go downstairs to have a tea whilst they did our room This was after o tiring day when all we wanted to do was relax , Wonderful beds excellent congierge and bar 
320539,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We had to leave early to catch the Eurostar so couldn t try the breakfast , All the staff and there were lots of them most friendly cheerful and helpful 
320540,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Even as a guest at the hotel we had to go on a waiting list in order to get drinks from the bar, Great location if traveling out of London by train Very handy if wanting to see london
320541,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, It was just disappointing I guess The building is incredible but the character doesn t flow through to the rooms They re really quite ordinary Clean smart and comfortable but you could be in any hotel anywhere There s no hint of the beautiful historic building that surrounds them , I didn t like the 1st room they put us in it was quite dark but they were absolutely lovely when I asked for an alternative It was no problem at all 
320542,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, When booking through booking com with breakfast included the hotel does not recognise this the following morning I had to pay on my return two weeks later I raised this issue and again it was not registered on there system Check with reception before you go for breakfast , Locatio location location
320543,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Breakfast was tasty but expensive Better value to find something locally just outside Spa was quite small and pricey , Location was really convenient Bed was really big and comfy Staircase and building are beautiful I would recommend it to a friend because it s really convenient 
320544,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Tired dark bedroom with chipped furniture Nothing special at all Also check in staff could not be bothered to book me a table for pre dinner drinks and had to do this myself , Great building
320545,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Our preorders were not present so had to chase for so by the time they arrived it was a little too late Also had to ask a number of times for coffee at breakfast , The hotel was a stunning building with massive amounts of character Loved the little touch of Cookies and Milk upon arrival Bath Ritual was also very nice Breakfast was also better than I expected as there were warm options available in the Club Lounge 
320546,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, A room with a better view would have been nice but we never requested one so probably our own fault, The breakfast set up we thought was excellent With plenty of choice all was made and cooked brilliantly 
320547,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Food very expensive Although lovely Room service not value for money very expensive for what you get, Service excellent Location excellent Ambience excellent Loved it
320548,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nothing everything was brilliant , Absolutely everything Architecture Spacious Victorian room helpful friendly staff gorgeous spa calm atmosphere of Chambers Club
320549,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Staff surly and rude Different departments wouldn t speak to each other causing delays and poor service Spa staff rude and discourteous, Location
320550,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Paying 15 for a rented film is ridiculous especially when I could not get the film in English Some members of the staff are very rude and arrogant Marcin jeruzal was very helpful All in all I would not stay here again I stay in a lot of hotels in London and I must say this is one of my worst experiences , The building is beautiful 
320551,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Coffee at breakfast tasted stale and no top up was offered and it has proved difficult to get a VAT receipt otherwise nothing it is a fine hotel , Everything was as it should be A very enjoyable stay 
320552,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Wasn t made aware that ordering breakfast in bed was an additional charge when I already had breakfast included in the room price , Staff were all amazing and very helpful Good size rooms nothing exceptional but nice and clean Foyer lovely and nice decor 
320553,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, having a charge for the Internet in the room when we paid 300 for the room Just hassle to pay for it and for 4 could they not just include it The bill said the full rate was 600 I wouldn t expect to pay extra for internet if I had paid that The worst thing though was that we called operator to ask if we had breakfast included in our rate and they said no On our way out the lady running breakfast asked if we were joining so we asked her to check again and she found we had paid and were on her list If we hadn t asked again we would have gone out for breakfast and missed our included one That was really sloppy of them and annoying , At check in although we were early they found a different room we could check in at 1 30 pm albeit with two beds not the one we had asked for 
320554,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Our room was as far away as you can get and when we arrived there the key didn t work Neither did the hallway phone to call down to reception Breakfast items VERY expensive even for London 4 for a pain au chocolat and there was no free wifi in the bedrooms even though it was free in the public areas , Room was nice and quiet and the bed was extremely comfy The staff were really helpful 
320555,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I booked for a guest and I wanted to pay for him I found it absurd that the hotel did not accept to process my payment by phone and asked me to go there in person or to send a fax There are not so many fax machines these days so I had to go in person and waste a long time in commuting ,No Positive
320556,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Charge for wifi that is then automatically removed from bill because they know it s ridiculous and long check out time only 4 desks , Excellent location Friendly attentive staff Great bars and spa Stunning decor 
320557,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Room over looked roof of station room 420 which we were told when booking in offered upgrade for extra 150 with afternoon tea thrown in which l declined Also continental breakfast at 26 per person very expensive, Good location clean room
320558,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, It is unacceptable to charge for Wifi in a hotel when charged 350 per night for a room It is simply ridiculous , Location and beautiful period features
320559,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, For the price some kind of breakfast ought to be included or some fruit more refreshments in the room that don t have to be paid for The pillows weren t very comfortable it would have been nice to have had a choice with some firmer ones , The room was clean and well appointed although I would have chosen slightly more colourful decor The staff were very nice 
320560,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, breakfast buffet a bit dried out electric iron flex damaged hadnt been safety tested for 2 years blackout rollerblind not fitting so not blackout Booking Hall restaurant very noisy, location and staff and decor and ambience excellent 
320561,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The fact we saw a mouse in the bar eating area the breakfast wasn t good stood for ages waiting for them to put fresh sausages and bacon out told the staff and was still waiting didnt acknowledge that the queue was long due to waiting for more food to be served was only scrambled egg no other choice need more toasters for customers and took too long to toast fresh glasses for cold drinks had to ask staff twice before someone put new ones there wasnt on the ball when the food was low to top it back up , The room was lovely the reception staff were nice and helpful the hotel was nice
320562,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No free wifi in room Ridiculous in this day and age Long dark hair in bath tub Poor shampoo etc and only one bar if soap for basin and bath Awful colours in bedroom greens and beige Fridge with do not move items or you ll pay regardless of not drinking them No complimentary water 4 a tiny bottle, Welcoming receptionist Large bedroom Quiet Easy inside access from hotel into St Pancras train station Very soft bathrobe
320563,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Unfortunately we were told at check in that the room came with a bath so were then slightly disappointed where there wasn t one The slice of almond tart left for my wife was somewhat dried out by the time we arrived in our room we had indicated on booking that we would be arriving late evening A little cling film could perhaps have helped , Location at St Pancras perfect for early Eurostar departure Comfortable bed Left a slice of cake as a Happy Birthday surprise for my wife which was a nice touch 
320564,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Not always somewhere to sit and have a drink Gilbert Restaurant very fast serving therefore not very relaxing But food and service excellent just need to slow down a bit felt like there wanted the table back , Beds very comfy people all excellent 
320565,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Hot food food served on cold plates in the Booking Office restaurant , Everything was as you expect from a hotel of this standard and the history of the actual building 
320566,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I was very disappointed with our room I booked this hotel as I loved the old building and the rooms on the website were all beautiful however we were in a standard bedroom that to me was very similar to a premier inn room but with different colours and a mini bar which was very expensive When we called down to reception to query this the lady said that only the suites are located in the old part of the hotel what a shame if I had known this I would not have booked this hotel especially as it was for my husbands birthday We were also disappointed by the spa one small plunge pool and one steam room with 2 separate saunas not at all how the pictures on the website look , The booking station was fantastic the breakfast was delicious and staff were really friendly I loved the reception area and the front of the hotel 
320567,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, We celebrated our Golden Wedding Anniversary on 2 April and decided to treat ourselves to a break in London We were delighted with our choice of your hotel which proved to be excellent Thank all the staff for their help when it was needed Regards Valerie Martin
320568,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No free WiFi hard to believe The mini bar is locked means it could be difficult to access the fridge The interior decor comparing to the architecture itself is a little bit disappointed , The architecture is fabulous the staff are nice 
320569,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Check in Shower over bath dangerous for older people like me Having to reserve a table in the bar for a drink Buffet breakfast was only OK, The restaurant Gilbert
320570,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Bed and pillows excellent Staff had made a note at the end of previous stay that we would prefer a quiet room This happened and we were also upgraded as they didn t have a didn t have a room available at the level of our original booking
320571,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I found the consierge not very well informed about several art exhibits I wanted to see and not too eager to inform himself or me , The staff in gereral were smiling and happy to help In particular the reception staff at check in and check out were very nice The King s Cross location is wonderful if you are getting the Eurostar to Paris You just walk thru to the station Also direct access to several tube lines and trains to other destination in England 
320572,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We asked for a bed for our son via the booking notes but they had not put one in it was sorted out very quickly to their credit I know it is convenient but 250 per night for a room just seems a lot of money to me , Just so convenient for Eurostar and although we did not have breakfast at the hotel as we checked out very early good old Costa Coffee is open 24 7 Wow what an amazing building stunning grade 1 listed so allow some time to just appreciate its beauty 
320573,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The windows didn t open lock so fresh air could not come into the room The sink tap was difficult to open and close has was the bath tap Could do with an extra cup to put teabags in and more milk preferably in fridge has we in the end bought our own has the milk provided was off , I liked that the hotel had good security measures so I could feel relaxed in my room The room was very clean and had home comforts 
320574,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Sadly we were not booked into the historic part but into the modern block which could be any international hotel anywhere We were told we were being upgraded but still had separate beds when we had asked for a double There was no green tea no biscuits supplied which should be standard for a hotel like this The shower was dreadful in a bath which for our mobility issues we had asked for a separate shower You had to stand on the bath plug to be under the shower Overall not good value for money , The location was excellent right next to Eurostar which was what we wanted The hotel had history and historic features which we appreciated 
320575,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, To check the Wi Fi charges you have to connect to the network which itself incurred the Wi Fi use charge It was no hassle to have this cancelled at reception however but make sure to check your bill , The sheer number of staff available and willing to help at all times was phenomenal and the free room upgrade was an unexpected but well received bonus The location of the hotel is second to none especially as we were travelling out from Kings Cross in the morning The breakfast options were superb The room itself was very well kept and we had a well deserved relaxing night 
320576,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Service is good but they do charge you for everything including internal calls to order a 37 burger and chips It was interesting but not excellent , Location great however wanted a spa hotel and got a hotel with the spa hence spa is OK not excellent 
320577,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Breakfast left something to be desired We like hot coffee not luke warm plates not very hot in one case cold and don t like overcooked and streaky bacon Need to sort out ordered items like fried eggs so that they arrive quickly and thus arev eaten at the same time as things from the buffet Why do the eggs come in twos We have previously stayed at the St Pancras Premier Inn at half the price where the breakfast was better dinner was good and the room equally as comfortable, Location friendliness of staff decor of old part of hotel and overall comfort good selection of hot and cold breakfast items
320578,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The only thing I wasn t impressed with was the size of the window in our room it was tiny and as a result it felt too dark Also some of the furnishings were visibly tired , The location is excellent for exploring London And the hotel itself is stunning 
320579,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Mentioned it was a celebration weekend for a 50th birthday when booking but no little extra Would have been nice to have had a treat as two couples staying for two nights and ate at the Gilbert Scott on one evening , Breakfast was great huge selection Room spacious and comfortable 
320580,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nothing, We stayed the night en route to the Eurostar Perfect location for this Pricey but luxurious hotel Friendly helpful staff Really comfortable bed 
320581,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We thought use of spa would be included in price of room When I telephoned to confirm booking and check whether we could use spa no price was mentioned , Comfortable pillows
320582,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The noise in the public rooms not including the Lounge and the lack of clocks in those rooms The difficulty in getting there without walking except by expensive taxi The Booking hall was too noisy to have supper in as it was combined with the bar no other option, The staff were outstanding in all respects breakfast was excellent as was the cleanliness 
320583,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The window didn t open and the room was hot and stuffy the air con coolest was 24 degrees The rooms in the Barlow wing were quite small and not worthy of 5 star rating Expensive for a four star , Comfortable bed clean room
320584,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Temperature in room was not easy to control most of the time room was too hot with noway to turn off heating , Very comfortable bed with feather pillows
320585,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I didn t think there was much difference between a Junior Suite where my daughter was staying and the Superior Room I wouldn t want to pay for a Junior Suite in future , Being able to check in early Friendly and very helpful staff

320588,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, To get to the bedrooms you have to pass the staff entrance to the kitchen Based on the language being used and at high volume Gordon Ramsey was working that night In the bedroom all was good Unfortunately in the bathroom water would not drain from the handbasin due to a build up of hair and gunk in the plug hole had to clean it and the rain shower head in the ceiling shower was almost completely block with calc build up had to clean it Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel with matching prices , Excellent location for business in the KGX area and connections to City of London as well as to other southern UK business towns Cambridge Stevenage etc by train

320593,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, If I was going to be picky I d say that The Queen Superior room interms of decor lacked some what although comfortable and some lovely design pieces overall felt a bit drab in comparison to the building itself with a tiny window and magnolia walls Minor though the hotel completely won me over , The building and architecture was truly out of this world The grand staircase and high ceilings all adding to the mystique The breakfast room took my breath away and the Spa was the perfect addition 
320594,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Checkin checkout staff 200 added to bill when checking in and not explained Terrible lack of storage in bedroom Nowhere to hang overcoats Uncomfortable chair Not offered a room with shower Bath with shower over not very good and very old fashioned , Breakfasts Staff Ambience Location Very quiet room

320597,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Poor access to EuroStar checking as the lift in St Pancras was out of service not a fault of the hotel but when assistance was requested to lug our baggage down stairs the response was not too good , Location as we were leaving the next day on EuroStar

320604,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Overpriced for what you get From the outside it looks amazing the room however is dated and basic Small bathroom one piece of cotton wool available in the toiletry set The room nothing special at all There were no speakers provided which you get at the basic of hotels and the view was horrendous 349 to stare out at a brick roof The drink options for tea and coffee were horrendous Nothing special whatsoever The wifi is advertised as free however upon arrival I m told it has a charge unless you become a Marriott rewards customers Isn t that false advertising How this hotel can be classed as a 5 hotel I don t know All I can say is don t be fooled by the amazing exterior and beautiful downstairs It s a basic hotel and I feel you get more from a room at a travelodge Disappointment doesn t cover it , The staff however were very polite friendly and extremely helpful Room service was extremely quick and the food was nice Also very beautiful hotel on the outside 
320605,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I would say a little dark the lighting in the rooms are not great but thats if i have to say something but DO NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF, Great Location and a great deal of choice whne picking somewhere to eat and drink Taxi ready out the front if required Staff fantastic

320611,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, This beautiful hotel is let down by the staff We were in one of the Junior Chambers suites which are beautiful however on Saturday night there was a wedding in the ballroom directly below our room I rang at about 11pm to ask how long it would go on for as you could hear loud music and feel heavy bass in our room I was told that it would go until midnight and that they would do the best to try and get it turned down a little The noise and vibrations did not go down but did cease at midnight Upon check out the next morning I raised this as an issue after being asked the obligatory how was your stay question and I provided the feedback that perhaps next time if they are aware there is an event then they should warn the guests in around that room The response I received was quite offensive I was told that they had ensured their regular guests would not be affected by the noise however they were booked out so as a result we were stuck with a very noisy room because we were not a regular guest Feedback to this staff member don t be so quick to judge a person for only staying one night in your hotel they may have been looking for a hotel for business use regular stay Management should certainly consider giving this staff member some training on how to treat guests at a five star hotel british woman with long dark hair , The building is amazing as are the rooms 
320612,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The only thing I can complain about is the fact there were not decent e g quorn veggie sauages at breakfast , The breakfast was out of this world and really good value 35 per couple Lovely room Great facilities Friendly staff All round amazing experience 
320613,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Not very good value for money Shower fittings damaged rooms not what I would call renaissance Food from room service left a lot to be desired , Beautiful hotel reception bar and spa facilities
320614,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, You book the hotel for its 19th century ambiance but most of the rooms are in a featureless modern wing Perfectly acceptable but not quite what one expects, Overall quality very good 
320615,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Stunning building and the spa was a delight and felt really luxurious The service in the bar restaurant was exceptional accommodating efficient and personable in beautiful surroundings The food was delicious as was the room service breakfast the following morning Highly recommend we didn t want to leave

320617,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, A little run down Members club breakfast very basic Not really to a club standard Complementary drinks only serverd 5 30 to 7 30 Stayed in the sir Benjamin Britten suite Attention to detail with fixtures and fitting could of been better Example turn on the sink tap and water spurts out of the sink , Nothing
320618,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Too dark in the Gilbert Scott resturant which made it very difficult to read the menu and wine list Similarly in the Booking Hall resturant but there was a light on the table , Superb room and we like the hotel for its location for the buses and the rail connections 
320619,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The late check in We was told it was 4 00pm and we would need to wait until our room was ready It wouldn t have been an issue however we had a show booking and we wanted to get ready in the room We was offered a room upgrade for 140 which I swallowed just so it wouldn t spoil by wife s 40th bday celebration , Lovely hotel 
320620,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Excellent location for connections from St Pancras Stations particularly on the Eurostar I always use this hotel when connecting to the Eurostar to Paris or Brussels It is certainly not cheap but well worth the price for the convenience and the quality of service 
320621,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Being restricted to a certain time limit in bar area and being is turned by knock on door asking why we hadn t checked out when we had Late Checkout arranged with our booking, You provided a birthday card and cake for my then fiance

320624,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nothing not to like this hotel and the staff are perfect in every way, The hotel is situated in a very beautiful building and is perfect for kingscross station and many landmarks I stayed in a Grand junior suite with lounge access Which was the most beautiful room I have ever stayed in Huge room and large bed which was extremely comfortable Huge bathroom with everything u need Lots of sofas and an office area All little luxuries included I could see the Euro star trains from my lounge window the booking office restaurant from another lounge window The grand staircase is so beautiful no pictures can do it justice The whole building is clean and tidy The staff were more than welcoming and helpful in fact they could not do enough for you The food was delicious and in the chambers suite everything was complimentary including alcohol during certain hours in the evening The chamber suite was peaceful with lovely serving staff who made u feel very welcome There are spa facilities which include a swimming pool sauna and steam room of which are all clean and tidy and very relaxing area Checking out was just as easy as checking in As I checked in before I could even say hello the staff had taken my luggage from myself and my friend and took it to my suite Everything about this hotel is perfect I will tell everyone I know to come here if they stay in London and I will 100 be staying here again many more times in the future My room was a Grand Junior Suite with lounge access room number 167 I suggest this is where you stay if u go to this hotel you will not be disappointed 
320625,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We booked a junior suite The room was not a junior suite in my opinion , The Club Room was very good The staff were very helpful Ideally situated for a trip the following day on Eurostar 
320626,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Had dirty sheets that weren t rectified despite complaining Requested early check in online as we were travelling with small children Got mixed advice Was told to call in at 6am the am of the day of arrival Called and was told that nothing could be promised Early check in eventually happened 15 mins before actual booking time No changing facilities for baby out of room No help with doors while struggling with luggage pram and children , Location Breakfast hours were long helpful for families
320627,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Room was comfortable enough but rather dull and lacking some touches to make it really special, Wonderful restoration of a magnificent London building
320628,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, It is not 5 star only just 4 The Butler promised didn t materialise room service was slow the Chambers Lounge is somewhere between a British Rail lounge and a second rate airport business class facility Paintings chosen for the suite were absolutely appalling and the Lillies chosen to refresh the the room were the type you get from Tesco As I said not even close to 5 stars The staff try hard but unfortunately I don t believe they know what 5 star looks like The whole experience is in another and inferior league Given the price tag this was a highly unsatisfactory choice , The staircase
320629,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Occasional traffic noises heard in the room The hotel had the air of waiting to go somewhere else even the private lounge was a bit airport lounge so they need to make more of a building which makes all other hotels look plain and add a more cosy lounge area with fire places cream teas etc or something , Beautiful room and hotel club lounge area had good free food and drinks Superb service to help with boarding the Eurostar getting past huge queues and loading luggage directly onto train The grand staircase is just astonishing to gape at Wellness area is lovely 
320630,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We were really disappointed as on our second night in the middle of the night our air conditioner unit broke and water started leaking through the ceiling There was so much water we didn t know if it was the people above us or where all the water was coming from In the middle of the night and from a dead sleep we called the staff to come up They came up and we were very cool about it and told them they could come back in the morning We helped them put towels on the floor didn t demand to be moved and gave them full access to our room both that night and then the next day The next day I was just shocked that the hotel didn t acknowledge what had happened didn t thank us for our understanding and even though we were woken up from a dead sleep they pretty much acted as thought nothing happened I then told a manager when we checked out a few days later I was surprised such a luxurious hotel had Such a huge customer service miss He agreed and said he would get back to me with a follow up about my experience never heard from them Just surprised that such a classy establishment didn t acknowledge a more than less ideal situation is anyway Not even a hope everything is ok today , The location is incredible it is a very grand hotel New updated and perfect for a young couple we traveled with my parents and they loved just as much Great for every crowd 
320631,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The noisy Extractor Fan in the Bathroom which could still be heard ALL NIGHT even when I closed the door It kept me awake all night , The location close to St Pancras Station
320632,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Welcome from the staff Being greeted by staff passing me in corridors etc comfort of the room The staff seemed both at ease and willing to give me an experience of being cared for in a special way but not subservient 
320633,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Rooms are not as expect in this hotel dark with often small windows no view and very little light Looked at 3 rooms before being satisfied but still not what I was expecting , Communal areas friendly staff
320634,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The accommodation is accessed down a corridor past the kitchens which smelt of old fat every time of day unacceptable in a five star hotel also paying a service charge and then onother pound or two on top of that for everything including coffee is taking the mick, The main building is fabulous particularly the main staircase 
320635,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The Chambers Suite was absolutely amazing Staff were always ready to help and the food was fantastic The only negative for us is that we couldn t stay longer Absolutely faultless 
320636,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The room allocated in the Barlow Wing did not have any mobile reception When this was reported at the time an apology was received but nothing else The room did have a window but it faced the wall of St Pancras station Overall poor value for money and customer service based on the rate paid This was reported to the Senior Sales Manager the next day who made a note of the above and advised that the better rooms face the British Library No refund or part refund received but a note made on file and the intention to arrange for improved mobile reception ,No Positive
320637,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The leisure club is great pool steam and sauna good The check in was very friendly a porter took me to the leisure club lift and was most helpful 
320638,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, i was fully aware of the room rate but considered it worth it for a special treat for my 7 year old grandson for a pre Christmas weekend treat However i took great exception at being charged 76 for the two of us for a cooked breakfast which to be honest wasn t that great hot so much so that i decide to discuss with the duty manager which resulted in further disappointment he was Very nonchalant with his couldn t care less attitude honestly speaking this is not a 5 star hotel other than the prices they charge the room was very standard not what you would expect for almost 300 per night the room was not that clean the carpets were heavily soiled even more so in the corridor there are far better hotels close by offering far better value service but i was offered an up grade for an extra 160 now kind of them LOL also a little surprised at checkout to find they had already taken payment on check in would have been nice for them to have informed me not really 5 star Standard practice all in all price isn t the issue so long as the so long as they deliver the expectation Which they certainly didn t on this occasion , the architecture is superb but unfortunately that doesn t make a hotel the rooms are very bog standard and not that clean 
320639,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The breakfast choices were very limited to a hotel of this standards This was compromised by staff who were very slow, The building is great furnished in extreme taste
320640,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The Booking Office was not available to guests as it was taken for an office party The dining room was fully booked until too late for us If you are charging such a lot of money for facilities the guests can rightly expect to be able to use them Not so with us TWICE now morning paper requested did not arrive Bathrobes do not absorb water please try them , see above
320641,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Do not touch anything in the mini bar as you will be charged if you move the bottles Also the Express Checkout is not advisable as they charged my card for things that I had not had , Fantastic luxury hotel a great atmosphere 
320642,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, All in all it was a lovely hotel A bit pricey but then you would expect that for a top London hotel , Stayed at hotel to celebrate a special occasion Facilities excellent but also convenient for Eurostar 
320643,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, It was my partners birthday and they baked her a cake Completely unexpectedly and absolutely delicious The best hotel experience I have ever experienced 
320644,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The hotel is ungenerous in its approach One bottle of water in a room for two people Charge for wifi Most hotels include it Poor show Everything is extra the hotel is already very expensive We travel the world and know that generosity pays Also we were not told the Booking Office was going to be out of action for an office party so we cd not use it We had to have a drink in an over crowded foyer We were not able to dine in the restaurant when we wanted because it was already booked Surely guests sh take priority We return to the hotel on the 11th of December off Eurostar from Paris We do hope we will have two or more bottles of water in our room and that the newspaper will be delivered free of charge ,No Positive
320645,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We thought it was pricey very pricey for a weekend but we did know that , The luxurious beds The fabulous restoration of the property is a joy to behold especially the fine staircase and public rooms
320646,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, A very minor thing That the extractor in the bathroom of our room didn t work so the mirrors were too steamed up after a shower to do makeup etc Only a minor thing , I loved everything about this hotel The building is so grand that it gives a real sense of occasion and yet it is cosy comfortable and welcoming The staff are so helpful and friendly I just loved it all and want to go back now 
320647,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We felt the rooms in the modern wing could benefit from a little more attention , The hotel is houses in a really impressive historie building The restaurants are very good 
320648,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The friendly efficiency with which all the staff went about attending to our every need The incredible amount of work that has gone into restoring such an historic building which has resulted in a masterpiece of a modern hotel 
320649,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Nobody could explain why the room rate changed whilst we were there , Great Service Liked the lounge where you can retreat to out of the madding crowd 
320650,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We were very disappointed with the standard of our room Very similar to a Premier Inn room and the tea and coffee situation was a disgrace very few teas or coffees no biscuits all very penny pinching when we have paid a great deal for the room The ancient TV was most unimpressive too , The amazing building wowed us every time we went in or out Just fabulous Victoriana at its best 
320651,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, It s a pity that they don t offer free wifi , Spectacular restored Victorian hotel with a huge number of staff Everyone very professional and helpful The location is exceptional right next to St Pancras Station with Bloomsbury just ten minutes away and some cool developments just behind the station We really think they have got everything right here 
320652,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I am sure no one could find a fault with this hotel, The staff 1st class from checking in the concierge efficient with a smile housekeeping turn down service chocolates in room cleaniness first class The Chambers Club Anka William The chefs nothing is to much trouble even when the team are busy professional efficient and always smiling 
320653,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Food and drink is very expensive and only of average quality Room service charge is steep but staff are efficient and friendly , The Gilbert Scott Building for its sheer Victorian architectural grandeur 
320654,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, From start to finish the staff were very friendly and helpful and took a real pride in their hotel At weekends there is a really interesting tour of the hotel where you can find out the history of the hotel and station This is free for residents Our room was a good size and very quiet and very comfortable A great start to a journey using Eurostar 
320655,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, the only things I did not like it I saw a mouse in their restaurant I inform the employee about it he told me because their location next to the train station so its happened its seems for him normal issue , nice room nice shopping area around it nice food 
320656,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Service bags not taken to our room as promised Breakfast ok but a few issues hot food only warm had run out of brown bread No gluten free bread for my companion, The building is beautiful being so well restored
320657,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, WiFi was not available and for those room prices WiFi should be free for people staying I can t believe you charge for WiFi Its almost laughable Sort it out it leaves a sour taste after a good experience In fact I m going to reduce my overall experience rating due to this , The tour was a good touch the guy who took us round was brilliant Staff were friendly and helpful
320658,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Superb architecture and very comfortable Very attentive and helpful staff Excellent meal in the Gilbert Scott restaurant Not cheap but worth it for a special occasion 
320659,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, That our room wasn t in the grand old renovated buildings It was in a new wing which wasn t clear when we booked online The newish wing could have been any old hotel really, The grand old buildings
320660,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, the view from the room was uninspiring, the iconic nature of the property the helpfulness of the staff the centrality and the quality of the breakfast 
320661,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No instructions in room to help with TV coffee machine or control of lights Even with all the various lights switched on the overall light level in room was still quite low , Everything was done to make our stay as enjoyable as possible An excellent choice for a special celebration 
320662,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Room was set out as if for single occupancy only one comfortable chair The supplied hot drinks were similar to a Travelodge just two sachets of cheap Kenco coffee The public rooms on s Friday night chased us away to eat elsewhere no guest support , The breakfast was superb The reception ambience was good
320663,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Shower poor over bath shower expected something more modern and of higher quality Very over priced for facilities received Will stay elsewhere on next trip , Location Eurostar 
320664,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, really disappointed that room was in Barlow House my reservation didn t indicate that it would be in a modern room I felt the price indicated it would be in one of the old restored rooms and what we had didn t justify the cost Think perhaps you should tell people where the room might be , comfort ease of nearness to Eurostar eating in beautifully restored restaurant
320665,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, 7th floor Barlow rooms have the tiniest windows and no views making quite a nice room like a cell and the staff wouldn t change us to something better Beware , Wonderfull environment and great location for getting around easily on the underground and regional railways including Eurail
320666,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, High prices especially mini bar 45 for half a bottle of pink champagne Breakfast was confusing i waited to be served than helped myself then had to order eggs which came after i had finished the rest of my English breakfast Don t get it self service or not , The atmosphere retained of the original building grace space and lack of pace Wonderful location in a buzzing area next to the British Library car parking outside the congestion zone if pricey I used to visit the building in the 1970 s on business 3 times a year for 8 years so its great to see it retained saved from demolition and full of travellers Very friendly staff 
320667,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Unfortunately all of the magic of our previous stay here was taken away this time The hotel was much busier and the check in staff unhelpful and actually rude almost degrading At no stage do I expect to feel unworthy in a hotel that I have chosen above all others because of previous experience Our bags were taken after struggling up the steps and through the doors only well inside the lobby They were placed on to an unattended luggage trolley and we then had to queue in order to check with the concierge that they would be sent directly to the room and the room number wasn t even known A serious of errors occurred after this initial experience that I m sure wouldn t have been noticeable had I not been left with such a sour feeling after check in , Amazing hotel and bar beautiful perfect location
320668,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The bedroom was functional but characterless, Lively bar Excellent breakfast Interesting architecture Easy access to St Pancras and Kings Cross stations 
320669,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Expensive room with view only of slate roof over St Pancras station we should have been warned of this prior to booking The hotel staff didn t make us feel special they seemed more caught up in being staff of a prestigious hotel, Hotel s position
320670,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The bed was a bit firm and pillows lumpy and uncomfortable, Amazing building and exquisite decor Also loved the concierge seeing us safely on Eurostar and bipassing the queue 
320671,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, My room quiet was the euphemism I believe used had the view of a brick wall I had to take my own luggage to the room myself On arrival no mention of facilities available at this supposed 5 star hotel , The meal I had at Gilbert Scott s was excellent Staff in restaraunt were what I expect from 5star service 
320672,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The room configuration was odd it was supposed to be a suite but was just one room and the sitting room part was in from of the bed and looked directly at the cupboard housing the aircon The bathroom was small and had no bath and the the shower sprayed directly onto the floor and the bottom of the bathroom door which was rotten and this room was really not to the standard I expected from a Marriott, The staff were very professional
320673,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The shower head had weak pressure although it did work , Good hotel clean and new good gym and fantastic breakfast Very convenient location at St Pancrass station 
320674,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Very expensive for an average room with smelly drains in the bathroom Very long check in and felt unwelcomed and unexpected , Spa and some members of staff
320675,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Room 2nd night quite small no room for bedside table one side of bed so water and tea had to go on floor , Staff excellent very friendly and professional
320676,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Hotel was lovely bonus was that we could use the spa facilities for free Location was ideal for what we wanted Rooms clean big and the beds were amazing Overall we had a fab stay and will definitely look to stay again
320677,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The standard of room was very underwhelming when compared to the standard of the communal areas , Brilliant bar and restaurant very convenient location
320678,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Checking in was slightly awkward It wasn t mentioned when I booked my room online that an upfront payment and 100 deposit was required upon check in However as an apology I had a free upgrade to The Haywood suite one of the best suites in the hotel , My suite was amazing Completely exceeded my expectations I would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel to others 
320679,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Spa area was really nice but not for swimming with a child as it was quite dark and erie Wifi should be free to guests, Staff couldn t do enough Lovely gifts in the room for my little girl Breakfast was amazing Great access to the train station
320680,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, Beautiful surroundings fabulouse food in the gilbert restaurant spacious rooms and very friendly staff As we are over 70 this was all very much appreciated before our journey 
320681,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, nothing really perhaps the charge for WI Fi in the room but free in the public rooms, I really liked the attentive staff the concierge who wears a bowler hat and hails you a taxi the very attentive staff the food the history of the building the sports channels on the TV the lady playing the harp taking your luggage up to your room The breakfast in Bed experience with beautifull linen and fresh squeezed orange juice and all the little touches that make it a truly 5 star experience 
320682,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Bathroom basin blocked and would not drain A C unit also blocked and temperature could not be changed VERY helpful member of maintenance staff Pietr attended and rectified all credit to him please but situation should not have existed Tissue box also empty Replaced For 299 a night this was unacceptable , Location 
320683,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Giving the quality of everything else the breakfast wasn t up to standard The bread was stale and the bacon was too hard to even cut , The hotel was absolutely beautiful and the staff were friendly and attentive 
320684,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, we wre given a disabled room 1st night but were moved to a room overlooking eurostar and platform 2nd night which was superb , the ambience is excellent food tromendous champagne the best Railway stations as they should be luxurio
320685,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, For travelling on the Eurostar the next day this was the best possible place we could have stayed Loved the vip concierge service escorting us and our bags though security and right onto the train saved so much time Fantastic to stay in this iconic building 
320686,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,No Negative, The staff were wonderful could not fault them from checking in to checking out The restaurant was 1st class excellent service very attentive without being obtrusive 
320687,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Swimming times for children fridge space, The staff were welcoming and helpful we loved the cucumber water stunning historic interior central location and close to underground
320688,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Very noisy in the Boarding Office for drinks and quite pricy And the bathtub shower in our room should have a ladder for entry and exit , Great location at St Pancras on the edge of Bloomsbury and not far from Soho and other great areas to which we walked Very comfortable bed and room quiet hotel stylish great public spaces 
320689,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The 7 50 minimum charge for Wi Fi 50 for parking The non English speaking doorman who did not understand the word car Started by charging 100 above the booking com price Customer relations is a low priority , The room was well designed and comfortable 
320690,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The room was expensive and not value for money at all We had a twin bedded room as there were no doubles available but although the bed was very comfortable the room Itself as not up to the standard of such an expensive room , Hotel magnificent and a joy to be in Booking office bar really atmospheric with a real buzz about it 
320691,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I didn t want to leave we had to leave at 5 30 am as we were travelling on eurostar and I would have loved to indulged myself for the rest of the day eating lunch dinner and re visiting the magnificent relaxing spa , The welcome we recieved was excellent staff were attentive smiley and efficient All members of staff were very proud of the hotel as I walked through the corridors staff told me to look at the magnificent stair case and decor The building is amazing beautiful and a quote from the book in our room on renovation of the hotel stated This railway station and hotels past was going to be its future A sentiment that I believe would really get people thinking before demolishing fantastic architecture from the past 
320692,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, A little farther to get to the main part of London , Love the Architecture the history of the building the staff and the food and wine The staff was very helpful and friendly 
320693,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Total mix up with our room uncomfortable beds poor quality towels sloppy housekeeping and some quite rude staff on the end of the telephone , The renovation of the hotel is beautifully done a shame more thought wasn t given to the actual guest quarters 
320694,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, The fact that I had booked a suite and was shown to a large bedroom instead but that was being sold to me as a suite was very disappointing room 256 I think Plus it was a view on the road when I had the feeling from the photos on my booking that I was getting a view on the platforms in a gorgeous suite This one was bland and noisy so I asked if there was any suite available that was looking onto the platforms So I was shown room 167 which IS a suite i e there was a sofa and a coffee table too and some space It is a very nice suite with some character and it was very quiet although I was told it would be noisy because of the live music in the Booking Office restaurant It was a far better looking room and at least I knew the music would stop at some point The traffic outside doesn t really And although I had to pay another 35 for moving rooms it was worth it The other bad thing was that in the first and cheaper suite there were large complimentary 1L bottles of water on each bedside table and some welcome truffles Between moving rooms I went to the lounge to have a coffee and when I got into the suite room 167 40mins later there was no water or truffles and my luggage still hadn t been moved I thought I had given them plenty of time to do that so I called to ask about luggage water and truffles my luggage came within 10 minutes but no water After 2 calls and being finally given two 330ml little bottles of water I called again to get the same size bottles please as in the former cheaper room The girl said she would investigate but I never heard of her again and no bigger bottle was ever delivered We like to drink a lot of water at night and it was ridiculous to get those tiny 330ml bottles in a suite But I had to give up asking it was just ridiculous We are returning customers and I would have thought it was quite an easy task to go into the other room grab the 2 bottles of water and bring it to us , The overall look of the communal areas very nice The private lounge where you get all day complimentary food and drink lovely Makes you feel special Very nice breakfast too 
320695,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Bed was terrible as was the size of the room Room was like being in a Travel Lodge with cheap furniture and dreadful small towels in the bathroom Bathrobes were riddled with holes Room 705 706 were the same and have no view whatsoever Stained carpets Guests have to pay for WiFi in the rooms but anyone can access from the lounge restaurant Money clearly spent elsewhere in this hotel , Liked the lobby lounge and restaurant Staff very pleasant 
320696,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Our stay wasn t long enough , The staff were very friendly which is rare these days and as we were travelling on to Disneyland Paris the next day it certainly enhanced our holiday many of the staff asked us about our trip which was very nice of them 
320697,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, There is absolutely nothing not to like , This is my favourite London hotel Great character and charm and its exterior architecture and interior features makes you feel like you are stepping back in time to an elegant era I didn t want to leave I can t wait to return The staff are friendly and courteous Nothing is too much trouble 
320698,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, No free wifi Can t think of many hotels that don t provide it for free , Hotel provided baby toiletries and activity pack for little ones Breakfast was gorgeous 
320699,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Very small niggles Being vegetarian there was a limited choice at breakfast as the mushrooms were tinned awful for a good hotel and the only eggs available were scrambled until I asked and then was provided with vegetarian sausages and poached eggs which took so long my husband had finished his before I got mine I might as well have just stuck with the hash browns as the sausages were pretty much the same but a different shape Other than that a carton of milk in the mini bar would have been better than the 4 silly little milks supplied in the room 3 needed to make 2 cups of tea It also was disappointing not to be able to see the fabulous decoration of the hotel We only found out about the guided tour at weekends upon leaving Maybe it should be mentioned to guests arriving for the weekend , The staff were all very helpful and friendly and the general feel of the hotel was efficient and clean but also had a good buzzy atmosphere The room had everything needed and was very clean and comfortable 
320700,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Doesn t warrant the inflated tariff huge deposit required without prior discussion so be prepared Very unpleasant odour down the long tiled hallway towards Barlow rooms plus you go past at least two service areas , Location great wifi good toiletries comfortable bed

320704,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Breakfast was very good but there should have been more gluten free food e g sausages and potatos should be available gluten free free wifi should be standard aal over hotel, atmosphere decor scent We give 10 points to Restaurant Gilbert Scott because of great british food and excellent service and we could get good gluten free bread and food also 
320705,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Free wifi only for guests booking direct with the hotel not via booking sites No guest lounge so you have to sit in reception or at cafe tables with a minimum spend of 12 50 per head during the day , Great rooms stunning architecture 
320706,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, We found cockroaches in our room and on one night the room was not completely tidied up This is so disappointing for a 5 star hotel We lodge a complaint and were given a discount on the night where the room was not tidied There were also alot of inconsistency on the feedback the staff provided us when we called guest services as toiletries and water were provided on some days and others not Overall an utterly disappointing stay , The location was very convenient as its above both Kings Cross and St Pancreas station 
320707,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, I found the rooms overpriced Windows don t open small room with no view Looks very enclosed , Like the setting restaurant bar very good service 
320708,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Very expensive considering no breakfast and they took another 100 deposit on arrival Mini bar very expensive Generally just not value or money , The location
320709,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Excellent city centre hotel but very expensive for the ordinary traveller , Quality of room and fittings Exceptionally well appointed hotel Walk out of the door and you are on time for departure 
320710,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, Shortly after we had checked out we returned to the hotel to pick up our bags As we had a short wait for our train we decided to sit in the lounge and have a coffee only to find it was a minimum 12 50 spend per person , Very friendly staff throughout our stay When the Booking Office was full at Breakfast we quickly got moved to the executive lounge and ate there 
320711,St Pancras Renaissance Hotel London, wish we could have afforded the delicious looking breakfast and more than one glass of lovely wine , wonderful luxurious hotel spa and with staff on hand who are friendly and even when meeting you in the corridor extend welcome Amazing
