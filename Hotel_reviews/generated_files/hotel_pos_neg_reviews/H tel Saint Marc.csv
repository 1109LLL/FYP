163269,H tel Saint Marc,No Negative, Excellent location and the hotel is perfect for business trips it s fresh comfortable quiet great bathroom amenities everything feels just right The staff are all very helpful friendly and professional The area is central vibrant lots of great dining options Absolutely to come back 
163270,H tel Saint Marc,No Negative, I had a few extra requests like rose petal flowers bottle of champagne in the room and they could provide them all without any problems Every question I had for traffic or other things got responded on in kindness 
163271,H tel Saint Marc, Limited number of amenities no gym swimming pool and bit overpriced for the standard it offers, Great staff at the front desk fantastic location in the heart of Paris great interior
163272,H tel Saint Marc, Nothing , The hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff are truly amazing They have been very flexible with us and our circumstances Great stay in Paris 
163273,H tel Saint Marc, Hotel offers an express breakfast for 8 euros but confines this to one tea or coffee and two small pastries We had fresh fruit and orange juice as well classic continental style breakfast but were charged as if we had had full breakfast Made the value for money aspect far more questionable when overall the hotel offers great value Air conditioning was centrally controlled and on a very hot night not quite as effective as one could wish We did mention this to Reception but no change was made These two negatives did not outweigh the positives , Although the dark red tone of the room would not normally have been our choice we liked the modern style with its quite stylish mirrors and lighting The bed was large and comfortable The bathroom was very spacious with an excellent shower and about the largest washbasin we have encountered Also very good the free afternoon pastries tea and coffee greatly appreciated provision of tea and coffee making facilities in the room the honesty bar a pleasant courtyard location less than 20 minutes walk to the Louvre for example two very good quite traditional restaurants just around the corner from the hotel 
163274,H tel Saint Marc, Nothing, Beautifully designed and quality interior fit out staff were very accomodating and facilities were above expectation Wouldn t change a thing except to invest in some really great art to compliment the quality of the design 
163275,H tel Saint Marc, The personnel varies very much in competence and customer service qualities The girl who checked us in was totally incompetent We didn t get an overview of the facilities as our friend did who was checked in by a different Receptionist she ignored our requests and was not welcoming at all The shower was malfunctioning and it was not fixed during our stay However most of personnel we met was accommodating and attentive , We loved the design and the concept We had a three persons room and it was spacious with large bathroom which was a nice change after tiny traditional rooms and bathrooms in other hotels The hour free spa was a fantastic opportunity to relax after a long trip The concept of refreshments and the serve yourself bar is a very convenient and clever arrangement Gives even more comfort during the stay We loved the hotel and will come back
163276,H tel Saint Marc, This is not a real critic but I think that the room design has been thought for pictures to be able to be best shared on social media etc It is not possible to take a bad pic of the room or the bathroom The lights and mirrors are perfectly set and everything looks beautifully art deco , I had made the reservation following the evaluation on booking and tripadvisor This hotel merits its great note not only is it wonderfully well designed everything looks beautiful but the bed is comfortable the room is quiet the service is outstanding and I had a great alone time in the delightful pool spa area My room was ready for me when I arrived at 1pm The following day I asked for early cleaning of the room and it was done when I came back at 11am Finally I was sick the last day and they even let me do a late check out at 2pm and even asked if I needed extra honey tea etc I will definitely come back 
163277,H tel Saint Marc,No Negative, The location was perfect the room was large and the staff were awesome and gave us some great tips about the area and where to find the clusters of restaurants The fact you can book the spa for an hour to yourselves was a great was to start our first morning in paris 
163278,H tel Saint Marc, Small breakfast and meeting areas Not ideal for business meetings No comments on food as I haven t tried , It s a nice spotless hotel in a quiet back street Spacious room Free afternoon coffees and teas Very close to a metro station walking distance to the opera Garnier and shopping centres la Fayette and les Printemps Staff members very friendly and helpful I loved the exclusive spa experience The hotel can organise a taxi to pick you up from the airport Charles de Gaulle for 55euros The cheapest option is to take the RER B which stops at all terminals for about 10 euros
163279,H tel Saint Marc, The room was quite dark and the some of the lighting could have been better positioned , Bed extremely comfortable excellent shower nice quiet room overlooking courtyard and very helpful and attentive staff It was fabulous having private access to the spa facilities 
163280,H tel Saint Marc, The breakfast was good but sometimes the staff seemed overwhelmed with too many people Patience helps The video surveillance in the spa made us feel a bit uncomfortable , The look of the Hotel is absolutely stunning I would recommend the rooms in the 2nd floor because they have the highest ceiling in the hotel We used the spa 2 times and we loved it 
163281,H tel Saint Marc, 20 for breakfast bit steep Should offer more Lots of dust in an otherwise delightful room The hotel reserved the restaurant big mistake Thank you for doing that but restaurant was a bit sad We were only customer except for some students Les Noces des Jeanette Really dead atmosphere but food was OK only My Cod and chorizo was tiny portion I actually appreciated that but it wasn t tasty My wife s Sea bream was basic Creme Br l e was nice , I will be brief Good attentive staff smart friendly welcoming Great location once you come out of the right metro exit Not sure which one Smart Hotel tastefully decorated I like the honesty bar bet most people are honest But stops at 10 
163282,H tel Saint Marc, Some street noise from my first floor room I did not use the spa so I cannot comment , The appointments throughout the hotel spoke of attention to detail and an air for fashion The staff exhibited pride and excellence in everything Concierge is world class Taxi s were called and arrived on very short notice Breakfast and Honor Bar both provided quiet respites 
163283,H tel Saint Marc, The check in service didn t quite match the expectation levels mainly due to the exceptional pre check in service , Great service prior to checking in Beautiful rooms and lovely spa Superb location for walking the streets of Paris 
163284,H tel Saint Marc,No Negative, Amazing service Nothing is an effort Lovely self service bar area and yummy free treats in the afternoon Spa was perfect too and very private I can only recommend and would gladly return 
163285,H tel Saint Marc, Personally I like the Saint Germain des Pr s area a bit more but this location is also really nice , The room was spacious beautifully designed in the Art Deco style which gives the hotel a unique and glamorous feeling with great attention to details high ceilings tall windows and big doors The bathroom was comfortable and stylish equipped with Hermes products and the bed was big and comfortable The SPA was very relaxing and the private shower was a great way to refresh before the flight The guys at the reception s day shift were very friendly and attentive and did everything they could to make it a pleasant stay There are a lot of restaurants in the area from French to Japanese and even an American diner Op ra Comique is right next door it s being renovated at the moment and Palais Garnier is a short walk away Richelieu Drouot metro station is just around the corner lines 8 9 and bus line 39 has a station nearby 
163286,H tel Saint Marc, There was one night shift reception guy who wasn t helpful and it felt like pulling teeth to get his aid regarding church location He was the same guy whose immediate answer to my request for an adaptor when our own broke the night before was will you get it here do you need it now because I have no one so you have to wait I said ok to wait and asked around what time but he didn t come in 15 minutes like he promised I had to call again to remind him after I waited for about an hour , The rest of the reception team were very nice and helpful 
163287,H tel Saint Marc, I was struggling to find something wrong but I did scrambled eggs were lukewarm Oh and I would have appreciated an internal light in the dark cupboards , Brand new hotel with large and well decorated rooms I got a beautiful corner one at honest pricing Excellent bed linen pillows decor breakfast location and staff 
163288,H tel Saint Marc, Limited restaurants nearby compared to other places I have stayed in Paris , Staff were friendly and welcoming Room was exceptionally clean updated and comfortable Very quiet 
163289,H tel Saint Marc, A little pricey breakfast and minibar, Perfect hotel to stay in Paris Good location a bit off the noisy grands boulevards but still walking distance from lots of attractions and close to the metro station Friendly and helpful staff Extremely nice room spacious especially for Paris comfy bed and amazing Hermes toiletries 
163290,H tel Saint Marc, Nothing Loved this place , Beautiful spacious room with 15 ceilings and a huge bathroom Not at all generic the decor was unique and stylish The staff was incredibly helpful providing perfect lunch and dinner recommendations even when most restaurants were closed in Augusr 
163291,H tel Saint Marc, Nil for the price we payed we thought the value was exceptional , Brand new hotel unique styling large oversIzed room comfortable bed fantastic value for money and friendly team The hotel staff are all excellent and very helpful especially the manager Adrien 
163292,H tel Saint Marc, A bit of walk from the Louvre even though on the map it looked just next door Well it s Paris , The hotel is very new meaning everything is clean and fresh Free coffee every afternoon very nice breakfast The best part is the steam room 
163293,H tel Saint Marc, Bathroom lighting difficult for putting on makeup Would benefit from magnifying mirror Breakfasts were okay but for the price don t offer value, Decor of rooms beautiful Bed very comfortable with excellent linen and towels Spa and sauna great Staff helpful and offered good advice 
163294,H tel Saint Marc, Waiters working in the restaurant for the breakfast did not speak English fluently, People in reception were really helpful and kind Modern and clean room comfortable bed 
163295,H tel Saint Marc, Small window looking over garden which is concrete Bath room door broken kettle broken TV remote broken but these were fixed immediately on request It s a nice enough hotel but i didn t feel it was fabulous as many of the reviews here say , Large and comfortable rooms Clean with nice design Buffet breakfast good Staff very helpful 
163296,H tel Saint Marc, The room service and breakfast is a little pricey 19 Euro s for a cold buffet breakfast , This hotel has only been open a few months and is finished immaculately The staff were super attentive and couldn t do more for you The room comfort was excellent and the branded toiletries were a nice touch The Spa is a great facility you can book a 1 hour session when you check in this is included in the room fee 
163297,H tel Saint Marc, Nothing at all , Very well located and perfect for couples looking for that romantic Paris vacation do make a visit to their spa Rooms were clean spacious and well serviced Soundproofing and dark curtains ensured we had a good nights rest for our entire stay Staff were inviting and extremely accommodating they really went the extra mile will certainly be staying here again 
163298,H tel Saint Marc, couldnt order room service at 9 45pm the eggs at breakfast werent fresh and it seemed the hotel generally was under staffed It all felt a bit self service so would have been better off in an airbnb, not much really

163301,H tel Saint Marc, The two triangle bed lights above the bed could be dangerous I was told that the hairdryer was missing after we left Hopefully they ve found it , Clean room helpful staff good location The welcome letter was thoughtful 
163302,H tel Saint Marc, I gave a low cleanliness score because there was a stain in the bathroom floor which I covered with a towel Other than that though it was clean There were construction works going on in the building at the back just in front of my room so I was awoken early in the morning I wish I had known that , Location is very good central but still quite secluded and not right in the middle of the tourist area very close to transports and to the Opera The staff were very kind on arrival I was given a proper introduction to the hotel facilities and I was allowed to check in a bit earlier than the time Rooms are well decorated and their size is pretty good From other reviews I ve read Paris tends to offer little space particularly when it comes to bathrooms but the size of my room was big enough The hotel has a spa swimming pool that was included in the price of my booking Sadly I didn t have the chance to try it
