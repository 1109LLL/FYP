122627,Rosewood London, N A, I generally stay here when I m in London for business or play Well worth it great location near everything I m interested in I usually eat in town so can t say about the restaurant except Scarfs for late snack and drinks which is very nice but busy and breakfast either in the Mirror room or the Holborn each they re own style but very nice Staff look after you very well

122630,Rosewood London,No Negative, Concierge and front desk was very helpful in recommendations Staff had eye for detail leaving behind a lens cloth when they noticed we wear glasses and bookmarks for our books 
122631,Rosewood London, Couldn t fault anything, The roome was really spacious and had everything we required I had mentioned during a courtesy call from the reservations department that it was a surprise stay for my hubby s birthday We were so delighted with the welcome birtday cake that was placed in the room for our arrival Special thanks to Julian and Natalia from guest relations for arranging this
122632,Rosewood London, At the first and second night we had got an average room with a small window on the top Besides the button for the toilet is too hard to press in the first room After request we got a better room with a French window in the following nights , Nice staff and lobby especially the lovely dog 
122633,Rosewood London, FACT THAT WEEKEND CLASHED WITH SEVERAL BARS AND RESTAURANTS BEING SHUT TO RESIDENTS DUE TO PRIVATE FUNCTIONS TAKING PLACE , BEST HOTEL BEDS WE HAVE EVER HAD TOWELS AND BED LINEN EXCELLENT QUALITY 
122634,Rosewood London, The area is dodgy The hotel does not fit in the neighborhood It s difficult to move around by car or bus because the roads around the hotel are jammed most of the time Best way to move around the hotel is by walking or the underground Which are not the types of transportation a guests of such hotel would prefer I presume , High attention to details I placed my book on the table Retuned to find a bookmark on it On my check out night I found a transparent plastic bag left for the liquids a traveler might take on a plane 
122635,Rosewood London, Very expensive cost of room plus having to then pay for breakfast Babysitting service also quite expensive , Welcome from concierge and reception very good and professional All requests were dealt with nothing was a problem Beautiful public rooms cool design very comfortable 
122636,Rosewood London, Very poor continental breakfast 26 pounds choose either cereal OR yoghurt OR fruit if you choose more than one option you are charged extra toast charged extra as well as coffee and no continental buffet anymore worst value breakfast I have ever had price cutting exercise gone wrong cancelled a forward booking because of this ,No Positive

122638,Rosewood London,No Negative, the staff at the check in was very welcoming I bought my car with me and the valet will park it in a secured car park nearby for 50 per day Great in room dining food 
122639,Rosewood London, We liked everything we didn t want to leave , Amazing beds linens The hotel has different seating areas in the lobby the coffee tables have beautiful books and decorative details like white roses and beautiful white tall flowers they use candles on the tables with this beautiful scent that we have to buy some to bring home The personnel is extremely nice and polite This hotel is now on my top three list and I do travel a lot PS the flowers and the candles made me love it since I entered the hotel Whoever designed the whole ambience did such an amazing job It s a gorgeous hotel 
122640,Rosewood London,No Negative, Nice and cozy hotel very confortable and clean The family room is perfect for a holiday with the children The position is perfect for visiting London All is perfect The level is very high Compliment to the staff 
122641,Rosewood London, Couldn t get a hair appointment or massage admittedly last minute and they found a solution so very happy in the end w Brooks Brooks No bath rarely use it but this time in lieu of spa would have been nice but no big deal No exhaust fan in the bathroom, The dog The entry gates The beautiful music in the forecourt The bed doona The real chair dining table in the room Movie which I commented I fell asleep during was kindly offered and removed from my account at checkout I was merely chatting because I couldn t remember what movie it was and she volunteered to remove it Very unexpected and very nice act 
122642,Rosewood London, Aircon in the room was inefficient No natural source of air made for a very stuffy head in the morning felt like I d flown long haul The view from room 424 was that of a construction site which of course sprung into action with bore drilling at 8am Bleuggh Incredibly overpriced food , Sumptuous surroundings 
122643,Rosewood London,No Negative, Best hotel I ve ever stayed Comfortable bed and high quality linen Elegant down to detail design and style Friendly staff Walking distance to British museum 
122644,Rosewood London, We had terrible service in the Holborn Grill at breakfast It took multiple calls to get a few items brought to our room blanket top sheet Otherwise fine , Beautiful lobby fabulous flowers and a dog Pearl was the greeter doggie and immediately made us feel happy to be there We had a couple of minor problems that were corrected but overall it was very nice Very nice bathrooms 
122645,Rosewood London, The only downside was the music but the bed was so comfy I was able to sleep easily , The bed was extremely comfortable as was the larger than the average hotel room 
122646,Rosewood London, Nothing , Nothing was too much trouble Whatever you required or needed was available The bed was amazingly comfortable Just loved our stay there A short walk to the British Museum one way the other way St Paul s Wonderful 
122647,Rosewood London, Absolutely nothing I did not like, Large comfortable rooms very stylishly appointed great bar on the ground floor and excellent restaurant Very convenient location close to Holborn tube and walkable to Covent Garden Easy access to St Paul s the City et Via bus taxi underground Beautiful building with a real sense of permanence an place Staff are very very helpful and courteous There s a Waitrose and Pret nearby but keep away from the nasty pretend Japanese places 
122648,Rosewood London, The family room wasn t exceptional compares to the common areas , The building itself is amazing Nice location in center London Very kind people working there 
122649,Rosewood London, Sadly the questionnaire we filled out beforehand seems to have been more for intern marketing purposes Got false expectations The decor in the room could have been better , Good location Nice and lively restaurant with good food and service Beautiful view from the room Friendly staff Nice with welcoming emails and questionnaire beforehand got expectations 
122650,Rosewood London,No Negative, Wonderful staff Wonderful hotel Wonderful rooms Beds amazingly comfy Food delicious Fabulous location Just totally love everything about this hotel
122651,Rosewood London, Should have stayed for longer , Could not fault another amazing stay This time we took our 4 year old son along with us The staff were excellent with him made us feel very welcome indeed Our son loved the whole stay Very comfortable beds lovely spacious room We will now always use this hotel for both our business leisure stays in London 
122652,Rosewood London,No Negative, Superb bed and pillows very quiet bedroom I had the best sleep I ve had in years The softest thickest towels Glorious building with stunning marble staircase massive doors from its previous use married with quirky designs Pearl the dog is stationed regally in an ornate grand dog bed in the foyer Outstanding food and service in the Holborn Dining Room from the delicious breakfast to toasties or shrimp burgers with truffle and parmesan fries Friendly and happy serving staff Similarly Room Service kept up the restaurant standards An amazing exciting hotel with superb service to match 
122653,Rosewood London, Nothing Everything was amazing , Stunning lobby very friendly helpful staff Amazing bar with live music great atmosphere fabulous cocktails You must try the bar Scarves 
122654,Rosewood London, I didn t notice a trx in their fitness centre It may have been an oversight on my part I imagine if I had told them I would like to use one they would probably ensure that there would be one there by end of day because their service is just that good , I travel 4 months of the year and often use booking com for my reservations and I have rarely taken time to write a review However the Rosewood compels me to make an exception Since the first time I walked through the doors of this hotel it has felt like I second home The service operates on a completely different level than most It could contend with the four seasons any day Their attention to detail is so mindfully considered and observing the staff is like theatre Their resident dog Pearl is a gentle soul too The interiors of the hotel are completely inspired you could gaze for hours in the mirror room and never tire The room sizes are considerable by London standards and the location is perfect walking distance to a variety of sites and amenities The brunch at their Holborn restaurant and cocktails at scarfes bar are memorable I have recommended this hotel to everyone I know visiting London Many have gone and we all have share the same sentiments that this establishment is a place that everyone should experience at least once in their life as you will be better for it 
122655,Rosewood London, It was noticeable that the staff were stretched Perhaps due to the time of year the restaurant was understaffed and it had a negative impact on the service It was about a 45 minute wait and then anything additional took 10 to 15 minutes For example extra hot water additional toast it was disastrous Coffee was not very nice We also had to be moved to another room The first room was next door to some kind of housekeeping cupboard and the doors were constantly open and shut The noise was horrific so that night we didn t get much sleep We were not very happy about that and believe me we needed our rest We were exhausted the morning after I would also add that the carpets in the room could benefit a bit from a better vacuum cleaner or maybe it is operator error , Rooms are always clean the linen is very soft and fine Our mattress had clean a very clean mattress protector I LOOKED The bathroom was very clean too The sealer around the edged of the bathtub were totally white no mould at all and this give you a good chance to relax There was also no damp smell in the room at all Greeting staff are absolutely lovely and they made us feel at home Impeccable taste Just arriving into the courtyard if you have been before it s truly as though you are staying at a very large private estate Staff are kind and do not make assumptions I didn t feel any sort of biased attitude I am of Latin american ascendance The staff at the reception desk were familiar and respectful Very pleasant and patient In our opinion it is great that they do not wear name badges It gives it a very personal touch because rather than reception staff from a conventional hotel they are your hosts I also would like to add that the recently opened Hair Salon Matthew Curtis really rounds things up He and his partner were nothing but welcoming friendly professional and add great value to the hotel amenities 
122656,Rosewood London, Breakfast was not great We were directed to the place across the courtyard It was too esoteric for no gain The decor is like a US dink g room but spelt pancakes and quinoa porridge not good Even pastries not great Service was poor , Excellent family room and room service 
122657,Rosewood London, nothing at all , The staff are so nice and friendly to me First impression start from the bellman they are expected my arrival he addressed my last name correctly Thai s lastname is super long and difficult to pronounce and leading me to check in counter and I sent requested for early check in prior my trip as my flight arrived London at 6 30 am I didn t expect much because normally it might just give me check in 2 hours early but when I arrived it s around 8 00 am and they are so kind to check me in right away The hotel is very beautiful X mas decoration is so gorgeous The location is very convenient with walking distance to Holborn station The room is spacious and clean breakfast is very nice overall I love everything and enjoy my stay at Rosewood London 
122658,Rosewood London, The staff in the bar and restaurant weren t great Service from the hotel into the dining area was not consistent The breakfast staff in Holborn dining room were rude on the first day and the breakfast was served cold After voicing our disappointment it was however much better the day and the staff serving us then couldn t me more helpful , Amazing decor location and overall aesthetics of the hotel
122659,Rosewood London, Breakfast is a bit expensive specially if you are a family of 4 in our case at 30 per person for what is actually available There is no buffet so you have to pay for anything extra you order out of your fixed menu choices Also the choices available for breakfast whether continental or cooked is quite ordinary for a 5 star hotel I think the breakfast is a big let down for me personally during our otherwise fantastic stay at Rosewood We really should have had a decent choice to choose from be it continental or cooked breakfast It appeared we would get charged for every extra we wanted of our choice The menu can be a bit confusing as well After our first day s experience we decided to skip breakfast altogether at hotel as we found better options near by This was the only issue I had in an otherwise great stay , Lovely hotel in a very good central location Rooms are good sized stayed in family room Bathroom was very clean with good set of toiletries to use Beds very comfortable to sleep in with good luxury pillows Staff was polite and attentive right through from concierge to room service Good choice of restaurants too if you fancy a meal 
122660,Rosewood London,No Negative, The service was incredible very professional and the location of the hotel very good Holborn station is literally 5mn walking from the hotel We had a very difficult travel cancellation and delay in our flight and when we finally arrive to the hotel they welcomed us with some delicatessen in our room This hotel have a personalised service which make you feel unique 
122661,Rosewood London, They don t properly service the bathroom or supply with good towels and shower set also the room are too small compare to other Rosewood hotel world wide , Court Yard and Main Lobby is one of the best in London 
122662,Rosewood London, Tub height for accessing shower a bit too high and awkward smaller bathroom space Spa was disappointing Mgmt Cancelled appt at last minute due to staff shortage when booking was made 45 days in advance , Close to tube station Dining options 
122663,Rosewood London, The restaurant could do with some attention to the food and the prices are a little expensive compared to the rest of London But that s all hotels from our experience Staff were beautiful helpful though , The hotel surrounds are beautiful and the staff are lovely Great position and amazing value Rooms were always kept fresh clean Will definitely stay again when we come back 
122664,Rosewood London, Nothing, The hotel is stunningly beautiful especially with all the Christmas decorations up currently The service was second to none with everyone making us feel special 
122665,Rosewood London, There s no swimming pool steam room or Jacuzzi I believe as it s 5 stars hotel it must have the previous facilitates Also there isn t an executive lounge for people who have booked an executive room or suite In addition many cars stopped outside the main hotel entrance while it didn t use to be 1 year ago when I stayed in this hotel which makes the yard looks so busy packed Suites rates are extremely expensive , The hotel staff were very helpful The hotel rooms are very clean Comfort bed private hotel entrance it looks like when you enter a palace I like the new outdoor terrace 
122666,Rosewood London, Not all dishes were available despite appearing in room menu Had to wait and call twice before order was taken for in room dining Halal meat should be served in room and restaurants it is central London and 2016 TIP The roof views are not particularly impressive so request courtyard views , Bed was extremely comfortable Communal areas were clean Staff were exemplary helpful polite and not at all overbearing 
122667,Rosewood London,No Negative, Beautiful hotel staff were great and right in the middle of the hustle of Holburn but you wouldn t think it We ll definitely be heading back 
122668,Rosewood London, I was repulsed by the service at Holborn Delicatessen the place was half full I came for a quick bite and left after 10 minutes of complete ignorance at the waiting area Probably the hotel and this eatery although located at the same place are operated by different people companies , The room was impeccable airy clean and the bed was soft and comfortable Macaroons were a great addition to to Nespresso machine I checked in in a hurry and had 6am checkout and both were flawless for which I m greatful 
122669,Rosewood London, Nespresso machine didn t work they had to replace it No Sky news channel Ordered NZ Sauvignon and they said they didn t have any left eventually found some but a bit weird , The doorman was ever so nice The beds were comfy and the hotel decor was gorgeous 
122670,Rosewood London, No cold water only warm for our bath shower Temperamental coffee machine in our room Attitude of young lady in Sarfs bar when we requested a coffee apparently it was unavailable so we made it ourselves in our room not ideal but free , The decor and elegance The cake in our room for our anniversary Attitude and attentiveness of Juan in scarfs bar The books indicating your room location The glass bottles of water in your room more eco friendly 
122671,Rosewood London,No Negative, Everything was exquisite from the staff to the food to the rooms Rosewood has become a second home to me and the staff is family There is nothing that needs to be changed If you re room has a butler Beau Bailey and Daniel are two stars that are willing to help you with whatever you need 
122672,Rosewood London, Nothing not to like , I like everything Have stayed in Rosewood 4 times will come back again Comfortable and cozy friendly and professional staff My favourite hotel in London 
122673,Rosewood London, No bath mat was provided not sure if this is customary for this hotel We used one of the hand towels, The staff we extremely polite and helpful especially Oliver
122674,Rosewood London, The corridors to the room was a little like a labyrinth and I got lost all the time and I mean all the time as my room was on the opposite side of the quadrangle from one of the lifts But losing my way meant I found the budgies and also finding Edgar a few times who was always happy to point me to the right lift stairs Not a bad comment and really to be expected for an old restored building Possibly one of its finer charms , What did I not like I came for a 2 night stay for part conference and part leisure and ended up extending my stay for another 2 nights The room was well appointed bed super comfortable and room decor very classy The Staff were exceptionally attentive and yet unobtrusive I especially must note the service attention given especially when I extended one night and then another night with the assistance from Marcus at the Front Desk The hotel was fully booked and he went out of the way to search for availability just so I could stay another night There are some small standing bird aviaries on the landing between floors and the budgies they house does add an unusual feel to thw place I also enjoyed the 24 hour all day breakfast which means you can order it anytime in that 24 hour stay Delicious with the full English Breakfast and Danish pastries coffee toast and jam selection wonderful but a lillte too much for me I had to forgo the pastries altogether The Rosewood London is certainly one of the finest establishments I have stayed in for a long time and it is the personal touch that made it stand out for me Thank you Marcus Thank you Rosewood A very special place indeed 
122675,Rosewood London,No Negative, The Rosewood is a beautiful hotel with all the facilities you could hope for and more The staff are outstanding what a wonderful warm welcome they gave me and literally they can not do enough for you The attention to detail to our reservation was absolutely stunning I had a wonderful lady called Sophia check me in and I must say what a welcome I was given The staff even took into account my guest arriving later than myself and made sure her every need was attended to We were celebrating a birthday and my my didnt they ensure we celebrated in style My guest arrived to a beautifully made cake by their very own pasty chef and a hand written note from the hotel manager She was completely overwhelmed This hotel their staff the beautiful spacious rooms and huge comfy beds set in an amazing location really is not one to be missed If you do stay here make sure to spend some time in their bar Saturday evening there was a stunning Jazz band on and wow what a night I really cant rate this hotel and their amazing customer service high enough Thank you for having me and I will be sure to recommend this hotel to friends family and clients in the future 
122676,Rosewood London, Terribly synthetic unsupportive pillows forced to double them over to sleep Would have liked tea making facilities in room Very overpriced , lovely reception and courtyard Large deep fast filling bath gorgeous bath room 
122677,Rosewood London, I had a package sent to the hotel from amazon and they kept telling me that it did not arrive I had to show them the name of the staff who signed for it before they found it Breakfast opens a bit late for business travellers, Dog in the lobby very cute very posh dog throne Good service Nice design 
122678,Rosewood London, No ice buget , The bed was super comfy The decor of the hotel was modern fresh and warm I particularly like the entrance as you have to walk thru the courtyard upon entering the building 
122679,Rosewood London, Holborn not my favourite area of London however the hotel was big enough that we didn t really have to venture out if we didn t want to , Staff were extremely friendly helpful made us feel very welcome Had drinks at Scarfes Bar in the hotel which we thoroughly enjoyed Great selection of Whiskey Champagne Had dinner at Holborn Dining Room which was exceptional Octopus tasted so fresh like it had just been caught Staff again very friendly attentive here with good recommendations of wine to pair with food Will be recommending to all will certainly return 
122680,Rosewood London, Nothing , Every minute detail has been carefully considered and was appreciated by us From the second we walked through the gates until we left we felt looked after and treated with the highest respect All hotel facilities ooze quality and functionality and the ambience throughout is soothing Eclectic and modern decor create charm and romance Thank you for our delicious birthday treats and for making our stay unforgettable 
122681,Rosewood London, I liked everything, Magnificent hotel Wonderful experience with the hotel having exceptional attention to detail Well above average and highly recommended
122682,Rosewood London, Could have done with some milk to make the tea coffee with but that s just being a bit picky , The breakfast was great the staff could not do enough for you The cars at the front give the guest a nice welcoming 
122683,Rosewood London,No Negative, Beautiful hotel good location excellent staff Very comfy rooms Lots of little touches coffee machine plenty of toiletries we had complimentary macaroons and a birthday wish in our room very nice 
122684,Rosewood London, The docking station available is for old apple gadgets The room did not have a bath tub, The bed was very comfortable The staff was extremely courteous and they paid attention to the comfort of our family in every way We were welcomed by fresh strawberries and wine The baby was gifted a soft toy and we were provided with baby esssentials including bottle warmer 
122685,Rosewood London,No Negative, We re well travelled and this is one of the nicest hotels we ve stayed in Extremely friendly staff who couldn t do more for you Very clean and beautiful decor Fabulous fabulous stay Can t wait to come back 
122686,Rosewood London, Service at breakfast in the Mirror Room was very slow and we waited 25 minutes even though it was not all that busy at the time This was blamed on a computer fault and resulted in the hotel deducting 25 from the bill , Hotel location room and facilities all first class as were food reception staff booking arrangements and communication 
122687,Rosewood London, The computer in the business center needed a user name and password to unlock it So I went to reception to solve this issue I think using the computers in business center for the hotel guests should be less complicated , The best hotel in London the staff were amazing the location was just perfect In room dining was excellent 
122688,Rosewood London, We could not find fault , The bedroom was beautiful the bed so very comfortable and the marble on the bathroom floor was divinely comfortable All in all it was a lovely experience I loved all the staff uniforms So unlike uniforms The staff were each excellent
122689,Rosewood London, I liked the a la carte breakfast and the service in the breakfast rooms but I do like more a nice buffet breakfast so this is the only thing that I would like to change , Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff Good location very close to an underground Station Walking distance to Covent Garden Nice outdoor terrace Nice and quiet but still close to everything 
122690,Rosewood London, After leaving our cases by agreement at reception no one could find them on our return so I would say needs to be better liaison between reception staff and concierge , When we told the Manager when we left he took it very seriously Easy parking at weekend
122691,Rosewood London, Perfect nothing negative to say, My favourite place to stay in London it s amazing the best selection of restaurants bars fantastic service and beautiful rooms 
122692,Rosewood London, Nothing, My family and I were 100 satisfied with everything about this hotel Special thanks to Julie who helped our check in and made us have really good first impression of this hotel
122693,Rosewood London, The restaurant wait staff were a little sycophantic it didn t feel very comfortable but the women seating me were really pleasant and gave me a suitable table no high stool and in a quiet semi private location , Front desk staff totally rocked The rooms are great and the wakeup call came with coffee what s not to love about that 
122694,Rosewood London,No Negative, Flawless hotel phenomenal stay Every detail precisely chosen for the comfort of customers Any small issue you do find it is fixed before you have time to address it Always one step ahead of you Spectacular 
122695,Rosewood London, Far from knightsbridge 25 min by taxi Far from Hyde Park and sloane street But the luxury of the hotel it makes the location worth even of it s far On another hand it is close to Picadly Square, Luxury hotel Big room They upgrade one of our rooms for free Clean and new furniture in the room The staff are ready to provide anything you could want One of the pest hotels in Europe 
122696,Rosewood London, One breakfast we had was poor They didnt turn down the beds in the evening or tidy bathroom in the evening at the same time The towels were OK but not big soft fluffy towels you normally get in a top hotel , Good hotel great location very impressive building Staff very helpful and attentive 
122697,Rosewood London, Can t think of anything, Staff is great Very helpful They noticed it was our 2 year wedding anniversary and they left us a surprise in the room It s a brand new 5 star hotel with a great atmosphere This was our second visit but it isn t our last 
122698,Rosewood London, room was very disappointing for the money nothing like what is advertised on web , staff was excellent 5 star Was there for our 15 year anniversary they had a bottle of wine and rose pedals waiting in the room when we arrived 
122699,Rosewood London, Breakfast very expensive , Bed very comfortable Staff friendly and accommodating with special surprise for our anniversary Seeing Pearl the adorable hotel dog was a welcoming sight 
122700,Rosewood London, The insistance on taking my guests card for payment when I d agreed to pay for all 7 rooms Very embarrassing and not easily solved , Very elegant in the heart of London but away from the road 
122701,Rosewood London, none , very comfortable matress nice location close to covent garden and theatre even free champagne cake and congraguation card for our honeymoon stay lovely and very sweet and a cute dog in the lobby 
122702,Rosewood London, Sadly too expensive to frequent other than for very special occasions However worth saving up for I do prefer a kettle to the capsule coffee machines which wasn t one of the best , The staff were all really genuinely friendly I loved the fact that this five star hotel is pet friendly and has its own two year old golden retriever Food and service all excellent The displays of fresh flowers all over the hotel are magnificent 
122703,Rosewood London, Nothing , The room was spacious the decor was great the pillows were really soft The staff was really friendly helpful and proffessional We arrived early couple of ours before recommended check in and got checked in at arrival without any hesitation which was great 
122704,Rosewood London, Nothing, This hotel is truly exceptional When paying these amounts even the smallest thing would degrade its rating but there were no such things to be found We all had a fabulous time 
122705,Rosewood London, Absolutely nothing It was an amazing hotel to stay at while in London , We stayed here with our two teenage children They were very accommodating The eggs were fluffy The bed was a cloud The breakfasts were included and were absolutely delicious This hotel was top notch They went above and beyond for us I highly recommend this hotel Wonderful staff and excellent service 
122706,Rosewood London, That I didn t book a suite, Excellent service nothing was too much trouble for the hotel staff The build quality finish and attention to detail to the building and soft furnishings was immaculate
122707,Rosewood London, There was nothing to dislike the Rosewood was quite simply a BIG 10 10, From the moment we arrived and were met by the porter team to checking in heading to the room and sampling the amazing in house dining for a surprise birthday treat the Rosewood simply oozed class amazing customer service and professionalism This is probably THE best hotel I have ever visited in London Europe Nothing was too much trouble and the entire place was spotless I will be back and will recommend the Rosewood to all of my friends who may want to stay overnight in London and would like to sample unuldulterated luxury 
122708,Rosewood London, Room service is terrible Both service and quality of food provided to the guest are horrendous The price is also exaggerated Thank goodness theirs a McDonald s just across the street The hotel gave rooms with the worst view possible even when requested otherwise I had a view off a parking complex Very inspiring I might add The tea time at mirrors is highly disappointing They serve the worst pastries and cakes I have ever tasted in my life , Superb hotel Fantastic design for both rooms hallways and lobby area Reciptionist staff are very friendly welcoming and knowledgable of the task at hand Rooms are spacious and include many amenities Beds are very comfortable and the rooms have good noise isolation Air conditioning and all technology in the room is in perfect working order I also liked the large smart flat screen and the sound system in the room Would love to stay here again
122709,Rosewood London, Leaving Only other tiny comment would be that the bath would be tricky to get in and out of if you had any mobility issues , So many small touches that added up to a lot as well as superb staff who couldn t do enough and a huge comfortable room My favourite things the nespresso machine easily accessible power sockets by the bed proper ceramic toothbrush holders in the bathroom cookie delivered for our son and soft close everything 
122710,Rosewood London, I am travelling very often and surprisingly my credit cards as well as my direct bank account are never founded enough or don t work in this hotel so I have to may in cash Never have this situation in any other place hotel restaurant bar etc in the world , Luxurious and personal 
122711,Rosewood London, , Everything Beginning with the staff so helpful and friendly Location is great Rooms and hotel are fantastic Everything is nice clean and comfortable Just a perfect experience I really mean it Actually it s the first time 1 put a 10 on booking but Rosewood and its staff really deserve it And value for money was great because we had a good deal with booking 
122712,Rosewood London, I thought that the Breakfast selections were too few, The hotel is luxury But still overpriced Staff are friendly nice helpful and understand your needs without long explanation
122713,Rosewood London, I have no adverse comments to make , It was our 40th wedding anniversary and could not have chosen a nicer place to stay Beautiful hotel and the Mirror restaurant was breathtaking I must give the staff a word of recommendation Everyone was extremely professional but so friendly They could not have been nicer We ate in the Holborn the first night of our stay and we will definitely be returning there Food was so fresh 
122714,Rosewood London,No Negative, The staff are so welcoming They make you feel like the most valued guest all the time The rooms are so clean and comfortable and the toiletries are great The hotel s atmosphere is just amazing and so calming 
122715,Rosewood London, The bar staff in the main bar were incredibly rude and unhelpful i go to the bar and use the restaurant alot for business but after the experience i had probably will not in the future ,No Positive
122716,Rosewood London,No Negative, An excellent hotel We ll run extremely helpful staff who were always very pleasant and respectful The hotel was also in an excellent position especially for the theatres 
122717,Rosewood London, nothing, staff incredibly friendly and welcoming Upgraded our room because we were celebrating 50th birthday and left a cake in the room for us Most comfortable bed I have ever slept in 
122718,Rosewood London, Main bar service is often slow and not the most attentive, Almost everything Arguably the most luxurious and well appointed in London The main bar is excellent comfortable relaxing and with a great ambiance 
122719,Rosewood London, Skohed with security system Last day we left our bag in luggage room until we go to the airport When we came back we got unlocked bag moreover the locker was opened by something else not keys And zipper lock was moved away from proper place We asked to send video recording of luggage room for this hours but manager dind t It really unexpected thing Tnx God nothing is stolen but it s really unpleasant case , Amazingly beautiful architecture stylish design nice lobby space and rooms good attitude and service Really trying to make u happy with stay in hotel 
122720,Rosewood London, Nothing to dislike at all , You arrive to a welcome from initially the concierge team dressed in tweeds and then get greeted by the reception team making this at the outset an especially homely London hotel Everything that I experienced this time as before is exceptional including the Holborn Brasserie Very very good The interior design of the hotel is also quite stunning and nicely non corporate 
122721,Rosewood London, didn t like the fact that staff in the mirror room restaurant were a bit slow to serve this time also one day I had to remind someone to clean my room sink and change bed, helpfulness and kindness of staff taking me to and from my room
122722,Rosewood London, The segregated male female spa area Also slightly smelly spa steam rooms The spa could be much better , Beautiful hotel impeccable 5 luxury wonderful staff and big glorious rooms 
122723,Rosewood London, A little too American and over the top with service , The mirrors restaurant served some quite diverse dishes with wine to accompany that enhance to taste of the food greatly If you like fine dining and good wine I recommend a visit to this restaurant 
122724,Rosewood London, Retaurants are not as good as we could expect in a palace Superior rooms are comfortable clean and big but decoration doesn t match with the great classic style of the hotel , Pure british stlye hotel you d feel like a king the service is excellent and you will find everything you may need Perfectly located in central London close to the train stations and heart of London 
122725,Rosewood London, Size of bathroom Bath too small to have a shower Bar had an excellent ambience with several choice of alcohol However service by waitresses was poor , Value for money Location Staff Certainly quality of food Delicious and choice was exceptional 
122726,Rosewood London, The bar staff all models were very skilled but could have been quicker Lighting in the room could have been slightly just slightly better although it s difficult to find any flaws in the place , The welcome was slick overwhelmingly so The room was luxuriously comfortable in a fashion of timeless luxury The whole hotel decor including staff uniforms seemed imbued with quintessential Britishness bespoke suave respectably eccentric 
122727,Rosewood London, I chose this location based on the fantastic reviews In our room the drain in the bath did not work well We asked them to fix and there was some improvement but it was not 100 better Also the carpet could have been better vacuumed daily , I liked the gym facilities and the nespresso machine in the room I also liked that the entrance to the hotel was in a courtyard off the street I felt safer going in and out that way versus trying to enter on the street 
122728,Rosewood London,No Negative, A immaculate luxurious hotel with extremely attentive staff beautiful rooms bars and exterior and situated 5 minutes from Holborn tube station I planned to propose to my girlfriend in London and the staff couldn t have helped more I was personally greeted by the Head of Guest Services when we arrived and the hotel organised for a bottle of champagne macarons red roses and rose petals to be left in the room when the room was turned down Our room was also upgraded and we had views across the London skyline staying on the top floor It was a perfect short stay and a memory that will stay with us forever 
122729,Rosewood London, my room toilet was a bit low to use properly so I had a bit of struggle to use it being wheelchair bound also plugs in the room itself were impossible to reach as they were hiding behind the big table, friendliness and helpfulness of staff
122730,Rosewood London, Breakfast in the Holborn restaurant was mediocre but very expensive Service was the worst I have experienced in any grade of hotel anywhere Think Fawlty Towers and you get some idea staff were a total shambles 30 mins before anyone took our order toast with no jam or marmalade and no knife or plate either Toast was no more than warm bread Sent it back but the replacement was just as bad We complained as did several other people and as a result we were not charged However this was a New Year treat and we would have preferred to pay and have a civilised relaxed breakfast At this price I will look elsewhere next time I am in London , Central location Lovely building beautifully restored Fabulous decor Reception concierge porters and housekeeping were all excellent helpful courteous and efficient
122731,Rosewood London, 100 held on my card for every night I stayed because I was using a debit card was a bit of a disappointment Did not know this at the time of booking,No Positive
122732,Rosewood London, the breakfast should be organised in a larger room or in more rooms Quality of the food was fine in the mirror room , the building the staff the restaurant the bar 
122733,Rosewood London, There is absolutely nothing negative about the hotel It is expensive but you get what you pay for The Rosewood does not disappoint , Fabulous hotel Excellent location The staff is wonderful They are approachable and helpful This is our second stay here and I can t wait to return 
122734,Rosewood London, The treatment by the staff and the room was very noisy from building work on going outside There was no in house dining menu in the room and took a while to bring up When food came it was disappointing Breakfast usually comes with toast when ordering omelettes and this wasn t the case My partner had to eat on the bed holding her plate as only one chair in the room , It was very clean n modern
122735,Rosewood London,No Negative, I booked Rosewood for my daughter to celebrate her 18th birthday on her first 2 nights away on her overseas gap trip The start looked after the girls daughter and friend like they were welcoming family Incredible really

122739,Rosewood London,No Negative, All of the staff members are exceptionally helpful and friendly The bar is beautiful and lively at night This was our second visit to this hotel We would definitely go back 
122740,Rosewood London, The poor air conditioning the waiting time at breakfast the poor indication in case of emergency poor light at night in the room, The building the interior architecture the staff the location comfort of the room bedding
122741,Rosewood London, Having arrived in London on an early morning flight from Asia I asked for an early check in I felt staff didn t go particularly out of their way to accommodate my request like other 5 star hotels that I have stayed at in London I had to wait almost 3 hours to get my room assigned If the hotel is going to cater for business travelers they will need to be more flexible in these types of situations , I loved the excellent location and decor of the hotel 
122742,Rosewood London,No Negative, Fabulous and gorgeous hotel well located half block from the Holburn tube station which is on the Piccadilly and the Central line Gorgeousx large bar that is the place to be seen plus two other restaurants 
122743,Rosewood London, Just that on the 5th floor our room had no view , Stayed in the Deluxe suite which was just beautiful with fresh flowers and an incredibly comfortable bed The food is outstanding and the staff extremely efficient and very friendly 
122744,Rosewood London, No choice for vegetarians at breakfast and they were not able to help out , Location was excellent Near the tube and lots of restaurants nearby Clean and spacious rooms
122745,Rosewood London, The overall lighting in the hotel room was rather dim and dark could do with a central light to make more illuminated, The staff were very friendly and efficient and helpful The resident birds and the dog Pearl were charming and made it feel more like a home than a hotel It s a beautiful old building with a a lovely modern feel and interior Feels exclusive with the treatment from the staff
122746,Rosewood London, The only problem we had was a faulty coffee maker but we were brought up coffee and biscuits free of charge while the staff replaced the machine, I loved the feel of luxury from the moment we arrived The staff were extremely welcoming and helpful 
122747,Rosewood London, It would be better if the bathroom could be made brighter , The hotel is nicely decorated The room was very comfortable Service was excellent and the staff were friendly Excellent location 
122748,Rosewood London, Minor niggles Everything was hidden away in boxes TV remote in a leather box Spare toilet roll in a box in a drawer Coffee and whiskey but no tea making facility A smoked glass magnifying mirror in the bathroom makes you face big but blurry Aircon would not switch off totally , Large room very comfortable bed and pillows Spacious bathroom Very helpful staff

122753,Rosewood London, I didn t like much the fact I had to leave , Undoubtedly one of the best hotels I ve stayed in Bed comfort five stars Excellent area of London tube very close and walking distance to caf s theatres and Thames Staff are exceptional and pearl the resident dog made our stay memorable 
122754,Rosewood London, It is priced on the high side so its not a hotel I will stay in on a regular basis Also the location is too far from the City for my purposes But for a high end vacation stay close to Covent Garden Bloomsbury and the West End it s quite convenient , This is a very well run hotel in a beautiful building with many nice touches which earn it the overall high rating from me 
122755,Rosewood London, Slow replenish of food during breakfast wifi not so good sometimes Room size is a bit small by comparing to Shangri La The Shard or even Me London for the price Window sound proof not good as disturbance from car noise outside room during very late night , Friendly Helpful staffs Hotel with modern classical touch feels great 
122756,Rosewood London, Nothing , Loved everything about this place Service is impeccable D cor is fabulous Rooms so comfortable and quiet Would highly recommend Rosewood hotels anywhere
122757,Rosewood London, Spa bathroom area smelled like overflowing sewage I had 700 pounds missing from my belongings and mgmt investigated but did not offer any compensation in any form Taxi drivers at the hotel ran the friendly neutral extremely rude gamut Staff in the same category I would not stay here again , The ambience luxury touches quality of breakfast not included and very expensive 
122758,Rosewood London,No Negative, This Hotel is Beautiful from the charming courtyard entry the lobby and the rooms The rooms were very comfortable and quiet The staff was amazing we were celebrating our 25th anniversary and when we came home from a dinner the staff had surprised us with rose petals romantically placed around the room they gave us an amazing bottle of champagne along with a personalized chocolate cake This honestly made our Anniversary a memorable one I absolutely loved this hotel and wouldn t even consider staying anywhere else when I go back to London 
122759,Rosewood London, No bad experiences whatsoever , The hotel is amazing throughout the spa is small but luxurious and a must to relax The food at Scarfes bar and breakfast at the Mirror room is excellent Staff are superb from drivers and valet to management
122760,Rosewood London, Nothing, There is nothing to dislike at the hotel apart from the lack of a pool But every other factor makes up for that minor fact The staff are brilliant and well trained they go above and beyond to cater for all needs Valet guys are superb Room service is very prompt and excellent 
122761,Rosewood London, Breakfast wasn t bad just not as good as everything else buffet had run out of eggs and croissants with a lengthy wait for the latter to be replenished Lukewarm mushrooms , A beautiful hotel Very quiet and supremely comfortable room Consistently excellent service from all staff members

122763,Rosewood London, The breakfast at Mirror Room has outdone Holburn Dinning room , My second time staying at this luxury hotel with my wife Thanks to the reception for keeping our luggage for a couple of days while we were away for the short journey the Land s End Good breakfast is served at the Mirror Room We will be back in August 2016 
122764,Rosewood London, We enjoy saying hi and greeting the little parrots living in the big bird cage outside the elevator on the ground floor However I do agree that they belong to the nature We were also surprised by the intrusion of the housekeeping for 2 consecutive days I was having a shower in the bathroom while my wife was still in bed I heard the lady was questioning herself if there were someonelse inside the room while she had already standing outside the bathroom door while I was not decent enough to replied her that I was still in the shower , Thank you for offering us an upgrade room We were flattered The location can never be better It s just a minute walk from the nearest tube station The double bed was also unbeattable Simply oppulent 
122765,Rosewood London, We stayed in an executive room but sadly no complimentary bottle of wine or fruit which is the norm with other hotels with executive rooms But I would still most definitely stay here again, Fantastic hotel to stay in close to Covent Garden Theatres etc Staff were very friendly and made us feel most welcome 
122766,Rosewood London, A Dog wandering around the hotel lobby The breakfast is a funny set up almost like a do it yourself job with pots and pans , Location and the Scarfe Bar
