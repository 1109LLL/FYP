332980,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, the location is the selling point this is my 5th return no membership all in change staff undertrained paperwork too much wanted to extend my stay had to do online then get to the reception only hours later to find again not registered main issue this time was cleanliness the carpet was not deep cleaned for months old hair etc the sheets changed once a week the quality of food purchases terribly low I thought i was eating rubber not cheese or eggs tasteless Marginally better in the exec lounge that closes completely serving at 8 30 pm unacceptable in central london 
332981,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Our room did not meet our expectations The bed smaller than queen size and one side was up against a wall more like a single room than a standard double room We complained are were moved to a larger room with king size bed but in another building Overall disappointed with our stay ,No Positive
332982,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, the staff at the Hotel were rude and offensive the room terrible no hot water TV stations did not work toilet did not work towels very hard When we complained the reception manager accused us as liars , Nothing at all 
332983,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I have stayed here over a 5 year period now and the room was starting to show and feel a lack of investment It felt worn and ever so slightly as though it needed a deep clean The same is true of the corridors, The location is excellent and the service unfussy so it is easy to come and go
332984,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Falling apart Aircon went off during the night Repaired by removing thermostat panel and replacing which means it has an electrical fault Light fell out in bathroom Wifi only worked if sitting in the toilet And this was in our second room We moved from the first as all the electrics creaked and clicked and the mattresses were so old they were U shaped with the aircon blasting on your head not your feet Terrible hotel , Location
332985,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Bad lightening small rooms Blood and lipstick stain on the bed Safe not working Cupboard doors not closing Toilet make skweaking noise when sat on, Nothing other than the good location
332986,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, This was a 30th Birthday trip away which the hotel were aware of We arrived to a small dirty room the next morning we found a pair of a previous customers pants in among the clean towels When reporting this to staff at reception we were asked to speak to 3 different members of staff before someone decided to move us to another room not 1 of these members of staff apologised nor was the inconvenience acknowledged This was not an inexpensive hotel and for what I paid I would have expected a lot more in terms of service and cleanliness Extremely disappointed , Location
332987,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Check in took too long No seats in foyer Made a mistake with the booking gave us double when we actually booked a twin Room was so dated Bathroom was old and needs redecoration Would not stay here agian,No Positive
332988,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The twin room i have got did not have view it looks over a courtyard The twin beds are too small for an adult and they are unbalanced and not comfortable at all If you do not checkout by 1200 than you have to pay 50 Pounds, Location
332989,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Fire drill on the Sunday morning was a bit of a nightmare We did not get told what was going on My friend was in the shower at the time I was in my pyjamas we both rushed out into the street there did not seem to be anyone in charge If someone had checked us off a list we could have gone for a coffee or a sit down in a caf I really appreciate fire drill have to be done and I am really glad they are but more organisation next time please , Excellent comfy bed good duvet and pillow ironing board came in very handy 
332990,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, View was terrible but that was not the reason for staying here so it can be overlooked I just felt underwhelmed by the whole experience There was nothing particularly wrong with anything staff were fine facilities were OK it was just that for the price I expected a bit more wow if you understand what I mean even for central London I have stayed at the Cumberland a couple of times before and the experience seemed much better on those occasions , Room was snug but clean and comfortable and facilities were good and fully functioning Breakfast was good and choices were fine 
332991,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, When I came back during my stay on monday I couldn t enter the room when I went to the reception they told me your room doubal locked by the security because they take of the Hose water that I connected with the tap water it was not allowed The right way They have to send message before they do this action to let me know the mistake that I did to corrected with them , Many rooms need to be renovated In terms of air conditioning and furniture 
332992,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Expensive rate breakfast was almost the same every day with no variety it would be better if extra care was given to hotel entrance in terms of adding chairs to sit good fragrance, Location was superb Concierge service was helpful
332993,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Didn t get room I paid for 192 pound D bed was pushed up against wall now I know what its like sleeping in a sardine can in an alley Room not big enough for 2 people Over priced noisy staff inefficient Hotel is tired attempts at upgrading have failed miserably Wouldn t recommend it , Centrally located 
332994,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Booked a twin room and having to sleep on foldaway beds , We were given a room that was like a cell Painted out windows We had requested a room not over the road away from traffic but this was awful PLUS reception had asked Bath or Shower abruptly we said shower but it was not what we got Went back to reception and we were given another room higher floor facing rear of hotel with a window This was after all the hottest day of the year It must be noted that the beds were foldaway beds not proper divans I work in the travel industry 5 hotels and know a foldaway when I see one Our time table did not allow us to go back and take on reception again and we stuck with it as it was a short stay Not really the type of service I have previously received at The Cumberland 
332995,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The elderly lady next door asked my friend and I to talk quieter this was at 2145 approx so I decided to leave the premises and crash at my friend s but I will stay at the Cumberland in the future It has a really nice overall vibe ,No Positive
332996,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Checking in was very slow with queues Housekeeping took towels etc but did not replace them Staff gave no information about the hotel facilities when checking in No local tourist information avaliable , The location was excellent The room although small was well laid out Lovely large bathroom 
332997,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Too busy Compact rooms for price paid Did not have a self service laundry however there was one only a short walk away in Seymore Place , Central location and approachable staff
332998,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The bed was awful the worst I have ever slept in If we hadn t come back to our room so late I would have asked to be moved We had stayed in a different hotel the night before and there was no comparison For 189 per night without breakfast the least you should be able to expect is a comfortable nights sleep , Location good and staff very helpful
332999,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Room booked was not available so after waiting a long time we were upgraded to an exec room the air con did not work and it was boiling so had to sleep woth window open all night hardly slept because of the noise outside The shower was dangerous scalding,No Positive
333000,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Bags were left to be delivered to room This did not happen as it should have and time was spent late at night trying to collect the bag from left luggage when we wanted to sleep , Very comfy beds and quiet cool room 
333001,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Great location When we first arrived the room we got was very dark and needed a good upgrade We let the staff know and they moved us with no problems and they were so friendly and helpful 
333002,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Its a traditional old shool hotel that is putting in no effort whatsoever because they know they will make money off the location regardless When we arrived there were only 2 staff checking in guests and 5 staff standing in the lobby doing nothing When we finally got served after 15mins in the queue we were interrupted by another guest complaining about his washing and the girl checking us in actually STOPPED serving us to attend to him The only reason she came back to serve was because I explicitly said to her that it was rude and poor service to attend to another guest while checking us in , I cant say there is much I liked about this hotel The bed was really comfortable but there was blood on the sheets 
333003,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Fire alarm at 05 30 was understandable but the guidance by staff was almost non existent The signage to the fire escape was appalling and misleading and thereby dangerous ,No Positive
333004,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, My last night I call for a towels several times for Five hours still they promise to send it but I have not received any towels , Centrally located
333005,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, We have stayed at the hotel before and was excellent but it has gone downhill Small room shower not good and there was a horrible smell in the reception area all weekend we were there Cleaning staff rude huge wait all the time at the reception Would not stay here again, good place in london where it is situate
333006,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, I booked this last minute due to commuters chaos and train failure at Paddington I thought what could happen in a luxurious four star hotel I checked in at 22 00 hoping I ll finally get a good nights sleep I had stayed with my parents at Cumberland as a child even before the refurbishment I always felt safe and happy there However I had a sleepless night due to my hectic day and delays Only to doze off shortly after 3 am Then we were woken up by the fire alarm and had to evacuate at 5 45 Half awake dressed on the way down There was not slippers nor a cotton gown in my room The air quality was bad All residents stayed out for no less than 30 minutes I understand accidents happen but no explanation was given I checked out at 7 20 because I couldn t stand staying on the premises I paid 228 for three hours of broken sleep and no breakfast Not even the courtesy of an explanation of what the fire was about 
333007,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Lifts staff customer service check in process , Bar closed at 1am No 24hr bar for residents staff customer service particularly poor check in service very poor and long large que for lifts a few didn t seem to be working room old and in need of modernisation very poor for central London and the price charged 
333008,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Very disappointed in this hotel walked in to large lobby which smelt dreadful looked really run down since last stay Massive cue to check in only to be told that I needed my passport to check in which I didn t have Receptionists English was dreadful Room was very run down and bathroom needs a total refit Unfortunately there was a fire alarm at 5 am and the hotel was evacuated an elderly Spanish woman was on our floor who was panicked and scared we helped her down the stairs and stayed with her no staff helped at all and I m concerned that if we had left her then no staff would have got her , Great location on Oxford Circus and close to Paddington station 
333009,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The first room I was allocated was suffering from a leaking water onto the bathroom floor and onto the bed It was uninhabitable the initial response to reporting the issue was unacceptable, Bed was comfortable Frontdesk staff response Rodolph and Serge to resolving the uninhabitable room problem 
333010,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Sometimes the multilingual staff didn t catch on to what this Australian was trying to say all very minor but there was always someone nearby who could assist , Location at Marble Arch is on Oxford St buses to anywhere and underground Walk to so many of the attractions is only 15 30 minutes or so Lots of eateries and shops nearby Staff were courteous and helpful Restaurant and upstairs bar were excellent and well managed Not the cheapest hotel but it was so well run it was worth it 
333011,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I had made a request prior to travelling to check in early as it said it was possible on the booking com website there was a very good reason behind this as we were going to an event that started at 1pm and once we were in we weren t allowed to come out and back in We were told on arrival we couldn t check in early and would be put in a queue We checked back twice and the room still wasn t ready so had to leave our bags with concierge which was ok but we had to get changed in the toilets of the hotel and I felt rather embarrassed as the hotel was busy At about 10 30 pm we had to leave our event early to get back and collect our bags and check in to our room , The bed was comfortable the afternoon staff were very helpful night time not so much 
333012,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I didn t have breakfast Housekeeping was slack Hot water for showers took for ever so much of waste of running water The bed was too soft , Great location Overall staff were friendly and helpful It was a good stay 
333013,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Was promised complimentary breakfast they denied it at checkin then told us at checkout that we could have had it Too late Also we were overcharged by 25 which they later refunded We paid in full in Feb for 2 night booking forJuly , Room ok hairdryer good 
333014,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Food in exectitive lounge needs to be improved big time as does communication between staff and management, We had no answer to a question about early check in until after we left the hotel Service was very bad this time around Room was not serviced one day until we asked for it to be done Batteries in tv control needed changing and down after two days Exectitive lounge had very bad service and food 
333015,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The room we were in was 1040 It was very claustrophobic the window was frosted glass which when opened which was only about a few centimetres looked out onto a brick wall When going to the bar late one night we found the bar staff extremely rude when we asked if we could order food saying they were busy there was a wait and were we sure we were hungry , Breakfast was very good loved the different stations which cut down on the queing The location was fantastic central to tube buses and main shopping 
333016,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, This is the first hotel that I always look at when I am booking in London The location is simply unbeatable for shopping eating out or nightlife Even a nice way in Hyde Park is a few meters away Cheerful and friendly staff comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast 
333017,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, As above the staff were not very welcoming I didn t like the long wait for check in There was plenty of staff at the desk but only 1 would do check in , My only criticism is l would expect a member of staff to show us to our room The hotel is very big with lots of long corridors The lifts are a bit confusing as you need to insert your hotel room card to call the lift No explanation was given at the front desk Check in took a ridiculous amount of time 
333018,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Soulless reception area bit like an airport Bed too close to the cupboard so couldn t pull out tea and kettle tray easily Also Momentus restaurant quite poor almost an hour between starter and main course arriving whole list of soft drinks on the menu which you no longer serve and waitress not at all apologetic seemed surprised that a mature women not happy with lemonade or coke Also had to return chicken burger as stone cold but it came back still tepid but was so hungry I just ate it Enormous queue and wait for breakfast also similar to an airport experience we gave up and went outside for breakfast even though we had already paid for it Probably won t be returning in future , Location was excellent
333019,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, We felt the room was a little bland in d cor it neither looked warm or welcoming it simply looked functional which was a little disappointing given that it was a deluxe room , The super king bed was very comfortable The room was air conditioned and easily controllable within the room The shower was really big and great water pressure 
333020,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Cleaning needs more Room service and restaurant is not always helpful Either not answer the telephone One i called restaurant the said we cant serve hot food cause there is no gas This should not happen in a hotel like cumberland , I always come to cumberland i feel like home Fernando is the most helpful I come to this hotel because he is here and other managers welcome me and my daughters The conceirge especiall martin and jack are hard workers and helpful Everyone has a smile also eve in the reception I found some rooms need maintinance but the staff make it easy when i ask for something
333021,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, It was not what I booked bath was dirty room small and dirty dressing gown wiv holes in fridge not cold and half bottles of water in fridge that was open when we arrived, The hotel right by marble arch and Hyde park
333022,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Check in was chaotic despite ringing ahead to confirm our arrival time The room wasn t ready so I asked to be called when it was Received a text to say room ready When we got back that was a mistake so off we went again We never got a text or call when the room was ready Checked into room at 4pm Not what I would call deluxe quite grubby looking Twin beds instead of a King Not clean a shower cap still on the hook in the bathroom and the desk looked like a child had sat drawing on it The TV was mounted on the wall but was crooked Went to the bar for a late afternoon snack could not get served so gave up and went to Selfridges Arrived back in hotel after the concert and could not get served drinks so my husband went and stood at the bar with many others Had one drink and went to bed Got chased by a waitress asking us to pay the bar bill and explained we d already paid when we went to the bar for the drinks This was the best and fastest attention by staff of our whole stay Did not bother with our pre paid breakfast the following morning Needless to say won t be returning Shame as their sister hotel Royal Horseguards is quite fabulous Really really disappointingly poor , Nothing generally poor all round 
333023,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Breakfast We paid extra for breakfast When we went to eat the queue was so long we didn t have time so asked for our money back They kindly seated us in the club lounge for breakfast instead but the egg bacon tomato and mushrooms were stone cold and inedible There was no toast and choices not great No time to complain as by the time we d done all of that we had to leave Also two receptionists one male and one female were lovely but another female receptionist was not friendly at all and not what I would expect from front of house staff , The room was great and we thought thought excellent value The location was perfect for us 
333024,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Ridiculous to have to queue for nearly half an hour to be seated for breakfast There is so much open space on LG that breakfast room could be enlarged when necessary , Location and value 
333025,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Overpriced for its category as it is a 3 hotel priced 4 Ironinh device falling apart low end technology WIFI reception losing signal every 2 minutes, Great location Esy access to all sight
333026,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The cleanless was verry poor there were junk in both of the night draws and safetybox They send housekeeping to clean it up after long time and whitevine that cost them 7 or so I wanted to hear from the manager but never did The stay cost over 1500 for four days and they short on staff and all the rooms are old and out off date , I like the location and i have been there four times in the last couple of years 
333027,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Bed was just too comfortable , Paid a little bit extra to be on the Executive Floor which was worth it Special thanks to Mohammed Hassan Reception Manager and Alex for looking after us and providing excellent facilities to hold our meetings Great location and will definitely stay at The Cumerland again when we re in London 
333028,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Strange service from the staff We returned from an evening out to find the bathroom flooded Kept waiting to move rooms Then moved to a room where you could hear the tube running all night noisy hen parties staying on the same floor returned late So not much sleep to be had , Good location right by marble arch tube station
333029,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Breakfast was great Location was excellent, The hotel is a nice hotel but the room could benefit from a deep clean especially around the sink and shower However when I went to use the Executive Lounge the fridges for the drinks were broken so no cold drinks The air conditioning was poor so on a hot day the room was not enjoyable A shame as that facility can make a difference 
333030,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Dialing any number from the room either reception or restaurant would require several attempts and re dialing as hardly anyone is available to answer calls I tried this at different times during the day with the same outcome , Situated a mere few steps from Marble Arch and its underground station this hotel provides close proximity to landmark locations such as Hyde Park Oxford St Circus Picadilly Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden all within walking distance or the easily accessible public transport Tentative staff with a healthy attitude and willingness to provide assistance 
333031,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Definitely three to four star charging five start rates Breakfast area quite chilly and staff little too anxious for you to leave Our friends we were to meet for drinks were told we had checked out They almost left and then asked again and this time the staff found us Later that night exactly 12 24am the front desk woke us up to confirm our name was correct and we were there Who calms at that hour , The location is superb Coffee ironing facilities great Breakfast buffet was excellent 
333032,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The entrance hall is a bit cold and not welcoming Perhaps some seating plants and a water feature would help without jeopardizing security , Location concierge very pleasant and helpful concierge staff If you are in London for shopping within walking distance of the major shops on Oxford street Regent and Bond Streets as well as short bus taxi ride to Harrods and shops in that vicinity 
333033,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, There was a lot of light coming in from the glass bathroom door as the bathroom has a large window in it The room was flooded with light from 4 30am , Great location and a lovely room with a comfortable bed all at a very good price 
333034,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Obviously in the middle of an upgrade so it would be wrong to criticize until such time as it is finished Reception area was very bare and in need of furniture Room just about acceptable but I was not in it much ,No Positive
333035,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The services of Booking com, The booking by Bookin com was incompetent and the hotel did not have a reservation for me but the hotel staff were magnificent at sorting out this mess 
333036,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I like the place the inside environment the cooperability and hospitality of the staff the nice English breakfast the cleanliness of the hotel these all made me to repeatedly attend this hotel every time I visited London,No Positive
333037,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I will never go to this hotel again if I had wanted to stay in a flat or apartment I would have booked one The reason I say this is that we were put in the annex of the hotel some 100 m door to door of the hotel I did not know there was an annex and I certainly would not have booked this hotel if I new Luckily it was a fine weekend no rain or wind to walk through, The bed was extremely comfortable did not want to get up 
333038,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, There was a bit of a smell of drains at the hotel reception Also the bed in our room was broken on one side which I reported to reception Carpet was dirty in our room , Location was great 
333039,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Over charged at check in Poor wifi Room stank of cigarettes Water pressure very low Very rude staff member upon check out Hugely hugely over charged because of one member of staffs mistake and over charged for breakfast too ,No Positive
333040,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, being woken up by members of cleaning staff Buttons on the lift on the 4th floor only half of them work , The bed was super comfy and the shower was lovely 
333041,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, bathroom should have been checked over before we arrived as the sink was faulty it was reported twice before a plumber arrived also we got to our room on two separate occasions and found door keys would not work as the locks needed updating, we both enjoyed the breakfast the room had all that we required and it was clean and tidy
333042,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Not enough place for the clothes in the room and limited space in the bathroom too Room too small Malfunction of door locking which did not recognized the room entry card so an engineer had to solve the problem , The location
333043,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The service has been gone down During 3 days the reception couldn t make as second key to the room so we have to arrive with me partner always together TV didn t work during all stay Telephone didn t work during all stay so there was not possible to call to room to room or other hotel numbers Room service turned twin bed room to double bed room with one bed linen and blanket set which was totally unacceptable as I shared the room with my business partner and this was reason why I booked twin room instead double room To get extra blanket was taking almost an hour and I was forced to go down to the reception twice Some how the general feeling was that staff don t care very much about the guests Next time I will think seriously do I book this hotel anymore It is definitely not a 4 service , As I know the hotel from the past the main reason to choose their executive room was the size of the room which is big enough to feel yourself comfortably with another person in the room Location of the hotel is good and easy accessible to Oxford street and other city center places 
333044,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Loved this hotel Location absolutely excellent Travelled with my son for his 13th birthday and even got a cake brought up to room nice touch beds alittle hard but all good Enjoyed our stay
333045,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Location perfect for walking through Hyde Park hopping on train or bus to go anywhere Very close to Paddington Station and theatres Shopping areas just around the corner Our room in the second building was very quiet and easily accessible with free serve yourself coffee tea and bottled water 
333046,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Nothing, Staff are 5 i have stayed in several hotels in london 5 star and the staff are ok The cumberland staff are so helpful we felt save also the resturant food was lovely Defiantly stay again 
333047,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I was upgraded this felt like a downgrade separate building paint peeling off walls hairs in the bath from previous guests out of date pat test on heated towel rack I was disappointed overall , Beautiful etched glass headboard
333048,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Building work going on so very noisy room Strong smell of sewage on the corridors of the 2nd floor , You pay for the location which is excellent but the hotel itself is nothing special 
333049,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The fridge light was really bright and fridge was pretty noisy Wind rattled around windows, Single bed was bigger than expected Beautiful hotel Excellent location Right next to Marble Arch station but walking distance to Carnaby Street and Leicester Square 
333050,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, everything was a bit tired not really what i would expect from such an expensive hotel , Everything was fine but only just fine the sink was blocked and there was a small leak from the shower The room was clean but everything felt quite tired and tatty Was going to complain but then the queue was too long at the desk 
333051,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Slow check in reservation not correct a bit noisy with big groups of tourists , The location was fabulous There was a mix up with my info as I booked through Booking com and the hotel had not received the update si it took over 30 minutes to check in after a 16 hour day coming from the U S The staff took forever to sort it out and finally I asked to see a Manager and she took care of the problem My room was lovely Big crowds in the lobby and a bit noisy for my liking but all things considered I would stay there again 
333052,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Is the 4th time I stay at the Cumberland and Is always a pleasure for the people working there the location the rooms and the services All people are professional and kind and the location is perfect tube and buses are at a few steps but also a short walk and you are in the centre of London I strongly recommend this hotel 
333053,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, My booking was messed up on arrival and I spent ages try to fix it Would say the room quality does not live up to lobby quality, Good location nice lobby area
333054,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The decoration is being aging comparing my last visit 3 years ago Some facilites in the room is old such as water tap and also malfunction of my bed lights Book desk also has not any light for reading , Location near to Mable Arch station and a lot of bus routes around Oxford Street which is good to shopping dinning and also travel to other sight seeing points 
333055,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The rooms are not very clean They didn t put us in the same floor although we request it earlier The staff are not very friendly , The location is amazing It s safe Security is everywhere The concierge are very helpful with lots of knowledge Food at the club lounge and at the restaurant is very delicious 
333056,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The room Was that a joke No space in bathroom to put our items not even a spot for hand soap at sink Faucet did not work correctly The towel rack was placed so high that I had difficulty hanging my towel No spot to hang towels while in shower for easy reach No drawers OK 2 very smalll ones in nightstands for our items so had to keep going back to suitcases Very small closet We had to ask most days for wash clothes , Liked that breakfast was included Very nice that we could get a box breakfast for our early tours Consig was great 
333057,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Multiple problems with key card Didn t let us partake of some perks we paid for until we complained Noise from construction Had to change room Problems with coffee maker that wasn t addressed ,No Positive
333058,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Not really clean slow Internet and no cellphone coverage in the 2nd floor The big doors in the corridor were very noisy that I couldn t sleep, Location
333059,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Hotel did not have the Booking com booking in its computer system waited long time at reception given a small corner replacement room with noisy internal unit behind locked door air con or generator or something no discount or free breakfast offered out of courtesy Room temperature very difficult to control Peak checkout time next day 8 30am 9 00am had only one person at the desk two at most for brief periods very long wait just to leave , Only location is its plus point near Marble Arch tube station 
333060,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Rooms werent really 4star quality Comfortable but q basic The foot towel was hidden on floor at entrance of shower so it got soaked two days running, Fernando on check in was b pleasant and helpful Great location
333061,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, No printed information about the hotel and facilities , Staff was very friendly and helpfull We stayed in a junior suit big clean and modern and in a deluxe double a bit small clean and modern Location was just fantastic 
333062,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, One of your concierges was very aggressive and even disrespctful with me in his insistance of carrying my suitcase Looked very experienced not an aprentice His attitude was a shame for your hotel , Localization at the very side of the Marble Arch a big bonus for tourist guests like myself 
333063,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I ve been a regular customer since 2012 and this was the worst stay The room was very old ripped furniture clogged sink broken toilet seat no slippers provided trash in the drawers and the list goes on And the 3rd floor is kept traditional is not a valid reason for me to accept how awful the room was I am really disappointed , The only thing standing out was the comfortable bed

333264,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, It s a big hotel therefore I feel the staff were short The rooms could have been cleaned better the bathrooms were slightly dated Towels a bit old , The location is right on the corner of Oxford street It s the best thing abt the hotel 
333265,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Most of the reception staff are Trainees and can speak good English Rooms are very very small and has no value for money, location only rest is very bad
333266,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, This time i waited a long time untill my room was prepared No complementary fruit or chocolates for being arrived Staff i think are few cause when concierge r busy no service and we have to wait for a long time My friend also suffered this when she moved from room to another Hope get more people to work when its season, 4years staying in the cumberland I liked it All the staf are nuce Fernando and sara are the most helpful and welcome me All the managers r nice The supervisor loredano of houskeeping and karolin are good in their job and most helpful Also the concierge jack and martin and henrick All the people are nice and help and welcom us Security is good also
333267,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The room is smelly with shabby and worn out furniture The bed matrices and blanket undercover are not clean The room telephone was not always working when I wanted to call for a service The towels provided are quite old The arrangement washing sink tap is very annoying because when you open the tap on low position it will spill the water at washing top So you always have to open the tap fully to avoid the water spill out This is totally a waste of water and disturbing, The staff only They are very welcoming and very helpful 
333268,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The room was not clean Nobody ever answers the phone They charged me twice and didn t send a release of the 2nd payment even after I called them , Nothing

333271,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The rooms need some renovation Staff at the momentus restaurant were not as friendly as the rest of the hotel staff some were even rude, Location is great Reception and concierge staff were most helpful
333272,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, room services dunt work sometime depends on what room you get sometime air condition dunt work sometimes toilet does not work the large number of rooms in the hotel is the biggest drawback of the hotel as they do not have enough staff to attend to so many guest and the hotel lobby is more like a market during peak season the smaller hatels in the same area will give u better service as this is not the only hotel in marble arch area , location of the hotel is the only plus point

333276,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, This is the second time and it seems the hotel management follows a strategy for putting all arab families in same floor it was noisy for my family and myself Size of Junior suites is terrible , The location is the main reason for choosing the cumberland hotel

333282,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The staff at night could have a little more charisma with them when asking you to show your room key before entering the lifts in the foyer , The location is first class convenient to shopping tube stations West End etc 
333283,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, we had to queue a while to get into breakfast but no big deal we were in no hurry, Nice lounge facility when you book an executive room massive thank you to the staff for posting back my hair straighteners after I left them very helpful bunch 
333284,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, We reached to our rooms however the room was dirty and they didn t clean it from the previous tents We called the reception to inform them with this situation however No one came even after half an hour and with several calls from us Housekeeping didn t come Until we went to the reception to complain The room was changed after waiting for more than half an hour Our first impression of Cumberland was not too impressive unfortunately it was disturbing to see an unclean room The biggest issue is that staff did not react very fast to sort out this issue , Location was very convenient
333285,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Too few staff and crap systems check in is a nightmare lots of customers from the Gulf so check in was a scrum some sort of queue system required everybody seemed to have special requirements and it went on for ever till a senior receptionist got a grip , Cheery staff decent rooms and good location

333288,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, booked a reg twin room but the receptionist said they only had an executive twin room available that turned out to be a very tiny crowded room for two people could barely move in it asked for an upper level room but was given a lower level room breakfast at the executive lounge had little choice of food than regular breakfast the hallways looked very dirty security was obnoxious my conclusion for this hotel the cheaper room you book the better offer you get This hotel is poorly maintained ,No Positive
333289,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, There was nowhere to hang the bathtowel near the bath so it had to be laid on the floor ready to use when you got out of the shower The towel rail was placed directly above the toilet which was a bit odd There are 6 lifts but only two seemed to be working , The bed was comfortable and we had a great night s sleep The room was clean and tidy The hallways were quiet and no noise of cleaning trolleys etc

333291,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, This was my first time being blackmailed by the concierge To be fair almost all hotels have some kind of a rude staff But this staff took it to an all new level When I ordered dinner from a near by resturant The staff didn t want to bring it up to me and after explaining how that its his job He says it will get cold before it arrives to my room I went down to collect it from him he told me if I knew u already paid for it i was gonna bring it straight away I came to london for work and after along day I had to face this I payed 200 gbp a night to buy my comfort not te get insulted , Great location

333294,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The furnishings of the rooms are starting to tire a little and could do with some updating Late check out being set at 1200hrs is a standard check out in most hotels Late check out usually means 1300 1400hrs For those catching later evening flights it would help to have a free late check out set at 1400hrs for comfort and repeated visits , All of the staff front desk concierge housekeeping room service etc where extremely helpful and always ready to assist Excellent location good facilities easy access to all key areas of London excellent breakfast buffet one of the best selections I ve seen uplifting and great contemporary interior decorating in the common areas good selection of television channels in a variety of languages and generally very accommodating especially with last minute changes extensions of stay

333302,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Having to wait for over 1 and half hours for our room As it wasn t ready even though we arrived after 3pm We were finally put in a different room that was not worth the money It should be made more obvious that being in the executive part means crossing a busy road and going to a separate building , Staff were friendly and helpful
333303,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, We had to request to get our beds separated as we had booked a twin room and when we got there it was made up as a double one of the beds had a huge dip in the base therefore making it a very uncomfortable sleep and for the money we paid was very poor , The breakfast was lovely hotel was good Great location as we were attending a concert at Hyde Park so all we had to do was cross the road Very quiet in the rooms too

333310,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, attitude of reception staff requested late check out and was told that they could extend 1 PM I asked extension till 4 PM with extra charge but was told that hotel fully booked and unable to extend it is impossible to believe that all guests will check in at 3 PM if the hotel is fully booked and when I checked independently there were number of available rooms on that day So loss of revenue to the hotel due to poor room management Also hotel arranged a taxi with no A C had to baked till I reach the airport , Nothing much to like room reminds you an university hostel No mini bar no toothpaste shaving kit etc There were no place in lobby to sit even for one person

333575,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, As mentioned above, Bring Pork when you ordered vegetarian meal You come for checknin at 1pm 4pm 8pm Your room is not ready please wait was the typical answer They failed to followup after saying please have a seat in lobby and we will be with you in 10 mins One of the worse front staff I have seen in any hotel very rude and it took 8 hours to check in They said due to inconvenience they will give better room and still ended up giving dirty smaller room They lie and failed to answer phone calls from room 
333576,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The noise from other rooms was unacceptable For one nights stay at 224 i would have expected a much better room The walls were paper thin we couls hear everything going on in the other rooms , Nothing
333577,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Not enough staff to handle the amount of clients Always had to wait in a long line for any matter check in concierge check out etc Booked a Deluxe Room which was very much a normal Double room and therefore very expensive for what the room was , Friendly staff but overwhelmed by amount of clients 
333578,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, My husband had called and requested a bottle of prosecco be in our room and provided bank details This bottle never materialised even after speaking to reception twice I will need to check to make sure we are not chafed for this This was not the first time I ve stayed in this hotel and our room 3088 was far less than I expected for the money we paid for it Also the TV would not turn on , Location excellent
333579,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, This is the fourth time I ve stayed here and I chose it because of its location close to the shops the tube literally sits on top of the tube station the buses and places of interest The room can vary from tiny to decent Though the price is high it s in line for this city and this location The best part was that i was allowed to check in early without a problem 
333580,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The bed was a bit flabby The reception was too small compare to the amount of guests , Location is the best Big room and clean Housekeeper also work very early in the morning we just went down for breakfast when we come back our room was already make up 
333581,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Apparently the staff at breakfast feel their only role is to point at the table where you should sit and even that is considered to be going out of their way to do you a favour Maybe the floor manager should engage with guests at least a bit , The location was really convenient the room was exactly what we expected and most of the staff were really helpful There was a big choice of food for breakfast 
333582,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, None, Lovely Hotel in a good position in central London staff very friendly helpful very comfortable rooms We only had breakfast in the mornings which was lovely and also a very good choice to chose from 
333583,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Wifi a bit slow and need to log in every time you enter hotel , Location near to oxford street near to marble arch tube and some convenience store for muslim traveller halal food is just walking distance 
333584,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Room service vegetarian menu was limited on first night room service food was cold but second night it was much better after feedback from previous night , Location was perfect so close to tube and yet so quiet 
333585,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The room was very warm and the air con was not very efficient , Excellent location helpful staff and the best night s sleep I ve had for years 
333586,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Check in was hell I understand that there are busy periods but a hotel of this class should not have a 35 min check queue The food at breakfast was great but it was like being in a school canteen with queue s waiting to be seated They even opened a conference room put some tables in there to help easy the delay but again for a 4 5 star hotel very poor , Location of hotel was fantastic as we were going to Proms in Hyde Park Bedrooms lovely and spacious Beds were a dream 
333587,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Queue at check in was ages Very poor first impression Got sent to the overflow rooms next door Door key didn t work had to walk all the way back to reception So took about 30minutes from arriving at the hotel to actually getting into our room , Bed was comfortable
333588,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Our room was awful could only get out of one side of the bed Dirty cups and spoons and TV not working properly Stayed with you before and never had a problem so was disappointed , Location very handy for Hyde park Staff very helpful
333589,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, the room was too warm a bit small but we were only there 1 night and the bed was against the wall, the location was great it felt calm and smelt nice as you entered
333590,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Central location and ideal if travelling with young children staff super helpful Room clean and breakfast was super Will definitely visit again THANK YOU
333591,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I booked Deluxe king room but the room was too small and no window view changed the room 3 times and ended up to pay way more for the upgrade I think the reception does this on purpose so we pay extra Beside this the shower door was not closing that every time I take a shower I create a mess at my bathroom The clothes cabinet is too small Room lights are not that good room is almost dark , Location is the only good thing about this hotel
333592,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Room very dark due to wall outside the window Lifts very busy Air conditioning in room didnt work very well and was noisy Towel rail in bathroom very high up above toilet, Room was a good size Beds were very comfortable Bar area served food late on as we had missed the restaurant
333593,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, My room was next to employee maintance Little noisy sometime , I stayed 20 days Location is amazing 24 7 life neiborhood nice welcoming at the gate security 24 7 every where in hotel plus card elevators and autmatic secured doors between the floors will close after 11 00 pm Friendly staff trying their best to give help and guidance although crazy busy crowded hotel and reception Conceirge very skilled and trained well Whatever you ask for they will find an answer each time i will visit lindon this hotel will be my top choices 
333594,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Bathroom smelled very musty The hotel is huge and quite impersonal Breakfast room vast Doesn t quit live up to it s stars the second Guoman hotel I ve stayed in that was quite disappointing , Location was brilliant staff welcoming and friendly Breakfast choices excellent If you re into shopping you re around the corner from Oxford Street and good transport links from Marble Arch underground 
333595,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, It felt a bit like an airport and the room was small with only enough milk provided for one cup each Extractor fan didn t work in bathroom , The staff were very welcoming Great location 
333596,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Not much to fault Being picky the breakfast room was busy and it s in the basement so a bit dark and no atmosphere , Good location at the end of Oxford street and good value at the price 
333597,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, rooms are tiny Bed was too small for me to turn even could not keep my bags for two days cause of renovations they had had to pay near 100 Bounds to keep them in the train station toilet door was almost see through glass not very comfortable with children being around , location
333598,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, WiFi is slow and needs to be reconnected all the time The hotel was always very crowded It s a bit expensive for the value provided , Location is excellent The hotel is located above Marble Arch metro station and on the far end of Oxford Street 
333599,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The hotel was packed during our visit and that affected the quality of service provided if you call for service the staff member hangs up before you do you don t even have time to say thank you , The location is excellent for middle eastern visitors close to Edgware road where many middle eastern restaurants are located the Hyde Park is nearby and the famous Oxford Street and there is a taxi stop at the hotel s entrance
333600,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The hotel was super busy during my stay Service was super slow I asked to fix my ar co and it took more then 1 hour Really old room smeling bad It was such a bad experience ,No Positive
333601,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I think breakfast can be better about this hotel for example there wasn t any honey and the butter wasn t good, Grate location very clean room and also the bed was comfort
333602,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, We had to wait to get into our room until 5 00pm I had paid a considerable amount of money for the room just for one night 238 00 and was not offered a reduction or even an apology for this We could not get any wifi We could not get to sleep because of the noise coming from the next room all night long, Location
333603,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, 1 Reception staff are not concerned with booking com One of the staff said if you have problem contact booking com this not the first time this has been told to me 2 What is said on booking com is not always what you expect when you arrive at the hotel, location
333604,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The location was ideal for my son and I close to Hyde Park and the local bars and restaurants The hotel was extremely clean and the staff were always on hand should you need any advice or help 
333605,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, 1 The bed wasn t very comfortable 2 The pillows also were not very comfortable 3 The view from the room was bad , Location is the best right across the street from Hyde Park And Marble Arch station is feet away On Oxford Street and minutes away from Selfridge mall Movie theater seconds away Mayfair across the street You can walk to Picadilly circus Leicester square Covent Garden Doesn t get any better than this And free wifi 
333606,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Too big Full and busy Not at all personable or bespoke A money making factory Much better to stay nearby by in a cheaper place which would be just as good , Bedroom Efficient staff
333607,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Some staff were very rude and appeared to have a bad attitud Some Concierge staff seemed overwhelmed and unpleasant, Love the location Breakfast was ok Room was fine 
333608,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Terrible check in system An indemic problem with hotels never enough tea sugar and milk the trouser press and Iron didn t work full stop Whoever designed the bathroom A door stubb right where you step out of the shower stubb your toe on the way in nearly break your ankle on wau out And a towel rail above a toilet It s not rocket science , Loved the bed although it did leave the room feeling a bit cramped Breakfast selection was fantastic and restaurant availability was good 
333609,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The reception was a bit of a mess because there seemed to be very little organization at the front desk as guest would not really line up and just bud ahead and ignore the fact that there was a line The elevators in the hotel were also quite slow as sometimes it took quite awhile for the elevators to come however that could be attributed to the size of the hotel as it is somewhat large The fitness centre was not located in the hotel which would have been nice to know prior to booking however it is not that far away from the hotel The wifi was decent but could have worked a little better as sometimes it was a little slow The flat screen tv was not interactive so there seemed to be a few things that could be construed as a bit misleading in the hotels description , The hotel is centrally located right next to Marble Arch Station The initial entrance of the hotel is aesthetically pleasing as it is very modern Also the hotel has a few restaurants and bars that you can sit down in and overall the hotel is quite large The wifi was decent and the bathroom was fairly clean The hotel had a lively atmosphere and the double room was a decent size The products which the hotel offered were ok and I the fridge in the room was a good size so you could buy things and place them in the fridge which was convenient The hotel is fine for a business traveler young couples mature people and party goers 
333610,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Security checks at the lefts Dirty bed sheets There was a dirty yellow spot on it Bad AC Its was really hot at night coz we cant open the wendow No housekeeping after 3pm Poor wifi The worst hotel everrrr, The location
333611,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The photos of the hotel foyer were misleading making it look leadingedge Contemporary museum but the reality was nothing like it square grey box Rooms given were much smaller than images suggested Value for money is questionable as no breakfast included in price further 90 required for package with breakfast , Location comfortable bed Good signage for weekend breakfast busy periods 
333612,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, Bed noise between rooms noise from fire doors outside our room There was an excessive gap all round the door No toilet brush or air freshener in bathroom Air con very noisy , Location Breakfasts Friendly and helpful staff Burger and pint 9 99 
333613,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, I was going back to the hotel with my girlfriend at around 2 00 am and one of the staff started asking me to show him my card and asked if my girlfriend was a guest and where is her card I felt like he was interrogating me and it was uncomfortable to be honest I didnt like how he talked to me and that really impacted my view of the hotel and staff He was borderline rude , The location and breakfast was excellent also the complimentary espresso in the room 
333614,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The lobby is missy noisy and does not look at all like the pictures The rooms are old and the toilets does not have a clean finish to it I had to change the room as I found the toilet seat broken and filthy The Air condition is loud this place does not meet its price , I liked the location The staff are friendly 
333615,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, If you want one of the worst case scenario check in then this is the hotel for you The girl was so unfriendly so unhelpful and so unprofessional I can t begin to tell you how humiliating it was for me The manager promised compensation but never followed through A thoroughly unpleasant experience fortunately my guests were late arriving and did not have to suffer the embarrassment as I did , I did not stay but had booked a room for for two friends of mine for a weekend in London 
333616,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The lifts got very very busy at check out time and a member of the cleaning staff told us we couldn t use the stairs it took 25 minutes to get downstairs , Great location and a super comfy bed

333623,The Cumberland A Guoman Hotel, The length of queue at check in and the fact that we twice had other people trying to come into our room because they had forgotten their room number not the hotels fault , The bed was the comfiest that we have ever slept in
