331422,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, We didn t like most of it The staff were not particularly friendly or helpful There was a problem with our booking and the man on reception was not helpful and the way he dealt with the situation was bad customer service after this I felt awkward and wanted to be out of the hotel as much as possible I have stayed in many hotels through booking com and the service in this hotel was the worst by far Very expensive for the standard we received Stayed in hotels all over the world and this was the most disappointing The photos are very deceiving the pool is tiny the hotel is also quite small The porter was very sweet he was the only positive I can say about the hotel no wonder it wasn t very busy If I can give any advice to the hotel management Invest in customer service training for your reception staff ,No Positive

331448,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, bed choices during booking I opted for a large bed as opposed to two singles but got two connected singles They did not have available a room with the bed type I booked room in front of building or back windows do sift most noise but you can still hear the street but back to what I liked next day I checked again with front desk and we were moved to a room facing back of the hotel with a king size bed , Short distance to the Plaza Catalunya north of it if you re planning on walking to sires this makes the hotel closer to the Gaudi houses and church but further from the Gothic Quarter and La Rambla Hotel staff are very nice and helpful and breakfast was good with omelette made to order LOVED the part that they check and make the room twice a day we happily participated in the local siesta There s a deck and a small pool in the back but we never got to it

331453,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, FAULTLESS, There are a number of top 100 resturants via trip advisor close to the hotel I went for cocktails next door at the beautiful cotton house Walking distance to the Airport bus that took 20 minutes from Airport to town Location of hotel couldn t be better Reception are so friendly and helpful The free tapa and wine between 5 8pm is a good touch after a long day walking Rooms are clean new hotel about 3 years old Would return in a heartbeat

331458,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Our room was in the centre of the hotel so we didn t have a balcony or a garden As it was just a short break it was fine but If we had gone for longer I would have upgraded , Fabulous family room with lovely comfy beds and nice extras
331459,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, the night receptionist informed us breakfast was untill 11 30 when we arrived at 11 they didn t believe us after a small discussion we got breakfast Also he informed us the room had a nice view but looking at backsides of old buildings is not my perception of beautiful view, Very nice hotel and nice rooms Catalonia is one the best chains to sleep in when you are in Barcelona

331463,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, You can not control the heat ac in the room so I was always hot at night Could not open the window due to traffic noise The shower has the typical Spanish half door so water runs on the floor Not much counter space by sink Minor complaints , Centrally located Nicely decorated with a sweet orchid aroma throughout the hotel Lovely linens and comfy bed Complimentary wine and tapas 5 00 8 00pm in the cozy lobby A special touch and a good way to meet other travelers A wide variety of spread at breakfast The breakfast area was impeccable but the service was mediocre I was there in January but the pool and terrace looked inviting I was sad to leave It felt like home to me I would definitely stay here again 
331464,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The alarming noise from housekeeping while cleaning other rooms of the same floor Moreover an airline privilege card was taken by the housekeeping from my room and after a complaint to the lobby it was returned without any apology , The location the bar and free snacks from 5 to 8 the bartender

331466,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The water didn t work when we woke up but to be fair they had maintenance staff on the job straight away and the water was working again in just a few minutes , Friendly helpful staff especially a nice guy called James who exceeded expectations with his desire to help us out with various logistical things 
331467,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Even with the air con on the room got a bit stuffy and it s too noisy at night to have the windows open having said that this is a common issue with most city hotels , Centrally located for the shops and a pleasant meander through the Gothic quarter to the port Good quality comfortable hotel with a secluded pool and decked area 
331468,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, House keeping should take care of the cleaning need pest control time to time The rooms are not sound proof , Staff are very helpful very good location
331469,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Shower temperature not easy to control , Great location and clean room The breakfast was nice as well I would like to stay at this hotel on my next visit 
331470,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Breakfast was not very organised Had to wait for things like bacon and eggs and quite a queue developed, The hotel was clean Rooms where great Location was also excellent The free tapas tasting with glass of wine was a nice touch
331471,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The prepayment of the room at check in Quite unusual It wasn t simply a hold on a credit card as other hotels do We were fully charged for our stay Felt like prepaying at a restaurant before being served the food , High quality hotel combined with great staff location and food We travel around the world and stay at 4 or 5 star hotels this definitely ranks in the top 5 and that is not based on its value we stayed through 2016 X mas for 180 eur night breakfast included Considering price I d rank it in the top 1

331473,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, We booked a three single bed room The third bed was a small rollaway not a nice bed like the other two They should not advertise it as three singles , Two of the three beds were very comfortable The staff was very congenial and helpful Happy hour is nice with good canapes and nice red wine no white 
331474,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, room was very comfortable although a little on the small size but the terrace made up for this, Hotel is in a very central location for most attractions and within walking distance Staff were very friendly and attentive We had a room to the rear of the building with a terrace which was very quiet 
331475,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Although I was alone I was offered an upgrade Instead of being given the king size bed room with a view that I ordered I was given a 2 bed room with a cramped terrace at the back Another problem is that upon arrival the room was cold and still smelling of wet plaster and it took almost a day to heat up above cellar temperature Hence my ratings in the comfort and value for money categories , The hotel is within a 2 minute walking distance from Pla a de Catalunya and very happily situated in a central beautiful neighborhood The room was well furnished large with great design There was very good light and it had two large mirrors out of which one was full vertical The breakfast was also great and the staff nice 
331476,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, No English channels on the TV that were not just news , Excellent boutique hotel in great location Very good breakfasts Excellent room with terrace

331481,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, not able to check in early girl at the front desk told us we could go to Park Guell at around 4 despite not having prepurchased tickets we walked all the way there and found out that they were sold out Left with terrible bug bites all over our bodies Not sure if it was bed bugs but we didn t want to chance it so we spent our entire first day sanitizing our luggage website shows photos of there being a hot tub no hot tub in reality just a non heated pool this is very deceiving , great location
331482,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Pool was cold but was late October Street vendors on la rambla and barcelonetta beach can be annoying , Excellent breakfast great location for walking to shops and bars One minute walk to metro where you can connect to all areas Tip use the N2 train to and from airport runs every half hour an takes 25 minutes 
331483,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Noisy Junior Suite Metro rumbles Street noise Not enough breakfast staff to reset tables , Location Breakfast selection Helpful Staff FREE afternoon Tea
331484,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Towels were average, The bed was very comfortable but above all the staff was outstanding Pleasant always ready to help Could not ask for more The complimentary tea was an added bonus After a long day out visiting it was very nice to sit in a comfortable lounge with a delicious tea and a choice of sandwiches and cakes served by a smiling and helpful waitress A wonderful stay overall 
331485,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, During my recent stay the breakfast selection was limited in comparison with my previous stay I had to wait untill 14 00 for my room I arrived from the airport at 10 30 In May not only did I receive my room immediately but I was upgrade to a suite I realize that this I was lucky in May and is not always possible I requested a late checkout due to the scheduled time of my return flight Of course I was willing to pay I was flatly turned down I felt that a little effort could have been invested in my request especially given the fact that I was a returning guest and currently a guest for five nights When I was 15 minutes late for checkout I was reminded with a phonecall This was not necessary since the gentleman at the reception desk was well aware that I was getting ready to check put It took me about 5 mins to leave the room On the upside my luggage was held for me and the staff was courteous in retrieving it for me and getting me a cab when the time came to depart , I was a returning guest My previous stay was in May 2016 The hotel is in a great location Quiet but close to the center Not too big which is an advantage in my opinion The afternoon complimentary tea and snacks was a nice touch Used this service once The waitress tending to the guests was very cordial The housekeepers were very cordial as well The floor wasn t clean when I checked in but was cleaned at my request when housekeeping arrived the next day 
331486,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Only complaint is that there was no plug point for kettle but not a problem just moved it to bedside to use Breakfast was ok but adequate , Well lit rooms and bathroom Great rooms roomy and well equipped Very quiet location just minutes away from all the action Complimentary afternoon snacks were nice 
331487,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Seems as if the reception migth be understaffed at times We had to wait almost 20 minutes for check in while the one person at the desk was handling a group of 4 persons , Excellent beds Bathroom pure luxery coffe tea in the room light in safe always afraid to forget something in the dark Perfect location Did not have breakfast 
331488,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Had a two story suite that was nice but the bottom floor was basically a bathroom with a couch in it As it also served as the entrance to the suite it was a bit awkward to walk in and find yourself in a bathroom with no door The steam from the shower set off the fire alarm more than once and sent the very attentive staff to knocking on the door while one was showering In my opionion just a bad design for a suite Housekeeping could use a bit of work as well They refilled some things and not others turn down services was a chocolate on the bedstand why not turn down the bed while your e there and althought the place was far from dirty it was obvious that they did not vacume and mop the floors daily Overall they were just a bit inconsistent , Great location with all of the ameneties and access to downtown Barcelona that you could want The Metro station is just down the block and La Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya are as well The view from the balcony of the top floor suite was great Mt Tibidabo Sagarada Familia and the rest of the city lights at night were impressive The facilites are modern and updated with some minor problems 
331489,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Shower head was positioned poorly so had to manually hold it over myself making it difficult , Lovely hotel in a good central location Very nice room with balcony Friendly staff good room comfortable bed 
331490,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, My mother and I enjoyed returning to the hotel in the late afternoon relaxing discussing the day s adventures with a nice glass of sangria and tapas This gave us an opportunity to re fuel before our evening activities 
331491,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, Been traveling Europe for the last 30 days and I can honestly say this has been the best The Hotel is Quiet Comfortable Perfectly located but above all that the Staff is Amazing when you add everything together you get the perfect stay Will be back for sure 
331492,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Breakfast provision fine though hot drinks a bit hard work Ok for evening meal but not great Not much atmosphere , Very helpful and friendly staff especially the barman Outside terrace excellent facility 
331493,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, Location is ideal great for walking to sights as well as next to a Metro Very friendly staff across the whole hotel The hotel is very nice indeed very tastefully decorated and the afternoon drinks snacks from 5 8pm are a nice touch 
331494,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, For us nothing, Everything that a first class hotel should be Spotlessly clean big and comfortable rooms and brilliantly helpful and pleasant staff The central location was great yet away from the crowds Perfect for the aerobus and metro station outside We had a slight difficulty with the room security safe but it was immediately dealt with Brilliant staff 
331495,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Restaurant was mediocre , Great central location a short walk away from the Placa de Catalunya Friendly English speaking staff Not a lot of bells and whistles bring your own alarm clock but there is a Nespresso machine in some rooms 
331496,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Nothing, Beautiful hotel wonderful friendly staff that were always helpful Gorgeous contemporary pool area Amazing breakfast choice Complimentary snacks and soft drinks in the afternoon Quiet room at the back 
331497,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, would not give this 4 star hotel Bathroom really really bad very low sink faucet bath dos inefficient and not good bath water instead of down the drain accumulated And of course the price is too high I would not give this 4 star hotel , Excellent hotel location very good hotel staff good breakfast tea time is worth improving A large room

331500,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Nothing , Stayed for our wedding anniversary and we were treated by the hotel to a bottle of fizz on ice and some nice fresh fruit in our room on arrival Worth booking a room with terrace for the extra comfort and luxury

331503,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The air conditioning made strange noises and was not effective enough The hand basin did not drain properly and leaked onto the cupboard underneath it Both easily remedied and did not detract from the experience Considering that our luggage never arrived at the airport and we were without any clothing for two days the manager on the day of our departure missed an opportunity to take advantage of an exercise in good public relations by demanding 28 euros to do some laundry four small pieces for us The rest of the staff were extremely sympathetic and supportive and he spoilt it by being so small minded Perhaps he should go back to hotel school to learn that small acts of kindness under extreme situations can go a long way to creating a lasting and positive impression This comment is really NOT about the 28 euros its about the principle Especially knowing that a survey would follow What an asshole , The staff were terrific Helpful and particularly pleasant at all times The late afternoon complimentary tea and snacks is a very nice touch

331515,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, All was good, A very clean hotel with a courteous and helpful staff Great restaurants nearby as well as public transportation Walking distance to the Gothic district and Las Ramblas street which leads to the sea 
331516,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, We loved our stay Breakfast was fantastic we both had our choice of eggs made everyday which were always tasty We also enjoyed having afternoon tea by the pool on a few occasions this was a great surprise that we weren t aware of when we booked We arrived a few hours early to check in and didn t expect our room to be ready so it came as a nice surprise that we were able to settle in immediately All staff were very friendly always making time to smile say hello 
331517,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, The brunch so good and also the hostel service with free tea time from 5 00pm to 8 00pm with lovely dessert coffee and tea so good The location is amazing very convient to every visit spot The services people are so good and polite next we will back if we visite Spain again
331518,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Nothing in particular Didn t eat at hotel at all so review doesn t cover quality of breakfast etc at all Just a tad overpriced for size of room when compared hotels other large cities , Garden view room v quiet Decor up to date and pleasant Air cond one of the few hotels where worked ok and quiet
331519,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Breakfast is a bit pricey if you are like us and only get down just in time before it finishes Probably our own fault to be fair It is an amazing spread but we settled for coffee and croissants elsewhere the second morning as we are always to late to do it justice , This hotel is just perfect Perfect location Staff are helpful and polite rooms are immaculate but best of all is tea time Such a lovely idea Free tea coffee fresh juice little sandwiches and bits and bobs served between 17 00 and 20 00 Just lovely after a busy day to sit down and recoup before getting ready to go out again Never experienced this any other hotel and I think more should give it consideration Just Lovely 
331520,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, This hotel was a real gem and excellent in every way The location was great and the staff was the best I have experienced anywhere We stayed for 3 nights prior to a cruise in room 102 I would highly recommend this hotel 
331521,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, No view from room, Friendly and helpful staff perfect location in centre yet quiet and relaxed in hotel complimentary snacks and drinks in afternoon early eve
331522,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The corridor fire door to rooms 1 5 needs some attention People coming in late or going to breakfast in the morning is very annoying with the slamming of the door giving a interrupted sleep , The hotel was really clean and everything was immaculate The helpful very friendly staff The breakfast was one of the best I have had 
331523,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, The service from front desk to breakfast turn down service was so professional and on point They were very courteous and accommodating It was an excellent stay I was so happy to choose this hotel for their treatment service and location 
331524,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The restaurant in the evening served nice food but the evening I ate there it was empty everyone else had gone elsewhere a pity More seriously I opted for one of Booking com s cheaper rooms and found myself in a room looking out onto a small covered courtyard about 6 7 floors deep Simply no usable daylight no view of the sky no idea what the weather was like outside without getting up and going downstairs and outside The room itself was excellent but personally I would have liked to have been able to see a bit of daylight My recommendation would be to book one of the rooms with a balcony which seem to be at the back of the hotel or one of the rooms at the front overlooking the Gran Via This is certainly what I will do next time I return to Barcelona and there will be a next time , Very close to town centre at least those parts most tourists visit eg Ramblas and also one of the main metro stations I would suggest that using the buses is not to be avoided as is suggested elsewhere some like the V13 bring you directly back from Barcelonetta to the hotel Just a little research is needed into the routes A ticket for 10 journeys is cheap and easy to use and you see some of the town and not just the wall of a tunnel Staff in hotel were all very helpful and pleasant Breakfasts were good including some savory dishes so frequently omitted Nespreso coffee was used which is also good much better than the older style of hotel coffee which is often poor although still not up to the proper barista style The Bathroom was more of an annex to main room but perfectly good whilst the shower was more like a proper wet room plenty of space to move around and a floor which was not slippy when wet Comfortable bed and plenty of storage space including a good sized safe big enough to put a professional camera into which for me is important There is a small swimming pool and some sun loungers available for those who like those things 
331525,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The breakfast had no variety from day to day Also there was ongoing construction work either in the hotel or outside which created quite a noise , very efficient hotel staff who were willing to help with all kinds of requests 
331526,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Could not sit in balcony due to noise from road and could also hear rumble of trains but would still recommend to friends , Exceptionally clean rooms were very modern and the added bonus of a rooftop pool and terrace 
331527,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Dinner menu options were limited would have liked to have perhaps seen Tapas selection or Steak option , Fantastic location within close proximity to The famous Ramblas Staff were truly exceptional and a real credit to the hotel Could not fault the breakfast and afternoon sandwiches and cakes included too Loved our stay amazing 
331528,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The superior room didn t offer anything better than the standard room i had one of each on my booking so it wasnt worth the extra money , Great location Nice additional touches such as water topup at night turn down 
331529,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, Excellent customer service clean rooms a great outdoor pool and seating area The breakfast had a fantastic selection of fresh food and drinks The hotel is an ideal location for all tourist destinations A superb hotel 
331530,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Can t think of anything, Comfy bed Quiet could hardly hear the neighbours faced the pool area up on 5th floor Free snacks from 5 8pm in the bar was nice Didn t charge for bottled water Also could open window and have a break from aircon
331531,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The only thing I did not like was that the split bed moved around and I was unable to sleep using the full size of the bed as the beds would part This needs to be addressed to achieve a truly exceptional stay , The breakfast choice was sensational I thoroughly recommend you take the breakfast included option especially if you have an early start because very little is open early The gymnasium was ideal for holiday exercise The bar staff and room attendants were excellent Proximity to everything was perfect The rooms were quiet and the room climate could be adjusted accurately 
331532,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The restaurant presents itself as one with a restaurant but it is in the breakfast room which looks like a breakfast room Because it does not attract many customers it was not an appealing option for dining fortunately there are many good restaurants in the neighborhood , We had a superior double room on the quiet back side of the hotel Very elegant and private we slept well You can t beat the location which is near central transportation hub and also near major attractions Other hotel guests were well behaved i e no noisy partyies in the middle of the night etc 
331533,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Nothing all fine , Everything was good Staff friendly and very helpful Breakfast buffet was excellent with large choice of dishes including ingredients for a Bloody Mary for anyone who had over indulged the night before 
331534,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Couldn t fault it, The location and also the staff highly recommended will definitely be going back A bottle of champagne waiting in our room for my wife s birthday was a nice treat
331535,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Dinner could be better Not bad but not at the standards I would expect in a good 4 star hotel in Barcelona Chilled red wine was quickly replaced by wine at normal temperature by friendly waitress Must be a Spanish thing , Location is great 
331536,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Nothing, Excellent location Very nice room and facilities Professional staff Various choices of breakfast This is my second time to stay here Still love it 
331537,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Nothing , The staff were just brilliant We stayed in the nice suite with the jacuzzi as we were celebrating our engagement and they made us feel like we were staying in the nice suite Small touches like making a non alcohol cocktail for my fianc as she is pregnant free of charge One night we came back early and 5 mins later we had a complimentary bottle of champagne delivered with a fruit platter I got drunk she was amused they came and got the jacuzzi nice and hot when needed and always very polite and helpful Second to none 
331538,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Water on the floor of the bathroom after taking a shower but that s just a minor flaw , Excellent location Close to Placa Catalunya and Passieg de Gracia but the street is without much noise Elegant decoration Comfortable layout of the room Sufficient facilities Wifi very good Professional staff Not the warmest style but I like that Good varieties of breakfast Free late afternoon tapas and drinks I didn t have time to try it but looks good enough and the waitress there is quite tentative In a word the place worth every cent 
331539,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Instead of a box of tissues we were given only 5 pieces of tissue folded up in a tiny box to use daily Housekeeping was happy to give more boxes but we had to call housekeeping very troublesome I feel At the room rates we paid a box of Tissues is not too costly to provide, Excellent Location Staff would assist to rectify any situation we were unhappy with eg Water pressure of shower not high enough
331540,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The rooms and bathroom is very small Expensive for what is offered , Not too much it was simply to put your head down in a clean place Tha amenities in the room are extremely limited Small soap bars no tissue paper comp what re was never replenished towels grey 
331541,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Nothing, We were on our honeymoon so the hotel immediately upgraded us to a suite that was available Immaculate hotel great location and helpful staff

331543,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, fabulous location excellent breakfast buffet and happy hour tapas well designed and plush rooms lighting and bathrooms friendly staff and excellent concierge service
331544,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Even though I named me and my partner the hotel said it was a single booking and they charged an extra 22 Euro s for my partner Disgraceful seeing as we had booked one of their best rooms at 325 euros The reception lady dealt with it very poorly , The large bed and long pillows 
331545,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Mattress was commercially acceptable but not great Everything was just fine not the top standard Better luggage handling would have been welcome , Location and breakfast service was excellent 
331546,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, No comfortable chair in room Balcony rail was very low making balcony very limited This needs looking at , Bed very comfortable Superb location Very nice interior of hotel 
331547,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Pity that the room windows let onto an internmal well with little light Rooms facing outwards cost more, The staff were smiling and helpful and made us feel welcome Hotel well placed for Rambla and Gaudi buildings in Passeig Food was good
331548,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, One morning breakfast service wasn t very good and my son couldn t even make a cup of tea because the machines were acting up The the sound of the underground directly below our room was a bit unnerving , The location
331549,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel is ideally located within easy walking distance of many of the favorite sites Gaudi buildings the Gothic quarter restaurants The staff is absolutely fabulous all speak beautiful English and were extremely helpful with tourist information and even straightening out an airline problem The hotel is completely modern with many conveniences Cannot recommend highly enough

331552,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Paid extra for room with view for my husband and I it was much smaller than out daughters inner room The problem I had was that the toilet which was behind a sliding door was probably only six foot from the bed so not much privacy However loved the hotel so if I came again would book the bigger room , Lovely hotel and in a great location Staff were helpful room and hotel spotless 
331553,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The service of the restaurant s staff is poor When we come in they don t serve us at all The blanket is too heavy and you may feel too hot to sleep during night , The pillow is so comfy 
331554,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The price was quite expensive for 4nights only we thought breakfast was included when we booked via this website however on arrival we all noted it was not included Breakfast really should be included considering the price , The hotel was very welcoming accommodating and provided us with all the local information we required The rooms were clean and were cleaned everyday with little extra goodies The location is also spot on not to far and not to near

331558,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Afternoon tea waiter s manner diffident despite hotel saying wanted to extend welcome but served teapots without lids except on the last day Didn t ask what type of tea was wanted nor if milk should be brought Sandwiches dried up too Early flight meant couldn t have breakfast and though offered sandwiches to take to airport we declined for obvious reasons yet didn t get offer to take price of breakfast off room rate for last day , Location perfect for airbus RENF plus for walking to all the major visitor attractions of the City even if the admissions were pricey but didn t begrudge that with Sagrada de Familia Free admission to Picasso museum first Sunday of the month was a pleasant surprise and Tour Moderniste led by student employed by local tourist office was an excellent introduction for the holiday This walk with others was advertised by hotel so to be recommended And Tibidabo not to be missed nor Montjuic with trip in cable car down across harbour to beaches thoroughly lovely holiday and hotel provided restful haven even if couldn t use jacuzzi as just not quite warm enough at this time of year 
331559,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The evening meal in the restaurant was tasteless and very disappointing but there are several nice restaurants and tapas bars nearby We only decided to eat in the hotel because it was pouring with rain outside , The breakfast selection as wondeful the staff couldn t have been more helpful location and cleanliness of hotel were both outstanding
331560,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Too man amenities in room writing paper and envelop Think about the environment less amenities in bathroom , Late arrival kitchen open till 23 00 with out any complaint 
331561,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, A beautifully set up hotel right in the heart of Passeig de Gracia close to Metro sights and shops A really nice touch is the free afternoon tea from 5 8 
331562,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, NA, Fantastic hotel super friendly staff and great attention to detail As an added bonus they also offer complementary drinks and snacks between 5pm and 8pm

331565,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, No mirror in bedroom could it be attached to back of wardrobe door Wardrobe space inadequate for two people or even one person staying for more than a day or two , Location Friendly staff Comfortable bedroom Terrace was generous on first floor adjacent to pool 
331566,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Nothing to fault , The staff was extremely attentive and dedicated to our wellbeing Top level receptionists and the Barman Dan is doing a superb job The hotel itself is amazing and would deserve to be a 5 Location is highly recommended and we will definitely be back Thank you for the brilliant experience 
331567,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The cost of the breakfast was a little on the high side , From the moment we arrived we were treated like frequent guests Staff was extremely friendly and helpful Rooms were clean and comfortable Our room faced the street and it was really quiet Loved the afternoon tea and snacks Great location

331573,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Bed quality although OK for a 4 stars hotel Superior room feels a pretty small in space, Friendliness of all the staff reception bell boys restaurant all Location only 7min walk to the main Rambla Great tapas and refreshments service at no additional charge everyday from 5om to 8 30pm
331574,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Nothing, Staff Maria from the receptionist is the best She gave us good recommendations on where to eat and where yo go Always smiling and willing to help Stayed in several nice hotels but good staff is always key for people to most likely return Rooms nice big and clean rooms Location near the metro Breakfast the best so far 
331575,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, I have eating breakfast with my daughter 10years old I have found out that I have been charged for two adults even my daughter Should be charged 50 of normal , Great location super good bed and very clean bathroom 
331576,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, We were unable to have lunch in the restaurant on Christmas Day as it had been fully booked It would have been simple for the staff to have asked us if we wanted lunch when we made the booking I would have expected residents to have priority in the restaurant ,No Positive
331577,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, The bedroom was spacious especially for a city hotel bathroom always beautifully cleaned and tidied I loved the tasty turndown chocolates everynight what a lovely touch The crowning jewel of the hotel is the staff housekeeping bar and front desk all always friendly confident and available to advise or simply greet 
331578,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, holdiday there wasn t long enough, the hotel was in an excellent spot handy to most things metro stations taxis shops tourist sites etc the staff were all helpful friendly especially the desk staff who helped us with our enquiries on how to get to places both inside and outside the city loved your idea of afternoon teas though the only down side was no tea or coffee with it we d stayed at another catalonia and it was just as nice 
331579,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Would like to have the option of a continental breakfast rather than full buffet , Without prompting I was given a bottle of champagne as it was my birthday What a treat 
331580,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, We had no dislikes, The moment that you walked into the door and approached the front desk you immediately felt welcomed Hospitality at it s finest 
331581,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Terrible smell in the rooms rusty bathroom doorframe expensive and not exceptionally good breakfast scrambled standard TV channels Staff knocking at the door and coming in anyway to offer good night bonbons at 9 o clock in the evening can be pretty disturbing , Location fast internet 
331582,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The hotel needs a larger sign on the wall Very difficult to spot Drove around for an hour after not realising we had been right outside the door Absolute nightmare , Comfortable room and very friendly staff 
331583,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, had to change room the standard rooms are not right too small not well equiped dark Just for 30 EUR more you get a room that is like moving from a 3 star hotel to a 5 star Massive differende All staff were awesome but just on recepcionist in the evening not too helpful , Superior room has massive distance You either get superior or don t go 
331584,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The place lacks soul very stark and this is reflected by the austere staff who were very helpful and professional but rarely cracked a smile, Great location very clean huge bed
331585,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, When I check in I was force to pay more as I had booked a double room but forget to add my wife on the booking The man in front desk are rude but the rest of them are great , The breakfast is great and most of the staff are nice 
331586,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, No bad experiences This is really minor but they could use a more efficient way to serve coffee at breakfast than the single Nespresso machine , Location close to the Barrio Gotico and the major shopping thoroughfare Passeig de Gracia but much quieter Close to a lot of restaurants both inside and outside of the Barrio Gotico Close to some great restaurants on side streets with a more neighbourhood feel Staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions and making reservations The best restaurants we visited we would have never found if it had not been for staff recommendations Very comfortable room of a good size Superior room Hotel was extremely clean Our room was at the back so it was very quiet We were overlooking the pool area though so it may be noisier in the summer we visited in November Great breakfast 
331587,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, It was really difficult to work the toilets I had to press long and hard and still only small amount of water came down , I really liked the little courtyard that was attaced to the room I thought the shower was superb it was quite large and had a big rain effect shower head And the coffee machine in my room Excellent breakfast
331588,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The only thing that was a minor negative was the shower over the bath was slightly awkward to access This was the only thing , Fantastic comfortable stylish hotel Great location just far enough away from the crowds of La Rambla but close enough to walk to Metro station within a minute Staff were super helpful friendly and polite Nothing too much trouble Welcome drink free Afternoon Tea snacks each day Chocolate on our pillow each night We had a ground floor room at the back of the hotel which was really quiet despite the hotel being on a fairly busy main road Excellent would highly recommend and would definitely go back again The Aerobus arrives and departs from Placa Catalyna which is no more than a five minute walk away 
331589,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, We loved the nightly chocolate delivery and the special bottle of Champayne because we were on our Honeymoon The rooms were beautifully decorated and very comfortable 
331590,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, Wonderful property and great staff We traveled with a 2 year old and the hotel provided a very comfortable large pack and play for our daughter Great views from the 7th floor terrace rooms Perfect location for exploring the City Enjoyed the complementary happy hour 
331591,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Be careful to park your car at the back side of the garage If it is raining your car will suffer from the calc water from the building , good location Very nice and clean room at the back side of the building Little or traffic noise Javier has helped us extremely well 
331592,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and Friendly and the Hotel was of a high standard I can honestly say that I would stay here again when I return to Barcelona 
331593,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Breakfast for 16 19 euros is very expensive, Very clean Newly renovated hotel Modern and cosy place to stay Quiet but just in the middle of everywhere 
331594,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Limited public space for drinks at the bar but would not stop me from staying here again , The location of the hotel is excellent Popular sights are either within easy walking distance or accessible via public transport
331595,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, When we arrived we were shown to our room However we discovered that the bathroom door was missing and what remained was the broken frame with broken glass fragments in it We complained and were immediately given another room but it was disappointing to think that the hotel staff clearly knew about this already and gave us the room hoping that we would think it was a modern twist to the room to not have a bathroom door , The location was great close to las ramblas but not too close Staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel and room were spotless Nice touches such as chocolates in the room every day 
331596,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Lack of hooks to hang things up in the bathroom This should be easy to fix but fairly common in h tels The hotel if you are arriving by car is not very visible from the road , The hotel itself is a great place Some very interesting features The friendliness and helfpfulness of the staff Breakfast is excellent and plentiful 
331597,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, The only window of the room looked out on a very small patio so you had to keep the curtains closed if you did not wanted to look directly into another room made the room very dark The tea time snack offered by the hotel was to be honest beneath the standards you would expect of this hotel , Comfortably good beds Nice and helpful staff Super good location near the Place Catalunya Ideal for city trippers 
331598,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, Great location metro at 50m moreover Beautiful modern and stylish hotel Spacious comfortable and tastefully decorated room Superb breakfast with smiling staff What else does one want 
331599,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, Staff was very friendly and attentive Breakfast was great good selection We stayed in the Imperial Suite having the private terrace with a hot tub made our stay even more enjoyable 
331600,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, We were on the first floor at the front and the traffic was a bit noisy You would have to keep the windows closed , Its a great location right beside the metro station and within 5 minutes walk of the two Gaudi houses and 10 to 15 minutes to the Ramblas Its a nice touch serving snacks from 5pm 
331601,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, I took advantage of laundry service but was not returned as expected before I checked out Fortunately I was back in Barcelona two weeks later and was able to pick it up A negative that they missed their deadline for return but positive that I was able to retrieve it , Breakfast buffet was exceptional fabulous selection and well worth the 18e if my memory is correct Could even make yourself a Bloody Mary if one is so inclined Has smoking rooms if that is important to you 
331602,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup, Can t think of anything I would change , Excellent staff and location Sumptious breakfast Very confortable room and bath Would recommend to friends 
331603,Catalonia Passeig de Gr cia 4 Sup,No Negative, Centrally located Walking distance to Bari Gotic El Raval and even Gracia if you re comfortable with a longer walk Loved it Have been to Barcelona several times and this is hands down the best hotel we have stayed at for its price point Better than many higher priced hotels Close enough to touristy areas without being in them
