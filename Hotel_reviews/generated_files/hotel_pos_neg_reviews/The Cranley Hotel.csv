18236,The Cranley Hotel, The service and staff are very low the room Was dirty staines all over the curtains terrace with dirty pillows and wet kitchen smell all day long coming inside the room ,No Positive
18237,The Cranley Hotel, Our room was situated on the ground floor as it had a delightful terrace however the plants were just dull and even some were dead no colour and yet what an opportunity to really wow your guests with area that could be filled with scent colour from climbers at very little cost In addition to this because we had to pass the Kitchen entrance and the door was always open the smell and heat hit you as you were walking down there was always staff standing in the doorway and even if you said hello they would just look at you and carry on talking to each other so it made you feel a little uncomfortable we did have some previous guests smelly socks left in one of the draws but one call to reception and the actual lady on the desk came and dealt with it straight away , The Hotel is just great we have stayed before but it would seem they have new staff now and it made all the difference from our last trip The lady that greeted us was wonderful as was the lady that assisted her just really very professional but by no means over the top an absolute pleasure 
18238,The Cranley Hotel, Excellent hotel normally however this is a one off had it not been for a quick turnaround from the previous guests they would have normally spotted a broken glass in the bathroom Also the breakfast tray didn t have any croissants as they had run out Staff need to more understanding of their guests as their English isn t brilliant Manage was very nice though , Fab location gorgeous designer hotel love the interior too easy to get to 
18239,The Cranley Hotel, AC was our of order replaced by a noisy transportable device Continental breakfast was small though coffee was very good far from the typical lousy English variety , Good location on a quiet street not far from Gloucester Road tube station Room had very little noise as it faced the yard Fridge in the room The room was rather small though perhaps not really by London standards but with an unusually high ceiling must be 4 m tall 
18240,The Cranley Hotel, No aircon made sleeping difficult We stayed at the hotel with another couple and the air con in their room was also broken We asked after the first night and were told someone would bring some air con units to the rooms they never appeared in either room We did mention this when checking out and no compensation was offered , Lovely hotel Very clean nice environment excellent location 
18241,The Cranley Hotel, The big fat loud air conditioning unit at the foot of the bed Had to squeeze past it to get into bed the big hose hung out the window looking ugly A small attic room didn t help matters so I cannot say I felt like it was worth the money , Location was spot on
18242,The Cranley Hotel, Having no tea making facilities in room Temperature of room humidifier made one side of bedroom sodden Noisy all night humidifier could not turn off as too hot Having to pay fifteen quid for two teas and two coffees , Staff on arrival
18243,The Cranley Hotel, No coffee facilities in room Air Con didn t seem to be working , Very quiet for a central London Hotel Comfy bed Convenient for Gloucester Road Tube Station Plenty of local restaurants 
18244,The Cranley Hotel, Chipped sink water stains in blinds and curtains Decor a little dated and could benefit from a make over Noisy ineffective portable air conditioning unit provided in room No slippers provided in room Overpriced snacks and mini bar Crisps 2 small bottle of wine 15 Overpriced continental Breakfast Tea Juice and toast approx 10 Would also benefit if hotel provided tea and coffee making facilities in room , Lovely location quirky building hotel very helpful friendly Staff 
18245,The Cranley Hotel, leaving and getting a good nights sleep when a i got home, the bed was great really comfy we had the attic room which had a stand alone air con system which had a large exhaust pipe that had to go out the window so the window had to stay open all night you could not close the curtains as there was a large pipe in the way if you kept the air con on it would wake you up all night as it went on and off and being the attic it was very warm me and my partner had 3 nights of very poor sleep the room also does not have any tea or coffee facilities on the first morning of our stay at the back of 7 i phone room service for a tea and coffee the phone rang and rang but to no avail i was on the phone twice for 6 mins no answer p s as you could not shut the curtains as soon as it was light that was you up the windows was meant to have 3 blinds but there was only 1 as the other 2 had been taken down so they could put the pipe out the window and when i say pipe it was massive like the ones you get with a tumble dryer so the window had to be open at least 25cm which was great for all the buglife but nobody else never have i spent so much for a room and got so little
18246,The Cranley Hotel, Old fashioned hotel Needs a serious renovation Carpet in the hotel is from the 70 s The air condition in the room is a very noisy hired unit which stands on the floor Staff is mostly from Eastern Europe where they don t write hospitality with a capital H The hotel is completely over priced , The area around Gloucester Road South Kensington is very nice however try to book another hotel 
18247,The Cranley Hotel, The air conditioning wasn t working The front desk sent up a portable unit but it made so much noise that we couldn t sleep with it on After the first night we said that we couldn t stay without aircon and they said that the aircon wasn t working in the entire hotel and hadn t for a week We asked to checkout and to pay for the night we stayed and that we would find alternative accommodation for the balance of our stay The general manager agreed while we were there and then reneged on the deal I ended up double paying my accommodation for the period There was also someone else s underwear in the drawer when we checked in I am a very unhappy customer , The staff at the front desk were very helpful and the location is good
18248,The Cranley Hotel, There were no tea making facilities in the room which was a bit disappointing although staff did offer to bring tea up to our room which was nice , The staff were welcoming and friendly the bed was very comfortable the location and interior design was pleasant 
18249,The Cranley Hotel, The air conditioning didn t work properly took long time to check in small reception area not enough staff, good size charming very good food at the restaurant but breakfast was poor
18250,The Cranley Hotel, Breakfast was poor not good value for money both in terms of quantity and quality There was not tea and coffee making facility in the room apparently for safety reasons however it is now standard to find this in a hotel in London The staff was polite and available but in some cases slow and not clumsy coffe with no spoon or sugar cappuccino instead of latte etc , There is a pitcher of lemon water and cake upon arrival and the staff is very attentiv and helpful Ther bed was exta confortable and there were different kinds of pillows firm fluffy etc also the duvet was not too heavy therfore the temperature was perfect The room was elegant quiet and large easily the best I have stayed in in London The espresso is Illy and made the Italian way the location is fantastici for this part of town 
18251,The Cranley Hotel,No Negative, The room was very large and the decorations excellent A fabulous staff great breakfast and we had dinner in the hotel and it was fantastic The location is amazing 2 blocks from a tube station and very close to museu ms and shopping 
18252,The Cranley Hotel, Nice birthday treat for my wife was planned with a weekend in London Cranley Hotel soon changed that 4 star really This should not be 4 star Where to start with what is wrong with this so called 4 star hotel First of all checking in we were told our room number 402 fourth floor but lift only goes to third floor Opening our door to the room we were instantly hit by the heat it was stifling even though window was open and it wasn t that hot outside under the window was a portable air con unit nice and noisy The carpet was stained and had a rip in it Curtain had a large round stain on it The bed headboard was the worst of all filthy brown stains The room never cooled at all and we had to sleep on top of bedding In the morning half way through my shower no water Phoned reception was told he would phone back in 5mins which he did was told to try now no explanation or apology Breakfast was a joke continental haha toast or pastry fruit juice tea or coffee that was it If you have booked to stay here remember the room number 402 402 402 if you are given this room refuse instantly , Nothing
18253,The Cranley Hotel, We booked superior suite and they gave the room in basement 1 floor Beds are old and worn out even bedheads are fractured Long story short the hotel needs reconditioning , Location
18254,The Cranley Hotel, Lobby was non existent just a desk at the front door Looked unprofessional Scary elevator First room was unacceptable Basement level no view smelt of dirt , 2nd room was better top floor nice view No a c Great restaurants nearby 
18255,The Cranley Hotel, Television not working replaced with one that needed to be re programmed No running water to begin with It was then turned on but there was no hot water Shame the management and sloppy facilities didn t live up to the very good staff , Staff were excellent 
18256,The Cranley Hotel, Needs refreshing in some areas The carpet in room was very old stained and had an open seam that was a tripping hazard No kettle for tea or coffee in the room , Convenient location pleasant staff comfortable bed Room was bright and very quiet Linen very fresh and new 
18257,The Cranley Hotel, Nothing, The staff was just incredible and the restaurant top notch it is Persian Room beautiful too Would definitely stay here again a great neighborhood 
18258,The Cranley Hotel, As the staff and service were so terrible we asked if the hotel had changed hands in the past and it had Which came as no surprise In every aspect you could tell the hotel was trying to save money breakfast was extremely petit my husband was served one tiny bun for breakfast which was supposed to be wholemeal but wasn t The staff were terribly rude no one helped us with the luggage on arrival morning breakfast a young man from the front desk was the only person there in the morning he came to us hands in pockets and was extremely rude telling us are breakfast could not be served as we were too early luckily I had a photo of our breakfast card and the time it was ordered when I said the time he wanted to argue about it we would have been satisfied with beverages and we waited anyway but he took a lot of persuading just to get us some tea The breakfast service was extremely slow as in everyone was waiting one morning to be served no one had breakfast and the whole restaurant was full bathroom had long hairs stuck to the wall we had to ask twice that is should be cleaned The rooms looked cute were very small It s a shame that the people in the hotel with the exception of one foreign lady serving breakfast did her utmost to help were so rude and unhelpful If you do stay here because the location is fantastic have breakfast somewhere else there are lots of nice restaurants nearby and don t expect any British politeness breakfast not worth it ridiculous attitude very few items on the table small jam pots 1 2 per person bad slow service bathroom not clean people at front desk rude and impolite lazy hotel is trying to save money on things breakfast number of towels in bathroom , what we liked the picture of the bed on booking com the one and only person who took any care about people in the breakfast room 
18259,The Cranley Hotel, People used to modern motel suites might find the rooms small and the building old fashioned but I thought the building charming and the room just right for someone who plans to be out and about all day I don t like the new addition of dinner service because the kitchen smells waft up to the rooms and there are plenty of restaurants nearby The only complimentary toiletries were a very basic shampoo conditioner and soap It would make the room instantly more luxurious if they offered more , Luxurious bed and towels good lighting quiet location offer of tea and petit fours on arrival boutique antique decor the improved wireless access system 
18260,The Cranley Hotel, constant pressure to eat dinner at their Iranian restaurant the latter being a swift transformation of the lounge by putting cutlery and napkins on the tables a big mistake in my view , location was excellent 
18261,The Cranley Hotel, The shower room was small not a deal breaker for me but might be for some although the shower itself was a good size A little bit of wear and tear in some areas but no worse than in any other busy hotel , The hotel was like a Georgian country house transplanted into London Lovely room and so quiet I normally use earplugs in London but there was no noise at all and the bed was very comfortable A mobile phone for guests from overseas was a nice touch although I didn t need it myself Proper hangers and a good sized bathrobe were a refreshing change The shower was very powerful like getting a rub down from a Soviet masseuse Would definitely recommend for people who don t want ultra modern decor and prefer some old fashioned touches but still want all mod cons 
18262,The Cranley Hotel, The air conditioning unit did not work Requests from the in room menu were always not available except Persian choices I was informed the restaurant is Persian now and only items from the Banu menu are available That menu which was added to the rear of the in room folder also listed the Cranley Burger Fish Chips and all other items on the in room menu however as stated above such items were not available on the three occasions I used room service Despite being listed as an available item there was no bath robe Should one wish to have a coffee or tea in your room it is necessary to order it via room service The choice available for the basic breakfast was poor so I went to a well known grocers on Piccadilly for breakfast ,No Positive
18263,The Cranley Hotel, The hotel has started to offer dinner a mistake I think since there are good restaurants very close by at a range of prices and styles Also the smell from the kitchens at night in my room overlooking the back was rather pervasive , Quiet convenient location Superb well trained staff Boutique hotel quality decor in rooms No skimping on bed linens and towels Complimentary tea or coffee on arrival which can be taken in one s room Water in glass bottles at bedside also complimentary 
18264,The Cranley Hotel, Water supply was interrupted several times during a 2 days stay making it uncomfortable to shower Did not provide any welcome drink as advertised, Bed was comfortable good location
18265,The Cranley Hotel, Room was small and worn out Poor repair finish curtains had been out in the rain at some point and you could not use the toilet seat without burning yourself on the towel dryer ,No Positive
18266,The Cranley Hotel, room keys though it is so original but have to leave each time like old days, Very nice hotel and so lovely British overall environment location is perfect and the area is so quite but very near to the main public transportation and restaurants nice small three tables outside to have morning coffee
18267,The Cranley Hotel, Nothing to complain about with this hotel , The Victorian decor of this hotel was beautiful a nice change from all these modern plastic hotels these days Lovely rooms with high ceilings and very clean 
18268,The Cranley Hotel, Reception area very small and facilities limited Would have liked coffee and tea making facilities in the room , Lovely sized room Continental breakfast very nice 
18269,The Cranley Hotel, The place needs updated i have been using this hotel for 10 plus years and notice the bathrooms etc are very tired, The staff especially derek were extremely helpdul
18270,The Cranley Hotel, Everything sadly this hotel trades on its location and photographs I ve stayed in much better bed and breakfasts I can only assume the star rating is self appointed No one answered the phone when i called prior to arrival to ask about parking of which there is none When we did arrive the receptionist was so devoid of human emotion I assumed he was a badly automated robot The first room had a Chinese water torture device constantly dripping gurgling AC unit fitted as an unwelcome addition The second room lacked basics like tea coffee a kettle etc The position of our Executive Room was in the basement next to the kitchen so we were woken at 8am on a Sunday by the chef juggling the crockery Breakfast was a joke Having paid extra for an inclusive breakfast we were told we only qualified for the Continental Breakfast which was a basket of luke warm limp bread optimistically described as toast and a cafetiere filled with dishwater equally optimistically described as coffee Anything beyond that including cereals was additional The service at breakfast was appalling I was unsure at which point Beadle was going to jump out and let me in on the gag Its a beautiful building but as a hotel its trading on its South Ken credentials very hard any where else it would struggle , Location was ideal for the purpose of our stay in London Large room for London and very comfortable huge bed 
18271,The Cranley Hotel, My welcome cup of tea was cold and we didn t seem to have hot water out of the sink taps It was barely luke warm yet the radiators were very hot and actually the temperature of the room was too hot , Absolutely delightful place Staff really friendly and welcoming and helpful Really quaint and walking distance from the tube In very nice area and lots of restaurants pubs to visit in close range 
18272,The Cranley Hotel, Extra bed too uncomfortable Not much space and or comfort for a junior suite This was the third time we had stayed at the Cranley and it was slightly disappointing despite the polite staff ,No Positive
18273,The Cranley Hotel, A little TLC with paintwork and carpets A shower cap and hair drier would have been great, Lovely lounge area comp tea and coffee on arrival Prosecco and canap s FOC in the evening
18274,The Cranley Hotel,No Negative, If you want the real English experience it doesn t get much better than this It s comfy cosy homey clean adorable and staff are so nice As if you entered someone s home but better 
18275,The Cranley Hotel, Breakfast a shambles Slow service had to wait ages for just a continental and then didn t have what we ordered Much better to order breakfast in your room , Very nice room Comfortable quiet with attractive decor Near to many restaurants 
18276,The Cranley Hotel, no newspaper delivered as promised no in room tea coffee making facilities got the impression they wanted to squeeze every last penny out of you , pleasant decor helpful friendly staff convenient location to Gloucester Road tube station 5 min walk
18277,The Cranley Hotel,No Negative, Super comfy bed Breakfast delivered to the room Coffee and tea on arrival Free Prosecco and canap s in evening Wonderful friendly staff Stately building full of character fitted out in period style Great location between museums and lots of local restaurants and cafes 
18278,The Cranley Hotel, You don t get everything that was advertised on the website even though it is stated you do The staff seemed like they didn t want to help and everything was to much trouble for them Hotel is desperately in need of a make over , Good location easily reached from the tube station 
18279,The Cranley Hotel, Very little to dislike apart from not being able to find bbc 1 on the TV , Great location just 5 mins easy stroll to tube station and then 15 mins to the centre Also situated on a quiet street 
18280,The Cranley Hotel, No tea and coffee making facilities in the room Only drinks available to buy from the mini bar , Lovely hotel and helpful staff Bed was large and comfy Location excellent Room was big and well decorated 
18281,The Cranley Hotel, Room a little tired with a strange piece of furniture under the window that is completely superfluous, Lovely comfy bed really helpful friendly staff
18282,The Cranley Hotel, Aircondition and fan in the bathroom didn t work, Beautiful little Hotel in victorian architecture style tasty breakfast friendly Service free umbrellas for rainy days
18283,The Cranley Hotel, The original room was sold as a Superior Double with a queen sized bed The room we were given was small with a standard double bed We complained and after a bit of arguing were given an upgrade with two singles pushed together The room had no tea or coffee making facilities and no hairdryer Both rooms were in need of refreshing , Location was very handy for the tube and local restaurants The manager changed our room to a larger Executive Double from the Superior Double when we complained about the bed size and grubby room standard Liked the free glass of prosecco in the evening 
18284,The Cranley Hotel, Continental breakfast so tea toast and ajm at 9 50 was overpriced Car sservice could have been more helpful and not unexpectedly add 5 Pounds for the luggage for a trip to the airport when guests will obviously have luggage , Beds were extremely comfortable room was charming overall 
18285,The Cranley Hotel,No Negative, Staff very friendly room well appointed beautifully decorated and spacious The evening drink and canopy were appreciated as was the cup of tea on arrival 
18286,The Cranley Hotel, The only thing that was not easy for us was the breakfast you have to choose at night what you want for breakfast in the morning and at what time quarter by quarter So we didn t have breakfast at the hotel But there are many caf around the hotel If you are able to plan your wake up then it will not be an issue , Very close to the train station Gloucester Nice place to stay Piccadilly line direct to Saint Pancras and the center of London Clean safe and quiet area You feel in the hotel like at home Many nice touches like tea when you check in cakes for tea time 
18287,The Cranley Hotel, There were no slippers even though the website says they provide slippers they still said no after I called the concierge to request some Bathrobes were very stiff and not comfortable with some stains There was a dirty sock left behind the night stand Breakfast was a ripoff continental breakfast very inadequate , Bed was very comfortable
18288,The Cranley Hotel, No lift on one side of the hotel the side of the hotel my room was in and I was on the top floor Breakfast had to be preordered the night before as no where to eat breakfast , Very pleasant and professional staff
18289,The Cranley Hotel, the room has a bit too hot it would have been lovely to have a kettle and some the in the room , it was a super hotel very good value for money we got an upgrade 
18290,The Cranley Hotel, There were no tea making facilities in the room which for a 4 hotel is not good Wardrobe space was also inadequate for 2 persons, The room and location was fine 
18291,The Cranley Hotel, Was upgraded to the penthouse Nothing to dislike here , Bed was incredibly comfortable Staff were wonderful They serve champagne and canapes at 7pm Unfortunately we weren t around for that but they did have nibbles looked like Afternoon Tea goodies left out in the lobby during the day Yum 
18292,The Cranley Hotel, The room could have done with updating and having a bit of a refresh The blinds on the windows and the carpet could have done with a good clean The grout in the bathroom could have been redone There are no tea making facilities in the bedroom and the breakfast is pricey if not included in the cost of the stay , Overall the stay was pleasant The staff were friendly The communal areas were nice and the bed was comfortable There is a prosecco hour for residents highlight of the stay It s a good location in a quiet area It s a few minutes away in a car from the Royal Albert Hall and only a few minutes walk from the London Underground 
18293,The Cranley Hotel, that the door to the room couldn t be locked from the inside, the beautifully decorated bedrooms and the lovely ensuite bath Great size room for london standards 
18294,The Cranley Hotel, Our Breakfast was always missing something fork milk etc and could be a bit more generous with the bread croissants etc Hotel could do with a bit of a makeover , The friendly and attentive staff 
18295,The Cranley Hotel, Housekeeping the first day there were two wash clothes the second day one then none On sunday there was no housekeeping whatsoever Never any soap personally I don t like to wash my hands with bubble bath or shampoo Security There was no interior lock on the bedroom door much less a deadbolt or even a sliding type Reception is situated so that they do not see everyone coming in and going upstairs Hospitality I asked to change rooms and was told that I would have to pay an additional 30 pounds a night I had paid in advance at 174 pounds night Booking com and hotels tonight were offering rooms at about 130 pounds night 159 for the same dates Rooms were available and at lower cost and they wanted me to pay more There was a burn in the curtain and threadbare carpet patches in the tiny room and even smaller bathroom Something is amiss here Maybe hiring off the books untrained immigrant staff Maybe milking the property to pay debts , The location is convenient for my purpose for my children live a block away 
18296,The Cranley Hotel, i have stayed here a number of times and what disappoints me is each time i have to complete all my details each time there should be capture of my details and at least a level of acknowledgement of my loyalty, I love the homely and friendly feeling of the hotel and in particular the location
18297,The Cranley Hotel, If your room is on the right hand side you have to take the lift in the left side and go up a flight of stairs across a landing and then down a flight of stairs to get to your room Not good with suitcases , Good decor
18298,The Cranley Hotel, The mobile air conditioner was out of order for 4 nights out of my stay of 5 nights under the 34 degree celsius Knowing that the staff had tried to repair it everyday after i reported to the front desk however it was still the same only the fan was worked , The bed is comfy Staff is polite 
18299,The Cranley Hotel, For the price they should include breakfast The internet was down for 24 hours and was a big problem for us from the US No elevator on one side so for heavy bags this was very difficult , Very clean lovely inside and out Nice safe neighborhood 
18300,The Cranley Hotel, Only problem with this visit was the broken air conditioning in room which was on top floor and very hot A noisy large and cumbersome portable machine had to be put in room which made sleep difficult , Always welcoming A favourite hotel in London Willing friendly staff and lovely rooms 
18301,The Cranley Hotel, They never sort their air conditioning out and do not appear to make it clear that it s still not working when booking Ive been there summer and winter but it has not been working for some time unless I m mistaken ,No Positive
18302,The Cranley Hotel, Has happened to us before and now again Booking com reservation means hotel will allocate less attractive rooms to you We reserved a Junior Suite but ended up in a LG room patio but no views bit damp old and worn beds Noice from other rooms and upstairs Worn furniture and floor carpet , Felt almost as staying in someones home No breakfast room you need to have breakfast in your room 
18303,The Cranley Hotel, The only two things that would be possible negatives is that there were a few walls and areas that were a little worn but this also added to the charm of the place and we couldn t rent movies at night for the kids to watch before they went to bed but we had our laptops so we rented a movie on Netflix , It was a charming hotel that felt like we were living in London not staying at some big hotel The location was convenient and not on a busy street I used to live a block away when I was in Grad school and was very familiar with the area I have stayed at the Four Seasons Dorchester and several other five star properties in London which are nice and have all the conveniences that the Cranley doesn t have spa exercise facility restaurant etc but if you are looking for more of a boutique hotel you can t go wrong with the Cranley We were there four nine nights with our two kids 11 and 12 and had two four poster bedrooms which we all loved even my kids said it was great 
18304,The Cranley Hotel, The refusal of the hotel management to rebook postpone to a later date even with several days notice a room that could not be used because the guest was ill , The quiet The efficient and friendly staff who offered tea stored luggage found an adapter plug tried all they could to deal with a booking muddle The bowl of apples and jugs of cool water in the parlour lovely to look at and welcome after traveling 
18305,The Cranley Hotel, Elevator only goes to 3rd floor No luggage to room service on arrival Shower head was old and splashed a bit Breakfast was a bit small, Great bed toiletries comfortable cozy friendly staff room decor was quaint lovely Neighborhood was really nice 
18306,The Cranley Hotel, They tried to charge me upon arrival despite having already paid online The receptionist argued with me about it before bothering to check and then gave me a dirty look when I saw her the next day The fan in the bathroom didn t work and there was a dirty mark on the curtains , The room was very nice The location was good Walking distance from the tube and museums 
18307,The Cranley Hotel, Basement room is totally affected by the smells of the surroundings ktichens and services located in the building , Great atmoshpere and location Average staff 
18308,The Cranley Hotel, Breakfast was just breads and there s no dining room or breakfast room You eat in the lobby The beds had dreadful plastic mattress covers so hot and sweaty Really bad internet connection Long walk to the underground , Lovely decoration Quiet 
18309,The Cranley Hotel, A little restricted with eating breakfast in the lobby or your room Suggestion that breakfast served in rooms comes on a bed tray with legs just to make it more comfortable Plus no tea or coffee making facilities in the room That s quite limiting when you re only provided with one bottle of water each Beverages could be ordered but 2 95 each is a bit steep when other hotels offer it as part of the service When laid in the bath room 602 you can see the underside of the sink which hadn t been finished off decoratively takes the sheen off when you can see plaster daubed on None of these things affected our stay it s just the little detail to attention that would have made a good hotel great , The area surroundings were great Lots of good places to visit and eat Staff were knowledgeable and friendly Bed was comfortable great shower 
18310,The Cranley Hotel, I dislike that we have to pay 5 for electric adaptor you have to buy them not only use The roomservice was very upsetting and not kind The shower was broken and very awful to take a shower with a violent Jet of water Impsssible to switch off the warming we slept wuth the opened window , Very charming hotel with wonderful Position The japanese italian girl at the reception was very helpful and nice 
18311,The Cranley Hotel, A breakfast room would be lovely rather than in room dining and off knees in reception area So if possible , Lovely staff Lovely room Great location 
18312,The Cranley Hotel, In our room 306 there were stains on the carpet and the curtain was stained and ripped It felt a little tired but nothing a bit of paint and stain removal curtain mending couldn t solve , Small Cosy hotel with friendly staff and great location Delicious breakfast in our room and grateful for late checkout time of 12pm 
18313,The Cranley Hotel, We have stayed here twice a year for the past five years and find that the rooms are starting to look very tired We were in a 4th floor room this past visit and the room was unbearable hot and stuffy despite having the window open and the heating turned off Otherwise staff are charming and helpful as always and location is perfect ,No Positive
18314,The Cranley Hotel, Location was a bit far from most tourist attractions I m a walker but for many people you would need a cab ride or underground transport, Staff most helpful and accommodating Comfortable bed and charming room Wonderful English breakfast
18315,The Cranley Hotel, We didn t like that the airconditioner wasn t working and because of that the room was very hot Staff organised a different room for us , We loved the hotel at this great location in Kensington The staff was very helpful and friendly Beautiful room and good bed
18316,The Cranley Hotel, Nothing really Maybe a little refurbishment will be necessary in the near future but keep the decor traditional in keeping with the building , The very comfortable bed with lovely bed linen Light airy room and small but nice bathroom I had a ceasar salad for lunch sitting outside which was very pleasant 
18317,The Cranley Hotel, no mirror to use with hairdryer not allowed in bathroom guesswork staff passive at best rude at worse GBP500 pre authorisation for a two night stay ridiculous requests slow to be met bathroom floor unclean not worth the price , location and decor
18318,The Cranley Hotel,No Negative, Everything was excellent especially our lovely room We have been a few times over the past six months and the staff is welcoming friendly and very considerate The location is a family one with a great neighborhood feeling 
18319,The Cranley Hotel, the hotel does not have a dining room for breakfast so you had to order a breakfast to your room This also meant that no buffet was available This is totally unacceptable ,No Positive
18320,The Cranley Hotel,No Negative, The moment I step into this hotel I receive such a warm welcome and you are really made feel special Every member of staff in this hotel is trained courteous and just so professional 
18321,The Cranley Hotel, Some creaky floorboards in my room and the one above, Good unobtrusive service Check in could have been better I was asked for information which they ought to have had from my online booking
18322,The Cranley Hotel, We had no Aircon in the penthouse suite and were given mobile units which were very noisy and did not get the temperture down , Staff are great and can t do enough to help 
18323,The Cranley Hotel, There was a portable a c unit in our room which stopped working unless I emptied the water from it I probably shouldn t have to do this on vacation But I guess that s part of the charm of an older building I like the Cranley so much I liked my visit anyway ,No Positive
