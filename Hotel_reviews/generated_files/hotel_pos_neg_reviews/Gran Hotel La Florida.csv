297452,Gran Hotel La Florida, Not enough light in bathroom All seats at terras around pool area where reserved but no people sitting there and not many people in the pool , Stunning views from the room over the city great breakfast and dinner Very nice pool Very quiet area 
297453,Gran Hotel La Florida, Hotel is really run down for example there was water dripping from the ceiling in the corridor of our room Bathroom was not properly cleaned bunch of hairs from previous clients on the floor and in drawer Bed is extremely soft for us personally not comfortable Swimming pool chlorine way too strong and pool was anyway not really clean We ordered breakfast in the room the morning of our departure and they brought it up with 30 minutes delay And the very worst a gentleman that said that was a client came in into our kids room with his own room key His room key happened to be a master key that opened all hotel rooms We did not even receive a proper apology from the hotel for this issue To cut it short definitely not worth the money we spent for the stay and we believe this hotel should not be tagged as Gran Lujo nor 5 Star ,No Positive
297454,Gran Hotel La Florida, Breakfast and room service prices very expensive The hotel is a bit out of the way so there is not a lot of public transport and it stops quite early staff were unable to give us much useful information such as times of services Shuttle bus does not start until 11am and only twice a day and not three times a day as described in booking information City pick up at 6 45pm allowing little time in the city if using this service No tea or coffee making facilities in rooms which you would expect in any hotel , The hotel was beautiful and the staff extremely friendly and helpful The views from the hotel were incredible Gorgeous pool area with very comfortable sun loungers and towels provided by hotel Excellent gym facilities and Spa Rooms very clean and comfortable Bathroom immaculate and supplied with l Occitane goodies 
297455,Gran Hotel La Florida,No Negative, Very well located with fantastic views over Barcelona Around 30 minutes drive from the airport which costs about 50 EUR in a taxi Good indoor outdoor pool facilities and all around outside area Excellent service Very spacious family room 
297456,Gran Hotel La Florida,No Negative, The view over the city and Mediterranean is amazing The memory of sitting on our balcony watching night fall and the city lights appearing spread out below us will remain strong for many years to come 
297457,Gran Hotel La Florida, The pool was so cold that we could not get in usually a five star hotel has a climatized pool , Location staff rooms bathroom food breakfast environment 
297458,Gran Hotel La Florida, Everything was great , The staff where very attentive we got an unbelievable rate and the views were absolutely amazing from the room and the terrace The bed was one of the most comfortable we have stayed in Gran Hotel la Florida is a luxurious retreat away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona which you can dip in and out of at will The food offering was of great quality with some inventive Catalan cooking prices were the usual 5 star prices This is an ideal place to destress and 3 nights felt like we had been away for much longer 
297459,Gran Hotel La Florida, The bar food service was a little slow as we weren t in any rush it didn t really matter , Go to be the best view of Barcelona so relaxing 
297460,Gran Hotel La Florida, Mineral Water at 7euros was a bit over the top but to be fair you had a free bottle each night with turn down service The pool side menu is expensive and small portions and limited but it is a 5 star hotel , I m amazed by some of the poor reviews this place gets 10 out of 10 for staff service and facilities We had a mountains view yes the Carpark was below a long way down 5th floor but the views over the mountains was fantastic with fabulous sunsets you don t get with the sea view Frederick kamzul especially were fantastic along with all the poolside bar staff Checking in we had a welcome drink we were then shown around the hotel and on leaving our car promptly brought up from the car park and luggage promptly put in our car with an added touch of a bottle of water to see us on our way If you want to be in Barcelona don t stay here it s a long way out and we choose it for that reason to chill with amazing views from the amazing pool The last day we did our sightseeing the bus was not an issue for us and along with the hotel bus you could get the theme park bus every 20 minutes Thank you all at the hotel nothing but praise from us 
297461,Gran Hotel La Florida,No Negative, A classic Grand Hotel The grand is not in having the latest things available but in the approach The greeting Welcome home as well as having your bed prepared in the evening are just a few sides of this approach 
297462,Gran Hotel La Florida, Nothing , The building is beautiful and the view also from the terras is amazing Very good bed and breakfast Also good food in the restaurant and the terras 
297463,Gran Hotel La Florida, The service in the dinner hall was very very slow We leave the table after 15 min wait Parking is very expensive , The hotel location is terrific The rooms and their views are perfect 
297464,Gran Hotel La Florida, The organization of the terraces outside was very poor Was a shortage of lounge beds and nobody there to coordinate the operation So some beds were left unused for hours whilst people who needed them had to go and sit elsewhere , Very good value for money in Barcelona Nice view over the city Overall quite a luxurious feel for the money we paid Quality of massage very good 
297465,Gran Hotel La Florida,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was beautiful So much design installations Art The beauty of the location and view The staff were truly fabulous and extremely friendly I loved my stay The pool was stunning 
297466,Gran Hotel La Florida, Not enough staff basically The restaurant is often very busy and a lot of waiting for food and constantly calling for service which was very frustrating and doesn t feel very luxury Nobody came to pour wine starters came at the same times as main courses we had to get up and try to find a waiter to bring a fork or even a wine glass which is not really what a luxury restaurant is supposed to be about if you are paying you expect to get what you pay for The staff don t seem trained in the aspect of luxury service they seem a bit clueless although friendly But this hotel makes out that it is a top luxury hotel There is hardly any shade at the pool so you have to fight for a lounger in a shade area quite often The pool area near the restaurant is quite dirty and not cleaned often it seems It seems that some local people actually just turn up order drinks and then use the pool too We had noise issues with wedding events going on too , Great to be out of the city even though you need to spend about 20 minutes into town by taxi it was nice to be away from the madness of Barcelona which is boiling hot in summer We liked the space there with kids it felt very relaxing and stunning views from the terrace and the pool The pool is very big so great again for kids The staff are very friendly and try their best to help The rooms are very comfortable 
297467,Gran Hotel La Florida, Door on bathroom There was a bathroom area so shower and loo had separate doors but main door would have been preferable, Staff excellent kind and attentive
297468,Gran Hotel La Florida, The property is a long way from the city center and an expensive 20 Euros taxi ride was necessary at the end of each evening Buses and a shuttle three times per day made it easy to get to the city center FROM the hotel , Staff was helpful and great Incredible views of city and of sea City night light view was great as well Good terrace bar and cafe The rooms and the bathroom were very large updated and clean 
297469,Gran Hotel La Florida, Far from the city center and nothing to do in the immediate neighborhood Nor any restaurants near the hotel You must take a cab to visit the city go out to dinner etc The restaurant menu was so so Room service took an hour to arrive and the chicken I had ordered was undercooked The buffet breakfast offered a great selection but watch out The waiters start clearing off the food a half hour before the end of the breakfast service We arrived for the 28 breakfast were told to wait because the dining room was full Not 10 minutes after we were seated all the food vanished , The view over the city is fantastic Great pool and terrace Nice spacious room and comfortable bed Lovely place to stay if you want to relax at the spa 
297470,Gran Hotel La Florida,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and always at our disposal As we were celebrating our anniversary the hotel offered a bottle of cava and a cake We will definetly come back 
297471,Gran Hotel La Florida, Can t faulty it at all really maybe the price of the breakfast , The service the minute you arrive the facilities the comfort and attention to detail Oh and the view is to die for Can t really speak for the food but the breakfast was very nice It s quite a way of town but that s what makes it great so peaceful If you want to relax there s the pool and terrace to enjoy the view The public transport makes it really easy to get into the city 
297472,Gran Hotel La Florida, It s a bit far from the center city so cabs can add up They offer a shuttle but it runs only a few times and is always booked The bus was a great option but it only operates on weekend , Amazing service Staff was so helpful They helped me book all my day trips and were exceptional Also lived the size of the hotel Felt like I was staying w friends vs a large scale hotel where you feel like one of a hundred Food was great albeit breakfast was expensive 
297473,Gran Hotel La Florida, Check out was a bottle neck , Great location overlooking Barcelona Very helpful staff Barcelona centre is a 15 min bus ride away and back in our room you can sleep with the windows open and enjoy a quiet night Order a dinner in your room and enjoy the views and the delicious food in your private restaurant 
297474,Gran Hotel La Florida, Nothing but travellers should be aware this hotel is not in central Barcelona but in hills above it , Loved this hotel Amazing views over Barcelona friendly and helpful staff especially Roger on the front desk Great swimming pool and amenities 
297475,Gran Hotel La Florida, Nothing Everything is top notch , The view is out of this world and the drive up the mountain is beautiful Staff are exceptional they are happy to help you and everyone spoke very good English which is a bonus when traveling in a non English speaking country The rooms were beautiful beds super comfy and the food was amazing The Barcelona Restaurant staff there were some of the best food and service we ve had on our trip around France and Spain 
297476,Gran Hotel La Florida,No Negative, The hotel has a very nice setting but is located next to a park that is quite remote The website is not transparant about this Our taxi to the hotel ended up in traffic jam for cars trying to get into the park Furthermore the location is very remote It takes at least half an hour to get up to the mountain Once there the view is spectacular the pool and spa are fantastic although the sauna requires some maintenance The rooms are comfortable The prices of drinks just coffee however is quite over the top It s ok to pay a bit more in a good location but 5 or 6 Euro for a cup of coffee is too much We decided to take the bus from the busstop adjacent to the hotel to go downtown The bus did not accept credit or debit cards We were sent to the hotel to get money from a money machine It was not there Then we had to go into the park to get money The next bus would not accepts bills of 20 Euro So missed that bus too Then we had to change the money in the hotel which fortunately they did So after 1 hour we had the 3rd bus to go down The hotel could have provided bus tickets or whatsoever to accommodate guests The bus ticket was half a cup of coffee and it took us one hour to arrange it 
297477,Gran Hotel La Florida, The service was extremely disappointing very slow check in restaurants and the staff just does not seem to care which ruins the entire experience totally not 5 stars , The terrasse with the view overlooking Barcelona and the breakfast buffet are great 
297478,Gran Hotel La Florida, Breakfast is poor and staff unfriendly, Very friendly front desk staff amazing and breathtaking view over Barcelona nice spa friendly staff in the bar
297479,Gran Hotel La Florida, Nothing , We were upgraded to the Presidential Suite with a corner terrace absolutely magnificent room The hotel staff were beyond welcoming and helpful throughout our stay The location is beautiful and relaxing a welcome break from the bustle of Barcelona Could not find fault with this hotel 
297480,Gran Hotel La Florida, main restaurant was closed which was disappointing as not informed on booking Hotel needs some maintenance , View amazing staff very good breakfast one of the best 
297481,Gran Hotel La Florida, Maybe to include more food options for Vegetarians as that was quite limited Also the bathroom window did not open so was a little difficult to dry and ventilate the toilet shower area , The room was spacious and the bathroom was nice and big shower was great Friendly staff and always helpful Great spa and jacuzzi pool area 
297482,Gran Hotel La Florida, It was cold air at the spa area and none was taking care of towels and hammocks They said the car would sleep inside the parking and when we picked it up the car had slept outside Room service did a mistake twice with the breakfast and with an specific order , Facilities and views are amazing and the staff is very kind 
297483,Gran Hotel La Florida, very minor ice bucket and water boiler should be in the room as a standard thing , wonderful location staff pro active and friendly breakfast buffet really good valet parking spacious bathroom
297484,Gran Hotel La Florida, Bad Smell in the Bathrooms Room Service very long and forgot our order Curtains broke Phones not working All the services offered are Very Expensive ,No Positive
297485,Gran Hotel La Florida, Nothing that would make me stay away but the staff are variable in their behaviour not all of them in line with the property s standing WiFi can be erratic in the rooms Some technical issues in the bathroom e g water leakage , This is a splendid building with a magnificent view over the city and luxurious interiors It feels very old world almost from another era but with updated decor Beautiful pool and spa area Spacious rooms with high ceilings Comfortable bedding 
297486,Gran Hotel La Florida, AC not working blowing hot air no drinking water in the rooms we had to request for it staff forgot our wake up call we were really luck arriving 5 minutes before check IN closing, Location and the bed
297487,Gran Hotel La Florida, no wifi in our room at all gave us 1 bed instead of 2 although I booked double room we were 2 big guys travelling didn t manage the situation well did not offer anything extra for the issue they caused even said we will not be charging you for the extra bed which we would normally do like a behaviour of a 3 star hotel , staff in restaurant nice dinner breakfast view from the room is really beautiful
297488,Gran Hotel La Florida, Wow where to start here As a multi time visitor to this hotel I ve had first hand experience of the changes over the years I have to say that this visit did not impress me for a 5 hotel Its most definitely gone downhill over the last few years DAY 1 Checkin Arrived early at 11 30 not really a problem we went for a swim and some lunch and was told that they d come find us if the room was available before the 3pm checkin They didnt come and find us Arrive back at the front desk at 3pm Room not ready Just a few minutes Mr xxxx no problem we ll wait here reception After 20 minutes they go chase house keeping again after a prompt by me I ve two small children travelling with me since 5am and by this point we want a shower before we go out No problem just one minute they are cleaning the windows A further 25 minutes I walk the few metres to the reception to chase again no not ready So we leave the few small items we have and we go out to the fairground to make the most of the day Thanks for keeping me and my small children sat in reception for 45 minutes No apology no glass of wine no drinks for the children Mediocre check in experience Return after a excellent few hours at the nearby attraction to be met by the same person who d basically span me a line at checkin He did take the time to gesture to his colleagues with raised eyebrows and a shrug of the shoulders when he saw me approaching nice professional touch We are shown to the room by the said person all cocky now the room is ready its now 8pm only to open the door and find that the room is made up for a couple no beds for my children So here we go again housekeeping contacted and we sat for a further 30 minutes as beds were wheeled in made up etc Beds rollup Z BEDS and definitely not the proper single beds on the website photos , Well lets be frank I ve been coming to this hotel since 2003 and had stayed numerous times over the years So I have to say I m fairly familiar with it and its history The views its difficult to take anything from this hotels views over Barcelona Stunning views about sums it up Fellipe excuse the spelling on room service Easily the best most helpful member of staff on the team 
297489,Gran Hotel La Florida, Small maintenance issues evident in many places No bathroom door showers out of order in spa toilet door handle falling off in WC loose fittings All small things but lots of them Maintenance manager with arrention to detail and a budget very urgently required , Spectacular view Very friendly helpful staff Wedding we were attending was very well handled 
297490,Gran Hotel La Florida, One of the female staff at the hotel probably needs to learn how to treat your customers When we checked in we were told repeatedly that we hadnt pre paid for breakfast and despite showing bills and confirmations they refused to take our word We re talking 100 pounds for breakfasts Once she stopped being difficult and double checked she found that we had indeed paid for it but she didnt apologise until i hinted it Just a totally retarded way of talking to your customer And not the greeting you expect when u arrive at a five star location I will not go back to this place unless they are on some riddic discount where i wudnt care abt service but just use their facilities at a fraction of the price Im sure she didnt even understand how they come across You dont just say no to peoples face repeatedly and question their credibility when they are your customers They overcharge u on everything btw ,No Positive
297491,Gran Hotel La Florida, Where to start this time Paying 28euros each for breakfast when all I wanted was a cup of coffee and a croissant The handle falling off the toilet door and getting locked in for 30 mins the staff not seeming bothered when I told them Getting asked for a 30euro charge to pay for an extra 2 hours on room for a late departure when my pregnant wife really needed a sleep at lunchtime This hotel used to be my favourite hotel in my favourite city but it isn t anymore Shame as I have been coming since 2003 It feels like you are less 5 star and more about charging a price for everything , The more relaxed dining experience on the terrace is excellent
297492,Gran Hotel La Florida, Its a shame to have to be negative about this place but it deserves a grilling as it could be so much better The staff are very friendly however they steer cleer of any problems and will pass it round the table hoping you will just disapear All staff seem to be doing every job conceivable it reminded me a little of the Carry on Movie when they visited Hels Bels Dont have a clue about how to deal with families wanted to put my young children in a seperate room on a different floor my 10year old a type 1 diabetic and then tried to charge me 50 a night extra for a foldaway bed when i told them he would have to stay with us as we didnt have the joining rooms requested It would help if at least one of the staff actually had children of their own so they would know how to behave Very money orientated did not inform any of the guests that the whole restaurant had been booked out for a private function which as you can imagine makes things a little more than difficult when you have a diabetic son halfway up a mountain and are now forced to eat whatever is on offer Areas of the hotel gardens always being partitioned off for weddings or corporate events can make it a bit uncomfortable as the pool and bar area is amidst all this come on who wants to be walking about in their swimsuit at a wedding or their bosses work do The staff do try hard and are more than friendly but i would recommend they actually experience a 5 Star hotel so they know what a guest would expect If your intending on touring the city and surrounding areas Make sure you have a car and they do charge 17 a night for parking which cannot be avoided as there is literally no where else to park , Mountain top location makes excellent getaway from crowded city Lovely pool swim from inside to outdoors Good Gym facilities and excellent spa overall a very nice hotel good food in the restaurant although very over priced I paid less in town at a 2 Michelin Star restaurant Good sized rooms well furnished and well kept Views are the best you will get overlooking Barcelona 
297493,Gran Hotel La Florida,No Negative, Got upgraded from jr suite with mountain view to jr suite with city view man was it breathtaking Decor facilities food rooms service top notch 
297494,Gran Hotel La Florida, We had a room with our own terrace sunbeds This was a great idea unless people in rooms on floors above smoke on their balconies twice we had a cigarette burn on the sunbed , Staff were very friendly and obliging Location and views were amazing Room was very spacious and food was great 
297495,Gran Hotel La Florida, Breakfast not included and nowhere to get a cup of coffee in the morning unless you pay 30 euros for breakfast , Free candy and nice staff except for managers
297496,Gran Hotel La Florida, Genius pack person at reception told me that early check in is available only if there is availability the same answer I have received regarding late check out eventually I was allowed to stay one extra hour only At the check in we arrived at 12 50 we were told that whenever room is ready normal check in time is 15 00 someone from reception gonna find us in the lobby swimming pool and inform us that we can proceed to the room but no one appeared and around 6pm we went to reception to check it ourselves ,No Positive
297497,Gran Hotel La Florida, Price of food and drink was very unreasonable for example 8 euros for half lager or 28 euros for breakfast not good value for money Also the selection of food available is poor, Huge bed and bathroom area very gorgeous room with fabulous views
297498,Gran Hotel La Florida, Upon arrival the welcoming was great howvever you then go in to the reception area and found the staff a little bit rude Other than that great all around , Fabulous hotel Location is superb with fantastic views of Barcelona city Hotel provides everything you want for a great holiday The hotel kindly gave us a free birthday cake as this trip was on behalf of my girlfriends birthday found this really welcoming and respectful 
297499,Gran Hotel La Florida, Very inconvenient timings of the shuttle back from the city center last one comes back at around 7 pm Some of the reception staff are unfriendly and not very willing to help though some are very welcoming it s a hit or miss Most of the furniture and decor in the room are a little worn out feels like they haven t been renovated updated in many years , Fantastic views Super comfortable huge bed just the right softness like a cloud Big spacious bathroom Nice toiletries Great swimming pool 
297500,Gran Hotel La Florida, No toorhpaste toothbrushes or shaver in the room Only 2 robes we were 3 Air conditioning did not work and nobody could fix it It is funny because Is a 5 stars GL , Hotel Is very nice
297501,Gran Hotel La Florida, The personel is in general very efficient and friendly but some are not always very profesional and do not deserve to work in such a GL 5 hotel Despite a panel please do not disturb two employees came into the room in two different occasions The breakfast is quite similar to a 4 so not very impressive The outside pool is very little and quickly busy There s no door separing the room from the badroom , Amazing location for a historic hotel with great views of Barcelona Majestuc building that transports you back to the 40 s Nice rooms suite junior with all the modern confort you need 
297502,Gran Hotel La Florida, Food Its either a super expensive meal or bad room service food Would have liked to see more options for regular prices mainly because its a bit far from the city to have meals away at all times expect paying 20euros each way to the city if you miss the bad timing of the free shuttle Other than that its an amazing hotel , Bed is huge view is breathtaking staff is friendly and attentive Nice for a few days away from the city without being too far away The rooms are huge and it is def one of the top hotels Ive ever stayed at 
297503,Gran Hotel La Florida, Everything, Nothing This hotel is expensive and non attentive Everything was chargeable even tea and coffee No kettle or cups were provided And when asked was given an old kettle but no tea or coffee 6 for a tea bag Horrific experience Location was actually 30mins drive from city center not 15 min Only good point is the view the hotel had overlooking Barcelona Apart from that I did not like anything else 
297504,Gran Hotel La Florida, Cleanliness of room upgraded to Japanese suite however jacuzzi was filthy the bathroom had a sewage smell , Facilities spa and pool etc were great as were the restaurants 
297505,Gran Hotel La Florida, I dont like how people job in that hotel have not education Womans clean very bad persons , They are so racist the people job there I dont back anymore 
297506,Gran Hotel La Florida, The staff is absolutely unfriendly They are so cold that it makes you feel embarrassed in any interaction all the time The friendly ones always seem to be overloaded with the work to be done We ve ordered two glasses of Cava in the swimming pool and half hour later we needed to cancel the order as they haven t been served Although the hotel is classified as a 5 stars GL this doesn t reflect the reality there s an aim of looking like sumptuous and definitely there s beauty everywhere but they are so far away of providing high levels of service that I do NOT recommend it at all I know Barcelona by heart and there are plenty of much much better staying options , The views from Barcelona are awesome and the room has a beautiful relaxed style and is pretty much comfortable The international breakfast is very good 
297507,Gran Hotel La Florida, Did not like to wait until 3 30pm to get our room also we did not like the attitude of one staff member saying it is company policy not to let customers in the room until after 3pm but the room was very nice once in, The rooms we had as we stayed twice were terrace rooms and both very good
297508,Gran Hotel La Florida, We had to move hotels last day of holiday and bathroom facilities had leaks and the shower handle did not work But all was dealt with in a professional manner , Fabulous views from the hotel looking over Barcelona clean and comfortable accommodation with well groomed staff 
297509,Gran Hotel La Florida, Inaccurate description of room information city views sea views and mountain view can be a bit confusing and under some room descriptions you can find pictures that are not real for that type of room so you can easily end up in a room that doesn t match what you are expecting When showed that inaccuracy to the hotel staff in their website the answer was you can always turn your head 90 degrees and you will have sea views, Amazing views but not from the deluxe terrace although it looks like from the pictures
297510,Gran Hotel La Florida, There was an event on while we were staying so unfortunatley there was some construction that went on through the night for our first night although we were moved rooms to a quieter room after bringing this to attention Of staff , Staff pool room service menu buffet breakfast was amazing view was incredible hotel is really grrat value for money in a beautiful outer area of barcelona
297511,Gran Hotel La Florida, The breakfast was very good but very expensive It was going to cost us 50 euro for breakfast for 1 day for a family of 4 While it had everything I think it was a little overpriced , Excellent service The room was amazing along with the view The food was delicious as well I would go back again 
297512,Gran Hotel La Florida, wedding weekend means a lot of maintainance work noice You can only partly use the pool the gym relaxing imposible gym is very small not really a gym rooms need a renovation most of the staff are impolite noice from fun park,No Positive

297514,Gran Hotel La Florida, This time we stayed 5 days The only day that the sun shined You where sanding the wood of the terrace so made us leave The other days it was raining and there was not so much to do in the hotel Also the staff was very busy with the planned events of different groups Hopefully next time more sunshine , La Florida is a nice comfortable hotel when the sun shines Amazing view over Barcelona We visited several times and I also organized a work event before Overall positive and relaxed experience 
297515,Gran Hotel La Florida, There was lots of work going on a floor being replaced in one of the restaurants and maintenance going on outside which we were not aware of when we booked It didn t really affect us too much and I guess it is good that the hotel is being kept well maintained , Magnificent View of Barcelona great food and lovely staff Definitely worthy of its 5 stars
297516,Gran Hotel La Florida, Room needed renovation loud fun park next to hotel and biggest mobile antenna of Barcelona busy Spa not enough beds food is average, view of Barcelona
297517,Gran Hotel La Florida, I requested a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries on arrival as it was our anniversary but they must have got confused somewhere along the way as instead I had a chocolate cake and a card wishing me a happy birthday it was good for communal value of nothing else , The bed was the comfiest bed I ve ever slept in and the breakfast was amazing Also the hotel air freshener It was so good I bought some 
297518,Gran Hotel La Florida, Getting into Barcelona centre is a 30min taxi drive which costs around 20 30 euros The hotel does offer a free shuttle service but we never used it as we went into town late at night The hotel was having a refurbishment on our second day so we couldn t use the pools gym or sauna , After a phone call before we flew we were informed the hotel had double booked us and they had sorted us accommodation elsewhere for the night The hotel we went to was amazing and hotel Florida picked up the bill When we got to Florida they upgraded us we had free champagne and chocolate strawberries on arrival to our presidential suite We were then offered a free evening meal at the hotels informal restaurant The views the hotel offers are incredible The staff are excellent and turn down the rooms Everything was excellent with the stay The quality of service at the spa is excellent

297520,Gran Hotel La Florida, Parking was tried to be charged on 2 separate occasions even tho it was included in the booking Breakfast was very very expensive , The view is stunning from the terrace rooms albeit a little loud with the amusement park next door but not at all bad The staff are excellent and attentive 
297521,Gran Hotel La Florida, The food and drink was a little over priced No tea and coffee facilities in the room so ordered 2 pots of green tea in the lounge and got charged 12 for what is ultimately just a tea bag and hot water Breakfast was nice but could have offered a bit more The poached eggs came out very undercooked most days so had to ask for them to re do them , Absolutely stunning views from the hills looking over the city and sea Great deco very stylish and staff provided 5 service Perfect to escape the chaos of the city 
297522,Gran Hotel La Florida, Traveling with 5 people in Spain is difficult for taxi travels Not an issue with the hotel but if you have a large party plan for splitting up and a little extra time getting a car s to town About 15 minutes down the hill , Extremely elegant but casual atmosphere Sitting areas throughout and it is as though it is an expansive living space The family room was spacious and well appointed with plush towels robes and bedding The hotel is true luxury A very short walk away from the Teplo Exporiatorio De Espana and the connecting amusment park Parc d Atraccions Tribado which was fun for the kids A view of all of Barcelona and beyond 
297523,Gran Hotel La Florida, Room needed a lick of paint A bit expensive , beds so comfortable staff so attentive wine waitress in Orangerie so knowledgable Everyone helped us one of the gardeners did not know the name of a tree but found out for us 
297524,Gran Hotel La Florida, The frequency of the shuttle bus provided by a hotel is low It would be appreciated if it can be increased Otherwise it costs 10 15 euro to the nearest Metro station , Calm and peaceful environment Staff is friendly and well trained 
297525,Gran Hotel La Florida, The facilities could be improved by having a shuttle bus that could accommodate more than 6 people , The room was fantastic and the views across the city were breath taking It was great to relax in the hot tub after a day of sight seeing 
297526,Gran Hotel La Florida, NO ROOM SERVICE NO FOOD FROM 23H AT ALL NOT EVEN A PIECE OF BREAD HORRIBLE QUALITY OF FOOD IN BREAKFAST PROBLEMS WITH MAINTENANCE PROBLEMS WITH WORKERS LAYING ALL THE TIME I LEFT SOON TO SET AN END TO THE BAD EXPERIENCE SO I DIDNT TRY THE SPA IM 100 SURE ALL THE GOOD COMMENTS ARE LAYS FROM FRIENDS OF THE BUSINESS ITS IMPOSIBLE TO HAVE A NIVE TIME HERE ALL THE SERVICE IS A COMPLET DISASTER DON T DESERVE EVEN 2 STARS ,No Positive
297527,Gran Hotel La Florida, The fact we had to leave , The staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful they made us feel so welcome The location is great if you want to be out of the city a taxi isn t too expensive c 15 20 to La Sagrada Familia and the funicular from Tibidabo is useful but closes early out of high season Well worth it for the views and facilities the spa is great and the pool gym small but very welcome after a day out 
297528,Gran Hotel La Florida,No Negative, breakfast with views Restaurant staff very professional and diligent Either dir dinner and breakfast Service room was brilliant And check in staff very welcoming and helpful 
297529,Gran Hotel La Florida, the knife for the smoked sausage was not sharp enough it was not possible to cut it at all when I asked for the better knife I was promised to get one but after all it was the same sausage and the same knife for a 3 days of our stay so we didn t have a chance to try one Too bad , the staff was extremely helpful especially when we asked to help us with getting tickets for the football game they just get for us the best places in a very short time and just before a game it was unforgettable experience for my 11 old son a big fun of FCB 
297530,Gran Hotel La Florida, Shuttle bus to city centre only runs three times a day 10 12 16 and only carries 6 people but reception can call for a taxi with 10 15 minute notice , Excellent location in mountains above Barcelona allowing a hybrid city break resort vacation Short though uphill walk to the Sagrat Cor basilica church at Tibidabo which has a beautiful interior and wonderful view Indoor pool and hot tub was beautiful and warm enough to swim on cool spring mornings We had a luxurious room with fine mountain view and huge bathroom My vegan teenaged daughter loved the tofu and vegetable toasted sandwiches 
297531,Gran Hotel La Florida, Room wasn t that much clean Hairs were in the bathroom and not full amenities equipped I had to ask for things several times I expected the L OCCITANE spa would be very nice but it wasn t The spa was operated by only one therapist despite of the size of the spa and no shower room in the treatment room , The view from room was nice Pretty quiet room Most of the employees were nice The hotel have warm temperature pool but never got the chance to use it 
297532,Gran Hotel La Florida, I ve stayed at this hotel four times before The first two times were great the last time I felt that it was going down hill I thought that I d give it another go but was once again disappointed The whole place has an air of a hotel in financial difficulty There used to be a large gym now there is gym equipment around the indoor swimming pool and a tiny room with a few machines There is a wall where there used to be a steam room This is a five star grand deluxe hotel that had no water in the water machine around the pool for three days of our stay They have reduced the room prices a lot since our last stay It seems that they have done this to fill the rooms and then make their money from the extortionate bar and restaurant prices It s 5 00 for a coffee 6 00 for a small beer 20 00 for a G T 28 00 a plate of ham with bread I personally love the location of the hotel as I used to live 1km away and have friends in the area But as a base for a stay in Barcelona it is not a great choice It is far away from the centre and the hotel shuttle to the centre runs three times a day at 10 00 12 00 16 00 with the return journeys thirty minutes later Why is there no evening late night transportation Again this smacks of a hotel trying to get people back there as early a possible to try to make a profit I am not certain but I do not think that this used to be the case I ve noticed that from my responses to different aspects of the hotel that Booking com has given the hotel a rating of under 6 out of 10 this is probably unfair as this is still a very good hotel but if you are expecting this to be what is once was or are looking for a truly five star experience then sadly I expect that you will be disappointed ,No Positive
297533,Gran Hotel La Florida, I guess the distance to the center might be a problem for some people , The service was top class we were even offered a glass of cava during the check in The view from the room was spectacular and the bed very comfortable I would go back anytime
