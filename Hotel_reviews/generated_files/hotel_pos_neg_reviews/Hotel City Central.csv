465289,Hotel City Central, The room this second time was a little sad but it is very clean The first time we had a corner room on the 5th floor and it was bigger with a view This time I asked for a room with view of the courtyard and it was a smaller room overlooking the glass roof to the breakfast room , This is our second time in this hotel The location breakfast and staff are great Mr Marco at reception is an exceptional host and goes way above and beyond the routine The breakfast is exceptional in all aspects I would recommend this hotel and would return again 
465290,Hotel City Central, There is limit for using wifi It s not so convenience for us For example we have two computers and two cell phone The limit is up to 3 units It means that there is one facility have to got out of wifi , The breakfast is good 
465291,Hotel City Central, The bedroom the bedroom was the worst of any 3 4 star hotel I had stayed in The pictures are misleading be warned The bedroom was too small with almost no place to put your clothes away or your luggage without being in the way On top of that the decor and objects in the room were very outdated with a sofa that had dirty fabric It s also very inconvenient that they don t leave basic things like conditioner in the bathroom Forget about nicer things to have in the room like a kettle for tea Last the room has a TV but it s smaller than an office monitor and was hanged in a corner facing literally nowhere , Staff at reception was friendly and multilingual Breakfast was very nice 
465292,Hotel City Central, A lobby and checkin area that is more updated would seem friendlier , We enjoyed our stay very much great location and close to everything we needed tour bus bank grocery store next door even a small restaurant for take out the one night we were too exhausted to go out The lobby however needs updating feels like you re stuck in the 80 s but nice to be able to have a glass of wine or other drink there on honor system Breakfast was amazing and totally enjoyable from selection to service

465305,Hotel City Central, As mentioned by others the air con in the room is rather noisy but also essential it was 29degrees when we were there The shower was an over the bath type no problem but needed a new hose as the outer layer on it was broken near the top so the shower head kept drooping downwards While using the shower the temperature kept changing and nearly got scolded on one occasion Needs a hook put back on the bathroom door , Only a 5min walk to the centre with everything nearby The hotels breakfast was an excellent buffet and they will cook you eggs if you want them The staff were so helpful and told us about the best places and ways to travel on the public transport system They also sell tickets to a lot of the main attractions at the hotel at the normal prices which makes planning your trips out so much easier The city sightseeing buses have a stop right outside the hotel and the hop on hop off bus is a great way to get to the attractions I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be back again

465337,Hotel City Central, Rooms need renovation The hotel is showing its age and is hard to put it next to others 4 hotels especially new ones not a fan of the fully carpeted floor but I suppose this is Vienna and hey I leave in UK this German Dutch toilet bowl is weird and hard to get used to it if you are not a previous user Elevator was broken and our room was on the 3rd floor To all fairness though it was fixed after 1 1 5 days and didn t bother us but could be an issue for people of greater age , Breakfast comes first and then the rest Breakfast was absolutely FANTASTIC and was served till late morning in an great atrium with an adjacent large seating space The variety of products being offered was stunning 3 4no different types of yoghurt 10no different types of seeds fruit pastry eggs you name it to the rest now The hotel is located in a rather central location and you can walk down to the centre in 10 minutes Room was clean with confy beds have asked for a double one but got 2no single ones side by side but didn t matter to us anyway and were changing sheets tidying up every day Decoration was rather heavy and Viennese but hey you are in Vienna after all Special mentioning is required for the room temperature since we travelled in December and Vienna was coooold The room was always really warm and you could adjust the heat from the cap valve of the radiator should you wish Bathroom was ok but with hot water as and when needed Next to the hotel there is a supermarket which is really convenient for grabbing anything required or your munchies

465392,Hotel City Central, Thin walls Room interiors look old and worn Average breakfast The cold cuts were not refrigerated Some of the softer cheeses had a cooling plate but were on a porcelain plate thus mostly negating the cooling effect The staff do not know how to cook an omelet should be a bit soft runny on the inside The filter coffee did not taste good and you had to request it from staff I expected them to serve tea and coffee at the table without needing to request it first Visibly worn sheets Two of the sheets had one hole each Room cleaning and minibar accounting issues This was ultimately handled properly by the reception staff , Great location Comfortable beds twin beds Helpful staff Nice looking breakfast area Breakfast included and you could order boiled eggs omelets fried eggs from the staff free of charge The espresso coffee at breakfast was good Add a little hot tea water if you want something similar to filter coffee

465469,Hotel City Central, I am not too fussy when it comes to accommodation and rarely spend more than 100AUD a night when travelling We had been travelling for 5 weeks throughout Europe before arriving at this hotel and I had been suitably impressed with all of our accommodation choices prior I have barely made a negative comment about a hotel guest house however I was very disappointed by the quality of this hotel I understand that hotels dramatically increase prices over Christmas New Year periods however the price of this hotel compared to other hotels we had stayed in prior to our arrival and the value for money disappointed us Shortly after check in my husband and I were getting changed when there was a knock at the door by housekeeping I advised them to wait a second but before I had a chance to cover myself in so much as a shirt the lady had unlocked the door and walked in on my naked self all for the sakes of ensuring the mini bar had been restocked with a missing Pepsi I was astounded at the amount of dirt dust hair and even rubbish there was on the carpets which looked like the original carpet It was like the carpet hadn t been vacuumed in weeks let alone shampooed at all The hand soap bottle was covered in makeup from the previous occupant and had not been cleaned away The pillows regardless of the fact that they have a pillow menu were flat and uncomfortable The hotel is called City Central but it is quite a walk to some of the major attractions being that it is towards the business centre I guess New Town as opposed to Old Town I also noticed that the booking we made on booking com was different to the booking confirmation we received I booked a room with a king size bed and bathtub only to have been given a booking confirmation silly me for not checking of a double bed and no mention of a bath The bed was the smallest we have had all trip and no bath , The staff at this hotel were very friendly and were more than happy to assist with our enquiries Breakfast was wonderful with a wide variety of choices

465513,Hotel City Central, my only criticism was it would have been nice to have a welcome pack of tea coffee etc on 1st night as we arrived on a Sunday and couldn t find any shop open Next day discovered supermarket next door, Stayed in the self catering apartment near hotel the apartment was spotlessly clean very spacious and comfy bed Two supermarket s close by but they don t seem to open on a Sunday so be aware if you arrive them The hotel apartment is only 5 10 mins from centre with good eating places nearby The area feels very safe
