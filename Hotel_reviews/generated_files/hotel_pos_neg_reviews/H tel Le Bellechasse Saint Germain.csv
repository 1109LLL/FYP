250321,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain,No Negative, Fantasticly positioned for the heart of Paris Quirky friendly and so very helpful Nothing was too much trouble Even order for flowers not too much trouble Noemie was a star Would come back time and time again 
250322,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, See above, The staff was too young and lacking in knowledge to be helpful although they were very nice The bar was wholly uncomfortable The croissants were the worst in Paris The bars of soap were tiny The hotel is very quiet for Paris 
250323,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain,No Negative, Customer care was beyond excellent The breakfast was very good and the staff was attentive and cordial Even though the rooms are on the small side they are charming and clean The hotel location is excellent for visiting the D Orsay and the Louvre the Tuilleries and crossing the river to Rue de Rivoli There are plenty of good brasseries close by We were helped with reservations taxis airport transportation etc Before our arrival I was able to communicate with them by email when I was arranging my train tickets to Paris The staff speak French English and Spanish so communication is no problem I have no complaints about The Bellechasse only praise 
250324,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, Nothing everything was perfect dry cleaning was expensive That was the only small concern, Excellent staff the always went out of their way to help you that is everyone we came in contact with
250325,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain,No Negative, Divine bed wish we had longer than one night to enjoy its comfort properly really tastefully decorated The staff were very courteous and helpful in all ways Location of the hotel is perfect romantic place ideal to bring your partner Love Paris and the stay here made it even better
250326,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, The room was very warm even with the heater off so I had to keep opening the windows but it was a lovely weekend so there was a nice breeze and we weren t overlooked at all at the back , The location was perfect to explore the good parts of the city and all the attractions It was right next the river It was down a side street so really quiet Quirky rooms Staff were friendliest people we meet all weekend Couldn t do enough for us brilliant 
250327,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, If you are sensitive to noise you might want to ask for a room off the street I like to sleep with my window open so that was a bit of a problem with revelers on the street below The closed window however adequately blocked out the noise , La Bellechasse presents itself as a hotel with class and dignity boutique style It is tucked into a tiny street right next to the Mus e d Orsay and is perfect for a visit to the great sights of Paris It is close to the metro and trains The room was beautifully appointed the bed was comfortable the bath and shower new and well designed The breakfast was very nice with complementary newspapers A happy hour was also offered with a pleassant bar area and comfortable arm chairs Lovely lovely hotel 
250328,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, It was quite loud Slamming doors from other rooms hammer all over our bed , Perfect location for walking to the museums or just at the Seine Very welcoming Staff 
250329,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain,No Negative, The most comfortable bed in a hotel ever Really friendly and helpful staff Fantastic location for exploring Paris Great breakfast with tons of options including for vegan 
250330,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain,No Negative, Small intimate hotel really unusually decorated which adds to the feeling that it s somewhere a bit different in a good way Friendly helpful staff and a great breakfast
250331,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, The room had a bath in the middle of it and the shower fitting wasn t really very good not what I would describe as luxury , The location of the hotel was excellent
250332,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain,No Negative, The location of this hotel is what you are paying for and it is EXCELLENT You are a block from Musee D Orsay which means a block from the Metro and the hop on hop off buses and other public transport Cafes are nearby and it s easy to walk to all the major sites in that area So that s reason 1 to stay there The rest of the reasons are easy too friendly staff speaks a number of languages good bar and cafe on site rooms are small but creatively decorated and absolutely comfortable and cozy No amenity other than extra space is overlooked There is a small elevator lift 
250333,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, Swelteringly hot in the common areas very little public space in which to gather and meet the room was very dimly lit , Phenomenal location wonderful staff great breakfast modern fixtures very clean and quiet 
250334,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, no door to the bathroom bathwater took quite a while to heat no coffee maker no egg station, interior of the hotel and the rooms location near the museum friendly and helpful staff
250335,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, Can t think of anything , Stunning interiors in this fabulous boutique hotel Excellent front of house staff Super comfy bed and squishy pillows Almost next door to a couple of major museums Small but perfectly formed room Really loved it 
250336,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain,No Negative, The staff was exceptional Very friendly and helpful The room was gorgeous so unique and unlike any hotel room I ve ever stayed in The breakfast was amazing and the breakfast room was so comfortable and inviting Very quiet and extremely convenient location just steps from the Mus e D Orsay and a short walk to the Louvre This was our first trip to Paris and we will definitely be coming back and staying at this hotel 
250337,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, This hotel does not have tea or coffee making facilities in the room Therefore you can t make a cuppa with your favourite tea or when you really want one , I liked the eclectic room decor and the staff were fantastic 
250338,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, The hotel seems to be a little rundown as far as maintenance it almost did not feel like a 4 star hotel The lobby is not very inviting nor beautiful The design by Christian Lacroix makes it interesting but yet its still lacks luxury They definitely had a great photographer because unfortunately the hotel did not look like in the photos Breakfast was expensive , The hotel is in a great location We liked the decoration of the room inspired by Christian Lacroix and the room had a free standing bath tub The room was small but the bed was comfortable Overall our stay was pleasant The staff was very accommodating and made sure we had the room we most liked 
250339,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, Room quite small Reception area too small to move around without people having to move their chairs to allow people to pass by , Receptionist was very helpful
250340,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, small rooms common for such a location and would have liked to have a drink upon returning to hotel after dinner but bar was closed , Location was terrific
250341,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, It s metro accessible and right next to a museum but the part of paris its in is mostly government buildings so it lacks in a certain small restaurant charm that you d find in the Marai , The room itself was lovely and the staff was very helpful 
250342,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, While the room was gorgeous the mattress was broken down On the first night after a long day of business meetings got back to the room and collapsed in bed only to wake up a couple of hours later with severe pain in the hip Eventually I found one part of the mattress that wasn t totally broken down and managed to sleep through the night In a similar vein visually the bathroom was beautiful but the shower was designed by someone with a wonderful design aesthetic but no concept of practical use , The hotel is beautiful A great deal of attention has gone into eye catching design Location is great close to the Seine a couple of blocks from the National Assembly and a few minutes walk to the wonderful Left Bank area 
250343,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, Tiny room mattress too soft very expensive for what offered I don t recommend , just the decor of the hotel is nice but not worthed for the price

250346,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, The showerhead and shower were difficult to position to keep water from spraying on the floor The foot of the bed was too close to the wall making it difficult to get to the other side of the room , The staff were very helpful in finding us places to eat and providing directions to places we wanted to visit in addition to being very friendly The room decor and hotel were gorgeous so perfect for Paris And the bathroom was surprisingly spacious 
250347,H tel Le Bellechasse Saint Germain, The restaurant is open only for breakfast but there are so many places to eat around the hotel that this is a minor inconvenience , I was very impressed with this hotel The location is excellent the staff very friendly and the rooms impeccable It s great value for money and matches the best five star hotels I have stayed in in Paris and elsewhere I love the small terrace and the design concept All in all a wonderful experience
