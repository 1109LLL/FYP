277434,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Only thin cotton sheet on beds perfectly warm enough though Nothing really Stairs were spiral and very steep take the lift , Very large double bed bigger than kingsize Spotlessly clean throughout Spacious family room Shower and bathroom area modern and clean Two separate sinks very handy for a family Airconditioning Mini bar fridge in hotel we took some of their items out and used it for own water wine etc Two supermarkets in neighbouing street for water drinks breakfast things if required 
277435,Wilson Boutique Hotel, nothing, the welcome from the staff the friendliness and breakfast value for money the surroundings feeling safe at night with two teenagers and plenty of restaurants around
277436,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Lack of Russian TV channels , The staff was very friendly and was always ready to help Very tasty breakfasts especially liked the variety Nice balcony on the 7th floor where it is nice to sit with a cup of coffee or a glass of wine Excellent and cozy room Spacious enough Cleaning is very clean and every day 
277437,Wilson Boutique Hotel, We were ripped off by the taxi thst the hotel booked us to the station Be careful as they charged extra for luggage and a mini van that we didn t need and the hotel pick up so beware The hotel is out of the main city but was within easy reach of most places by taxi, We were in a suite which was very nice Staff were very friendly Hop on bus was just across the street
277438,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The shower facilities were a little poor not much pressure from the shower head and also the water did go cold quite often I would also say the pillows on the bed would maybe need changing too as they were quite small and uncomfortable at times , The staff at this hotel were extremely helpful I came to visit Barcelona for my boyfriends special birthday and I emailed the hotel asking if they could prepare some champagne for when we arrived When we arrived the champagne was waiting on ice for us along with some chocolate truffles and an amazing view A fantastic place to stay for a couple who are wanting a romantic weekend away Will be highly recommending to other people 
277439,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, bed was very comfortable breakfast was available and room was cleaned every day Staff went out of their way to be helpful Location was great for our purposes Surrounding area was very quiet and we were able to go out at night to the local venues and feel secure 
277440,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Breakfast would be better if fresh eggs were offered , Cozy place just outside the frenetic center of Barcelona Nice building Suites have a unique structure based on the curved early 20th century architecture All staff has a good attitude and gives the feeling of having worked together for a while 
277441,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The staff unfortunately doesnt speak English very well They couldn t recommend any nice bar or restaurant in the neighborhood When we asked for a nice place to have drinks they just boldly answered NO The rooms and accommodation in general isn t in proportion with the price they charge you , Location is nice 
277442,Wilson Boutique Hotel, If you will hang out in the beach mostly it is a bit far away 30 min one way Also at dinner the most crowded places like Barri Gotic is not so close , Bus stops close to the hotel 
277443,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Bathroom smell to heavy to cleaning products Only one elevator you have to wait a lot in peak hours or take the stairs A bit too pricy, Location friendly staff I got the penthouse room impressive views of the Diagonal
277444,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The bed was comfortable and given the hotel is on a main road it is quiet and the breakfast was excellent and the staff are very helpful It is so easy to get around from this hotel with bus connections right outside the hotel including to the main train station connecting to other cities Great cafes and restaurants nearby Highly recommend 
277445,Wilson Boutique Hotel, We had two rooms on floor 2 and 5 The one on the second floor was quite dark I also don t understand why Design and boutique hotel usually equals bathroom toilet with glass walls and door Okay it wasn t see through but a little privacy would be nice Also there is no place where to hang towels to dry, The location of the hotel was really good and the rooms were clean and had enough space for 3 adults Really handy that the toilet and the shower were separate Passeig de Gracia with the shopping street was in a walking distance there were also a lot of nice restaurants nearby 
277446,Wilson Boutique Hotel, No swimming pool but we didn t need one and to be honest going to Barcelona for a city break I don t really think you do but as an option it would probably make it s even better, Everything rooms modern and clean Free wifi Trendy decor Very cheap hotel bar Staff extremely helpful Great location 
277447,Wilson Boutique Hotel, There wasn t anything I didn t like , Loved everything about this hotel Staff were really helpful and as we had a late flight the late check out was very convenient and only for 30 euro until 5pm 
277448,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Minor issues The room we were in was a quite odd shape almost like a L Bed was very large so where it was positioned it was very hard to get around The bathroom sink really needed a shelf above so as the shower We stayed 3 nights and our pillowcases never got changed even the sheet was done once I am sure our room was not listed in those photos shown on Booking com so bear in mind that might happy , It was the second time we visited Barcelona so we were quite happy about the hotel s location Easy access from the airport Line 9 and change to Line 5 Diagonal We like walking in general so 20 mins walk to metro station Diagonal was not a problem at all Hotel staff were really helpful during our stay We liked the effect our room was quietly sit on the 7th floor and we were the only room on the left side of the building We also really like the large and comfy bed in our room 
277449,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Everything was excellent , Very original room outstanding design and views Huge bed and quiet atmosphere The bath tub was a good surprise The hotel deserves a better category 
277450,Wilson Boutique Hotel, No complaints , Very friendly and helpful staff Good location outside the city centre but very convenient for public transport The large corner rooms are very nice and spacious with wide views across the Avenida 
277451,Wilson Boutique Hotel, , I researved this hotel for my son and his friend The feedback from him was first about the hotel staff They were superb willing to help you in any matter About the room and other facilities it met the price we paid The hotel is located in the area where tourists can easily get to the tourist sites and lots of restaurants nearby And importantly for one who loves football Wilson Boutique is near CampNou D
277452,Wilson Boutique Hotel, For a suite the bath was a little odd cramped Could use a shelf in the shower for soap etc Breakfast was pretty picked over by the time we came down most days not the best selection of our trip Same decor as our visit five years ago some things could use a spruce but otherwise still a stellar hotel , Our second stay at the Wilson great location for us on Diagonal We booked the suite and got the top floor a huge room but somewhat cramped bathroom Junior suite on the floor below on our previous stay seemed more luxe Views are astounding Feels like home if only we could afford that location 
277453,Wilson Boutique Hotel, You can forget about privacy when using the bathroom There was a transparent sliding door which didn t close completely Additionally the level of cleanliness and a water pressure in the shower were really poor Please be aware that your sleep might be disturbed by noises from other rooms and hallways , Bed and location were excellent 
277454,Wilson Boutique Hotel, There is no bar or cafe but there are excellent ones just beside it so it was fine , This is a lovely small hotel Its well located with lots of bus options right outside the door The reception staff were great and very helpful 
277455,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Limited on site food but plenty of restaurants nearby so not a big problem , This hotel is in a good location for a sight seeing trip to Barcelona The hop on off bus stop is just over the road and the city centre a not too far walk away Hotel is clean and the staff friendly and helpful 
277456,Wilson Boutique Hotel, This hotel had the worst service on floors ever We went out around 11 AM leaving the card inviting the housekeepers to make up the room We came back 5 hours later just to find it exactly as we left it We had to argue with the front desk manager who kept saying it could happen well it is not a hotel of 300 rooms and the floor housekeeper had enough time to do it The housekeeper herself was beyond rude to us I suppose angry because she was about to leave and was forced to do HER JOB and we had a walk of a half an hour despite being tired to allow her to do it Surprise when we came back all she did was put the bed duvet back leaving dust and hair on it by the way She took away every single towel and did not put back clean ones which was something I realised just about I was to take a shower Angry much that she had to work No sign of good will from the hotel whatsoever aside from generic sorry but it is not our fault I suppose it s the guest s fault then , The position is fantastic and the room given to us was beautiful very spacious The young man at the front desk who greeted us was very polite and professional 
277457,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The cleanliness in the bathroom was a bit faulty there were tiny specks of black mold , The size of the bed was awesome the staff was very helpful very easy to get to the hotel and we found in walking distance a lot of nice bars and restaurants 
277458,Wilson Boutique Hotel, I have no complaints drink prices in hotel fair reception staff were polite and knowledgable facilities great no tea coffee facilities, location excellent easy stroll to city centre and Metro Station Digital near also for football fans bus to Neu Camp Stadium right outside hotel entrance
277459,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Small room with limited room for luggage no tissues or soap holders TV reception was intermittent Staff were quite indifferent Tiny reception which was congested when occupied with 3 people Trip advisor rating of 4 stars was in 2015 and needs to be updated This is a 3 star hotel , Quiet room 
277460,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Excellent value do not be put off by the 3 star rating on the door Wonderful cafe for light dinner after a day of walking An 8 Euro 10 minute cab ride from Pl Catalunya where the bus tours start 
277461,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Bed was uncomfortable We were never able to get English TV in spite of it being promised Far from the main tourist attractions We did a lot of walking , Friendly staff Really outstanding Spacious room and bath Balcony very nice 
277462,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The room overall is spacious however a little more attention to detail would make it feel more boutique e g the bathroom products were cheap quality and the hairdryer attachment was dirty and dusty , Overall clean room with good view of the local street Good local shopping and bars 10 minute walk to closest metro station Diagonal which is 3 stops to Liceu La Ramblas and marina Reception staff were good when we had queries or when requesting items such as an iron 
277463,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The room was clean and tidy with working air conditioning The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was good If we returned we would definitely stay again 
277464,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Only one elevator with narrow reception which leads to queuing when there is a large crown Cleaning services needs some improvement and pay more attention to details , Friendly staff that was very hospitable and helpful with maps recommendations and advise We had a terrace room which was really nice and room was spacious Good internet connection Central location with easy access to town 
277465,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The furniture was old inside the room needs some refresh , Breakfast is good the position of the hotel is excelent Two POKESTOPS available from the hotel Free WI FI 
277466,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Great location and great staff The hotel is was very lovely and we enjoyed the breakfasts This boutique hotel has comfortable rooms We enjoyed the beautiful view from our corner room In the heart of beautiful Barcelona but very quiet The staff was very helpful and had great recommendations for dinners and sights 
277467,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Hotel was more frugal than we expected , Hotel location is excellent Room was frugal but adequate Small bath with shower Twin beds were pushed together and were somewhat hard but again adequate Breakfast not included but served in hotel dining room Staff was very helpful 
277468,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Since this is a boutique hotel the room was small but adequate and clean , Very pleasant and helpful staff who could understand English Liked the section of Barcelona where located was fairly quiet and felt safe Easy walk to shops restaurants and some popular tourist spots Close to on off city tour bus stop for access to main city attractions 
277469,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, We booked this hotel for both before and after our cruise The staff was exceptional They took the time to check into hours of operation for sights we wanted to see called taxis and usually were asking us if there was anything we needed before we could think to ask If we go back to Barcelona I know we will be staying again 
277470,Wilson Boutique Hotel, A water cooker would have been nice but that s really a detail , This is a good hotel Everything was as expected Nice room with smart layout relatively big Breakfast is nice too 
277471,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Would be good to have tea making facilities for first thing in the morning , Room was large with good bathroom plus huge balcony Great storage facilities for clothing Good soundproof room with air conditioning Very secure hotel with 24 hr reception and within walking distance of La Ramblas
277472,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Was a little expensive but it s the nature of the city , Great location within walking distance of the main shopping area Lovely friendly staff great selection of food for breakfast Room very comfortable and quiet considering its on a very busy main road 
277473,Wilson Boutique Hotel, the bathroom was a bit cramped in our suite but otherwise it was very nice , When we notified the hotel that there would be 3 of us instead of 2 they suggested we book the attic suite which was really like a penthouse with a private patio and almost 360 deg view of the city it was fabulous 
277474,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Liked everything about the hotel Staff very nice Room very clean Lots of electrical outlets Good wi fi Nice location Nice not to need a car Great breakfast for 12 But small cafes nearby also Very nice stay at a great price for good Barcelona location 
277475,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, My friends and I had a very pleasant stay at the hotel the room was very clean and tidy Location is very central with good transport links on the doorstep Staff were very helpful when we asked for directions to places they were more than happy to help us Breakfast had a fairly limited choice but we were more than happy with what we had I would recommend this hotel 
277476,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, the staff are an absolute delight we stayed there and they were extremely helpful in letting us know how to get around When we we left at our early morning flight everything was ready to checkout and they had ordered a cab for us 
277477,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The bar restaurant was not good at all We had dinner there one evening and didn t return No ambiance just one person doing to cooking and tending to the drinks The food when it finally arrived wasn t good at all and so we ate out for the remainder of our stay for the same price and the food was tastier ,No Positive
277478,Wilson Boutique Hotel, In our room many small lamps and dim lights but no chance to read anything but iPad Forget if you want to read a book in a bed used cleaning chemicals were with very unpleasant strong smell and you need to open a window for really a while to get rid of them , good location friendly people very good breakfast 5th floor with balcony and a nice view 
277479,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Nothing , Beautiful clean hotel friendly staff nothing was to much trouble for them we had a lovely breakfast each morning with a great range of produce free WiFi and a great location we will definitely stay there again 
277480,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Nothing, Despite the main road location rooms were quiet Bar minibar and room service very reasonabley priced Big comfy beds and big choice unhurried breakfast in pleasant room
277481,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The bathroom glass doors made me feel a bit uncomfortable You can t lock the door either In my opinion the rooms should be lighter it is a sunny destination At least our room was a bit dark for me , Excellent location if you want to stay close to the city centre but not IN the city centre The staff was friendly and the room was clean Great shops around as well 
277482,Wilson Boutique Hotel, There was no luggage rack tea coffee facilities in the room not even a notepad and pen was available The room was really dark and very basic very noisy after advertising that the rooms where sound proof but running water can be heard through walls from other rooms using toilet or shower ,No Positive
277483,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Cannot say anything about the food as we didn t eat there Breakfast was not included in the price we went to explore the coffee shops around and we enjoyed the Spanish pastry , We booked two nights for the new Years and it was one of the most beautiful experiences The room was great and spacey clean and comfortable The hotel itself is a beauty classy and well located The view from the room with windows on the three walls of the room was great as well Booking on line I didn t know what to expect and it came out to be a beautiful surprise 
277484,Wilson Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is right on the Diagonal Whilst it is a short walk into the older part of town it is not far and it is easy to get to everywhere from the hotel The rooms are nice sized and the staff were very helpful 
277485,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Late night street noise on some nights that the windows didn t quite block out The hotel offers a dinner menu in the 1st floor restaurant but the choice is very limited , Nice location and breakfasts Easy reach of the tram and rather longer to the Diagonal metro Plenty of places nearby to eat 
277486,Wilson Boutique Hotel, All perfectly , Very stylish hotel Large room Responsive and friendly staff Always willing to help Excellent WiFi Delicious abundant breakfasts Nearby bus stop in any part of the city Prior to the underground 10 minutes on foot Not the center of Barcelona but many points of interest you can walk 
277487,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The room was a little too small and THE WIFI is soooooo slow Other than that not much to criticise, It is so close to Diagonal and you get everywhere super fast There is so many nice little caf s and restaurants in the neighborhood 
277488,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The room wasns t exactly what i expected because the photos posted were only of the suites Fruit served at breakfast was not fresh but canned Orange Juice was not fresh either, The hotel staff as friendly and helpfull The breakfast is good and with many choices 
277489,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The bathroom toilet was the most ridiculous thing I can think of short of a totally open concept bathroom toilet The sink area had no door whatsoever and the toilet and shower had glass doors which only went two thirds of the way in fact more like panels than real doors and opened to the no door sink area In fact there was no privacy whatsoever with respect to light and sound since the whole bedroom sink toilet shower combination was basically one big common room This is beyond cheap The room did not have any kind of real reading lights and had only one sort of armchair , It is not a long walk to the Rambla de Catalunya the barrio Gotic etc Breakfast is good though the variety of fresh fruits and their fresness left to be desired Good sound insulation and air conditionning Staff is helpful and courteous 
277490,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Reception was a bit rude when calling to tell me that it was time to check out I was running about 15 minutes late but they were impatient on the phone Bathroom doesn t offer much privacy , Perfect location great spacious corner room with an amazing view overlooking Diagonal 
277491,Wilson Boutique Hotel, I wouldn t want to stay any longer than one or two nights facilities are somewhat limited , Best location for shops tourist attractions and bus routes 
277492,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The water flow in the shower was not very stable the water was either hot or cold but not mixed together The distance from the metro station is a walking but not very short about 800 meters which may be frustrating when all you want to do is get back to the hotel at night The bus services to the city center is very convenient during the week but not so much on weekends If you are a tourist and want to explore the city this is not the most convenient location , The hotel is very lovely the rooms was small but nicely decorated the balcony was a great addition 
277493,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Staff appeared unaware of internet advise to pre book visit to Gaudi sites to ensure timely entrance All Gaudi sites book in time slots and when arriving without pre booking we were offered entry time 4 and 5 hours later on the same day , Staff very friendly Location away from the busy tourist end of town still within walking distance or quick bus ride
277494,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Hotel s bathroom do not have hanger for hanging clothes when we took our shower the bathroom toilet were made of glass which might bring inconvenience to some people , Excellent service All hotel staff is very helpful helping us calling pocket wifi company when we have problem in the connection n also helped us in booking sagrada familia tickets The hotel even willing to lend us electric kettle at no charge The hotel people is very responsive when we emailed to them 
277495,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Quite far from city center and from any means of transportation The staff is not very welcoming The lamp was noisy and the shower cabin not really well isolated water always leaked to the floor in front of the cabin which is quite annoying in the absence of a mop , The room is spacious 
277496,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The beds were very hard and there were no tea coffee making facilities , The breakfasts were excellent the staff were friendly helpful 
277497,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Didn t like bathroom open to bedroom Difficult at night because switching light on woke up partner No bidet but unnecessary two washbasins instead No plugs for sinks but notice asking guests to save water etc Safe on floor of wardrobe so not easy to access No kettle Towel rack not easily accessible from shower , Location excellent Staff pleasant and helpful with excellent English Room stylish and modern with comfy bed Nice shower Clean 
277498,Wilson Boutique Hotel, The room smelled musty and could do with a freshen up The nights were chilly and the top quilt was in need of a wash as it was stained We paid for a balcony to sit out on at night which was good but access to it wasn t a large door opening into a narrow corridor , Very good location to travel about the city with Metro and Tour bus pick up points near by There are also a number of very pleasant restaurants and small bars in the local area Even with the negatives which are always a personal thing I would go back but leave the balcony out of it as it was expensive 
277499,Wilson Boutique Hotel, When we checked in we were stood for 2 3 minutes with barely any acknowledgement from the staff on reception Not really the sort of thing that bothers me too much overall but I remember not liking it at the time , One of the staff a guy called Badl was incredibly friendly and helpful Went the extra mile and nothing seemed like it was too much trouble Room was spotless and the location was perfect Far enough from the centre to feel out of the hurly burly but close enough to get to the key parts of the city in barely any time at all 
277500,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Nothing missing really, Location of the hotel 20 min walk to city centre but we booked on purpose Im glad we did really quiet neighborhood and many local restaurants and bars nearby Staff very helpful clean hotel 
277501,Wilson Boutique Hotel, Nothing , The staff were wonderful easy to talk to and good in english The room had enough space the bed was comfortable The area where the hotel is is just fantastic and beautiful near the bus stop
