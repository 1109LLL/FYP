59830,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I thought the staff at reception could have been more friendly When I was checking out I wasn t asked if everything was alright I have stayed here a few times before and I thought the whole atmosphere has disimproved somewhat , The room was clean and comfortable The lobby was lovely I liked getting the Irish Independent every day 
59831,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Hotel could put directions on web site telling best route to take to Hotel especially if coming from International Train Station from Paris etc Once you get on the Jubilee line it s a straight shot to Kilburn Station then catch any bus on the same side of the street as the station and on to the Hotel a mile or so this info would have been a big help especially when carrying your luggage , Price and location Bus stop right outside of Hotel short trip to the Kilburn Station tubes trains Located outside of London in an older neighborhood Plenty of Mom and Pop grocery stores and places to eat Bakery right across the street and McDonalds next door 
59832,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Bathroom looked like it needed a refresh but shower was very good and it was very clean Cricklewood High Street isn t the prettiest place in London but that s why the price is reasonable , Handy location for where I needed to get to in North West London Good value price for location and facilities Wifi was fast I could stream Netflix with no issues Very clean and big room I had a double bed and a single bed just for me Very quiet on my floor was on 1 Bus stop just outside hotel only took 5 mins to get to Kilburn Jubilee line tube station which is zone 2 Convenience store across the road from hotel I did not have breakfast or use leisure facilities small gym and pool but they looked good I would stay here again 
59833,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The room was very warm even with the air conditioning set low and on full power It just didn t seem to circulate the room Also unfortunately the area is not ideally situated for using public transport especially as the closest route closes early ,No Positive
59834,Clayton Crown Hotel London, a bit smelly need to improve shower facility as it s a bit slippery and water pressure was not good though the bathroom is very large , good location easy to go down to city large room comparing to other hotels in london i am quite happy to find this hotel 
59835,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location was poor as it was 15 minutes walk from the tube station and bit of a grotty area all around If your gluten intolorent avoid the restraunt Menu stated full gluten free treats available for breakfast but apparently never existed and only had one option for dinner , Lovely hotel inside and beautiful bathroom
59836,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The service received in the adjoining restaurant Crown Grill was appalling and I complained to the restaurant manager and the Clayton Crown Hotel check out staff I ordered a 3 course meal and every item served was different to what I ordered For example I ordered a crab salmon soufle starter what arrived was smoked salmon and rocket served on a sourdough bread I ordered a corn fed roast chicken with a green salad and herb garlic sauce main course what arrived was a roast chicken with a cream peppercorn sauce and chopped carrot salad I then ordered a raspberry brulee desert what arrived was a vanilla brulee topped with a strawberry My bill was reduced by 2 94 which I thought rubbed salt into the wound , Easy to understand air conditioning controls 
59837,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Car park was full when arrived even though we were told we didn t have to book Luckily there was a space on site outside the front door otherwise we were informed to park on the side streets nearby which didn t look too save , Bed was comfortable no noise 
59838,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We got a room with window view into indoor pool area which left a strange feeling Though we did not try to fight for something else as we were there just two nights ,No Positive
59839,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We waited 50 minutes for breakfast to arrive and items that were on menu were missing due to hotel not ordering enough which was very poor, Bed very comfortable
59840,Clayton Crown Hotel London, A bit awkward to travel to from Central London but worth it for the quality of property , Great value for money It was a great bonus to have a swimming pool and gym in central area 
59841,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The bath in the ensuite had been fixed near the plug and was sharp there was black mould near the shower which could have been cleaned up better Some of the reception staff were not very helpful at check out The food in the Clayton Crowne bar was expensive and we were a little disappointed with quality of the meals as they were not worth the money the restaurants nearby were much better The breakfast had a good selection but on the first day the cooked breakfast was a little overdone and cold but the second morning was much better I think for what we paid per night it was a little too expensive have stayed in London before in much better value for money hotels , The room was a good size the bed was comfortable and the room was clean our ensuite was a good size and had a good power shower The location was close to transport to get into London quickly with many restaurants nearby The waitress barperson in the Clayton crowne bar was very cheerful attentive and helpful Good selection at breakfast 
59842,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Hotel receptionist male was unhelpful and dismissive I have written a letter of compliant reference the absence of cold running water in room 352 We had no cold water to drink or to cool hot water for bathing Plug in bath was blocked and many other things spoiled our stay We have received no response to our letter of complaint I will now take this up with my credit card company as the contract with the hotel to supply me with a comfortable room was not met , Bar staff were very friendly and helpful
59843,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast was poor several options had run out not good also we had to wait an hour for our evening meal the staff were apologetic whoever was in charge of the kitchen didn t have a clue, Location and friendly staff
59844,Clayton Crown Hotel London, You are charging almost 150 pounds per person per night and not even providing water and breakfast When I complained about the problem of only hot water coming in the bathroom there was no follow up action Even though you may be doing good business now I would not prefer to come back to your hotel next time , I Just liked the cleanliness 
59845,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Nothing , Friendly staff clean and spacious room with lovely bathroom good value for money close to train Station and a 15 minute walk to the tube Lovely stay Our hairdryer didn t work and was replaced immediately 
59846,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Inferior hair blower Outdated very low air volume only one speed and heat level , Comfortable bed Nice breakfast buffet Fantastic shower Great water pressure 
59847,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I cannot think of anything unsatisfactory , I have stayed at Clayton Crown before and it is a welcoming comfortable clean hotel with good local facilities and with easy access to central London 
59848,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Some reception staff are very inexperienced and rude On check out I advised the receptionist I had already paid for my stay but she continued to put my card details through anyway In the end I was charged twice for my stay I rang the hotel and they assured me they would deal with it promptly it has been a week and still no response My bank was very helpful in dealing with this situation I will not be back to this hotel as it was quite expensive for what it is and the reception staff don t know what they are doing , Clean and modern rooms
59849,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The area isn t great but we chose it for ease to get to Wembley Thought it was Priced a little high , Size of eventual room cleanliness of it Breakfast was good Staff were polite including those in the pub Although room was non refundable the hotel gave us the opportunity of re scheduling our stay as we were staying there for the Adele concert that was cancelled I thought this was a nice gesture although we decided to still go n the date booked due to train tickets 
59850,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Its a little bit of a walk to the Kilburn tube line probably 10 15 mins for access to central London or you can hope on the many buses that pass outside the hotel The area is fair the staff are friendly the hotel is nice modern and clean and of very good standard ,No Positive
59851,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast was shocking The last thing we will remember was the breakfast sadly having to sit outside the breakfast room waiting for a table then the service and food quality was poor Eggs cold lack of knives and forks sauce everything was asked for it seemed A real shame as the venue itself was lovely , Great venue with fantastic rooms busy street full of everything shops bars and restaurants 
59852,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast was very poor All cooked items were cold when they arrived There were holes in the blinds in our room which looked like cigarette burns and we saw a mouse in the bar one evening , Good transport links outside hotel lots of buses into city centre 
59853,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Had to change room as the ceiling in our bedroom was damaged by water , To far out of town but would have been okay had we see Adele The area was poor Towels and bedding good 
59854,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, We were in the modern extension excellent room Disappointed that Pan Asia restaurant replaced by a grill room Website needs updating to reflect this Enjoyed breakfast good selection hot food cooked to order Good bus connections outside hotel 
59855,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The hotel exactly matched my needs , This is a comfortable clean friendly hotel When I first saw it I thought that given its location it would be noisy but this was not the case despite a fairly lively pub being part of the premises The rooms are of reasonable size and the staff helpful and cooperative The hotel is modern without being austere 
59856,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I didn t appreciate the manager messing my payment up and taking it twice even though I pointed it out to him prior The hotel still didn t refund it and I had to contact my bank for them to do it , Relaxed friendly atmosphere Great bar with a good selection of food and drink Room was a good size and spotlessly clean with comfy beds Access into Central London was quick and easy and just three stops on the train with station being literally five minutes round the corner direct into St Pancras Alternatively bus from directly out front goes to Oxford Street Hyde Park one way and Brent Cross shopping centre the other 
59857,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Poor choice and quality of food served at lunchtime in the hotel bar area The car park is very tight to maneuver down too and the ramps catch the underneath of the car and spoilers , The room was clean and so was the bathroom The beds were very comfortable We had a lovely breakfast consisting of a buffet style then a silver service full English 
59858,Clayton Crown Hotel London, This is nothing to do with the Hotel but it was the distance from the Train Station one of our family was pregnant and it was very hot but we enjoyed our stay, I travelled with Adult Children The room was big and very clean this is the first time we have stayed here mainly because of the proximity to Wembley for the Adele concert which was cancelled the duty manager at breakfast informed us of the specials on Sunday but we were checking out after breakfast 
59859,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Poor parking poor staff knowledge poor room service Overpriced and definitely not what i expected from a 4 star hotel , Clean reception tidy rooms 
59860,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The large windows at the front of property didnt cut out much noise from the busy main road outside The curtains didnt really fit very well either so lots of gaps The distance from the underground station good 20 minute walk from any of the stations around the area , Large room with large comfortable bed and small seating area Comfortable seating in reception and the pub next door was a bonus for meals and drinks although waiting times for food at night was lengthy Nice selection for breakfast seemed to run out of some pastries and fruit on the second morning 
59861,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast disappointing NOT self service for hot breakfast Restaurant quite basically furnished Coffee very stewed Desserts on evening SHOCKINGLY bad Pastry on banoffee tart bordering on damp Apple crumble virtually no Apple , Reception staff very helpful
59862,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We had booked this hotel as we were going to see Adele at Wembley Unfortunately she cancelled the gig at the last minute and I emailed the hotel direct to see if there was anything they could do in the way of a refund as we were not coming and Ive not even had a reply ,No Positive
59863,Clayton Crown Hotel London, nothing everything was great, Fab hotel excellent location and close to the train station didn t get the time to use the pool unfortunately breakfast was lovely so much choice big room with housed a sofa definitely return next time I am visiting London
59864,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Shower was over bath was high to climb in and out of and didn t drain well Loo seat badly fitted cheap , Lovely helpful staff Gorgeous beds and bed linen
59865,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Could fault the place, Would go back to the clayton crown hotel the staff were amazing especially The reception staff A male member called Will was fantastic and went out of his way to meet all our needs He is the jewel in the Clayton Crown hotel Well done for making our stay a memorable one 
59866,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The staff all appeared to have just started working in hospitality There was no attention to detail it s not that they were rude just undertrained Especially breakfast service , The decor and traditional building was beautiful
59867,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The hotel pub menu not much variety This made us dine elsewhere , The housekeeping attempted to get into our room when we left a still sleeping sign so they left a note which said they were only available until 1400 We left our room at 1357 and when we returned our room was cleaned Great service from house keeping 
59868,Clayton Crown Hotel London, General condition of furniture is tired and needs refurbishing The shower on the morning ofcheck out was cold and staff not very helpful in getting it resolved,No Positive
59869,Clayton Crown Hotel London, When we checked in there was no mention of our anniversary or flowers fruit of wine in the room Given we had booked a superior room I would have expected this Enjoyable stay, I let the hotel know it was our anniversary which was acknowledged by email
59870,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The cleanliness of the plates cups etc the staff trying to charge twice for breakfast the rudeness of reception staff the fact there was a prom on right next to our room Terrible experience , Nothing 
59871,Clayton Crown Hotel London, For a delux room the furniture was a a bit poor table varnish cracked and quite water marked and the bed base was a bit battered, The Hotel was comfortable and bedroom clean staff friendly 
59872,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The room we had was level to the pavement right by a bus stop so it was very noisy and we felt the need to keep the curtains closed at all times as people were right outside our window The room was lovely but so so noisy , The staff were amazing so polite and welcoming Breakfast was outstanding 
59873,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Signage needs to be put up regarding the poor entrance ramp to the hotel which was so steep it damaged the front of my car whilst leaving the carpark It was so steep that I had to reverse out ,No Positive
59874,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Certain rooms view into the pool we kept our curtains shut the whole time as we didn t want people looking in from the pool when getting ready for dinner ect The pool was so visable from the so many floors and rooms Maybe explain that there will be no natural light in the room because for a 110 you would expect a window to the outside not to the pool , The rooms were amazingly decorated big rooms and nice bathrooms 
59875,Clayton Crown Hotel London, No bottled water in rooms selection of hot drinks could be better No conditioner provided only shampoo and body wash Air conditioning not very effective though it as extremely hot weather , Comfy clean and quiet extremely helpful and friendly staff particularly in the restaurant Amazing towels they are huge and fluffy Nice quiet swimming pool with glass ceiling Signs you can leave on the doors to order breakfast 
59876,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The attitude of the reception staff Lack of on site parking non existent really Having to park 2 blocks away at the Travel Inn when parking was assured at the time of booking They only have 40 spaces allocated on a first come first served basis A wedding was taking place on the day we arrived and I imagine that s where all the parking spaces had been allocated Bathroom plumbing left a lot to be desired although the bathroom itself was clean Breakfast service organisation food was dismal Someone needs to sort out the quantity of food needed to placate paying guests , Nice quiet clean room Handy travelling distance to Wembley Stadium 
59877,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Excellent location Close to great shops and restaurants Ideally located for the tube station Pub attached to the hotel was nice too Looks like it is used by quite few locals Bus stop is right outside the hotel Rooms were a good size with everything we needed 
59878,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The eggs at breakfast , Loved the style of the hotel part of it is old with a new bit added on but how it s been done makes it look continental in the reception area Good location for what we were doing ELO gig at Wembley About a 15 minute walk from the tube Willesden Green to the hotel Tube from there to Wembley is about 6 7 minutes Room was spacious and comfortable It wasn t obvious where to go for breakfast upstairs the sign for this was pointing away from where we came into reception from our ground floor room no big deal though Breakfast was a help yourself cereal pastries toast hot drinks were brought to you and cooked breakfast done to order However the waitress that seated us did not explain any of this I had poached eggs and my husband had fried eggs on our breakfast both were hard we didnt complain though The overall portion of the breakfast was generous and this was an Irish breakfast as opposed to English as part of it included black pudding Overall we felt this hotel was a little gem and somewhere we will definitely use again when we travel to London 
59879,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, All the food was excellent staff were very friendly and helpful with questions we had about how to get to various places Entertainment in the hotel bar was outstanding on both nights we were there 
59880,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast was appalling they ran out of some food we waited 1and a half hours for our food to arrive and not what we had ordered not enough staff on and not enough food so many people like us were complaining, Nice big comfy bed
59881,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I little away from the centre of London however suitable for a trip to Wembley which was the overall purpose of the visit, A few nice bars and a good curry house nearby however good entertainment available in the hotel and also food very reasonably priced and looked good
59882,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location We didn t feel comfortable walking back to hotel from the tube station in the evening , Breakfast was nice and cooked to order Room clean and comfortable 
59883,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Had the breakfast refunded as waited 50 minutes and hadnt arrived and informed half the items on the cooked menu was not available the breakfast is the main part of the morning and failed mould on the ceiling in the bathroom and mould on the mastic sealant in the bathroom room 118 this is a maintenance issue not cleaning ,No Positive
59884,Clayton Crown Hotel London, My daughter I enjoyed our time in the pool although unfortunately we had to share a towel as there was only one left , Breakfast was superb very tasty My daughter I enjoyed the pool very much The staff was very friendly and very helpful The room was well presented very spacious Will definitely stay here again maybe for a couple more nights rather than 1 night 
59885,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The neighbourhood is busy and noisey, The staff was friendly and accomodating there was air conditioning on an unusually hot day and public transportation is very close and easy to use 
59886,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I was surprised there wasn t a fridge in the room The area is okay but I probably wouldn t feel safe walking outside at dark , Very close to public transportation local co op near by They left a card in the room so the aircon stayed on as it was plus 30c at the time of visiting so that was a nice touch 
59887,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The booking was in a different name so took us 20 mins standing at the checkin the rooms air conditioning did not work so later that night we were moved to a different room The breakfast was served from 6 30 but not all the food was cooked ready and had to wait a further 30 mins for it to be cooked for the outskirts of London Centre i think 15 a day parking was expencive when you can park in carpark next to County Hall Westminster of 20 a day , The parking was underground the swimming pool was good size the bed was very comfortable bathroom was clean room was clean Good veriaty of breakfast and was relaxing However
59888,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, The hotel was really good for the price The staff were helpful and friendly A bit out of the city but lots of buses go by the hotel and the tube station is about a 10min walk 
59889,Clayton Crown Hotel London, My room was at 28 degrees for the four days that I was there although I reported the fault while the room next door the air conditioning worked Nobody came to fix it ,No Positive
59890,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Too many allergen related foods on the menu Husband has a nut allergy so coul only eat 1 item on the menu even the burger wasn t eligible , Great overnight stay after seeing The Stine Roses in Concert Would definately go there for a long weekend A bit pricy but worth it Staff very helpful and pleasant 
59891,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Our deluxe room was fitted with handrails shower chair etc for those with limited mobility which gave the room an air of functionality great if that is was is needed not so great if it s a rare weekend away with your partner and you are fortunate enough to be able bodied, Excellent venue if going to Wembley secure underground car parking nice clean pool
59892,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The air cond is not good under this kinda hot weather and awoke me during midnight at high temp Food is bad while we pay high expectation on the new restaurant , Bed is comfortable
59893,Clayton Crown Hotel London, aircon unit in the room wasn t great on a 30 degree weekend , Clean room lovely staff reasonable parking charges Nice bar with decent prices for London 
59894,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, The staff were incredible Once my boyfriend mentioned that it was my birthday they went above and beyond to make it a very special day Our room was upgraded and we received a complimentary breakfast and dinner The bed was comfy and the room was airy thanks to air conditioning The only slightly off putting thing about the room was that it had two massive mirrors facing the bed I understand this was done to make the room look bigger but it was slightly disconcerting to wake up and look straight in the mirror The hotel is a bit difficult to navigate but the staff are very helpful and made sure we found our way to the pool which is lovely The location is very near public transport and busses go regularly back to the tube station 
59895,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The food was over priced and the menu was minimal , The staff were friendly and helpful Would definitely go back next time I m in London Room was clean and had everything you need Bed was comfortable Only thing missing was a fridge we realised that after we bought some drinks Overall I loved it and I would definitely go back 
59896,Clayton Crown Hotel London, faster internet, Interesting hotel that is a bit out from London but easy to get to all the attractions The bus takes you to one of two Underground stations and you can be at the main sites within 40 minutes The general area was safe but a bit rough looking They have staff whose job is to help you get around They were very helpful letting us know which buses to take 
59897,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, I was pleasantly surprised Lovely hotel with pub restaurant next door I will definitely visit again if there s a need to be in the area We wanted a single room for three friends and was not expecting to have such a large and comfortable room in this area of London The beds and pillow were so comfortable the extra bed was a proper bed Lovely 
59898,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Unfortunately many of the windows are single glazed especially on the front by the road which makes for a noisy stay , It s a high quality hotel designed with a Far Eastern influence really like it While being a little way out it s easy to access London on the Thameslink line from Cricklewood 
59899,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Staff could have been more pleasant , It was an okay experience nothing to shout about Have stayed in many starred hotel all around esp in Asia and felt dissapointed with this hotel Location was great but everything was was just avearge They should improve on the front desk services 
59900,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Price , Excellent Hotel Just wish it was a little cheaper and I would stay there every week A little over my budget unfortunately Probably best hotel I have booked through Booking com
59901,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room was tired to remote didn t work properly and safe didn t work at all When reported they just removed the batteries from the safe Cups in room were not washed and windows didn t open Pillows too soft and unsupportive ,No Positive
59902,Clayton Crown Hotel London, This is the second time staying at this hotel my partner and I got some bumpy redness on our elbows first time we thought nothing of it as must be a rash but it happens the second time as well I m guessing is from bed bugs We inform the staff the manager came he did apologised for the inconvenience and said will check with the housekeeping didn t write any report on the matter we left it I will not stay there anymore as mentioned that was our second time that it happened , The
59903,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Hotel location as I was along with small kid and all tourist places were far from hotel I had to take bus than tube than walk to reach any tourist place that was little tiring along with kid rest all was great hotel is excellent for price , Reception staff was very helpful gave us complete details along with print outs kept our luggage for extra time after check out too hotel is great for price 
59904,Clayton Crown Hotel London, There was nothing I didn t like , For me one of the best hotels in London Staff extremely friendly and obliging The rooms are comparatively big clean and very comfortable They also do a very good restaurant which serves a very nice breakfast 
59905,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The Grill was really bad It s the new restaurant at the hotel The staff was not really professional and it was a very bad steak we got served It s a lot of potential nice locations but the food was so bad ,No Positive
59906,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Only bad thing was just one type of tea could ve done with different flavours , Lovely big rooms bathroom and super comfy bed Only 5 mins walk from cricklewood station and regular buses outside hotel entrance Loved the swimming pool too 
59907,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Booking collected money from my account 138 on 29 05 17 for 1 day and the hotel charge me 2 days stay In total I payed 3 days that not fair at all I need my money back Thanks,No Positive
59908,Clayton Crown Hotel London, That parking is not included and that my booking was not as I intended I booked triple room for 3 with brekkie but it showed up as room for one with brekkie and I had to pay another 35, Eggs florintine were the best and brekkie is a must
59909,Clayton Crown Hotel London, about 1Km from the nearest underground The fact that it is nor in the heart of the city make it problemaic for one who like to enjoy the city in day and night You travel once a day to the city and beck as the juorny is long I wouldn t recommend it for tourists who like to see some Londod , nice hotel clean with very helful and nice staf 
59910,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, This is the second time I have stayed here and I hope to be back Beautiful hotel close to the tube and train The personnel made us feel very welcome they were very friendly They went out of their way to help us A really great hotel 
59911,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The plug in the wall was broke and it was the only one that I could get my straighteners plug into because of the wire its hard to plug into certain ones so to use the other plugs I had to ask for extension lead the staff were very helpful On the wall of our bedroom the whole room was painted one colour then behind one of the pillows there was a big white mark of paint that had tried to be covered up with the pillow Didn t get much daylight through the window on the ground floor and there was a wall very close to our window so we had to rely on the okay lighting inside The signal on the television kept flickering whilst we were watching the television The area isn t amazing but to be honest that didn t really bother me Never got chance to use the pool as we were too busy but it looked nice , Inside the hotel was very nice room looked very nice when you first walked in 
59912,Clayton Crown Hotel London, It was expensive with no included breakfast If there hadn t been arrows to the lobby we would still be there Location far away from London central The 10 15 minutes to the tube took 45 min on foot , We rec d a special discount from Booking com Personnel friendly and helpful Everything was clean and new 
59913,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Nothing really It s a wee bit out of the way transport wise with the nearest underground station a fair walk away and the overground train is very close but less frequent so it s worth studying the buses which are great it s never been a problem for us but needs a bit of thinking about , We have stayed at this hotel a number of times before and it s always comfortable and pleasant and the rooms are amazingly quiet for such a buzzy place in a busy area The staff are helpful and almost always really charming and friendly The breakfasts are good and excellent value It s not in a posh area which might bother some people but very cosmopolitan there is a fabulous Indian restaurant just a few minutes walk down the road on the same side as the hotel I think it s called Khan or similar Very well worth visiting and insanely cheap 
59914,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The room service was a rip off Got about 8 chips for 5 The mozzerella cheese pizza was made from chedder No condiments No apologies Rooms are much smaller than advertised Damp in room just above bed , Car park facility was handy They allowed me to keep my car there even checkout Kids enjoyed the swimming pool 
59915,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I personally found the bed soft besides that the stay was wonderful , The staff are very friendly especially Yana the receptionist very helpful and welcoming 
59916,Clayton Crown Hotel London, No sleep So noisy There were two funtions behind held on the same night at the hotel Beause we were not part of these functions we were not seen as a priority The noise from the functions was horrendous would gave been better off booking a premier inn Also ended up getting conned into buying breakfast twice Very unhappy , Was cleanish
59917,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The tea and coffee facilities were not very good only enough for one, The rooms were very clean and comfortable the breakfast was fantastic so much choice would stay in this hotel again
59918,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room was very noisy because of swimming pool during the entire day Additionally parties were held during two of our nights making too much noise We requested change of room so we were moved to a room in another floor away from the swimming pool which was quiet during the day However there was another party although this time there was much less noise in our room I think it is unacceptable for such hotels to allow organize so loud parties after midnight , Nice location felt safe even if relatively cheap and out of centre Large room nice bathroom and bedroom Polite staff
59919,Clayton Crown Hotel London, A very noisy hotel We had to move rooms after the first night away from the function hall The second night we went for dinner at the restaurant but there was a disco in another room which drowned out the conversation , The staff were very helpful friendly We changed rooms after the first night because of the noise coming from the function room an Irish beauty pageant and without us asking they refunded the cost of the night 
59920,Clayton Crown Hotel London, It would have been good if the email confirmation had indicated the closest Underground stop with instructions from there very easy since you just walk straight down the same road We did not have WiFi or phone when we were trying to figure out how to get there from Heathrow We asked at the Underground They directed us to switch at West Hampstead to a National Line train That worked but we had to walk between the Underground and other train before boarding then wait again over 10 minutes so it would have been much better to do as the hotel instructed us use the Kilburn Underground station and one of the frequent busses if desired We had the address from the confirmation email but no note of the Underground stop We had no phone available either , The bed was very comfortable The swimming pool had long hours 7 AM to 10 PM was heated and was a great way to start the day There were many good restaurants within walking distance and although the walk to the Underground was several blocks it was pleasant and we could very easily have hopped on one of the frequent busses had the weather been bad 
59921,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We were not aware of bar food so we ate in restaurant which we feel was too exquisite and over priced More variety of food and cheaper prices Bigger portions, Breakfast was plentiful and a lot of healthy options 
59922,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I was over charged by 708 And 3 days later still have not received my money back If I ever stay there again I will expect a room upgrade or a discount ,No Positive
59923,Clayton Crown Hotel London, To be honest I had no complaints about the hotel or my stay and would definitely stay there again , The choice and standard of food for breakfast were first class My room had everything I needed and was quiet which for me is a big plus Wi Fi was excellent 
59924,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The cleaner never clean the dresser even obviously there were empty bottle and paper tissue on it What they did was just making the bed And I really hate to live underfloor although there was a swimming pool outside my window I asked the front desk for changing a room and they told me they would inform me once they got free room but got no response anymore , The room is very big comapring to other hotels in London I ve ever lived 
59925,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We did not find it , The swimming pool was very nice and seemed to have less chlorine in it The bed room was very nice The staff were very helpful thoughtful and accomodating We only stayed one night and would recommend the Clayton Crown Hotel anytime for Value Convenience and Comfort Thank you 
59926,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Reception staff not very good with their information and when we mentioned they had given us contradictory information about the pool they told us they didn t The pool is a good size but the dressing rooms only have one shower and a small bench to change Really only suitable for two people Be sure not to be there during swimming lessons or you will have a long wait for the one shower the food in the bar was not good at all But the bar restaurant manger was excellent at her job , Room great size Good location short walk or four stops in bus to tune
59927,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast was adequate but even the cheapest of hotels offer ketchup that resembles the best brand I know I sound typically English talking about ketchup but it is a real insight into how much a hotel is prepared to spend and not cut corners this stuff was semi transparent and resembled sweet and sour sauce It was given to me in a polystyrene cup Yuk , It was great to have a room that sleeps three people

59930,Clayton Crown Hotel London, First room faced the street and youths were hanging around outside my room Fortunately the staff moved me to a top floor room but that wasn t as nice as the first room It was fairly shabby The pool was disappointing as swimming lessons were taking place The gym was too much hassle to access Quite a scary area for a lone female traveller Breakfast so expensive I didn t bother , The room was very clean
59931,Clayton Crown Hotel London, It is a really noisy hotel from the road outside with sirens and loud cars going all night The hotel has a small crane parked outside which was moved loudly at 5 30am on both the days I stayed This was not good The sockets in the room are not well positioned so I found it really hard to charge my phone and laptop as the sockets are so close to the desk top that the plugs did not fit in , The room was really lovely clean and spacious The wifi was good too 
59932,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Eggs sausages bacon etc everything was undercooked for breakfast No tea coffee in room Shower was poor Staff were rude and not helpful Parking was terrible Overpriced and rubbish Premier inn would have been 10 times better , Practically nothing 
59933,Clayton Crown Hotel London, NO breakfast, For what i paid for the night we got no breakfast this is the only time i have ever stayed at any hotel in all the years and got none and if u want to give them more of ur hard earn money it would cost u 24pound for a breakfast

59939,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The only thing which was off putting was whilst we were having drinks in the bar on Friday evening there was a very drunk couple who were very loud and drinking their own drink purchased elsewhere They were eventually escorted from the premises not by security but by a young girl behind the bar Well done to her , We stayed here for three nights whilst down in London for the Marathon A little bit of a walk from the station either Kilburn or Willisden Green but definitely worth it The hotel is ideally situated very nice decor and very clean and very helpful staff Would recommend and use again Very handy for Wembley park too The pool looked lovely but never got the chance to use it Despite being situated on a main road the rooms were very quiet 
59940,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Too much noise from room service maids every morning We hear all This is at maximum a 3 star hotel not 4 One toileterie only for a couple Cleaning was not not not good, Location
59941,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The restaurant in the basement of the hotel was poor The cooked breakfast was lukewarm as most of the bain maries were not heated The first evening meal I had was slow cooked pork cutlet Slow cooked meat should be tender this wasn t though it wasn t tough enough to send back The second night I ordered the gourmet burger and was asked if I wanted it medium or well done I asked for medium expecting from this request a good thick burger between the buns Instead it was thin like the frozen patties you get from the supermarket In attempting to cook it medium it ended up under cooked and cold which is food poisoning central in my book The salad inside the burger was also cold I sent it back and when it was explained to me why it was like this I decided not get an alternative meal which was offered but left the restaurant A poster in the pub heralds the opening of a new restaurant in May They certainly need it , The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was large and clean with a great bed The hotel was centrally located in a very cosmopolitan area of North London The attached pub the Crown was a great watering hole and the clients very friendly but then again I ll talk to anybody

60009,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We struggled to plug items in under the mirror that had a USB attached as the plug sockets under the mirror were really close to the surface There was only 1 other plug socket in the room that wasn t restrictive Also the lighting could ve been a little better in the bathroom over the mirror , Pretty much everything
60010,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We walked to the tube station Kilburn was told about buses but decided to walk it anyway was a straight walk there but a little way about 15 minutes walk Not that it put a dampener on anything as we were happy walking But at the end of a long sightseeing day it felt like a trek , The staff were a credit to the hotel that alone would make me want to return As for the hotel itself it was modern the rooms were a lovely size and the bed was so comfy We had a bath in our room as well which was a bonus Overall a lovely hotel and would definitely return

60016,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast was a waste of time The sign said to wait to be seated We stood waiting for 10 mins before we took it upon ourselves to sit at one of the many available tables It wasn t busy so why did the staff not welcome us or the other two couples waiting It took forever to take our order and then when it came it was wrong It said on the menu that soya milk was available so when I asked for some I was disappointed to be told that there wasn t any The coffee was repugnant You d have to work hard to make coffee that bad I d stay at the hotel again but won t eat there I d rather go to the pub down the road for breakfast For a 4 star hotel you definitely don t get a 4 star breakfast , The room was lovely clean and quiet
60017,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Lack of plugs in accessible places It was very cold during the nights due to the draft coming through the windows When using the shower water wasn t as warm hot as we d have liked As we stayed for 4 nights we requested to have a small fridge so we could put small beverages in and we were refused as our suite didn t include a fridge , Loved the location it was in a prime location with the tram stations within walking distance lots of food places nearby too

60020,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast service very slow Understaffed No plates available Very limited choice from the breakfast bar The swimming pool was not in operation during the 3 days we stayed in this hotel No explanation was given Just bad service without excuses from the staff The train connection Thameslink did not run at all during 25 26 and 27th of December The hotel staff was not aware Our planned connection from Luton Airport to the hotel did not work for that reason It took finally about 1 hour longer then it was said ,No Positive
60021,Clayton Crown Hotel London, It would be fine to have a mini fridge in the room, Location 15 min far from oxford circus Cleanliness the room was clean The housekeepers were very careful about the cleaning and our comfort Equipment perfect wi fi kettle TV It was our first time in London and we ll definetly come back to Clayton Crown hotel 
60022,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We especially were dissapointed with the breakfast not worth paying 12 I guess that how much was it for a full was no black pudding both days super poor choice of two cold meat selection once sort of cheese and croissant for a bakery section I must to admit this was the worst breakfast we have ever had coffee was awful too Also did not like the fact that we had to pay an additional 30 for a two day parking It is quite pricey and if would that been highlited then I made a booking I guess would be chossing different place with free parking there were also loads travelers staying so very messy in most of the hotel areas as well as noisy , The Hotel is quite fine due it s exterior and interior Location is ok I guess you get what you pay for Since we used to be staying at 5 star hotels in the future this one came a slight dissapointed However I have noticed it is only 4 star so all understandable the rooms are nice clean and good size nice amenity having indoor swimming pool too 
60023,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The communal areas are worse for wear Sofas are knackered rugs are worn Walls are scuffed Tiles on floor are cracked TLC needed , Rooms are spacious and clean
60024,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room as advertised , The pool was a decent size the breakfast was good and cooked to order staff were friendly and we had a nice overall stay 
60025,Clayton Crown Hotel London, A bit off the beaten path from the tube, Beautiful roomy room and nice big bathroom Helpful staff and comfy beds Right on bus route and stunning lobby Colorful neighborhood
60026,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Well nothing really , Staff especially the lady who was on the reception last 19th Dec 2230 hrs was fabulous She is approachable and Incan see how she love her job and passionate about it On top of that she is so caring and accommodating My husband is a wheelchair bound but she really made it sure that we will have a comfortable stay 
60027,Clayton Crown Hotel London, No clean of dry towels to use in pool changing rooms the wet ones were still on the floor the next morning when I went for a swim No one had checked the area so therefore still hadn t been cleaned Disappointing for such a lovely place , The location is great atmosphere size of the Clayton Crown is very good The main added bonus for me is the beautiful indoor pool 
60028,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The location is just to far from the center crickelwood Train station poorly served by trains and buses just take forever, Very high standard of accommodation very clean and tidy
60029,Clayton Crown Hotel London, It was near nothing Cost us 45 taxi back from the theatre when the website says it s close it too That s the only bad thing about this place was location cost us a lot of money , The hotel was beautiful couldn t fault in just in a bad area

60031,Clayton Crown Hotel London, not a great selection of red wine in the pub also a little unsure of the drunk people wandering in off the street especially making a nasty hand gesture to my friend, nice hotel with the bar and restaurant attached rooms quite big and very quiet
60032,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Requested a bucket of ice for room and told it would be a 4 charge Was getting ready for a bath but went and got it myself Not impressed Breakfast not as much fruit choice on the Monday as there was on the Sunday Porridge like wallpaper paste Sink in bathroom blocked took 12 hourscti fix , Staff very friendly location great for central London
60033,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The room was at underground floor 2 without windows outside i felt very claustrophobic there The bathroom was dirty and the room was very noisy because was next to the inside pool The breakfast was horrible nothing was tasty and it was very poorly I paid 240 for 2 nights But not worth the money For sure was not my best experience in London and for sure I will never come back ,No Positive
60034,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast was very poor Not enough staff to deal with all the customers Poached eggs were like boiled eggs and food wasn t freshly cooked , Everything apart from the beeakfast
60035,Clayton Crown Hotel London, There was nothing we didn t like, Hotel palatial clean lovely decor staff helpful friendly breakfast fabulous car park a bonus would be returning
60036,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Small details like the curtains that had small wholes Furniture is basic and the only disadvantage was that the room doesn t have mini bar or fridge, Very comfort bed room very warm bathroom was clean and spacious with hot water all day Internet was fast and free in all areas Hotel is 20 minutes from central London but has bus stop just in front 
60037,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location was a long walk from the underground Although there was a bus stop right outside the hotel you needed an oyster card to get around easily , Stunning reception area 
60038,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The area is a little run down and there weren t any nice restaurants but plenty of takeaways A minor dislike , The hotel staff were very friendly The layout of the hotel was really nice and if you don t mind staying outside of London this is a lovely hotel The bus into London stops right outside the hotel and the tube is only 4 bus stops away A great stay Thankyou 
60039,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Felt a little worried when walking down the road at night but apart from that it s ok and loads of busses right outside hotel and trains nearby, Beautiful room which was large and comfortable

60041,Clayton Crown Hotel London, suggestion why not offer a shuttle service to Kilberrn underground station for that is the only fault with the hotel is that its a good mile away from nearest station, Lovely building very comfortable and clean room great breakfast
60042,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The fact that the standard rooms have no bath slippers and robes doesn t feel like a 4 star , The staff at reception are outstanding especially Chantelle She was always happy to help 
60043,Clayton Crown Hotel London, A choice of pillow would have been nice The pillows in the room were all too bouncy I prefer a soft but flatter type that don t spring up around my face An alarm went off at 1am which disturbed our sleep , A very warm welcome on arrival The hotel has an impressive entrance area and was very clean and shiny throughout The beds were comfortable and our room was spacious and warm 
60044,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location not much in the local area apart from takeaways a 10 15 minute walk to nearest tube station Willesden Green , Quiet rooms friendly helpful staff food reasonably priced and good quality 
60045,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room not ready on arrival expensive for a 1 night stay breakfast expensive for what was on offer and service haphazard, Decent size room but had to upgrade to junior suite
60046,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Its a 20 minute stroll to Kilburn tube and I woyld not advise my daighters to walk it although I saw nothing wrong and its a straight streel lit road fast walkers will do it in less than 15 mins , Great beds and great staff with great guinness
60047,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Very tired decor generally but in particular room shower Bar food was very poor, Price and the public areas have great potential if a bit of money was spent updating them
60048,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I had no hot water in the morning and hey made me shower in diffrent roomthen in second morning it was the same problem again so had no shower i think they should have just moved us rooms, It was easy to get any where
60049,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast was terrible and the service wasn t great at breakfast The cooked breakfast was horrible and the croissants were not cooked properly inedible in fact The coffee was OK though , The room was excellent Reception staff were helpful and friendly 
60050,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room was so basic ugly carpet More like a 3 than a 4 Location is in a very urban area with not many nice places to eat around Good place to stay if you haven t got any other options No phone reception in lower level rooms which was inconvenient because we couldn t call anyone Wifi was good though , Pool and hotel decor was quite nice 
60051,Clayton Crown Hotel London, There was no bidet for the toilet The room assigned was located at the back side viewing the swimming pool There was no elevator very difficult to carry our luggage up and down stairs , The hotel location was very strategic for us Helpful staff Room was maintained clean with good odor 
60052,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Your reception staff were rude when we handed over Scottish money which may I add is legal tender in Great Britain was totally shocked by there response and so was everyone else around us wouldn t be back at this hotel x,No Positive
60053,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room was hot and very noisy aircon unit Dirty windows looking over pool Pool was closed due to maintenance which was really dissapointing Frayed carpets on lobby stairs No phone signal in our room We had 2 family rooms over 2 floors would have liked rooms on the same floor Our shower head was very low my partner is over 6 ft tall so the water only just covered his shoulders with his head touching the ceiling We were not aware restaurant was closed on a Sunday would have been helpful to get told this when we checked in as we could have stayed at Wembley to eat Nowhere to eat around the hotel but we found a nice family run restaurant called zeytoon down the road , Good size room and nice looking lobby area until you look closer Bar and restaurant looked nice Clean room and comfy bed Free WiFi was good and easy to connect to Some staff were friendly Location was perfect for event at Wembley Short walk to underground willesden green and only a few stops on jubilee line Cheap parking for overnight as london goes 
60054,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The hotel itself is actually not the nice Victorian red brick building in the photos but a modern build attached to the side of it Rooms are pretty awkward There were only 2 sockets in the whole apartment and one was so close to the desk you couldn t plug anything into it The area was noisy And despite advice saying you could park nearby all day for 7 this turned out to be untrue The location of the hotel is quite far away from a tube station so the cheaper room price was probably negated by the extra bus tube fares and long stay parking cost Breakfasts were also pretty poor , The rooms were a generous size And although the neighbourhood was busy and noisy there were some interesting shops and stalls around 
60055,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast was awful running out of food juice cooked food overheated and some inedible sausages no one to advise as what to do no self service for the cooked meals the worst we have experienced in 6 years and one of the most expensive It let the hotel down Only paid for one day after that bought cereal and milk for breakfast in our room , Swimming pool
60056,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Nothing at all, The hotel was absolutely faultless staff were all extremely professional and rooms were stunning Breakfast offered was to suit everyone as taste everything on offer and cooked fresh to order 
60057,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The location is quite a distance from the nearest underground station and the walk between the two is not great when carrying luggage One of the nights there was an extremely loud disco coming from the bar area that we were not made aware would happen Despite being told we were in the quiet area of the hotel the music still carried all the way through Not what you want after a long day round London , Appearance was clean and smart All staff were very friendly and were there to answer any questions 
60058,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The pre ordered cream tea the bread was hard We were given marmalade with the scones Asked for jam which took an age to arrive We were woken at 8 25 by the cleaner to do the room unacceptable Overall not a good weekend We were offered free lunch but having eaten the breakfast which was cold I e the mushroom tomato and fried potatoes were cold We were not impressed ,No Positive
60059,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Parking was a little confusing and very tight getting in , Very clean staff very friendly Lovely treat for my wife as hotel was luxurious I stay in hotels 3 4 nights a week so I know cleanliness and standards 
60060,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Absolutely beautiful hotel we went for my daughters 18th birthday and had a brilliant time couldn t fault it You ll definitely be seeing us again 
60061,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Bed very uncomfortable staff had no clue how to cook My medium steak was cold in the middle and all our drinks were flat Also had to wait 15 minutes at the bar to get our drink order taken, Location
60062,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The surrounding area although close to a train station was a little rough at night and not the nicest of places but we encountered no issues over the stay simply didn t feel too safe or welcome in the area at night The TV was a little dated as I couldn t view the Guide to see what was on each channel without actually clicking on a channel and waiting for it to load minor issue but a little disappointing when other large budget chains are now offering large smart TVs The room was nice however the paint had cracked around the light switches and plugs etc which could be touched up for such a small cost to the Hotel to just make the room feel that bit more premium One of the biggest annoyances of the room were the plug sockets They were either so close to the skirting boards or so close to the desk that any plugs with the cable coming out the bottom couldn t fit into the plug sockets as the hardened part of the cable joining the cable to the plug couldn t bend enough to allow me or my girlfriend to plug any of our stuff in the only exception being a phone charger with the cable coming out the top , The hotel once inside was absolutely fantastic for the price you pay I m used to Premier Inn s which whilst very good for the price in London cost about the same as the Clayton and the Clayton adds in that extra star rating giving you a slightly more luxurious stay The rooms were very spacious by any standards and incredibly spacious for London standards The bathroom was clean and modern and the room was very nice My girlfriend used the bath and seemed to enjoy it I had a few showers during the stay and found the shower was very powerful some may like this I found it fine Do note though if you turn down the power you are almost pressed against the wall trying to stand under the water The bed too was comfortable and warm The room also had air conditioning although we didn t feel the need to use it during our stay The location was very good for our needs as we needed easy access to London in order to get to a workshop in the center It was easiest to walk 0 1 miles to Cricklewood station to get to St Pancras and from there get the underground to our final destination It would ve been cheaper and easier had the hotel been slightly closer to an underground station but wasn t much of an issue for us 
60063,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Not a nice area and picture of outside is well taken Car parking is 15 per night so 30 for two night stay which I found rediculous To top off also a Long walk to nearest underground station Air conditioning in first room didn t work properly so had to change rooms Lift didn t work , Comfy bed 
60064,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Did not realise parking cost until arrival even though adverts said parking available assumed it was free , We did not actually eat in the hotel very comfortable stay lovely rooms teamaking facilities iron hairdryer provided Staff very helpful friendly 
60065,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Air conditioning was noisy rooms were not soundproof so could hear the tv and laughter in the next room We were not advised that we would need to book in advance for PanAsia restaurant and was turned away and told to come back an hour later , Bed was comfy and the rooms are a decent size with a large bathroom The pool was clean and a the perfect size for a swim and to relax in after a long day close to transport links into London just over 10mins walk from the nearest Tube Station On site car park is reasonably priced Gym was clean and well equipped for a typical hotel gym 
60066,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast was awful We waited 20 minutes after ordering and had to remind the staff about it When it came it was quite obviously precooked a long time before The bacon was inedible and everything else was cold , The beds were very comfortable and the staff were very helpful 
60067,Clayton Crown Hotel London, They don t have any helping or can do even see you again attitude towards gust , I didn t received any welcome attitude while checked inn And no any bell boy attend to pick mt lagguge We was so tired but we had to take those to the room 
60068,Clayton Crown Hotel London, There was no explanation from the check in staff where all the facilities were I e the restaurant for breakfast The bar or the pool I would have thought going on previous experience from other hotels that this would be the norm Also the cleanliness of the hotel could have been better , The bed was comfortable 
60069,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, The bed was very comfy I had a great nights sleep The Staff were very helpful and friendly The food was gorgeous Will defiantly be visiting again
60070,Clayton Crown Hotel London, poor lighting if you want to read the best place is bathroom horrible breakfast it is better to buy food in supermarket than to have breakfast in this hotel for 12 pounds ,No Positive
60071,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The noise from the party nearby went on until 2am It did quieten down after reception were contacted after 12 o clock but check if there s something on and ask for a room away from the venue when there is , Staff were lovely Breakfast was good and service excellent in a very busy time
60072,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Staff were polite but sometimes with rather strange behaviour It was close to the midnight when we asked for a bottle of water my wife opens the door and apparently out of being too polite one of the staff who brought the water walks into the room without an invitation where I m sitting on the bed almost naked He asks us to pay while standing in the middle of the room and when I say I will do that tomorrow during check out he refuses saying sorry this is not possible I try to find coins in my wallet while covering my body with a blanket and really really furious I managed finally to find some coins to pay him but later on I was asking myself what if I didn t We wanted to discuss this matter with the helpdesk the day after but we had to run to catch the flight back home I have travelled all around the world so I can confidently say that this was the most awkward situation that I have ever experienced in a hotel , Good value for the price in terms of facilities etc Decent breakfast 
60073,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Cheap sausages and only half a black pudding breakfast is very important don t compromise on quality or quantity Web details said it was close to wembley but it was not , Interesting hotel with a little history FUREYS 
60074,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast a bit pricey if you only choose to have a cooked breakfast although you are able to help yourself to pastries and cereals on offer, Lovely comfortable and modern room Great if going to Wembley as only 4 stops on the tube About 10 minutes walk from the tube but didn t find it a problem There are regular buses if choose not to walk
60075,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Couldn t get parked in the hotel carpark when returning from our evening out When I asked the guy on reception if he knew where else we could park he couldnt help saying he didn t know so we had to just drive around and park on the street somewhere We then had about a 5 min walk back to the hotel Not to much of a problem but wouldn t want to walk it if I was on my own ,No Positive
60076,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The bath mat placed on a tiled floor which meant getting out of the bath shower proved dangerous I actually slipped and ended up bruised from thigh to shin which was extremely painfully ,No Positive
60077,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The fact that we asked 3 members of staff where the restaurant was and they had no idea we gave up on it in the end Got told to go to level one and we would be met by someone this never happened and signs to restaurant led us round in a circle First part of staff training is to show the whole premises to avoid any issues like that , Room was nice and comfortable 
60078,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Staff aren t welcoming don t cnsider regualar customers and loyal visiters Room isn t comfy enouph Leeking was experienced in a room ,No Positive

60080,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The cooked food for breakfast was just average no presentation Some days staff were inattentive disorganised Other days it was good no stand outs though which you expect in hospitality , Staff very friendly on reception helpful Pick up from airport was great Facility is lovely clean miss the bar fridge for fresh milk cold water Etc though
60081,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Can t think of anything , Very relaxed but efficient Close to where my son lives so good location for visit but also only a short train ride from st pancreas 
60082,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The chain s central reservation staff didn t reply to a question left via booking com so it s best to call the hotel directly Guests who need hair conditioner and body lotion should bring their own or pick some up at the nearby Coop as there aren t any provided If you re a stickler for privacy you might want to avoid the ground level rooms which look on to the pool this wasn t an issue for us but might be good to know for others , Very spacious room and bathroom with large thick towels We were arriving from St Pancras and visiting family nearby so the location was ideal but even for those wanting to tourist about the Cricklewood train station is just up the street and while not as frequently serviced as the Tube a quick check on Google Maps or Citymapper will confirm the train schedules There are several tasty inexpensive restaurants and cafes in the area as well as a couple of Costa coffee shops although we also enjoyed drinks and an evening snack at the hotel s bar The wifi worked well even in the lower level rooms facing the pool Finally the staff was very helpful managing to sort out an early check in for us which was quite appreciated Finally the noise insulation was quite good we didn t hear a thing from the weddings and birthday parties that took place over the weekend 
60083,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Everything, Staff not able to deal with a noise situation Placed me and my child on a floor where 5 rooms were being occupied by a wedding party People were congregating outside my room talking till the early hours of the morning and staff did nothing Complained but unable to offer anything to compensate for no sleep
60084,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Our first night was spent in a room on the main road with a bus stop outside Awful so disappointed No sleep but the staff were accommodating to upgrade 2nd night Still stressful having to pack move again To charge for such a room is pretty grim , Location staff atmosphere food the pool was beautiful 
60085,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Absolutely excellent staff great facilities very central We stayed here with 3 children the staff were so helpful accommodating Close to universal studios the hotel runs a taxi service to from it was ideal Will absolutely recommend return in the future The pool was a bonus as lovely warm really enjoyed our stay thanks 
60086,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast wasn t very good The full cooked English breakfast had one sausage one rasher of bacon and no beans Everything else seemed okay , The room was very clean and tidy as was the whole hotel Very friendly staff 
60087,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, The rooms were allocated to us by noon even though we had been told check in was 3pm The staff were very friendly and helpful The rooms were spacious and very clean Plus point the onsite parking

60089,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Bathroom could have had more hooks and bath was a tad too high , We loved our room on the fourth floor Rm 401 The room was very spacious with good views from both windows Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff particularly at Reception Great tea 
60090,Clayton Crown Hotel London, CCTV in car park My car was bumped and unfortunately I was parked just outside the view range Not good , Breakfast was lovely excellent choice available and well presented
60091,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Pool was very small but that s being a little picky , It was all good Only 20 mins into central London lots of shops cafes close by quiet at night and one of the cheapest rooms in it s class what s not to like 
60092,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room not ready for 2pm check in No window in room , Lovely clean room Staff very nice Good location for buses tubes into London Cricklewood station only 5 min walk from hotel Plenty of shops restaurants within walking distance 
60093,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Would have been even better value if breakfast included Went to a local Costa instead , The staff were very pleasant and helpful Parking convenient and good value for London The large family room had a single and double bed and was very clean Slept like a log as the beds were so comfortable 15 minute walk to Kilburn tube station which was easy to find walking through this multicultural area Took us about 25 minutes to get to Oxford street Ideal As only staying overnight didn t use the hotel facilities but would definitely use this hotel again
60094,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Hotel was good but a bit far to the city When you leave in the morning you will most likely stay out until the night as it takes 40 min each way with the underground to the center , Good Hotel with a good price KFC right next to it Friendly staff Comfortable beds 
60095,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The hotel is about a 15 20 min walk to the nearest tube station However there is a bus you can take right outside the hotel that takes into oxford circus or can drop you directly at the tube The shower was a bit tricky to get the hang of but otherwise was good , Staff were extremely helpful let us check in early which was great as we were tired after an early morning flight They gave us advice on the best ways to travel etc Rooms were really spacious and bed was very comfortable The hotel was quiet and relaxing and the pool was open until 10 pm which was great as we didn t have time earlier in the evening 
60096,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The fact that you can t get any signal in the room on the ground floor, The fact reception changed my room from a ground floor to 4th floor as I couldn t get any mobile coverage on the ground floor
60097,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Air con was not working properly cleanliness was not up to standard and breakfast was not worth the money, The location was good and the appearance of the hotel is lovely
60098,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Air conditioning in room far too cold man adjusted the temperature but still too cold I asked for poached egg on bagel for breakfast but received poached egg and bacon I explained this but it was not replaced no apology For dinner I requested chilli with tacos and rice very little chilli mince , Hotel was lovely room fine 
60099,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Could have been more instructions in room Air conditioning was impossible to figure out and so I was freezing because I couldn t switch it off Similarly the shower was well nigh incomprehensible and I only got it going by sheer luck and trial and error I m sure the chambermaids would have willingly helped They were very helpful and attentive Weirdly the towels were positioned right at the other side of the bathroom away from the hand basin , Bed was comfortable Room was spacious and bathroom was very big Why are hotel rooms so badly lit dark Decor was excellent and lobby was lovely Wifi excellent Gym items all worked Unusual in a hotel nowadays I find 
60100,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast room staff were quite slow to take our order but the food was great when it came, The bar staff were lovely and room was clean and bigger than expected
60101,Clayton Crown Hotel London, gym could be better Didn t stay long enough to experience the facilities properly, comfort of beds and facilities in the room good clean nice staff lovely friendly and helpfull
60102,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I booked a executive double room but it was really small my bathroom was more grand and bigger to be honest i spent most of my time in my lovely big bathroom , It was a lovely hotel staff was friendly I lost my purse but i left on the reception desk so all night and all morning i was panicing so finally i went down stairs to reception at around 3 30pm and there it was so the staff are also trust worthy to 
60103,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Very accommodating and a humble location The price reflected this and made for a great break in the good old cricklewood which didn t break the bank Great restaurant elementtree not far away had a good time 
60104,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Staff very cold not the best customer service Bathroom was filthy with black mould grime in the sink and filthy glasses Parking is tight VERY tight , Very comfy beds Great bar and cocktails Well maintained hotel 20 into central London via Uber 
60105,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The room solely had a window to the indoor pool area Hardly any natural ligh a bit at least from the glas roof above the pool From the pool there was an extreme smell of cloride in the room and you could obviouls not get any fresh air Upon request the room could also not be changed Very poor value ,No Positive
60106,Clayton Crown Hotel London, If the parking is full reception not knowledgeable about a plan b and so were less helpful than would have liked The pub attached were more in the know locally and pointed us to the nearby Travel Lodge where 24hour parking is free and open to public use Breakfast was a little on the expensive side for what it was 12 per head with 5 supplement for salmon and scrambled eggs 17 in total steep wherever you are n the world let alone Cricklewood Hotel did take off the cost of the breakfast though when we merely just mentioned it A fair gesture, Clean comfortable spacious family room Does what it says on the tin and hotel offered flexibility when we required another night stop over 
60107,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Stayed Friday and what a disaster No parking left had to park in travelodge which apparently was much cheaper Check in fine shower was covered in grime bed was most uncomfortable as were the pillows Had been bitten by God knows what on my arms and legs Paid an extra 36 for breakfast that was absolutely awful The eggs were under cooked myself and my husband have been unwell since Saturday evening Only now getting over the sickness so glad my nephew opted for cereal shall be making a phone call later to complain and ask for the 180 pounds I ve paid just to be left tired bitten hungry and sick As when I went to complain at check out there was nobody to be seen , That it was next to a few convenience stores 
60108,Clayton Crown Hotel London, No parking in the car park or near the hotel dispite trying twice at 3 30 then waiting until 9pm when I rang and was told that there were spaces in the car park but there were not Had to park a 10minute walk away outside some houses and flats and carry our luggage , Staff were friendly and welcoming Rooms were spacious

60113,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Lovely hotel excellent location Staff were really friendly and helpful Had dinner in the pub downstairs which was ok Room was very clean good size excellent value for money and really quiet 
60114,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The air conditioning was not working unfortunately which affected sleep in addition to this it was like trying to eat breakfast in a sauna The exterior at the front of the hotel became very littered towards the end of the evening was not cleaned until the morning The music in the hotel was exceptionally loud even in the reception area which made conversation less relaxed The Windows on the upper levels of the hotel needed washing on the exterior the parking was very hit miss I booked originally with yourselves and the hotel froze the money in my account prior to the stay When I booked out settled my bill in full I found that I still had the frozen money in my account I had to contact my bank to unfreeze the amount , The interior of the hotel was very nice clean The rooms were of a good size comfortable The food was of a good quality and serving staff were pleasant 
60115,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Traveling to London can be tiring it s nice to have this hotel ideally located also the swimming pool and gym is great My daughter loves the pool 
60116,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We had to change room twice The first room we went to it had fungus I m the room the walls were extremely dirty and you couldn t breath then asked to be moved and got chargerd and that room the air con was not working and it was so hot outside we couldn t breath and my partner is ill we then got moved to a 3rd room and had to pay the 79 difference because they had no other rooms and when I asked the staff to open a window she refused and was so rude to me and my partner the worst experience ever and no one even said sorry when it was no fault of our own , I didn t like anything apart from underground parking 
60117,Clayton Crown Hotel London, It was the worst experience of a lifetime At around 10pm a couple just opened the door while I was half naked in bed and I almost passed out as I had a panic attack My son saw them from afar and rushed back to the room I had the greatest scare of my life and I am going to ask for legal advice on this matter as they claimed I occupied their room Apparently their room was changed but they still had the keys to my room 042 Ithought they were criminals as they could not speak English Glad I did not travel alone I would have been dead if my son did not come in ,No Positive
60118,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast was horrible in comparison to other 4 star hotels its not that it wasnt good but in terms of value for money it was very bad The staff during breakfast meals werent the best either The trolly used to tranfer our luggage to and from the rooms was old and a bother to use, Very helpful and friendly staff who were also tentative The rooms were cleaned properly and the pool was fun to use They compensated for a problem they had when i sent clothes for laundry
60119,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The shower was burning hot and adjusting the control didn t make it any cooler Also no point paying 12 for breakfast when cafes in the Broadway offer good breakfasts for less than 5 , The bed was lovely and comfortable and room was quiet even though on the ground floor 
60120,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We could not eat evening meal in restaurant because menu was not to our taste very traditional very meat based and no vegetarian choice on the menu , Beautiful location and grounds lovely view from our bedroom We were allowed to finish our breakfast in the sunshine on the terrace Comfortable bed and spacious bathroom We would revisit 
60121,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Very ruth and unreliable staff Yana and her Manager especially Never settle to go to their basement rooms which they initially gave us with windows level overlooking to their indoor pool with no fresh air and constant noise Loud music and screaming people until 2 00AM from the bar every night of our stay 5nights when you have small child it was extremely difficult We were required to check in with receptionist every time when going back to our rooms if not our keys were not working Location is in bad neighborhood too far from the City We had to walk over 15 min one way to get to the subway Bus will take you forever We asked for hotel private taxi to go to Silverstone Grand Prix he never returned to pick us up in the rain and after waiting for 2 hours we had to look for another way to come back to the hotel about 100 miles away and of course our keys didn t work at 1 00AM So the hotel decides when you could enter your well paid rooms We ll NEVER go back to this place AGAIN , Only positive thing was the size of the room Deluxe King bed 
60122,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Nothing is good Staff attitude One person at the reception No one receives call from Housekeeping Cleanliness is pathetic Room cleaning staff dont even clear the waste basket properly Bed is extremely bad the mattress are old and have a dip in center , Other then one can say location there is nothing good Although the web site says 10 minutes walk to underground infect its more One needs to take bus to reach station
60123,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Finding yourself in a room with one window that overlooks the indoor swimming pool where a large number of children are understandably playing noisily and where there is no mobile phone signal is not what I expect for a business booking Then to be advised that there are no alternative rooms but later a different view is given to booking com and I am accused of requesting an upgrade that i had never asked for And when seeking to cancel and get a refund that was refused That wasn t a great experience , Eventually the team on reception were very helpful in dealing with my issue
60124,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location is almost a mile from the nearest tube station But there are several bus lines from near the front of the hotel to the tube station Expensive rate for the night but we booked late , Very nice hotel Breakfast was very good Efficient laundering service although expensive 
60125,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The fact that there were no secondary parking allocated for the guests after the main parking was full resulting in me getting a ticket for parking in an a street Opposite the hotel just minutes after checking in , Friendlines of the staff was second to none facilities were great and the room was beautiful with a reasonable price for the location 
60126,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We thought it would be closer to Wembley however it is a 25 minute drive , Amazing hotel and really helpful staff Very clean and large room We had spacious 3 persons bedroom Would recommend 
60127,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Needed more milk and wash products in bathroom , Lovely hotel Friendly staff that made it easy to check in and out Very clean room and hotel in general Good location with easy access to tubes to Wembley Stadium Very comfortable beds and spacious rooms 
60128,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We went into the pub restaurant and a member of bar staff Shauna was incredibly blunt and rude with us came across like she really didn t want us being in there and she made us quite uncomfortable having lunch Also we had 2 Mojito s which we re overly strong no mint leaves and no sugar so we couldn t drink them without it making us feel unwell They also brought them out 20 minutes after we got the food , The reception staff were great and really helpful The bed was incredibly comfortable one of the best nights sleep ive had in a long time
60129,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Our room was situated in the BASEMENT our view consisted of the swimming pool which had a kids club Saturday morning meaning we couldn t open our curtains for the duration of the stay Also we were awoken by the said kids swimming class as the only thing separating us from the pool was a single piece of glass very very noisy After all this stress we couldn t even go swimming because the pool was occupied by the swimming class for the entirety of the monring The location of the hotel is poor its not situated in a nice area of London and it is not central at all took us an exhausting 40 minutes tube and a cab just to reach the hotel after being in central London The surrounding area consist of kabab shops halal meat vendors and Iceland , The breakfast was nice well after paying 15 for it I would ve expected it to be gold plated but after sending my order back the second time they got it right it and it was quite nice 
60130,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Nothing not to like , The rooms were spacious and modern and just generally lovely Great bathroom with powerful shower and really comfy beds Immaculately clean and a perfect location for Wembley stadium events 
60131,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I thought breakfast staff could of been a bit more efficient as service was a bit slow, The bedroom bathroom was very clean really happy with room as it was 3 of us sharing last minute booking really impressed with cost location
60132,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room wasn t exactly quiet when a large group of tourists was in the lobby and exiting as all the noise seemed to funnel straight up to the room same for the wedding party giveing a send off to the happy couple but nowhere would have been quiet for that one , Was in Room 351 and it was very large being on a corner of a curved building Lots of space to move around The food in the pub was spartan but served promptly by the staff short on tables seating but its a modern pub where you are expected to stand 
60133,Clayton Crown Hotel London, No tea or coffee facilities in room 2 people sharing only 1 towel in bathroom so had to share We did find another but in top of wardrobe that we couldn t reach, Fantastic room
60134,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We were a family of four our rooms were so small different to what we saw in the photos No mini fridge Even though we asked for a interconnecting rooms it was not provided No bell boy to carry the luggage the Manager and the receptionist had to do it The breakfast had no variety for a guest who stayed for 5 days Its the same every day The lift was noisy and old If you are to rate this as a four star property these little things matters , Location near two underground stations price and the reception staff was courteous 
60135,Clayton Crown Hotel London, WANT TO BE HAPPY IN LONDON DON T EVER GO TO Clayton Crown Hotel Here is my story I have booked this Hotel for 3 nights on 8 06 2016 to 11 06 2016 Deluxe Double and Single Room 361 80 It was a family visit when we came to the hotel the ladies gave us a warm welcome and were very nice to be honest We went out side and come back late in night the hotel room is extremely hot I put it on the maximum cool temperature but unfortunately was also hot the maximum cool you can get is between 23 9 25 I have complained to the reception and they have sent me a guy to check the room and told me your room is really hot but the reception said we do not have any more available room so they gave me Air Cooler which it didn t make any better I can t believe it Am I in 4 stars hotel or 1 star any way the reception in the other day told me that they are going to give us a new room and they will move the luggage and make sure the air conditioning is working good I have trusted them before checking the new room so we went outside and when we came back I have find out that no one has inserted the electricity card which I have asked to do to make the air conditioning working the room was extremely extremely hot I have waited 4 hours to get the room cooler but nothing happened I have complained again and the same thing happened no any room available and gave me other Air cooler We couldn t sleep on that hot weather I have asked to see the duty manager when I was talking on the phone so in the morning I went to speak to the duty Manager ZOLTAN around 7am And here is my story begin I came to hime and you can see from my face how exhausted I was I was very calm talking in very nice way asked him sir do you know what is my problem since I came the manager you can see all the anger from his face don t know why No smile no kind no respect no apology for the air conditioning problem we got from the room , Nothing 
60136,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We didn t like the breakfast it was appalling and not worth the money we were going to pay There was not a lot of anything and a lot of the food was cold not much variety in what was there Eggs were not fluffy Haha However the lady at reception told us we didn t have to pay for it which we were very happy about , The reception workers were kind welcoming and understanding
60137,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The staff were unhelpful and charge 4 for things to be brought to the room e g extra towels toothbrush etc There were no slippers or gowns supplied and me and my partner paid for late checkout and were then told we couldn t check out when we d wanted too I d never use again ,No Positive
60138,Clayton Crown Hotel London, No daylight in the room The window could not be opened and anyway overlooked the indoor swimming room so no fresh air available , Large airy reception area Swimming pool
60139,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Have to say this is a gem of a hotel the staff were super friendly and the facilities perfect Location excellent for heading into centre of London The pillows were beyond comfortable like sleeping on clouds Yana on reception was so helpful and friendly Would definitely recommend 
60140,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The wood surfaces showed signs of a lot of wearer and tear as did the painted walls and ceilings The shower bath tap was extremely loose on its fittings and made for a poor shower , We loved the room which was a complementary upgrade 
60141,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The location was not ideal rows and rows of crappy shops Plus we booked especially due to having a swimming pool at the hotel yet the pool was being used for swimming lessons throughout our stay which really was a shame We stayed sat sun , Lovely hotel great friendly staff and clean as well 
60142,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Original room offered was a bit tired and smoky Asked to be moved and got a room at the back which was much newer and perfect for us No view but quiet , Breakfast at extra cost was excellent with a fantastic selection Not just soggy bacon Ham brie rolls croissant fruit as well as full English or Irish 20 taxi from Paddington and also from Wembley Nice swimming pool although limited changing facilities 
60143,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The executive rooms to us were just family rooms for 2 people Couldn t see what made it executive Room also had a single bed which for 2 people was only good for putting suitcases on Pub had both ale pumps out of order , Very good airy hotel staff good Had everything you could need Great breakfast 
60144,Clayton Crown Hotel London, There wasn t nothing we didn t like, Bed and pillows were very comfortable very nice breakfast lots to chose from Excellent bar area and very friendly staff 
60145,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room suite was dated and not worth the money Would stay closer to Wembley next time No time for breakfast or to use the pool so can t comment on these ,No Positive
60146,Clayton Crown Hotel London, no bathrobes to go to the swimming pool real ale was not available due to high demand need a little more planning , friendliness of the staff and their willing to help and accommodate our requests
60147,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The distance to the nearest tube station , Staff were courteous on arrival answering queries readily and politely The room was spacious beds were very comfortable and the bathroom spacious too Throughout the hotel was spotlessly clean 
60148,Clayton Crown Hotel London, My room had a window onto the swimming pool rather than the outside which made it a bit gloomy My greatest criticism is the lighting especially in the bathroom it was well nigh impossible to find a well lit spot for applying make up etc In my room there was virtually no mobile network coverage meaning I missed phone calls and messages , I chose this hotel mainly because it is on a bus route convenient for my purposes It also has good transport links into central London and other areas several useful buses stop right outside there is a frequent and quite fast service into St Pancras from the station nearby and Kilburn tube and Brondesbury Overground are a short bus ride away All of these services are covered by the Oyster card The room and the general decor are very pleasant clean and comfortable Wifi is free and works fine The bathroom is well equipped and everything works well although it takes a while to work out how to operate the taps The Pan Asia restaurant on the premises has excellent food which is good value The menu is quite limited but the quality is high The service though friendly and polite isn t always very efficient 
60149,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, our entire stay for 3 days was wonderful staff ab fab so friendly and helpful Edel arranged a little surprise flowers and chocolate for my parents 50th anniversary the bar food was excellent really couldn t say enough ideally situated for city centre with bus stop just outside the door
60150,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast was expensive given that no one explained where the buffet was offered us coffee until we asked where to get it I ordered poached salmon eggs and asparagus and was told it would cost more which was ok but what arrived was smoked salmon and scrambled eggs I sent it back as I really wanted poached eggs and asparagus and about 20 minutes later a plate with salmon eggs and pak choi arrived At this stage I just wanted to leave so I ate the eggs and left Pretty insulting really I would have preferred them to tell me there wasn t any asparagus than taking me for an idiot , Receptionist was extremely cheerful and helpful at check in and in assisting us in planning our travel routes 
60151,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I couldn t smoke on the balcony and had to go down to smoke that s not so comfortable dressing undressing for a quick fag while the balcony is there , Beds comfortable clean felt super comfortable in the room spend amazing night nice bathroom with a bath tv to watch the euro 2016 games very value for the money will definitely return to this hotel to stay if I need
60152,Clayton Crown Hotel London, That the TV auto turns on in the morning and the gentleman that checked us in was very unhelpful and due to him there was confusion paying our bill at check out, The bed size and towels and gowns
60153,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I missed out the deals for the night I stayed it went down by 40, Great stay I missed out the deals for the night I stayed it went down by 40 other than that I will be happy to recommend this hotel to friends and family
60154,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and woke us up , staff were very helpful and friendly Taxi service ordered by the hotel was great Waited for us as we struggled to get out of Wembley stadium I was very grateful for this given I was with children The swimming pool was a nice treat 
60155,Clayton Crown Hotel London, we were offered a room in the basement 2nd floor from ground reception floor even thogh the rate we paid was considerable for such a hotel then we managed to get room on the fourth floor reception 2 after a long negotiation the key cards and the tv flat screen worked occasionally and at their own discretion We turned off the TV could watch only one channel by deplugging A noise of about 80 Db woke us at 6 am every morning which we thougt was caused by pushing of some metal carts alarms went on one night at 2 am for no reason and we didnot know or were not told whether we should evacuate Furniture literally was worn out and away drawers were falling off and not being pushed back We had to stay there because of proximity to a certain address but the neighbourhood was very unpleasent , the only positive point we could think of was the condition of towels and bedsheets They were new and clean 
60156,Clayton Crown Hotel London, My major points of contention would be the bathroom and a failure to address a large 20 in length crack in one of the walls When I inspected the bathroom initially everything looked orderly and clean until I checked the shower and tub This was quite a let down for me The tile grout had notable mildew in several places and the shower head was encrusted with dingy calcium deposits This bothered me enough to talk to the staff about it and to their credit someone did come and try to improve the problem with a vinegar cleaning solution which made things a little better but not perfect London is a world class city and all hotels need to make sure that their establishments reflect that prestige in every possible detail right down to the tile grout and shower heads , First impressions always matter and the hotel made a good one as I walked into the ornate airy lobby and was greeted by gracious and professional staff Check in was smooth and quick As for my room 362 its size was much larger than I expected for a London hotel I was pleasantly surprised However I would say that the best feature about my room was the bed After a busy day in the city it was a relaxing treat to sink into the lush and fluffy duvet covers and drift off to dreamland It was as if clouds wrapped themselves around me and lulled me to sleep 
60157,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I had a cashmere hood sweater that got lost in the room during a 2 days stay When I challenged the staff about this they refused to take responsibility making it look like I made this claim up I did not like that The managed promised to look into it but told me that their staff was 100 trustworthy again initiating that the missing item was something from my imagination They did not offer anything even a free coffee for my discomfort and not even a welcome back we will do everything we can to help ,No Positive
60158,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Shower was not easy to operate couldn t work out hot from cold , Great value for money Comfortable and spacious room Very clean Friendly staff Nice bar 
60159,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Facilities in pool and gym were poor Changing room was small and full of children having swimming lessons Not the relaxing start to the day I expected Thought the pool looked dirt and dated , Comfortable quiet rooms Nice reception and bar 
60160,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The cofee was a real let down undrinkable bitter this is not a matter of taste or strength it is to do with compromising on the quality of coffee Also the most interesting area in the hotel the balcony overlooking the atrium is not accessible unless you are renting the room for a function This is annoying if that view is one reason you have booked , The interior of the hotel is very interesting and stylish Staff very helpful
60161,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Reception staff rude breakfast average and could have been hotter Feel standards have slipped since being changed to Clayton Overpriced for what you get, Convenient for my requirements
60162,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The area was quite run down but lots of restaurants and takeaways nearby , Very comfortable beds more spacious than many hotel rooms Handy for Wembley stadium only 15 mins walk from nearest tube station 
60163,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The pool was shut for my entire stay unfortunately The aircon wasn t really making it a nice temperature either , The beds were lovely and the whole hotel was charming and a short ride away from central London 
60164,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location isnt great 20 min to tube which isn t to bad but doing it everyday back and forth after being around London city Phew There is a bus which does run past the station It also seems to be in an area where there are a lot of coloured people and Muslims and they seem to hang around but it s fine when you get in the tube into the Center of London , English breakfast Staff were fine It did have its own carpark although it can get busy 
60165,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Bathroom in our room was dirty and not up to the usual standard Mentioned it to the reception but it was still not cleaned properly, Staff were very friendly Couldn t fault them
60166,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Bathroom could have been a bit cleaner Bar area was under staffed the staff were doing their best but at times it was chaotic and hard to get served Price a lot higher than the last time we stayed here maybe ramped up for a busy sporting weekend in London Our room was at the top of the stairs from reception and a bit noisy Someone had dumped a load of equipment outside of it as we were going to bed around midnight camera tripods my husband had to go out and ask them to be quiet , The room was a great size and the bedroom was clean The bar is great the quieter side inside the hotel rather than the section leading onto the front Reception staff were friendly and helpful The food and service in the Pan Asian restaurant are fantastic Breakfast was tasty and reasonable as hotel breakfasts go Easy access to Wembley stadium In spite of some criticisms this is a hotel where I feel comfy not like some soulless places I have stayed 
60167,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast was very poor and was an extra 12 per person We waited 20 mins to get a seat for breakfast and another 30mins to get served breakfast , Room was nice but small
60168,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Complicated air conditioning system i stay in lots of hotels and never have a problem No hot water on my last morning and smoke alarm woke me at 5 am no explanation given I got such a fright , Location and comfy beds
60169,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The water in the shower was not warm on both days we went to shower after breakfast and there was no hot water at that stage For a hotel this size there should have been constant hot water , staff were lovely Location was good the room was comfortable and the area was good with plenty places to eat etc nearby The breakfast was excellent and on weekends the breakfast goes on til 11 which is great 
60170,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Very nice staff and very clean Hotel a really pleasant atmosphere the 2 days were there I like the variety of food around the hotel the Bagel bakery cake place across the road was nice we didn t have breakfast as we were busy out and about london but plan to include that on our next vista as it looked awesome Indoor swimming pool was great for my little daughter she loved it and its a nice wake up call in the morning the water was warm as well
60171,Clayton Crown Hotel London, It mentioned in the borchure the restaurant had a childs menu but really it was a choice of the main courses but half price not quite a childs choice of food The service in the restaurant was not as good prawn crackers were forgotten then when asked for them they came with no sauces and had to ask no apology but apart from that it was ok , Only stayed one night but the reception staff were very welcoming and answered all questions I had simply and efficiently Great having pool and restaurant on site as a single mum with 2 young children it made the stay very comfortable and enjoyable Breakfast choice was excellent and relaxed 
60172,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Our cooked breakfast was cold and we had to send it back It was replaced but shouldn t have been sent out in the first place The buffet breakfast looked a better option , The room was clean comfortable and spacious It was also pleasantly quiet The staff were helpful 
60173,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Bathroom tiles were coming up on the floor making them dangerous and plug socket in bedroom coming away from wall beds very uncomfortable unfortunately we were on a very tight time restraint so we didn t have time to make them aware of these problems
60174,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Booked breakfast on checkin but in the morning was refused service in the breakfast room because I hadnt paid for it The shower wasnt working properly just a jet of water Tried to use the gym and found equipment broken broken straps on the exercise bike pedals Room was too warm tried to switch on the air conditioning or ventilation system but no instructions and not easy to understand how to try and cool the room down , A gym pool and parking were key requirements which they do have Checkin was smooth and room looked nice 
60175,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The gym equipments need updating and the ventilation in the gym improved there is a swimming pool next door and apparently when the heating is increased for the pool then the heating affects the drift into the gym and they are literally no visible ACs in the gyms The rooms are clean but no fridges in the room which was abit annoying however I went down to reception to complain and they were kind enough to give me a mini portable fridge which hardly cooled anything but atleast they tried I guess , The location is great with loads of shops easy access to trandport The staff at the reception are extra helpful and friendly The rooms are actually quite large and very clean 
60176,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The shower is strange and the tap a bit dirty Also the fact that there is no fridge for a 4 hotel it is a bit strange, The staff is nice and helpful the bed and the pool are great
60177,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room heat controls not good and water was not hot on second morning of stay View from room very poor and window couldn t open, Location and room access was easy
60178,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Didn t enjoy cold showers in the morning as the hot would run out before 9am the air con was set on 14 degrees cel When you complained to management regarding issues nothing was done about and you were told there was nothing wrong, on occasion you would have a helpful staff member The rest of the time you were looked upon as an inconvenience 
60179,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, My husband and I came for a wedding Reception held in bentley room catering was really nice room looked stunning staff worked really hard and very polite stayed in the hotel over night Room lovely all facilities available 
60180,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The only thing if i was being very picky would be some locals outside the Pan Asia resturant asking people for money but you get this all over so thats life it happens x, There was nothing to dislike Hotel was fab fantastic location and staff will return in july x
60181,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Nothing , Liked everything excellent value for money and ideally situated for travelling back and fore to Wembley Arena for the event we were attending over the 3 days 
60182,Clayton Crown Hotel London, No mini bar fridge not okay for 4 star but it s seems to be okay according to London standard, The Thai restaurant inside the bar the pool as well as the staff 
60183,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, The most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in in any hotel anywhere in the world Convenient location for our needs visiting our son in West Hampstead Excellent transport links 
60184,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Although the room was nice there were no windows so no fresh air This meant either having the very noisy air conditioning on all night or trying to sleep in a very hot and stuffy room Also duty manager who checked us out on Saturday morning not very friendly at all compared to the Australian lady checking out the people next to us By no means a bad review just our experience Would stay again just perhaps not the same room, Room was very clean Shower was amazing Staff on check in were very helpful with directions to where we were going 
60185,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast was disappointing coffee was stale , Staff were friendly and helpful The adjoining pub was a quirky touch Much nicer than a standard hotel bar 
60186,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Shower head seemed to be slightly broken but nothing too major , Bed was comfy room was large and spavious staff were very helpful and hotel was very clean and presentable 
60187,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Tea tray not topped up in room but we could have asked for more items we didn t our fault, The bed was very comfy slept well every night Room service breakfast was fantastic breakfast served upstairs in restaurant was excellent as well
60188,Clayton Crown Hotel London, A decent 4 star hotel but it lacked some of the most basic things 1 A toilet brush 2 A minibar 3 Plug adaptors were scarce 4 ONLY ONE SOAP 5 A very cold room with a bad heater I required an extra heater to warm the room in a 4 STAR HOTEL 6 I asked for 2 single beds and I found them together that was hilarious 7 A 4 star hotel that actually offers prices without breakfast sounds more like a low cost airline , The staff was extremely helpful with giving me the bill the way I needed it 
60189,Clayton Crown Hotel London, See above , You were able to find rooms nearby on r ception floor as we had elderky frail relatives with us The double bed plus single excellent for them Only thing That could have improved stay would be a access shower for them 
60190,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The room was tiny noisy and the corridor stink of cigeratte smoke Bathroom had pee marks on floor with bath tub full of hair The shower head was broken which was replaced when complained Unhygenic place to stay , Nothing at all 
60191,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Cold shower and staff just apologised and didn t take it any further Would have preferred not to be on the ground floor but minor issue , Food was good Wifi excellent Pool facilities good Rooms comfortable
60192,Clayton Crown Hotel London, bathroom could do with a good clean damp a mildew marks around shower area , Great value for money loved the ambience of the hotel Staff were very polite and helpful large family room beds were comfy 
60193,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The view of a brick wall from the window in the room, The hotel was close to underground for transport and the room was comfortable to stay in for a night 
60194,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We were told we needed to pay extra for triple room yet my in laws that paid for 2 doubles got 2 triple rooms even tho there was only 2 staying in each room , Decor reception area and joining bar
60195,Clayton Crown Hotel London, There was access to the London underground however it was a 15 minutes walk and there wasnt any restaurants near the hotel , The property was extremely clean at all times and the staff were friendly and helpful 
60196,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Only a minor thing but the ramp to the underground car park was very steep and you could easily scrape your front bumper if you arent carefull , The beds were incredibly comfortable as were the pillows and the bathroom and room were very clean 
60197,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Our room was right next to the stairwell entrance and this door was repeatedly banging at 8am from staff coming back and forth Shower head could use replacing as it was old and pressure was too high , Rooms were clean and tidy comfy beds and nice d cor in the lobby Swimming pool was also good 
60198,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Nothing every thing was great, everything beds very cosy room hotel very clean breakfast lots of choice and delicious Staff very helpful and friendly 
60199,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The only thing we didn t feel to comfortable with was our room looked directly into the swimming pool which was quite busy The first thing we did was close the curtains Wasn t a huge problem with us staying the one night as we wasn t in the hotel much If was to stay again and longer I wouldn t want the same room ,No Positive
60200,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room was very noisy Room 36 It was an adjoining room and could hear everything from other room mainly their TV No window so felt very stuffy actually overlooked swimming pool so would have to close curtains even in daytime to get privacy Ideal room if have kids in adjoining room but horrible for us as a young couple enjoying a night away without children , Nice clean hotel with close access to kilburn station Car park easy to use and good cost per day Shower was good Breakfast was nice 
60201,Clayton Crown Hotel London, My room heating did not work was taken a plug in one for fist night Moved rooms the second night room was hotter but noisy from air conditioning , Service from staff rooms v clean and spacious
60202,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Pool did not look very appealing , The staff were outstanding could not have been more pleasant or helpful Rooms spacious and food very good Location just off the bottom of the M1 with car parking and then easy access to London centre via Bus and Tube was perfect 
60203,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The location of the hotel was much further than I would ve liked and also the value of money It was a good price considering how much the hotel normally is but I expected the room to bit more spacious , I liked how friendly and polite the staff were 
60204,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Food and drinks very expensive in hotel Plenty of options a short walk away , While Crickelwood is busy lots of traffic we found our room very quiet so sleep no problem 
60205,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location is all , Just like all the other reviews i ve read really 10 10 for the hotel just a shame the location lets it down Deffinatly be stopping there again 
60206,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The room I was given was rather noisy Next to the changing room for pool and in front of the pool so I couldn t open the curtains during the day , I always stay here when in London and just enjoy the place and space 
60207,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Every thing was great There is a bus line takes you to the tube metro and in about of 20 minutes you are in the center of London We did not have problems with the WiFi Since we eat Kosher we did not use the restaurant 
60208,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Very noisy in the restaurant area as you can hear the noise from the TV which was very loud coming from the bar area , Comfortable hotel Cooked breakfast was delicious 
60209,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The fry was quite poor especially for 15 If you get room 039 it has no windows and its underground where the heat is unbearable however the room is lovely they did move me to another room Food did take a while to arrive One of the bar girls quite small dark hair was quite ignorant , Good location 15 in an uber to get to the sites Big Ben Buckingham Palace etc Rooms were small but comfortable beds very comfortable 
60210,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Bedding was fresh and clean but very loud during the night The rustle of the pillows and duvet kept us awake, Location and facilities of hotel and pub 
60211,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Breakfast restaurant was cold We tried to get a new place but the waiter forgot about it Too far from London Centre, Staff at Reception very helpful
60212,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The Bed Heating Controls Bed not very comfortable and I believe heating controls should be more user friendly or have instructions, Hotel location familiarity
60213,Clayton Crown Hotel London, One member of staff was very rude as i went to check in early and said we had to wait I went back to check after a hour later and another member of staff were checking people in When i questioned why once again she was very rude ,No Positive
60214,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Car Parking Checked in about 11am and no car parking spaces left, Ideally situated close to Tube network Comfy beds and tea coffee available in room a good touch

60236,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I think breakfast should be included for 90 a night or the rooms need a little more character once we arrived in the room it could have been a premier inn clean but a bit bland Also arrive from wilsden green station it s much nicer route than from Kilburn , Entrance hall very nice blend of modern with Georgian style
60237,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location is not great very little around it to do Noise in bedroom was terrible as my room was tight beside the gym and swimming pool so got woke up very early every morning with people screaming in the pool or banging the doors to the gym Room was horribly warm and very hard to cool down even using the very noisey aircon , Was clean and had everything I needed in the hotel Staff were lovely and rooms were clean and comfortable

60242,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The car park could not be booked prior and when we arrived there was nowhere to park We were advised we did not need to book parking so therefore presumed there would be plenty of space this is not the case it is a first come first served situation with very few spaces We will not go again unless we travel by an alternative way of travel , Friendliness of the staff convenient for Wembley Breakfast was very good

60250,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Nothing , Good location although a little out of the centre Excellent bus train tube links Just needed to factor in a little extra time Fab hotel can t fault it Excellent breakfast 
60251,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The fact that the kettle in the room was not emptied and the fact that it contained tea leaves The area where the hotel is situated is surrounded by hot food takeaways and the only real choice outside of the hotel to eat is Weatherspoon s The overground station at Cricklewood is very close but the underground is approximately one mile away at Kilburn Parking is available at a reduced rate of 15 00 per day at the hotel , The comfort of the bed and the staff

60254,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The room was lit by dim lamps instead of one ceiling light The bath looked like it had be used and the shower head had white crust suggesting there was a limescale build up Signal for the WIFI was abysmal the higher up in the hotel you got There were quite harsh carpet stains which were probably just hoovered over The TV volume only went up so high and was locked at a certain level , The size of the double room was great and spacious Very nice that there was an option to have a bath with a shower head Flat screen TV

60261,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Once again I declined having breakfast and was glad to Just a look to it reaffirmed my original opinion namely that the choice was too unimaginative and the whole offer of breakfast too limited for the price requested Otherwise for an establishment of such good standing some more emphasis on the details e g curtain hungers or scratches from natural tear and wear on the bath furniture would definitely be appreciated especially by returning customers , This has not been the first time I stayed at this hotel I was only too glad to establish that despite the change in the name and eventually the administration the nice welcoming feel was there Excellent state of cleanliness thanks to the very committed floor staff maids and all they have to be expressly praised for their effort immaculate linen What to say of the proximity to transport A bus stop right in the front of the hotel with buses getting you straight to Victoria and other central London destinations Tube station reasonably close Supermarket and conveniece stores next door or accross the street Burger King McDonnalds KFCs Costa Caf within sight I could go on for ever

60265,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The attached pub is very noisy and tends to spill over into the Hotel side very loud football on the TV with the inevitable fans shouting and cheering felt a bit uncomfortable at times with a few very loud drunks about stayed here over 6 times now and been the same most times so not a one off , Front Lobby is very smart and staff always very friendly food is excellent when they have a good chef which at the moment they do bar staff are fab but sometimes very low in numbers so you need to be patient 
60266,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Lack of parking car park full so no chance of on street parking anywhere close until after 10pm and before 9am at weekends On site parking if available 20 a day , Good size room large bathroom well appointed Good communal areas 
60267,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The only thing that I didn t like was that our room keys stopped working a few times and I had to go down to reception about 3 times to get them reprogrammed the shower in our room could of been a bit warmer even though they started off hot in the early part of our stay Also it would of been perfect if they had a spa there but they do have a small gym Don t expect a sea view from any of the windows lol It s a nice modern clean hotel and I would stay again for sure had a great time with the family kids absolutely loved it , Lovely hotel I booked 2 rooms in total an Executive room 1 double and 1 single bed inside and a Double Single room 1 double and 2 single beds inside The rooms were clean and warm beds were comfortable and the hotel was quiet as we had rooms around the back of the hotel Shower gel shampoo and body lotion were provided in the bathrooms extra towels blankets and a safe in the wardrobe The pool is lovely and is open from 7am to10pm the kids loved it there s also a small gym There s the Staples Corner branch of Cineworld cinema not too far away maybe 3 4 bus stops away in distance but about 6 minutes away by car went to see the Star Wars Movie which was great There is a Mc Donalds restaurant next door to hotel which the kids loved also a Burger King restaurant across the road and local kebab shops and a few small restaurants etc nearby The hotel does have a pub next door and the Pan Asia restaurant but Pan Asia was closed on Boxing Day during our stay so not sure what the food is like there I did book a table at Pan Asia on the Open Table app but God knows why they told me it was open when it wasn t so beware if booking on the Open Table app however breakfast was fine and was situated in the same place where the Pan Asia restaurant is 
60268,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, The price of the hotel for the New Year s was more than reasonable Very close to the Tube walking distance 10 minutes or you can catch the bus right in front of the hotel The staff was awesome Breakfast was worth 10 pounds Swimming pool and gym Free wi fi in the room Restaurant and bar with welcoming staff as well I will definitely visit this hotel again

60273,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Stayed in the hotel 2 years ago standard look like they re dropped Water to cold to have a shower at 9 o clock in the morning Soap dispenser was empty and not top up on a 2 night stay , Nice hotel with a good atmosphere
60274,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Dirty room TV not working properly Cold I wouldn t stay there with a baby again BREAKFAST IS TERRIBLE Not worth the money Our baby was sick they charged us for 5 min 10 extra for late checkout Disgusting Management terrible , Location excellent

60280,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Music in the front bar on Saturday night was so loud we couldn t hear ourselves think and we had to move to the residents lounge I went to the check in desk to order a taxi and I felt that the man behind the desk had poor English I had to write down the address and postcode for him as he couldn t understand me I am English , The hotel is beautiful and in a great location for getting to London and also Luton airport 
60281,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Food and drink a little expensive prob due to the euro exchange rate for us , Staff very friendly Comfortable room Lovely lobby lounge bar whatever you need even tayto crisps 
60282,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The only real complaints were no clock available in our room and our complementary tea set had no tea or sugar ready for when we arrived Also a wider range of food would have been appreciated as there wasn t a lot of choice and this forced us to eat away from the hotel , Absolutely everything was perfect in the hotel no complaints at all If it had been a bit closer to the centre of London it would have got a perfect score as that s where we wanted to travel to during the day but that takes nothing away from how fantastic the hotel was we can t wait to stay again 
60283,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Tv remote didnt work consistently Bathroom taps ultra modern nice looking but impractical to grasp with wet hands Shower temp control from very warm to hot only no cooler temps Cleanliness could be improved floor tiles bathroom water stained marked shower nozzle full of lime scale some mould tile grouting missing around bath bath itself bit dusty carpet bedroom bit gritty under barefoot mattress stained , Nicely decorated room with comfortable bed and good lighting Pub inside next door beautiful old architecture beautifully restored decorated open fireplace plus xmas deco perfect

60288,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast was horrible But that s UK food for you lol , Great location very close to Central London Tube station a few blocks away Interesting neighborhood Convenient and reasonable price A 3 night stay was around 700 USD compared to other hotels for almost 700 USD a night There is also a pool and fitness center that we did not go to but they do have it There s a McDonald s right across the street which is good because UK food is mostly terrible Any problems were mainly quickly addressed 
60289,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I had no bad experiences , I loved everything about the stay The hotel is immaculate the staff were lovely and very attentive the good was delicious and the room was beautiful and so comfortable to stay in I would most certain y come back to stay in this hotel and will be recommending it to friends and family I didn t want to leave 
60290,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Missing a mini bar , A very friendly young staff Very Helpfull Spacies rooms Nice breakfast We were with a group of 8 and booked 3 rooms All of them with lots of space Very clean as well 
60291,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The hotel is located a bit far from the Paddington station costing me 25 pounds for a taxi ride to the hotel Even though we pre booked a continental breakfast for hot meals we needed to pay extra Some front desk receptionists had an unfriendly attitude of serving their customers , The room was fairly clean and comfort The hotel has a nice dining restaurant which provides delicious Asian food 
60292,Clayton Crown Hotel London, it was little bit cold inside of our room and the only temperature regulation device was from A C which did not realy heat Wifi signal was very weak in our room We had to go to the lobby to be well conneceted from neighboring rooms you here more than you wish Noise isolation is weak , we were very happy with kind hotel stuff very good connection to public transportation hotel is nice clean and stylish even you need to pay extra for breakfast it is worth money it costs Wide breakfast offer should satisfy everyone even I wrote some negatives in general we can recommend this hotel and we will probably consider this hotel again for our next stay in London 
60293,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The picture on the website showed a jacuzzi which was misleading because there wasn t one This however did not detract from our wonderful experience, The hotel is located in a busy area with a rich supply of caf s restaurants and bars There is an excellent bus service on the doorstep The tube station isn t too far away The hotel is clean and very comfortable The staff were incredibly helpful informative and patient I made good use of the gym and pool
60294,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Shower wasn t quite as hot as I d like but was powerful Lift juddered a bit Basement parking is limited I was lucky and got the last available space , A large comfortable and attractive room and bathroom Good quality breakfast 
60295,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, We arrived late they allowed us to park outside as no room in car park I was quite ill during my stay with chest infection and allowe a late checkout at short notice enabling me to get a few more hours rest before travelling home
60296,Clayton Crown Hotel London, All good Volume on TV could have a higher setting, Access from A5 couldn t have been better rooms of a very good standard and utilities where good 
60297,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location wasn t great the whole of cricklewood area is run down and full of different cultures not welcoming at all only good thing about Cricklewood is the hotel and the crown pub, Hotel is lovely staff are friendly rooms are clean and spacious would definitely visit again bus right outside the hotel that goes into London city centre through Oyster card that can be bought across the road
60298,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Its a little too far outside the main attractions but has reasonable transport links the breakfast room staff need to be not a little more attentive just attentive , Reception staff were fantastic nothing too much trouble the room was very good bed a little hard for my liking overall very good and i would stay again with no reservations

60300,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Wifi almost non existent making it impossible to work Staff banging around outside our door from early Housekeeping knocking the door and waking us up when we clearly told reception we would like a lie in, Staff in the bar really pleasant 
60301,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Really dusty room and sheets sneezing and itching Al time there Terrible shower pressure struggled to wash my long thick hair Only whole milk for tea and coffee Noisy road, Facilities and staff
60302,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The rooms and no only have a smell that smells of disinfectant That s fine but only in U K and India is that we it bother For the one offering the Hotel we believe that the price paid was too high In cities such as Milan Barcelona Dubai Munich Lisbon and Amsterdam similar structures It is often more cheaper Bother much because you pay so much and is not included breakfast , The availability of staff at reception From my point of view availability over the avarage for as is normally in England In the UK the behavior is for us normaally just sufficient The room big enough for a family with one child The transport to the center as easy For eating out is pretty close Transportation to the center quite easy with bus not less than 30 minutes with metro not really close it is much more fast 
60303,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The breakfast was horrendous I did not sleep all night due to the extra curricular activities of the people in the room next door The staff said they would sort this out but it didn t happen and we were still awake at 5 o clock in the morning not the restful night I was hoping for the bathroom was also dirty on arrival , The room was ok 
60304,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Swimming pool does not have a shallow end so not much use for younger children Although perfectly pleasant room could do with a little colour feature wall to go with the magnolia maybe , Lovely and clean and tidy bed was mega comfy Staff very friendly and polite Nice bathrooms good wife which is free
60305,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The public bar of the attached pub The Rugby was on but I felt some of the clientel needed better vetting The atmosphere was not very friendly The Lounge part was night and day in comparison , The hotel was very good indeed Staff were helpful and gave a free upgrade The breakfast was excellent and location was central enough to not be too busy 
60306,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Housekeeping didnt pick up my laundery which resulted in me wearing unwashed cloths on one day Not super convenient with public transport , Really enjoyed the overall hotel with the restaurant and bar attached to it Nice Asian foor altough there could be a little more spice and less sweet Bar is great for either lunch of having a pint watching the game
60307,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I dont think charging 10 per person for breakfast x 3 is value for money plus 30 for car parking when paying over 200 s per night is reasonable , Friendly staff and food in the bar was good value plus the leisure facilities and internet were good 
60308,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Only downside for us was the swimming lessons going on when we tried to use the pool but that s the only possible thing that would be negative, Hot was fantastic location was great wasn t bad staying just out of the city the old bar was beautiful and the hotel had great facilities the room was great staff very helpful No complaints
60309,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We did not have a bad experience but only downside was the distance from the nearest underground station , Nice room lovely hotel good food in the bar adjacent to the hotel staff friendly and helpful 
60310,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Cricklewood is a bit hit and miss but if you don t mind that it s a FAB hotel complete with a warm pool The only place to stay in NW6 NW2 , The staff were amazing and so helpful for my 3yo Even got us a little fridge so I could keep cold milk on hand Nothing was too much trouble for them especially Ramona the duty manager 
60311,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The changing room after a swim is very small and only one shower , Staff are very friendly and helpful I actually checked in early which was good as the room was clean and ready 
60312,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Traditional English breakfast was edible but dry and certainly not up to the same standard of the evening meal , Very relaxed atmosphere with on site parking great traditional pub and excellent meal in restaurant 
60313,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Only issue was the wi fi reception was poor in the bedroom, Staff were very helpful and friendly Room was attractive spacious and clean Bed very comfortable 
60314,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Our tv didn t work , Lovely spacious room quiet considering location nice and close to public transport Clean bathroom and room very friendly and helpful staff 
60315,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Mattress was a bit rubbish so didn t have the best night s sleep Parking is also difficult to find when a van is parked across the concealed entrance and 15 night is a touch expensive , A nice clean hotel with two very reasonable restaurants attached Room was fine other than the old mattress 12pm checkout definitely a bonus though 
60316,Clayton Crown Hotel London, I was overcharged me It was resolved but caused a major kink in my vacation cash flow The area around the hotel isn t that nice If you re from New York it s like putting a very old fashion upscale hotel in Flatbush You won t find sidewalk cafes and upscale boutiques there more like bodegas and 99 stores which is fine if you re not looking for the former We had to change rooms because the first had zero wifi coverage and then when we changed rooms that one had a stopped up sink , The hotel is easily accessible by bus from the local subway stop The hotel decor is classy and well kept It looks exactly like the photos The staff is friendly and helpful 
60317,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The room was below ground level so not much in the way of a view in fact a brick wall was it really , Being in the location of London without being IN London 
60318,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Could have had a few biscuits with tea coffee, The staff were extremely helpful hired a room for a wake and everything went to plan Guests were happy with food 
60319,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The water wasn t working for over 12 hours Nobody informed me of this the staff were very unhelpful and uncooperative I had to go buy a big water container to take a shower not to mention the level of cleanliness the front desk staff attitude , I ve been staying in this hotel since 2010 but the deterioration is clear 
60320,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Restaurant shut at 10 30pm and very few welcoming other eateries if you been to a game at Wembley , Good parking facilities and we ll placed for Wembley and Central London 
60321,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, excellent staff always ready to help loved the fact bar was open and had a few relaxing drinks after our long wait to get a cab back from Wembley will return when we next decide to watch England
60322,Clayton Crown Hotel London, No ample space in room No refrigerator available in room No continental breakfast and no varieties in dishes far away from center the surrounding is loudly hotel rate is high I paid high accommodation price Electrical receptacles difficult to connect your own devices requires extensions furniture are old and must be changed housekeeping provides lip services and face lifting is mandatory to upgrade hotel facilities , Internet staff very responsive especially one lady I forgot her name secure and quite 
60323,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Hotel was probably lovely 10 years ago We paid for a junior suite and got upgraded to a King suite but all the furniture was tatty and badly scratched marked for the money paid even considering the upgrade it wasnt up to scratch excuse the pun Not what you would expect to see in a King suite Also we had a lot of bags and I am 6 months pregnant but there was no porter to help us to from the room the receptionist told us to get the luggage trolley and bring all bags in out and up to 6th floor ourselves Not great customer service The room was clean but little things like a lot of dust under alarm clock and mould dirt under shower door just weren t what you expect in a decent 4 star hotel , The reception area is nice and the Pan Asia restaurant is quite nice too 
60324,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Location of room next to pool so anyone poolside could see into room Zero wifi connection for work and Ground Floor is really the basement , Overall apperance of the hotel and the proffesional staff 
60325,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Its not a biggie but it took quite a while to order a glass of wine to our room as the restaurant and bar were busy We also had to ask twice for an extra pillow however the staff were extremely friendly, It s always tricky finding somewhere to stay in London which has easy transport links but also ticks all the other boxes The hotel was just a 5 taxi ride away from Willesden Green tube station there were plenty of shops around and really good bus links to nearby Brent Cross shopping centre We really enjoyed how easy it was to get around The hotel itself was lovely and we opted for the breakfast which was yummy Our room was also really quiet from outside noise which was a plus
60326,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The location Although the shower failed the drain the first day we were there the staff was alerted was quick to resolve the problem , The room was spacious and comfortable 
60327,Clayton Crown Hotel London, while taking shower the water pressure dropped to zero suddenly I had to phone to the reception to announce the problem and wait about 10 minutes to be able to finish my shower This happened often enough to become an annoying problem Hope it was a temporarily issue , very very clean everything as described very friendly stuff very good breakfast 
60328,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Beggars outside constantly harassing me for money as I entered and exited No lockers in the gym or pool forcing me to carry belongings everywhere The staff unable to communicate between themselves when I ve made arrangements with the hotel And finally the duty manager waking me up out o bed and forcing to checkout when I ve clearly extended my stay on their systems ,No Positive
60329,Clayton Crown Hotel London, location is far away from London Center No refrigerator available in room toilet facilities are rudimentary one duty manager is not receptive to our needs No Arabic Channels and Bar music is loud consequently difficult to sleep in some night windows at room unsafe it open downward easy to trap children , Security is good subway and buses very closed to Hotel receptionists are helpful especially one lady I forgot her name very helpful

60331,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, The size of the room was great The location was good as it was a 10 min walk to the underground The restaurant was the best tasting food I have had 
60332,Clayton Crown Hotel London, i was booked in for 2 nights I had no telephone signal and so I was promised that on the second night I would be moved to a room with a signal Whilst I did change rooms there was also no signal in it I think that they should be clear that they are letting rooms which do not have suitable coverage it is unacceptable ,No Positive
60333,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Got charged twice for my stay still yet to receive a refund Got upgraded to a double and single room despite paying for a deluxe double room twice why on earth they think you would want an empty single bed in your room with you is beyond me eventually moved to what we paid for , Easy to get about from this hotel by public transport
60334,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Nothing it was perfect , Abus stop was right outside which took you into the city and being disabled it was easier then the train the pool was a great extra and relaxing to start a busy day sightseeing We were able to all stay in same room myself my sister and my mother which allowed us to chat and have fun most hotels only have two adults stay in same room excellant hotel all round 
60335,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Requested early check in and this did not happen The reception staff were not pleasant and I witnessed a customer being treated very badly on Saturday night when he raised a query The windows in my room would not lock shut and the Wifi in the room was terrible The quality of the breakfast has gone down hill very much in the past 12 months and should be a lot better , Car park facilities
60336,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Slow service at breakfast Staff took far too long to clear away used plates bowls One or two breakfast staff were excellent some never smiled or even made eye contact Could not open the window no handle , Quiet comfortable room Very good selection for breakfast apart from gluten free for my friend this was very poor despite us telling the hotel well in advance 
60337,Clayton Crown Hotel London, two of the staff i encountered were very rude and not nice at all the one 1 is the deputy manager on duty that day ZOITAN and a young lady called LYNDAL ZOITAN who is suppose to be very helpful as a deputy manager was the worst , the location is great with a lot of fast food around and shopping mall
60338,Clayton Crown Hotel London, No outlets available except at desk Hair dryer hard wired to the desk not able to utilize effectively Food was not quality especially room service Too noisy constantly being woken by noise,No Positive
60339,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Traffic makes this hotel feel further from downtown than the distance on the map would suggest It took 45 minutes to get to the Tower of London, Very accommodating The Hotel looks immaculate and has a real upscale charm to it 
60340,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The plumbing fixtures are old and limescaled They should be replaced , The location was great Vibrant neighborhood with bakeries restaurants and cornershops Best yet is the bus stop that is literally 10 seconds away buses take you straight to Oxford Circus via Kilburn High Street and Kilburn Underground and Brondesbury Overground stations are just 7 minutes away 
60341,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The water was turned off in the morning for maintenance works We were told upon check in however would have been nice to be informed ahead of arrival ,No Positive
60342,Clayton Crown Hotel London, There was never any spaces in the car park We were attending a wedding in the hotel the tables had named places but staff would not make sure that people were sitting in the right place We had nowhere to sit due to incompetence and ended up leaving to have our meal elsewhere there were six of us in the party one of us being the father of the bride We did not return to the wedding reception as the whole thing was farcical , Breakfast
60343,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Water issue is the main problem if you can sort that both running water and hot water My little one got a flue because of cold water and sometimes it would not be coming out of the tape We had to call for us to have water , Everything was good Enjoyed it 
60344,Clayton Crown Hotel London, price is expensive in considering that the breakfast is not included Also wi fi is the worst I have ever had , location is very good different arabic stores in front of bus stop to any where
60345,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Hotel is next to a pub Can get very noisy and the smell of alcohol next morning is evident when walking to breakfast room Water pressure from taps was variable Had to wait around 10 minutes for water pressure to rise Sometimes pressure dropped during a shower If you are not a fan of a traditional breakfast then continental options and quality is limited ,No Positive
60346,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Unable to get a 2nd key for our room Reception lady most unhelpful Water in sink in bathroom took 10 minutes to drain I have stayed in this hotel regularly and it has gone downhill in my opinion,No Positive
60347,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Unresponsive ness of staff especially front desk staff On some occasions calls to the reception are not picked The front desk staff apart from one lady that is a manager are unmoved and certainly unwilling to assist For eg I almost missed my flight because I was at the reception begging them to detail a staff to help me with my luggage as I was checking out They just mopped at me helplessly I was forced to take a trolley to my room and started carrying my luggage contrary to my doctors advise I have been in pains since then , The hotel is always kept neat 
60348,Clayton Crown Hotel London, the bad experience was booking com and having to pay extra 1 for parking each night not stated when booking , quietest pool I ve ever known nobody but us 
60349,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Room we where in over looked a wall which was approx only 9ft away and lighting was poor especially when putting make up on would consider extra light above tall mirror Sockets unusable due to being so low to chunking skirting board appliances with a fixed plug won t plug in Wifi in room hit and miss Toilet seat light loose Overall wouldn t stay again too many small things that need improvement housekeeping teabags sugar not refreshed cleanliness ok but bathroom grout etc could do with better attention Carpark not for large cars tight corners with blind entrance with light system didn t appear to work but felt secure to leave car once parked Room we stayed in needs some TLC to bring to 4 star level but was great size for London However not patch on Novotel we stayed last year , It s blended old pub hotel with new buildings well although can feel like rabbit warren Reception staff are a credit but felt other hotels offered better for similar money 
60350,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Pool needs a clean not the most salubrious location but interesting safe and we ll catered for , Good swimming pool and small gym Over a mile to Metro but bus to Central London outside hotel Eateries very close 
60351,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The fact that they charged my card first thing on the day of my arrival when booking com say they will charge you 9pm for a no show yet they hit my card on Sunday morning even though I wanted to pay with a different card and locked up mu other card the receptionist said it was policy to charge all cards in the am which is unacceptable as some people may want to pay cash not what the morans bewleys would have done , Location I have stayed there 3 times now
60352,Clayton Crown Hotel London, We had wheelchair bathroom which was disappointing as rainfall shower and bath tubs advertised and hotel not fully booked , Location excellent very clean and comfortable 
60353,Clayton Crown Hotel London,No Negative, Would recommend the hotel Besides convenience of location the room and service the biggest assets of this property are the staff Excellent customer service with a smile I will recommend the hotel to all leisure or business family or group Enjoy your stay When back in London I will stay here again

60355,Clayton Crown Hotel London, Swimming pool had a few plasters and grit Still OK but could do with a bit of clean , Good quality hotel with fun Irish type pub attached Friendly helpful staff Good breakfast with plenty of choice Handy for Cricklewood Station for trains to central London Car park underneath hotel 
60356,Clayton Crown Hotel London, The pub food was fairly average hotel room furniture and hall furniture and walls could do with an update room curtains wash slight scruffiness just brings down the tone on otherwise good hotel , Comfy bed quiet room v nice staff clean rooms pool is nice for the kids but it s not only for hotel guests so check for the local swim school lessons times Good tube and bus connections from to Kilburn underground station and hotel
