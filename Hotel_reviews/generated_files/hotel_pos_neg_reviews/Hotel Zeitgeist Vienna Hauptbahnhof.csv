453798,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof,No Negative, Just around the corner from the Hauptbanhof great if you are travelling by train The room was designed excellently Toilet shower and wash basin all separate so you really could use them all at the same time 
453799,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, For privacy reason it would have been better if the bathroom has a enclosed room instead of just having a shielded door , Reasonably close to the Hauptbahnhof 
453800,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, There weren t very many restaurants near by that we could find , It was very very close to the train station we were able to easily walk there with our bags 
453801,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, There was no tea and coffee in the room There was no fridge in the room although we discovered later we could have paid for one This caused a problem as we had medication which should be kept in a fridge and the reception would not take it to put in their fridge , The property was close to the railway station and metro which gave direct access to the centre of Vienna and the outskirts It was clean and comfortable and the breakfast had a wide choice of both hot and cold foods 
453802,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof,No Negative, Very modern and quiet We choose our hotel for its proximity to the Main Train Station It is a little away from the main city centre but lots of transport and about a 20 min walk Travel tip make sure you get a public transport pass as the ticket box on the trams only take coin and we didnt have any The Yellow bus is amazing and has 5 different routes I wouldnt recommend paying the extra for a Vienna Pass as you will never be able to spend the time exploring each stop Just choose and pay for the stops you want to do 2 of the routes took 2 hours without us getting off at any stops due to limited time Wonderful overview of Vienna if you only have a couple of day Look out for the dedicated cycle paths everywhere throughout the City as they cycle with speed Love the way everyone gets out into the Parks with the warm start to summer 
453803,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, The area around the hotel seemed very business y mostly hotels and there is the main train station Nevertheless it was a convenient location for us since we wanted to be close to the train station, We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the train station it s a brisk 5 minute walk which allowed us to drop off our luggages and walk around freely The neighborhood itself is okay but there is a supermarket nearby although it closes really early and you can find places to shop within the train station Belvedere palace is within walking distance and you can take the U bahn easily from the train station to get to other parts of Vienna We really needed water one night but nothing was open but they had vending machines on every floor so crisis averted Breakfast was not included for us so we paid 15 euros each for two days of breakfast and it was well worth it Great selection of ham cheeses bread pastries and salads Overall very pleasant stay and the wifi was fast 
453804,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, All very good at the Hotel Not many places to eat locally so have to go into centre for restaurants , Lovely breakfast Close to the train station Short metro ride into centre of Vienna 
453805,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Pillow was too soft , I liked the bar very friendly staff the barman was funny D and also the receptionists they were all very helpful I would definitely stay there again next time 
453806,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, The service in Hotel s Pergola caffe could be and should be a bit better waiters were really really slow , It was quick business trip I went with my boss no shopping so the location of the hotel was good for our business needs meetings The pillow was fluffy just the kind I prefer I slept well most probably we will come again when we need to stay in this area of Vienna 
453807,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof,No Negative, Hauptbahnhof is unlike to other capitals not the city center and the hotel is a 10mins walk from the underground you ll need approx 20mins to get from the hotel to Stephansplatz but located in a quite quiet area and a walk after dinner has never done any harm Very friendly staff nice bar restaurant 
453808,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof,No Negative, Hotel Zeitgeist is a new Hotel with practical and clean rooms Very friendly staff and a good bar restaurant in the ground floor And breakfast is excellent Location is very close to the main train station thus about 30 min walk from Vienna center From main station to airport goes a train all 30 minutes very convenient arrival and departure 
453809,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, The wifi reception was really poor room 612 , Very cosy and clean hotel with nice lobby with bar Very good breakfast surely worth its price Special thanks to the staff I was once late for breakfast I also did checkout too late but they never complained and were polite and kind 
453810,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, We stayed in a triple room and they only gave us two pairs of slippers but they gave another pair when we told them about it Seemed like they just forgot This was a very very very minor problem tho , Very spacious room The staffs were really kind and very helpful The speed of Wi Fi was awesome Also the location was excellent too Very close to Wien Hauptbahnhof Vienna Central Station and a supermarket was next to the hotel The toilet and shower was separated which is very helpful when you re in a rush They even had Nespresso Coffee capsule machine inside the room Of course they also offered two capsules of coffee They also had a small gym on the sixth floor The gym is for free as long as you have the room key 
453811,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof,No Negative, Great location Front desk staff were most helpful Memorable New Years Eve Was able to get out of our hotel at 23h45 got a tube and was at the river before 24h00 Free use of the gym was a great plus Also five minutes walk to Main Station and to Hop on Hop off route 
453812,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, There were no coffee and tea facilities in my room I think because they charge extra for a Nespresso machine If I was staying longer than one night I would have appreciated this The previous night s hotel Hotel Ploberger in Wels had the cool decor gym and sauna that this hotel has but also had a bottle of spring water and an apple in my room on check in AND coffee and tea making facilities For the price the location is excellent but is three stops on the metro to the city centre , This hotel is superb very convenient for the main train station and metro for visits to the city centre The modern decor is flawless and the cafe bar on the ground floor is really cool 
453813,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, A robe would be useful in the rooms so people can use the saune more comfortably, Good location good room excellent breakfast The Pergola bar has a very good atmosphere and good food 
453814,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Nothing really , The room is spacious it s clean and smell good The staff are friendly and accommodating The restaurant within the hotel serve yummy food The common toilette is very clean and smell good Love the modernize style of the hotel All in all we enjoy our stay 
453815,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Very expencive parking Very expencive breakfast Location 2 10 for travelling with a baby Small room No wifi on the 7th floor , It was relatively clean cleaned every day but not thoroughly Croatian girl at the reception was very dear and nice 
453816,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, For pets there wasn t clarity when booking through Bookings com that we re meant to be on a higher rate room given the need to have wooden floors Which meant we had to pay additional room charges in addition to the standard day rate for a pet It didn t seem fair however we had limited time so agreed to this , Location Staff and facilities It did have a home like feeling in a very modern looking hotel
453817,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, All the thing are food, Good location room also good near one large maker Take care there is no free water provide u can buy it in the market but Sunday it not open And there is other market in the trains station it open all week 
453818,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Sauna was cold and staff were poor at giving info about facilities Quite expensive for an average hotel , Great bed and we were able to borrow the bikes for a day 
453819,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, A dog had defecated on the corridor carpet on the floor on which we were staying which my wife slipped in It took management an inordinate length of time to clean up breaching standard health safety requirements No one took responsibility , Not much There is little in the vicinity of the hotel Closeness to Hauptbahnhof allowed access to the city Lobby bar staff were very helpful and accommodating 
453820,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Nothing , Excellent and freindly staff who will always give you all the informations with a smile on their face which is crucial in this profession One of the reception lady staff memeber happily accepted our awkward request of taking the cloths out of the laundary machine and put them into laundary bag for us which was something we never expected wanted hotel staff to do that for us She not only put them into bag but also put them nicely agtet folding them Wish I could say a thank you to that lady upon collection Excellent hospitality which I have not seen any other hotels that I have visited so far Thank you for offering such an excellent services to your customer Keep it up 
453821,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Fair way out of the city centre 50 minute walk City centre is a 10 minute underground journey from the main rail station which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel , Good value clean hotel Staff were helpful 
453822,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Would have liked the cafe open for coffee at breakfast time not everyone wants the full breakfast at 17 euros , So well located within a few minutes walk of the main railway station and u bahn Very helpful staff Nice ambiance and decor 
453823,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Would have liked kettle etc in the room Noisy people in the room above Would also have liked coffee bar open for breakfast not everyone wants the full spread for 17euros , Superb location only three minutes walk from main and u bahn station Staff all friendly and helpful Enjoyed meals in the hotel 
453824,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, I skipped the hotel breakfast since it was so pricey , Loved the bathroom design especially the shower The bed was just how I like it Well located One usually doesn t expect a hotel near the railway station to be so pleasant 
453825,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Wifi was not working sometimes which was quite frustrating , Very friendly staff and excellent breakfast The food and service at the bar and restaurant is good as well Location is convenient just a few minutes walk from the Wien Hbf We also love the fact that they have their own big car underground park 
453826,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Staff is kind However there is a lack of training for them and or the electronic system used is very limited and poor As always I chose to get a rate without breakfast Reception informed if I would change my mind I still could have the breakfast It was just necessary to show up and inform at reception desk from breakfast room and they would make the arrangements As I decided to get breakfast at the hotel I follow the instructions and showed up next morning First surprise even before enter the room I was requested to pay EUR 14 00 At this point I asked them to include the amount into the hotel bill what was not possible So I asked the person to pay with credit card and was not possible either As I did not have cash with me I was allowed to take the breakfast with the promise to return later with the cash and pay It was an embarrassing and inconvenient situation that could be easily avoided if amount could be included in the total bill from the hotel like in any other hotel I stayed or if at least breakfast could be paid by credit card Brought me the impression the staff made me a big favor to be allowed to get breakfast and pay later As a hotel and a service provider they should target to delight customers not embarrassing them , Hotel is new clean and overall facilities for a short stay are at very good level It is located very closed from main train station what brings convenience for the ones coming by train to spend 1 or 2 days in the city 
453827,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof,No Negative, This was a great hotel to stay in Great breakfasts very nice restaurant bar area during the afternoon and evenings and closely situated to the train station Everybody can speak English 
453828,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Nothing , Good location near main train station You can get anywhere quickly Nice clean and quiet hotel with good breakfast selection Personnel is helpful and speaks English Stayed only one night and I have nothing to complain about 
453829,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, The fact that bathroom is opened style is not too nice especially when friends are traveling together Hotel felt like a hostel Lobby has a restaurant it looks weird no space whatsoever , Location great Sauna nice but resting area too small Big garage Very modern interior design Clean 
453830,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof,No Negative, This was an excellent option for us as a family of four We have stayed in many four person rooms in city breaks across Europe and this was one of the best Plenty of space and very comfortable great shower lots of storage Our boys are 9 and 6 and they enjoy playing this hotel has a courtyard in the middle which they could use for games and running around In general the hotel was modern and didn t have any tired looking furniture which you tend to find elsewhere The location of the hotel was good as well for us although a little away from the centre the centre was only a short metro ride away Also next to the hotel you have a supermarket a bank and also one block away a pedestrianized zone with shops cafes etc The main train station is also only 5 minutes walk away for trips out of Vienna Overall for a city break in Europe for a family of four who don t want to spend five star prices on accommodation Hotel Zeitgeist cannot be faulted 
453831,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, Very functional off putting minimalist rooms devoid of the usual pleasantries of a 4 star hotel No hot pot for water on tube of universal shampoo soap no pictures in the room basically an upscale red roof in dorm room like environment Functional yet disappointing though everything works and staff was overwhelmed though friendly , The breakfast was good 
453832,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof,No Negative, The location and great shops at the station Easy to get into the centre of vienna Breakfast buffet very good Really nice room comfortable bed Modern clean Friendly and helpful staff especially Christina at reception 
453833,Hotel Zeitgeist Vienna Hauptbahnhof, 4 stars hotel and premium room with 160 cm king size bed is far to little Sleeping comfort accordingly Upon arrival no soap which seemed to be a problem to solve for the reception staff safe was unable to be used and we had to wait for its reset until next morning The room had probably not been used for some days thus the air condition had been turned down and the temperature was above 30 degrees C Breakfast quite nice but partly with clearly cheap commodities and bread One morning no bacon and just a short not available today from unfriendly kitchen staff All in all the price of the hotel room and the hotel s status as 4 star hotel are not justifiable , Modern and new hotel Breakfast is quite nice Staff quite friendly
