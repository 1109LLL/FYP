17852,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, The breakfast area was too small with not enough seats and tables to accommodate guests On Sunday breakfast was absolute chaos There were no coffee cups the kuerig machines weren t working there were no eggs or sausage or seats or milk or silverware and one poor staff person trying to do it all We wouldn t come back to this hotel because they are not prepared to serve breakfast to their guests ,No Positive
17853,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, bathroom is a nightmare for privilege room their most expensive type of room no door for bathroom bad shower toilet is in a separate room a very very tiny room 2sq feet 0 6sqm with no sink A very unfortunate way to design a hotel room, Staff is helpful and nice Location is very very good close to RER C subway and buses
17854,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, Very poorly staffed for breakfast in tiny cramped restaurant 1 person trying to serve 20 guests 45 min waiting time to get clean spoons no warm milk for coffee no one to clear dirty tables hotel should not be offering breakfast if it cannot provide a proper service , Convenient location 20 min walk from Eiffel Tower next to bus metro and RER stations 
17855,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, it is even not 2 stars and breakfast provided bad and staff are rude and the services are horrible The rooms are dirty there is no wifi coverage in rooms the bathroom is not ideal and the fridge is always hot inside They didn t give the wifi password No WIFI in the ROOMS or Restaurant No Parking Space, The staff working in kitchen was friendly and helpfull but receptions staff was over over over 
17856,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, I would re think the breakfast buffet it was OK but I am sure they can do much better , Helpful staff and quite tolerant had a very crappy problem with the near by car parking they simply had broken payment machines and no one to help out and the hotel staff helped with it Location is very good if you want a point close to most of the famous monuments in Paris

17858,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, Nothing to compain Did not have breakfast at the hotel though as plenty of choices in the area around, Located 100 meters away from metro Javel easy access to Paris center Restaurants shops and coffee houses are very nearby on av grenelle River Siene embankment is 50 meters away for good walks and runs Embankment is excellent jogging route to the louvre area and further to notre damme area and back 
17859,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, The rooms were too small and congested Our room was not cleared of the glasses bottles etc even till the next night The staff who arranged the airport drop was not honest Gave us a small vehicle after promising and charging for a larger vehicle , The location was good

17866,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, I was very disappointed with their flexibility to change a reservation date in which I made an error by one day I booked for day of my flight forgetting I would arrive a day later The total number of days would have been the same They would only change if I paid an additional 150 unbelievable And the day manager seemed to think it was funny not at all sorry I would not stay at a Mercure Hotel again ,No Positive
17867,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, I can t think of a thing Really , We were very happy with the Mercure Eiffle Tower It s excellent location is a very short walk to the Juval Station which easily takes you to Versailles or the sites along the Seine The closest bridge has the Statue of Liberty the next one is the Eiffle Tower We took the Batobus a hop on hop off boat along the Seine It took us to most of the major sites There are several nearby affordable good restaurants and the breakfast they offer in the hotel is excellent Our room was spacious with big windows which keep the noise out The bathroom was exceptional In addition their staff was very accommodating and friendly Yes we will stay there again

17869,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau,No Negative, The staff were more than accommodating They simply could not do enough for us The room was so spacious and even though we had no view of the Eiffel Tower we were looking over The Seine River The room was fabulous and the complimentary drinks in the fridge and the nespresso machine were such nice touches to make our stay even more luxurious 
17870,Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel Pont Mirabeau, We turned air con down because the room was too hot otherwise Cleaning staff turned it back up each day No need to do that Although we hung the towels for re use cleaning staff changed them each day No need to do that either Otherwise nothing to dislike , Room was large much larger than usual for a Paris hotel at this grade Nicely furnished and quiet Good view over the river Good bathroom Did not have breakfast or drinks in hotel so cannot comment on catering services Reception staff very helpful and friendly Well located easy and interesting to walk round Arrdmts 15 and 16 and 7 Plenty to discover in those three other than Eiffel Tower La Cite de L Architecture in Palais de Chaillot truly excellent especially the currently running World War I exhibition Lots of traditional very good bars bistrots and brasseries in all three Arrdmts Zinc and La Gauloise in 15 and Cafe A La Fontaine in 16 excellent The latter produces its own special raspberry liqueur Metro and RER only 50 metres away at Javel station
