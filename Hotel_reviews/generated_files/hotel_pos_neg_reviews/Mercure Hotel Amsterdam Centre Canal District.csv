389005,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Centre Canal District, The breakfast was quite poor and we had issues on checkout where they wanted to charged us for additional breakfast This is a combination of an issue with booking com making a reservation for 9 people when apparently only 4 5 people were entitled to breakfast but also the hotels fault for not informing prior to us having breakfast and taking money from my account with no prior authorization I have also been charged twice for one of the breakfasts but still no refund has been given The staff at reception were not very helpful and refused to try and speed up the process given we were late for our flight A really poor way to end a special family trip for my sisters birthday , The location was good and they had bikes on site which were easy to hire

389104,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Centre Canal District, We had booked and paid for a double room but on arrival were told that there had been a technical problem and so we were given a very small double room for our first night We assume that it was in fact a single room which had been given a small double bed We had to get out of bed to turn off the room light There was no bedside light We were moved to the booked double room on the following day As compensation we were eventually given a complimentary drink each and a free breakfast for one morning , Staff very friendly and helpful
389105,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Centre Canal District, Our room overlooked the car park and was a bit noisy with people coming and going The staff on reception constantly prioritised answering the phone rather than serving the guests in front of them , Traditional old building in a quiet street tastefully modernised Our room had lovely large windows

389107,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Centre Canal District, We might waiting for the room several hours inspite of confirmation to receive our notes about early arrival The window of the room was in the ground floor in a covered parking gate without any direct views of open air Extremly loud corridors with not effective proofing , I have tried to be this hotel with positive attitude but unfortunatelly this hotel is a trap 
389108,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Centre Canal District, Our free mini bar in our room supplied us with chocolate Toblerone and Pringles We came back late and were hungry so we decided to have them as a snack only to find they were gone We can only assume a member of staff from the hotel entered our room when we were out and took the Toblerone and Pringles This really annoyed us on principal and the fact we had only just left a coffee shop and started to really get hunger pangs if you know what I mean We don t expect to have things taken form our room when we are not there Also we were late risers and didn t leave the hotel to around half 11 12 each day The chamber maids said they would come later to empty our bin and give fresh towels This did not happen Maybe they were too busy stealing our Pringles and Toblerone, Location was good We had a privileged room so we recieved a robe and slippers and full access to the mini bar for free The reception staff were friendly and helpful 
389109,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Centre Canal District, However the shower room was abit tight , Group of 4 ladies aged between 25 to 32 came to stay for a 2 night weekend break for a concert at the Heinaken Music Hall Huib at reception was very welcoming and very helpful The room was cleaned daily fresh bed sheets and towels the room was clean with a flat screen tv and the free WiFi connection all around the hotel including the room was great We was also able to arrange a last minute late check out free of charge as we were all hungover from the concert the night before this was a life saver Thank you so much for a lovely stay Tip use the UBER App for cabs they are cheap and are accessible at all times from this hotel 3 mins waiting time on average 
389110,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Centre Canal District, Very expensive and breakfast not included 714 euros for 2 nights Parking expensive at additional 45 euros per day Check in took 45 minutes as staff on the telephone most of the time Room decor very tired even though a privilege room needs complete refurbishment and the room smelled of cigarette smoke ,No Positive

389113,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Centre Canal District, Access to Reception area up stairway without a ramp to move heavy suitcases needs to be remedied Only after one has dragged suitcases up the stairs is help offered A Porter is a must , Located in a quiet neighborhood with entertainment and restaurants nearby 
389114,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Centre Canal District, I didn t like that it wasnt walking distance from the main attraction red light district all main coffee shops etc But still over all a good place to stay, Ideal place for coffee shop at the end of the road also somewhere to eat at the end of the road if you missed breakfast
