256880,88 Studios, Maybe more selection of tea coffee hot chocolate and biscuits xx, It was a very nice apartment and the customer service was even better I loved the free toiletries and the water etc in the fridge
256881,88 Studios, Great for one person bit cramped for 2, Close to bus route and tube Small corner shop nearby Good sound insulation on Windows Tea and coffee sachets provided Best looking premises in the road Very clean 
256882,88 Studios, Far from the tube station 15 20 min walk after a full touristy day in London is too much The road of the hotel is very trafficked, Staff Newly restructurated Nice decoration Good functionality Cleanness
256883,88 Studios, The only thing I would say is that as a group of girls sharing together having a bathroom door you could see right through although it was frosted it didn t give you much privacy But everything else was excellent xx,No Positive
256884,88 Studios, The additional bed was not as comfortable as the double bed The kitchen area did not have enough space to put washed dishes there wasn t a rack provided The entrance of the room had a small staircase which was not desirable From our room we could hear other rooms bathrooms when they flushed which was annoying at late hours , The rooms were made full use of the small space The kitchen area was the perfect size catered all our needs The bathrooms were up to date which made the place look modern and welcoming Quiet location and area was perfect after long days 
256885,88 Studios, Kettle was in a very akward place All kitchen plugs were under the units so to boil the kettle you needed to place kettle between lower shelves which might cause a hazard with those who have young children who like to explore , Liked having the family room with kitchenette even though we didn t have an opportunity to use it Also liked the modern amenities 
256886,88 Studios, They gave me a room in the basement where I hear the water circulation all the time as it was near the main exhaust pipe I checked in by 8 PM On the next day when I requested to change it they said I have to request that in the morning only I lost another day Then it becomes unworthy to change the room and pack unpack as I will check out the next day, The location is great as it is near two metro tubes Rooms are cleaned on daily basis 
256887,88 Studios, Room clean need to be improved The toilet door was too transparent almost can see what people do in there , Service from reception was nice The room is kind of big House is new and modern 
256888,88 Studios, Heard the the neighbors in the room above ours using the toilet The flushing And you could smell the No 2s Sent emails to complain surprise surprise NO RELPY We Stay at the Kensington studios across the road Excellent room there , Excellent staff
256889,88 Studios, My fault for not reading the small print but if you book through booking com they charge one nights accommodation as a pre auth for a security deposit , Great place easy checkin modern and comfy very close to public transport and Kensington High Street nice comfortable bed appreciated the tea and coffee with milk in the mini kitchenette No complaints I will stay again and can highly recommend especially for single female travellers Easy to get into building after hours simple check out 
256890,88 Studios, The bed was quite small and shower could only be turned on while standing under it at least it warmed up fairly quickly , The location was great and staff were very friendly and helpful The kitchen facilities were also useful 
256891,88 Studios, Very expensive near a busy street which bit noisy and the housekeeping ladies make a lot of noises and disturbance when they clean other rooms nearby in the morning between 7 to 12 am which makes it impossible for me to enjoy my morning sleeps, the room is very small comparing to the photos mentioned in booking com bed is comfortable the room is clean but it has a lot of dust despite they clean it every day it has everything you need and the kitchenette is usefull the location is very convenient and safe for visiting london a grocery is just across the street
256892,88 Studios, Location a bit distant from shops and restaurants , Coffee and tea provisions plentiful Enough for 5 or six cups unlike most hotels which provide only two Basic cooking facilities very much appreciated Lovely comfy bed and plentiful toiletries and towels 
256893,88 Studios, There was nothing that could be picked fault with our stay it was perfect thank you , Great location for our everning lovely area smart clean great value for money very acomidating for 5 men on a reunion 
256894,88 Studios,No Negative, Very clean I booked to recover from jet lag for 2 nights before driving further While it was a small room it had everything I needed Holland Park Kyoto Gardens Design museum in walking distance Go a bit further and you have a street full of shopping and cafe s restaurants Was perfect for me and I felt very safe 
256895,88 Studios, Very noisy when people on floor above shower or flush toilet it sounds as if in own room For first 3 days no wifi apparently had a problem Over weekend staff did not replenish coffee milk toiletries etc had to work elsewhere and couldn t handle both locations ,No Positive
256896,88 Studios, The road outside the hotel Holland Road is very busy but fortunately with the double windows closed noise intrusion was minimal Wifi was often slow and sometimes temperamental The room and double bed were small but this is London and the tariff is reasonable , Nearest tube station is Kensington Olympia but this only operates on weekends and some public holidays Fortunately we arrived one weekend and departed on the next so could use it On weekdays we used Shepherd s Bush tube station 10 15 minutes walk away Our room had a kitchenette with frig freezer which allowed us to store food and cook our own meals The staff were very friendly and helpful Value was good for London we would stay here again 
256897,88 Studios, Dark tiny basement level room No sound insulation for sewage it feels like buckets of water are emptied next to your bed Impact noise from doors and steps can wake you up early when you are on a holiday Cleaning the corridors with vacuums started before 9am Cleaning staff after being asked to delay vacuuming till later hours went on to conduct emotional personal affairs probably in Russian on a mobile phone All this could be heard too well in the room where we stayed , Very little street noise Well decorated in a good condition Working aircon and a good bed had 3 nights of decent sleep 
256898,88 Studios, Our room was on the lower ground so we went down in the lift to the room This meant no view at all , Everything was very clean and the reception assisted with ensuring we had transportation booked for our transfer to the train station for our onward train the next morning 
256899,88 Studios, The room keepers didn t clean up our rooms proper enough and the size of the room is too small no breakfast was a shame , The design of the room is very modern which we loved and it is super clean with a little kitchenette and some cutleries 
256900,88 Studios, Waited half an hour upon arrival with noone to speak to as desk clerk was out for lunch Booking stated no charge except pre auth of 50 Pounds prior to arrival Full amount for the night was charged to the card prior to arrival desk clerk then tried to say this was the deposit and that he still had to charge me for the room we disagreed then after arguing infront of another delayed guest he agreed to complete the transaction for the night and hold only a 50 pound bond when i suggested the booking info be updated he said it was right clearly not The website and all booking com correspondence has said the funds will be released within 7 working days we are now onto the 14th working day since leaving and several emails to the hotel No response and the amount is still pending on my card Not trying to nitpick but very clearly misled on a number of fronts a real shame considering the room was very nice climate controlled and the bed extremely comfortable ,No Positive
256901,88 Studios, Storage in the bathroom missing and Wi Fi was very poor with no phone signal due to being underground , A decent room but a little on the small side for the price which was too expensive for what you get It is well kitted out but for some strange reason there is nowhere to put your toiletries in the bathroom We were also in the lower rooms which were underneath the outside path slightly noisier but not too bad would much prefer a higher room in the main house Very comfortable beds and the room looks very modern the shower is superb 
256902,88 Studios, Wifi not working and small bed, Nice room bed was a bit small as I m quite tall and lanky and my legs really stuck out the end of the bed nice kitchenette in the room which is a great idea Wifi was down when we arrived and we were told it wasn t likely to be working at all during our stay other than that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
256903,88 Studios,No Negative, The air condition the internet and the room phone were not working during my stay I have done a formal complaint to the email provided by the hotel and i am requesting a full refund of my whole stay
256904,88 Studios, The main downfall was that the floors were too slippy which resulted in a few falls and the slippers that were provided were not non slip either but we managed to get around it by having to walk cautiously and in small steps On first glance the room looked immaculate and tidy however we found the bedside drawers had not been cleaned dusted and the curtains had not been washed changed as they had yellow stains on them let s just say someone had a really good time with their partner The bathroom was very nice inside the only things I would say is I would have liked a floor mat as the sink was too small to wash your face in without spilling water so we had to use one of our towels as a mat The room should have had an air freshener spray as we had ordered a take away and the smell lingered for the full day as it was a hot day and there wasn t a breeze with the window open We noticed the receptionists would almost hide behind the desk and just look up to see who was entering the building and were not very helpful when it came to asking for basic items such as a pencil sharpener for a start but they were nice when they would speak to you , The property was very modern and had everything you could expect ironing board iron kitchen equipment toiletries towels WiFi and a great TV which let you watch YouTube BBC iPlayer and satellite programmes Although the room was quite small for 3 guests and our suitcases it was very comfortable and we had a lovely view 
256905,88 Studios, The floors in the room were very slippy It s a high shine finish and at times this was a little dangerous , 88 Studios was so convenient for us close to the tube and easily accessible The facilities were clean and spacious The beds were comfortable and appliances modern The shower was brilliant and we couldn t fault the service at all There was also a luggage room for us to store our baggage the following day 
256906,88 Studios, The room was small may be in meters even ok but the way everything placed makes it very uncomfortable to move around Shower door didn t closed till the end Water in the sink did not pass and was stuck there for around half an hour after every use and was full in 2 minutes so easier was not to use Equipment in the kitchen very poor For example only one small spoon even we were 2 people staying Terrible audibility You can hear your neighbours not only coming home at night but also going to toilet or washing in the shower The most unpleasant was when one of the personal guy came and nock to our door in the morning even we had a sign do not disturb after we said we are sleeping he still demanded to open the door because he wants to talk and all this were because he wanted to say that we were too loud in the night Well we heard all our neighbours every night and mornings too Other staff however was nice and polite I would stay again in the same area but I would never come back to the same hotel , The hotel is in super location it was clean and bed was comfortable but this was all good about this place 
256907,88 Studios, My only complaint is that we dealt with a receptionist who was on her first day and couldn t understand that we d arrived early had left our luggage in the luggage room and needed to access it to get to our room She was left alone on the reception which for her first day I didn t think was too professional Apart from that minor experience everything else was great , 88 Studios was lovely Great location in Kensington with friendly staff comfy beds and an excellent shower Would definitely stay here again 
256908,88 Studios, There is no getting past the apartment being tiny I had to sit on the end of the bed and pull down a shelf to get any sort of desk to work on The bed was also tiny I am only 5 4 but my feet hung over the end I felt it was very expensive for what was akin to student accommodation The wifi was awful not good enough to hold a WebEx or Skype call on as the connection kept dropping out , the staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful
256909,88 Studios, there was a constant noise of water flowing through pipes which kept us awake, The service at reception was very good and the overall cleanliness of the facilities was excellent
256910,88 Studios, Only issue was a smell from drain which was reported, Tea coffee biscuits and plenty bathroom products provided very clean staff very approachable and helpful
256911,88 Studios, Cleanliness My bedsheets and pillows had makeup stains and the cleaners left it like that and said they only changed Beddings every 3 days was really upset when I got back to the hotel at night to discover this They didn t even make the bed they just covered it with the duvet Called the lobby no one answered went down to the reception no one was there had to wait 25mins before she came back me said she is the only one running 2 hotels at the same time because they had another hotel across the road Also rooms are too small like a bed and breakfast , Bad bad bad
256912,88 Studios, dust on floor and side tables especially around plug act alarm of clean filter sheets don t get changed for days no water replenishment unless you ask front desk, most staff friendly and helpful conveniently located comfortable bed cost efficient clean shower with good water pressure
256913,88 Studios, If we would have known there was no wifi at all in the hotel we NEVER would have booked it in the first place When we checked in we were told We re having a little bit of trouble with the wifi It may be slow But when we later complained that we had zero wifi we were told by the staff that they were frustrated with it too because they had to go across the street just to transmit business information This demonstrates a much greater awareness of the problem than just it may be slow This may seem like a nit picky problem but with work responsibilities communicating with the family back home and most of all planning our stay in London needing to walk several blocks to Wetherspoon s every time we needed the internet was extremely frustrating ,No Positive
256914,88 Studios, The room was small as the Booking com Genius they did not allow me to extend even one hour check out time I can t see the benefits of being a Genius Besides after I told the reception that the hair dryer in my room didn t work their first reaction was I was the one who broke it GOOD ATTITUDE to guests but it was quite okay that they finally found a proper one quite average experience just worth its discounted price , I chose to live there because of a 9 am appointment the next morning the location is okay near to Kensington train station 
256915,88 Studios, The room is somewhat cramped but this is London and you cannot expect a large room for this price Holland Road is very busy but fortunately we were on the second floor and with the double windows closed traffic noise was not excessive in the room Kensington Olympia station is near but only offers limited services District Line Underground only operates weekends and some public holidays Otherwise it s a good 10 minutes walk to Shepherd s Bush station , Good value for London The kitchenette in the room was excellent The staff were very helpful and friendly A small convenience store is very close and a large supermarket is 10 15 minutes walk away Location is good if you don t mind walking 
256916,88 Studios, Our room was in the basement and smelt of damp It was also very small and under the main reception and could hear constant walking around and drawers opening and shutting which went on through the night as there was a night porter The floors were all wood and so making the rooms noisy and not very cosy , The location was good as we were going to Opera Holland Park which is about a 10 15 minutes walk away The kitchenette was adequate for our needs 
256917,88 Studios, Our room was located on the front of the property which meant that you could hear all the traffic however as we were tired from walking all day we managed to sleep easily regardless The bed could have been slightly more comfortable , The room was perfectly sized for 2 people It was easy to find and very accessible It was very clean and cosy 
256918,88 Studios,No Negative, the overall design of the rooms each bedroom separated by a set of stairs All the built ins the kitchenette was hidden in a closet Comfy beds quite spacious rooms for the price 
256919,88 Studios, Only 1 chair Very strange as one of us had to sit on bed to eat Why not a second folding chair Heat wave at time and aircon kept on reverting to 27 degrees Not sure why Had to ask for another fork Maybe check how many people due to come Minor irritations only though far outweighed by good points , Very clean compact studio with good facilities Excellent shower and reasonable cooking facilities Iron and hairdryer provided Good TV Comfortable bed Local transport good and excellently situated for Olympia and Queen s Good local food shops and a pub a few steps away Kensington High Street 5 minutes walk and Westfield shopping centre close by Staff friendly and helpful Tea coffee and some biscuits provided was a nice touch Left luggage facility very helpful Plenty of good quality towels Nice toiletries Would definitely stay again 
256920,88 Studios, The dinning table was little bit small It was noisy because of the street , Very kind staff very clean apartment not so specious but compared to the other places in London it was very good The bathroom also was very good There is free coffee tea water Everything looks new and very well maintained Close to the grocery store The nearest tube station is 8 10 min walking 
256921,88 Studios, the bathroom floor is slippery my toddler was fell down one time need to be carefull other than that all fantastic experience , The facilities is great the small kitchen is very good to cook light meals especially if you travelling with children 
256922,88 Studios, The number 4 flat was in the lower ground floor with traffic noise and quite claustrophobic All throughout the night there were rushing water noises from WC pipes in the corner of the small room quite unpleasant , Situation convenient for my London event It had toiletries and tea and coffee 
256923,88 Studios, Staff was aloof not mean but not friendly either They seem to hide behind the counter , Clean well designed big windows that you could open for fresh air and to hear the birds although they were covering them with another layer of bothersome extra window contraptions that took away the nice little windowsill shelf and ability to access the fresh air when we were there Mini kitchen was appreciated 
256924,88 Studios, It was not close to much all attractions were a good 30 45 min by tube Food in area was sparse The street traffic was very loud in our room Dislike the glass wall door to the bathroom didn t give much privacy , I thought the room was well laid out and very clean Plenty of hot water AC Beds were very comfortable and the shower head was amazing 
256925,88 Studios, broadband speed was very poor according to the speed test I made download was 200 kb ps I mean this hotel is in the middle of London not in the North Pole or something I would expect 25x faster broadband than that I mentioned this problem to the staff and they said they were trying to solve the problem with their service provider Beside that room was too small I stayed different better hotels in London for a cheaper price and bigger room space ohh plus very fast broadband speed , Location was important for me to go the French Visa application so that hotel s location was close to the place that I need to be
256926,88 Studios, Rooms are NOT soundproof so you literally hear neighbours walking on your head and flushing their toilets , Very nicely designed little hotel in the area of Holland park Clean spacious rooms with big windows 
256927,88 Studios, The staff and in particular the cleaners do not speak a word of English They have no regard for the guests and make excessive noise through out the day The bed was extremely uncomfortable and the matress needs to be changed to something sturdier It felt like we were sleeping on old matress The biscuits provided for your tea and coffee were broken The greatest shock was when I came face to face on three different occasions within a space of 10 minutes with various peeping Toms The room was below ground so for natural light and fresh air we had to open the blinds and window The room was aslo extrememly small so condensation from the bathroom engulfs the whole room Opening the window meant that anyone who wished to could see into the room And so they did Not the general public as I would have thought but the hotel s own staff I was getting dressed and they came down a few times to the window I was very angry about that The reception which is street level has a privacy glass but the bedroom which can be seen from outside doesn t How does that make any sense We complained and from what I understood of her poor English the manager would speak to us but obviously that never happened First and last time for us I can assure you I will never stay at this hotel again , The location of this hotel was a plus 2 minutes walk to Kensignton Olympia Station and 10 minutes to Shepherds Bush The room was clean looking 
256928,88 Studios, See above, The rooms are excellent Be warned one of the room lets in far too much noise due to the windows My company booked 3 rooms there was a noticeable and rather irritating issue the noise as its on a busy main road Bar that the rooms are excellent and I had no other gripes Would definitely stay here again though I would avoid the room I stayed in originally 
256929,88 Studios,No Negative, Well I was not sure how to rate this place as there is one big issue they also have rooms in the basement with fake windows that look out on the hall for the same price as the rooms on the standard floors This is a real disgrace to offer basement rooms for over a hundred pounds For such room I wouldn t rate them more than 6 7 But after my complain they moved me to the room on the second floor so I must rate them based on what I had and the room was very nice everything new modern style clean and with nice small kitchenette Also the area around this hotel is pretty nice and in walking distance from metro station and beautiful Holland Park 
256930,88 Studios, Size of family room on booking com showed 30 sq meter but this was very small This studio felt like we are staying in garage or prison converted into modern studio Bathroom was very small , Everything except studio
256931,88 Studios,No Negative, It s amazing what they can fit into a small space Everything you need was updated and clean However if you like to be able to walk around the bed this may not be for you as it is very small 
256932,88 Studios, Photos gave the impression it was bigger Not much room around bed kept hitting toe Only three coat hangers No space to store suitcases so put in single wardrobe which did not leave much space, Location was really good Room was spotless Easy to find Friendly staff Compact functional kitchen
256933,88 Studios, Extremely small Bathroom and bedroom they were all very small Mine was with a queen and a single bed Kids and husband all knocked their legs against d sharp corners of d queen size bed at some point during their stay Not much space to walk around or place d luggages , Located near Holland Park and Kensington palace Has kitchen facilities like microwave stove fridge and sink all inside a cupboard 
256934,88 Studios, I left my facial cleansing brush in the hotel room but sadly they said the cleaners didn t return it to them which made me feel like their staffs there aren t very honest the soundproofing of their rooms were poor too wifi was extremely slow but on the bright side is the price is decent ,No Positive
256935,88 Studios, The room wasnt as it looked like the picture shown If you book only one night your room probably will be alllocated to the basement which woundnt certainly favorable for your holiday ,No Positive
256936,88 Studios, The rooms are quiet small and stuffy and not cleaned well We were given a room in the basement which we asked to change as my partner suffers from clastrophobia and hotel was full understandable Yet the next day hotel didn t follow up and always where busy at the desk to change our room We eventually got accustomed to it and opened the windows for air but it made the stay less comfortable, The location very quiet and safe area Bus passes frequently and westfield shopping centre is just a stone s throw away Again area feels very safe and walking in the evening is ok 
256937,88 Studios, The initial pre authorisation security deposit is quite steep almost 2 3 the total cost of the room and you still have to pay the full cost after On the plus side you do get the deposit back after 7 days , The room was very nice comfortable bed the kitchenette was nice and could be hidden away behind doors The shower was good heats up straight away 
256938,88 Studios, Room a bit small for 3 people Some staff didn t speak any English No washing machine on site , Overall a great stay Rooms very cosy Westfield shopping centre one station away Kensington High Street very close Would stay again 
256939,88 Studios, There isn t really a wardrobe because of the kitchenette so storage is limited, I loved the smart TV in the room and the free water coffee tea milk and biscuits they left us every morning
256940,88 Studios, Nothing worth worrying about really except that the room was slightly on the small side for twin beds , The apartments was clean and modern As a woman staying there alone for the night I felt very safe and comfortable I knew that a member of staff was always on the premises 
256941,88 Studios, Please note that Kensington Olympia is connected to the Tube via a overground rail system which is much less frequent than the tube This is not their fault but keep it in mind when booking if you need to use the metro a lot it can be slightly inconvenient , Excellent small hotel It is very clean and the staff is friendly 
256942,88 Studios, The missing tea towel for drying up but it s really not an issue , It s a wonderful place to stay right near Olympia with great pubs and shops and a park only a street away the room was great the inclusion of sink microwave cooking hob and fridge with toaster kettle everything you could need a tea towel for drying up was the only thing missing but they even provide a safe and slippers so I can t complain at all try the shower too a rain forest shower is wonderful Well recommend
256943,88 Studios, Bathroom doors were glass and anyone in the room could see you on the toilet which wasn t pleasant for my partner There was a lot of noise from above us mainly in the mornings which wasn t ideal , Comfortable room with everything you need in it Location was ideal with plenty of things nearby 
256944,88 Studios,No Negative, The room was clean and spacious the boutique hotel is renovated and I enjoyed the design of my room It also had everything I needed during my stay hairdryer iron a safe box There was also a kitchenette in the room which was very useful for me 
256945,88 Studios, I got the room in the basement floor minus 1 which was very very very small for single occupancy rather than double the window was facing another room and the room was not very clean there was hair on the floor in the bathroom the curtains were very dirty etc The bed was very soft , Facilities in the room little kitchenette hairdryer ironing board
256946,88 Studios, They should have cheaper prices for the lower floor rooms you can t pay the same price with the other rooms The room was not at all sound proof You could hear each time someone flushes the toilet And could hear footsteps and noise from the corridor Overall what I like to have is customer service and people friendly and smiling and eager to assist you Instead I had icy cold behavior so I wouldn t book there in the future , I stayed in London for one night I was disappointed from the hotel and I think it is highly rated by customers at booking com I was given a room in lower ground floor basement I asked to have a room on the floors but the receptionist said that there wasn t another room he was very indifferent and didn t care at all male I have paid 132 British pounds 160 euros for a basement room with bars on the window which smelled humidity It was also very small I had the double studio and was by myself still very very small The bathroom was nice probably the nicest part of the room though a bit small They provided shampoos conditioners and soap very generous with that The kitchenette looked old the furniture and the pan need replacement They had complimentary bottles of water tea and cookies though although I didn t use any Bed mattress felt old no space to move around They did have slippers though ironing board and hair dryer My power plug adapters which I ve used in another part of England where I was before didn t make contact in their plugs fortunately my laptop was purchased from amazon and had uk power plug so I charged my phone and ipad through my laptop 
256947,88 Studios, I was on the first floor I think there was a second and third floor I could hear the people from upstairs walking around And everytime they used the water for sink shower toilet it was so loud when the water was draining off , Really modern studio really close to the station Had everything I needed 
256948,88 Studios, We had no wine glasses and there was no ice available at the property which made drinking a cool Ros not possible There should be a fold up kitchen nook table with bench that will allow you to sit comfortably and eat drink , Very clean neat and modern Loved the shower as it was spacious and with a big showerhead Comfortable bed with pillows Family of 3 stayed comfortably 
256949,88 Studios, I did not like the location of the room which was lower ground with a series of steps I had travelled for 4 hours and was tired so did not question if there was a different room , The location was ideal for the conference at Olympia The room was clean and the staff friendly The bed was comfy and good range of toiletries supplied 
256950,88 Studios, The room is far too small It is like sleeping in a cupboard I cannot stress this enough There is not enough space to move around the bed We are both small people This is definitely not a studio More like a tiny 1 star hotel room The water was not hot enough in the shower and you could not turn it up One morning there was barely any water coming out of the shower It seems if everyone showers at the same time this happens The price is far too high for that size room It should not be sold or advertised as a studio I have stayed in much larger hotel rooms even when it clearly states small hotel room on the advert , The Location Close to everything The Mini Kitchen The reception staff Storage for luggage 
256951,88 Studios, We had the ground floor room and unfortunately it turned out to be really noisy Each time other guests in the room above us turned on their shower or flushed their toilet we heard everything too well , Clean comfortable room equipped with everything one needs 
256952,88 Studios, the beds are rubbish the mattress has no substance we would not stay again due to the uncomfortable beds , we were working at the Olympia the location is great just a ten minute walk The pub up the road does nice reasonably priced food Rooms are small and basic but clean and perfectly fine for a night or two 
256953,88 Studios,No Negative, The room is just fantastic new and clean They got everything in the room even the slippers Our room is at the basement but it s not dark and stuffy as we thought it would be The room is airy and bright very comfortable There s a lift very considerate for travelers Great location safe and nice neighborhood 
256954,88 Studios, The day time concierge was not friendly and made us feel like we were inconveniencing her when we asked to do something She also did not seem knowledgeable about the area , The hotel was located in a nice neighbourhood We got the hotel at a good rate The shower functioned well and did not smell bad like most showers in Europe 
256955,88 Studios, The sound insulation was poor We could hear people talking and walking The cleanness was bad The floor was not cleaned , The staff are friendly The design of the room is really good It s quite convenient since there s a big shopping mall close to the hotel 
256956,88 Studios, Studio was advertised for 3 people luckily it was only 2 of us staying otherwise it would have been quite cramped , It s in a great location The receptionist was very welcoming and gave great customer service The studio was comfy and clean 
256957,88 Studios, The room looked a lot bigger online than in the photos not much space for baggage , Really clean and comfortable room really close to Shepard s bush tube station I was happy with the room for what I paid 30 discount 
256958,88 Studios,No Negative, Excellent location Very close to subway and buses Staff were all great and helpful Lots of pubs and restaurants around it Will definitely be back 
256959,88 Studios, The staff were extremely rude and unprofessional We were accused of smoking in the room when we didn t and charged 200 without our approval and they scammed us into an earlier check in so that we had to pay for an extra day ,No Positive
256960,88 Studios, The hotel is located on a very busy and not very upmarket road considering that you are in Kensington Room was absolutely tiny for two people you can t move around Terrible soundproofing between rooms you can hear people talking in the corridor cleaning ladies start to clean and create a lot of noise from 8 am at the weekend without any consideration for a guests, Very modern and clean bonus of having kitchenette located close to the shops and Holland park
256961,88 Studios, The safe was too low for old people to get to easily We couldn t get the microwave to work The ladies took the towels away even when there was the environment notice about saving washing Very important to teach staff this there were no face clothes The door notice needs to be elongated so it doesn t catch in door Room rather hot hard to cool Staffs English could be better , It was very well equiped with many different teas knife coffee The bathroom had the best shower ever heated rail for towels The kitchen was hidden behind the doors was everything one could need in a very small space The desk was cleverly concealed under the TV the bed was very comfortable Loved the idea to put notice on door if you didn t want room done Lift was very convenient Room lovely quiet 
256962,88 Studios, No parking nearby unless you consider the hotel s option of NCP 28 00 per day best option is nearby westfield at 8 00 day perhaps the Hotel could pass this on as useful information , good size family room well equipped no hairdryer however
256963,88 Studios, everything was perfect , comfortable nice and clean the staff were very friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable about the area all areas immaculate 
256964,88 Studios, The room was very small Barely enough room to even walk around a small Full bed for relativity , Location being fairly close to a large public train and bus station was nice
256965,88 Studios, It s not close to anything like restaurants or bars It s in more of a residential area Bit of a walk to the tube but it s safe and clean and the staff are friendly and helpful , Friendly staff and clean spacious accommodation 
256966,88 Studios, Only few buses that run pass by the hotel and nearest underground stations are considerably far to walk , Rooms are bigger than average size of hotel in London with wide windows and practical layout Everything s clean and comfort You literally have everything you need Best facilities i e kitchenette amenities electronic outlets working table Friendly and helpful staffs Newly renovated Grocery shop and restaurants at walking distance
256967,88 Studios, The kitchen or pantry should be a bit bigger The table is very small for the triple rooms There should be some curtains between bathroom and bedroom , The bed is comfy
256968,88 Studios, Confusing on how to get there Need to be clear not to go via Kensington Olympia if travelling from the centre Shepherd s Bush and then a walk will work better , Good comfortable sleep Kitchen was a plus 
256969,88 Studios,No Negative, Comfortable beds big bathroom nice shower kitchen with everything you could need and more tea coffee cookies made us feel welcome The soft contemporary tones of the decoration felt cozy 
256970,88 Studios, It states its close to tube station however it wasn t It was quite a long walk Good if going out for the day whilst there but not on arrival with heavy suitcases too far to walk Taxi to from Heathrow expensive around 55 pounds I recommend Airportr a service provider in London it s great and economical Can use both for inbound and outbound from London Check them out , I liked the area of Kensington and it suited my needs to be in that area there is a corner shop 3 min walk away to obtain stocks of food supplies and its great to have a kitchenette to cook to keep costs down A big plus for me being alone and not wishing to be out at night although the area is very safe It is modern compact and clean I am airline staff and travel a lot a fellow work colleague was there the same time as me unbeknown to me She was with her family So the property is popular with airline travellers 
256971,88 Studios, The mattresses are so soft that make my back ache The air conditioner is a little bit confusing for me I have no idea of how to change the mode between heat and cold , The surrounding around hotel is peaceful Good accommodation like an independent flat room with kitchen 
256972,88 Studios,No Negative, We had a lovely one night stay here The room was modern and clean with a mini kitchen station and nice bathroom It s in a good central location and the staff are friendly they let us keep our luggage in their storage room for the remainder of the day after checking out which was very kind of them and helpful to us 
256973,88 Studios, The staff was a bit cold in attitude but it wasn t too intruding or unpleasant The position of the hairdryer is far from the mirror making it awkward to dry your hair after bath , Very comfy bed and nicely designed room We were given the room on the third floor as requested and it gave a good view over the streets below 
256974,88 Studios, A little tight on space note that not all the apartments are the same size We miss a wall rack and some shelves Some of the apartments are facing a main road which is a bit noisy No coffee maker , Friendly staff Clean and pleasant apartment Comfortable beds 24h reception Wifi included Not central London but nice area close to Holland park and public transport bus train bikes Complimentary mineral water cookies and tea every day The managment enforces an anti noise policy we greatly appreciated 
256975,88 Studios, The 2 rooms were way too hot and the heat system was not working When I complained the receptionist was not able to fix it so even with the window open it was too hot to sleep When I complained to the management and asked for a discount or refund he refused Nice rooms but not able sleep in them because of the broken heat ,No Positive
256976,88 Studios,No Negative, Love love loved the bathroom I like the modern design of the room and the ability to get the perfect pressure and temperature of water in the shower Having a small kitchen was also very convenient 
256977,88 Studios,No Negative, Very very clean I booked a double room for one person Enough space for one person or two The wc big enough Everyday towels very fresh Small kitchen for fast breakfast Very close to Olympia excibition center 
256978,88 Studios, The check in staff were disinterested and rude We were charged twice for the room and given a twin room instead of the double that we booked The room smelt of curry and was too warm The beds were uncomfortable Noise from the main road outside was unbearable and we had a really bad night s sleep Would not return , The room was clean and the location was good 
256979,88 Studios, The aircon needed updating so it was making strange noises The floor wasn t clean enough made my feet dirty , Staff were great Location is fantastic near overground 
256980,88 Studios, A little bit far from the Underground really close to the bus though Pretty small but comfortable rooms , Nice and cozy bedroom Clean and functional bathroom 
256981,88 Studios, I was in a basement flat accessed via very steep exterior steps and there was a light flickering loudly outside my bedroom window all night Not great , Location for Olympia was great Design and layout was good bed and sheets were comfy
256982,88 Studios, Please realize that the rooms in the basement will give you the pleasure that you think you sleep under a waterfall whenever your fellow guest above you is using the shower or toilet you will experience extreme noise and It will wake you up for sure several times per night Parking difficult Quiet expensive taking in mind above mentioned issue, Very friendly welcome by Moldavian receptionist Modern facilities Location ok although you need to walk 10 15 min for subway restaurants Close to Olympia
256983,88 Studios, Room contained most basic essentials but I would have liked a proper table to work on and eat at Road noise a constant companion , High quality fittings e g shower tv and good beds 
256984,88 Studios, my room was on lower ground floor so not a great view Heater was way too much was to keep it closed for the two days Temperature control could have been better No concierge or room attendant to help with luggage etc , great bed very clean washrooms additional pair of towels and the towel art nice toiletries and great mini kitchenette Location was good nearest Bus Stop is Russel Gardens and tube station is Shepherds Bush Olympia Exhibition Centre is just three minutes walk opposite the road 
256985,88 Studios, 2 short hairs on my sheets The sheets where clean but still that s not so pleasant The hairdryer is mounted in the wardrobe not such a handy location , Excellent location near to Olympia where I attended a fair Nice staff who helped me printing my boarding pass My room was next to the elevator but I had no noise nuisance Nice comfortable rooms Handy small kitchenette An iron and ironing board 
256986,88 Studios, I asked staff about where to park before my journey over the phone after reading the welcome email details about parking and secondly on arrival to make sure I was OK parked outside the hotel I parked on their recommendation literally outside the main entrance and had a parking fine Not great advice Parking bays are confusing outside the hotel and pay display area is only 2 spaces across the road and down a side street Not what was mentioned by staff When mentioned at check out the staff member shrugged shoulders and said not my problem An apology would have been appreciated I only mentioned it so they could advise guests better in the future Out of date UHT carton milk in the fridge was like cottage cheese when opened Sash window was unlocked on lower ground floor room with easy access from rear courtyard not great for safety of a woman staying on her own Glad I checked the windows before bed before leaving my belongings for the day I travelled with two other ladies one had to move rooms because of filthy bathroom what looked like faeces in her shower and the other had a blouse melted by a faulty iron Again neither had an apology from staff We asked for the managers name so we could complain in writing and were refused this information from the man in reception and were asked to leave Customer service and consideration was zero Extremely disappointed , Location was good for the Olympia exhibition centre Free wifi couldn t comment on the speed as I didn t use it Price would have been acceptable if we hadn t had so many problems 
256987,88 Studios, Nothing that wouldn t cause us not to book again Our room was very warm so we slept with the window open meaning passing cars could be heard more but as previously mentioned by late evening this had died down and for light sleepers who are concerned with this just ask for a rear room , Proximity to Olympia exhibition centre Although we could hear road traffic of an evening it wasn t an issue late night nor could we hear neighbours 
256988,88 Studios, Staff could be a little more explanatory about breakfast room service if it s available But they were happy to give us privacy , The room was reviewed as small by others by I thought it was the perfect size for a weekend break away or a business trip The shower was amazing and the decor was tasteful and modern Beautifully comfy bed and sound proofed room just added bonus Wish we could have stayed longer 
256989,88 Studios, To much noise in the pipes when the people in the room abowe us were flushing the toilett, The staff was excellent so friendly and helpful The room was a bit small but very good and the shower was excellent
256990,88 Studios, The fact that we could hear the water in the waste pipes running down from the apartments above very loud You need some serious insulation works, I liked the fact that there was a walkin shower and a kitchenette 
256991,88 Studios, The female night shift receptionist was not friendly and was not very accommodating We were not given our official receipt and the 50 deposit credit slip was never returned upon our checkout That is why am worrying about weather it will be charged on my credit card The main front door was not shutting properly, The location and how convenient it was to get on the buses
256992,88 Studios, They don t provide soap for hand wash Had to constantly use the body wash provided for showers , Nice modern hotel Not sure about the Star rating though The kitchenette is great idea The bathroom is roomy Location is also good overall very good 
256993,88 Studios, The room was so very small the net curtains were so long that my Husband kept catching his feet in them whilst trying to get into bed through the 6 inch gap There is not enough room for 2 people to move around in these rooms and the bed is very small and the quilt not even a double size Unfortunately as the windows are not double glazed the constant noise of traffic is deafening morning and night , The cleanliness and modern facilities were amazing The studio room was superb and the clever way that everything was fitted in was very good indeed The staff are truly lovely friendly and helpful and the position of the address was amazingly central for both Kensington Olympia and further afield Great restaurants nearby too 
256994,88 Studios, The small bed which had my feet hanging almost a foot over the end I m about 6 5 Apart from that it was comfy , We stayed here on Valentine s Day and the staff had shaped the towels on the bed like a heart which was a nice touch Easy walk to nearby tube stations 
256995,88 Studios, Bottle opener cork screw , Bathroom shower very nice Comfy bed and loved the lighting over the bed with the bedside lights Apparently these apartments have just been refurbished Bijou and compact but exactly what I needed 
256996,88 Studios,No Negative, The location is great A new and very comfortable place The rooms are tiny but very well equiped A great place to stay especially for business trip 
256997,88 Studios, This room is not at all sound proof I could here footsteps from room above very late at night There is also road traffic noise , Very good value for money Very spacious and clean rooms Nice shower as well All newly renovated and a kitchenette was included for an incredible price 
256998,88 Studios, Each time someone flushes the toilet you can hear it quite good But that was the only noise we could hear , We stayed in a beautiful and modern double room The little kitchenette allowed us having breakfast in bed and a chill evening after a tiring but interesting walking day Close to the tube and a busstation right in front of the hotel Friendly employees 
256999,88 Studios, We had a room on the ground floor and we couldn t sleep all night because there was a very big noise from the pipes i think upstairs so we could here all night running water or noise of a boilers or something like this It was really loud and disturbing so we didn t sleep well at all At the check out i mentioned it to the staff as he asked how we liked everything and i explained that unfortunatey we didn t sleep well he said he was sorry ,No Positive
257000,88 Studios,No Negative, We had a 3 night stay here at the 88 Studios and thoroughly enjoyed it a very warm welcome to a very clean and fresh modern studio apartment my mum and I couldn t fault it at all location was great a bus stop pretty much outside takes you to Shepherds Bush Station A really lovely experience will certainly be returning on our next visit to London 
257001,88 Studios, The wifi didn t work very reliably which was a little frustrating I d have appreciated a proper desk area as well although it wasn t a major problem , The room was great lovely bathroom plenty of space and very quiet I never feel I get value for money from hotel breakfasts so a studio with kitchenette was great for me and it was a nice surprise to find the kitchenette stocked with complimentary teabags milk etc The location is ideal for Olympia conference expo centre and was a reasonable walk from Shepherd s Bush station so I d use it again if attending events there in future 
257002,88 Studios, Nothing really , Only 3min walk from Olympia Exhibition Center Supermarket only 2m away Brand new looking interiors with stone cladded bathroom and interior wall Small Studio but luxurious feel 
257003,88 Studios, Although on the top 3rd floor the busy street traffic filtered through in the room Tube stations are at a bit of a distance, Room was very good for a young family The kitchenette in the room was a well thought through extra Cleanliness of the hotel
257004,88 Studios, The noise of the traffic outside was horrendous for someone not used to noisy streets Hardly slept which is why I appreciated the free wi fi and comfy bed However my daughter slept through so for some this isn t a problem , The bed and bedlinen were excellent Loved the kitchenette although only there one night so only used the kettle Shower room very nice and roomy Location great for trade shows at Kensington Olympia 
257005,88 Studios, The price way too much high even for London considering rooms are small I m staying in London hotels almost 250 days per year and I would not pay more than 80 per night for comparable properties , Very nice studios located in Kensington area close to holland Park Everything perfect Including staff kindness and property cleanliness and modernity 
257006,88 Studios, better sound insulation as you can easily hear other rooms TVs large air gaps in door maybe kitchen in a cupboard is a little bit of a cheat , comfy bed smart fresh decor
257007,88 Studios, Lady at the receptionist a little grumpy , The room was very clean and the shower was lovely Nice comfortable bed Location wasn t bad either about a 10 minute walk to the tube station 
257008,88 Studios, Road in front of the hotel gets quite busy sometimes so getting a parking space nearby is hard But if you re lucky nearby there s a metered parking space that you can use , Its interior was kind of minimal which makes it very nice to look at The room isn t super big but spacious enough for our comfort you don t have to squeeze your way through to go to the toilet The room we slept in had a small kitchen in a cupboard which I think is pretty convenient too The staff was really nice and helpful too and made us feel very welcomed Tube station is few minutes away so getting around isn t really that big of a problem for us 
257009,88 Studios, My only problem was that considering my height being 6 3 the small duvets didn t cover me as well as it should and like many hotels in this country they seem to not realise that in winter heat is needed The small radiator in a triple family room didn t do justice We woke up and it was even colder , The cleanliness the bedroom slippers all the mirrors and they gave us extra cookies 
257010,88 Studios, The shower didn t work for part of my trip It couldn t get fixed until I was checking out so couldn t have a shower Wasn t offered anything for the inconvenience , Great clean and comfortable rooms New decor and facilities 
257011,88 Studios, Reception unattended much of the time staff did not speak English did not get any help with taxi or directions poor customer service, Really smart clean apartments very close to Olympia
257012,88 Studios, Small room with a limited light lower ground constant noise of the piping system thin walls weak wi fi signal , Great location gorgeous Holland Road beautiful building well equipped kitchenette very good shower friendly staff international power sockets convenient check in check out policy 14 00 12 00 
257013,88 Studios, , Beautiful area of the town Quiet and modern room in the back High ceilings Good tea Clothes iron not mentioned in the description but could be found in the closet which helped a lot Ordered a package online which was kept at the property for a week before we arrived Thank you 
257014,88 Studios, We had a room on the lower ground floor which seemed have the plumbing pipes from many rooms running behind the walls in our room Which led us to have the noise of flushing toilets and running showers quiet loudly in the room which was a bit like being in a water park or like it was raining I get heavily outside Don t know if other rooms in accommodation are the same but I would avoid lower ground , Clean good size Great shower comfy bed and room not to hot and stuffy near exhibition centre 
257015,88 Studios, Every morning from 7am or so vaccuming trolley movements loud conversations started , Everything was alright but the noisy mornings The rest of it was really wonderful 
257016,88 Studios, Wifi isn t great but it wasn t a huge problem Stayed on the lower ground floor and it was very noisy no soundproofing also was the person above me was very noisy slamming doors walking around with high heeled shoes on but this is just inconsiderate people and no fault of the hotel , First time I have stayed here and very impressed The apartment is just as it looks in the photos Very neat clean and everything that I needed was in my room Big enough for 1 and had a double bed and the shower was amazing Little things such as a decent amount of coffee tea and milk etc makes the difference Room was cleaned and fresh towels left every day Inbetween Shepherd s Bush and Earl s Court Kensington tube Lots of places to eat short walk and felt safe to walk around on my own Will stay here again 
257017,88 Studios, The public transport was a hassle in that the closest station is overground with tricky access to the underground So quick easy access is a bit inconvenient The othe niggle was the inability to control the heating We found the room slightly too warm but could not reduce the heat as it was centrally controlled It wasn t too much of a problem though , Excellent facilities very clean and modern Helpful staff No noise Loved the compact kitchen it has everything you need in minimal space Will definitely stay again 
257018,88 Studios, Found a chicken bone under the bed Complained to reception didn t get an apology So complained via email didn t get a response Shame otherwise nice hotel ,No Positive
257019,88 Studios, The only thing I could think about is that it could be closer to the tube station , Helpful staff clean room and comfortable Close to central London 
257020,88 Studios, WiFi was way too weak could not work or even do Skype Whatsapp calls, friendly staff quick check in nice modern room not too far away from down town train and bus reasonably close nice little kitchenette
257021,88 Studios, No negatives, My first trip overseas solo and I loved everything about this property Loved every minute of my stay here Comfortable bed kitchenette was great and spotless bathroom with nice hot shower Will return for sure 
257022,88 Studios, Traffic noise was disturbing but I do live in the country where the only sound comes from owls Noisy neighbours in room opposite woke me up at 2 15am I rang reception and the lady was very helpful and immediately came up and told them to be quiet , Location to Olympia stadium perfect Great little kitchenette 
257023,88 Studios, The lady staff her name was Alex i think was unwelcoming and didn t seem too keen welcoming us into the hotel It was awkward to say the least , The space was clean and tidy private with no disturbances 
257024,88 Studios, The glass doors to the bathroom I travelled with 2 teenage girls who were very self conscious and wouldn t use the loo as it was right next to the opaque glass panel , The hob microwave fridge and sink All very useful if you are staying longer than one night Can t fault the cleanliness and the beds were nice and comfy too We were on the lower ground floor so wifi wasn t too good but overall the place is lovely Perfect location for us Less than a 5 minute walk to Olympia and train station 
257025,88 Studios, Slightly noisy in the morning cleaners but not a problem 10 15 minute walk to Shepherd s Bush tube also not a problem, The building entry and room actually looked like the photos very clean very welcoming 
257026,88 Studios, Lots of dust under bed and in vents No plugs in mini kitchen so had to plug kettle and toaster in to bedside table, Location was excellent for the tube and Olympia Very comfy beds Big bathroom and great shower

257029,88 Studios, There could have been some shelving in the bathroom for washbags etc and more places to hang towels , The room was well designed and clean The kitchenette facilities were good Beds very comfortable Staff were very nice Would definitely stay again 
257030,88 Studios, Bed being a double size felt a little small for two as used to king but still was very comfortable , Very clean and stylish d cor perfect location for Olympia exhibition hall 
257031,88 Studios, Slightly off putting having glass bathroom walls Would have liked some decaf coffee and maybe a rug on the floor but this was not a major drama , Little details in kitchen were lovely ie Bottles of water biscuits and plenty of tea and coffee Staff very helpful and beds comfy 
257032,88 Studios, Missing a table and 2 chairs to have breakfast as a couple The bathroom door should be solid instead of glass You can hear everything when the other person is in the bathroom not charming , Location odeon clean functional Friendly staff at reception 
257033,88 Studios, No Breakfast available, We were there to attend olympia the hotel was very close to the exhibition centre The rooms were really clean with a small kitchenette with microwave hob and fridge No meals served but that suited us as we kept irregular hours due to having to look after the horse we had with us at the horse show Would certainly stay there again
257034,88 Studios, Was quite noisy next to the road with single glazed windows corridors were noisy but that is the way the building is built , Lovely bathroom spacious room good facilities 24 hour reception 
257035,88 Studios, Bedding was a little yellow from iron I should think but nothing really to complain about , Lovely airy room which was located at the back so lovely and quiet 
257036,88 Studios, The bathroom doors wall is frosted glass which means you can see silhouettes of the person on the toilet The water running through the pipes is also very noisy, Great location for olympia Well equipped with all you need Staff were friendly and helpful and the reception is manned 24 7 Able to control the temperature of your room yourself 
257037,88 Studios, Little bit noisy at night as on a busy road but couldn t fault it as the location was so convenient , Staff were friendly and helpful Lovely accommodation very clean and modern Excellent location Very easy to find Would definitely stay here again when next in London 
257038,88 Studios,No Negative, It was clean and spaceouis Normally booking in London you never get the same as the pictures but this was 100 accurate The room was spacious especially with two girls and two massive suitcases we had room to spare the facilities was clean tidy and immaculate from the moment we walked in The staff friendly and accommodating simply one of the best places I have ever stayed so much so when we got home we booked straight away for a few weeks time They let us check in early and was ready for us and even after check out held our luggage so we could go shopping before we had to leave I would recommend this hotel to anyone 
257039,88 Studios, They have a problem with plumbing that is a little noisy first thing in the morning If you have to get up early it s not a problem but if you want a lie in ask for a room on the top floor, Fantastic value for Kensington very comfortable bed and quiet x great shower with plenty of toiletries x plenty of coffee tea milk and biscuits

257041,88 Studios, Sound isolation of doors and walls between the rooms seems quite poor Could hear noise from the corridor and the neighboring rooms and from the water pipes when somebody above took a shower or flushed the toilet , Modern interior Clean 
257042,88 Studios, the noise outside and inside the building by feuding people the room needs better climate control and is way to small for international travellers with their luggage , the Staff members on check in and out were very nice 
257043,88 Studios, struggled with airconditioning and glass panel toilet side of bathroom so you could see your otther half on loo no thank you , Kitchenette was ideal bathroom was lovely with good quality fitting really good shower lots of towels and tea coffee herbal teas
257044,88 Studios, Road is a little noisey which meant sleeping with the window open wasn t possible Triple glazing quietens the road considerably it was a little hot in the room even with the radiator off , Rooms were well equipped and decorated to a modern standard Kensington High Street is a 10 minute walk though there is a bus stop at the end of the road 
257045,88 Studios, None, The service at the front desk stood out The willingness to help was great Special mention to the lady at the front Alexandra she was excellent
257046,88 Studios, Only one toilet roll supplied More information needed to operate air con and TV Duvets a bit thin , Pleasant reception staff Clean room Quiet location
257047,88 Studios, The bathroom wall and door were glass and although opaque you could still see in Not great The traffic noise was relentless , We had a family room that was spacious and clean The beds and pillows were very comfortable The kitchen had everything we needed and there were 4 bottles of water in the fridge for us which we were grateful for The whole room was very well and elegantly kitted out 
257048,88 Studios,No Negative, This is a lovely place modern clean maybe a bit on the small side The studio is perfect for a couple but was a bit small for the three of us It is quiet the staff are friendly and helpful We also liked the location near Kensington Highstreet and near the Olympia I would come to stay here again 
257049,88 Studios, Wifi and floors were slightly dusty on arrival but nothing that affected the stay, Very clean and comfy only let down was the poor wifi connection in the room
257050,88 Studios, The cleaning could be better as there was urine in the shower , Great transport links brilliant value for money good facilities in the room Definitely recommend 
257051,88 Studios, No breakfast available The area is nice but there is not much restaurants or cafes close by The nearest underground station is around 10 minute walk The rooms are very small if you have large luggage I would say it is a bit overpriced for what it is and what it offers , Fully equipped kitchenette Smart TV where you can watch movies through Netflix or simply YouTube There is a nice park nearby called Holland Park that is full of giant squirrels and a nice Japanese garden where peacocks roam around 
257052,88 Studios, Nothing it made me come home wanting a new bathroom it was lovely , It was clean tidy friendly ideally located and had everything we needed toiletries bottled water coffee even a swan made out the towels

257060,88 Studios, The door in the bathroom is made of semi transparent glass It is very nice but sometimes may be not very convenient , Excellent location zone 2 quiet safe area Opposite the door is the bus station Closest tube station is 5 minutes on foot Very helpful and effective staff Reception 24 hours All equipment in the room was new The room is sufficient for three persons 
257061,88 Studios, Unfortunately sited on the ground floor meant that the constant drainage echoed throughout the room resulting in very little sleep on either night, The room was immaculate and extremely well kept with appropriate extras provided Staff efficient and welcoming
257062,88 Studios,No Negative, We were attending the Baby Show in Olympia and the location was perfect The room was immaculate the bed was oh so comfy and the shower was amazing Range of TV channels perfect Definitely booking again 
257063,88 Studios, There is not much space for hanging clothes but we did not care about it Location wise great area with a nice Corner Pub but quiet a walk to the nearest Underground Station The Overground Station Close by is not advisable as you have to Change Trains often and the wait for the next Train can be Long We walked a lot but enjoyed it, We loved 88 Studios staff very friendly and helpfull perfectly styled room great bathroom with excellent shower toiletteries comfy bed and a mini kitchen We will return here

257068,88 Studios, Felt more utensils in the kitchenette would have been useful eg tea towel tumblers and wine glasses, The room itself and the bed and toiletries great lovely shower area 
257069,88 Studios, Always noticed black long hair on a bed towels I m blonde The room is very tiny In a rainy day when one of staff member was asked for an umbrella he answered that he can t see the rain anymore like it s a favour to be given an umbrella ,No Positive
257070,88 Studios, The apartments are in a converted traditional house on the main road The Double studio was not in main building but outside with its own entrance and down small two flights of steep and narrow stairs towards the basement of the property The stairwell was well lit and well paved but the steps are narrow and those with children or physical health issues will struggle This is ideal if you are fit and want to be left to your own devices as the room has its own entrance However Not the safest if it rains It sounds like a big issue but once you re used to it it s ok Room was cold and there was a heater which has a limiter so you will not be freezing but may still be a little cold Outside is a busy road car horns can be heard on Saturday morning as traffic starts to increase Wasn t a big Issue for me however as I was up getting ready , Overall for price location and privacy I cannot Complain about this property although there are some areas for improvement but nowhere is perfect Beautiful good sized bathroom Good location Westfield London 11 mins away by car minus traffic during the day Easy to find in a car and clearly signposted Clean and tidy reception and decor outside Slippers and toiletries provided Iron and hair dryer in provided hair dryer didn t work however Complimentary water in fridge and tea bags and biscuits Ample towels provided maybe too many Kitchenette in a cupboard and suitable for a short stay and if you don t plan to cook as I don t fancy standing in between a cupboard to cook However It s nice to have a good sized fridge sink and microwave when away as you don t often get these in hotels Small room but there was a single and double bed in my room I would recommend for max 2 adults or an adult and a child of they can make it up and down the stairs Price for location was excellent 75 for Friday night and booked on the day Although I don t think this price drop happens often it s worth looking out for I googled the area before hand and found out the whole borough has controlled parking However permit restrictionss are Monday to Friday 8 30am to 6 30pm I Parked in a pay and display bay on Friday night until 8 30am on Saturday morning At 8 30am on Saturday I topped up the maximum stay of 4 hours 3 50p h until check our time midday Such parking arrangements are quite stressful and expensive so others may wish to book a Saturday to Sunday stay where permit restrictions are lifted after 1pm on Saturday so you can park from check in to check out stress free 
257071,88 Studios, Disappointed that I booked a double room and was given a room with 2 single beds And they were fully booked so we couldn t change , Very clean Modern and stylish with a rain shower 
257072,88 Studios, Whatever you do don t book a lower ground floor bedroom at least not LG 7 As there is another room opposite but below your window overlooks an inside space which has a strong light on all night The blackout curtain is far from adequate and consequently the room is illuminated throughout the night so it is very difficult to sleep unless you can do so in a room that feels like it is constantly at dusk , A compact but well designed space with a small kitchenette fridge two ring hob and microwave and a nicely appointed shower room Everything was very clean and the presence of 24 hour staff an advantage The air conditioning on a sweltering day 30 C was a real boon 
257073,88 Studios, Nothing at all, Everything from the room with all the essentials you could ask for the room was spotless and cleaned evryday Ease of transport which was available across the road to Sheppards Bush or a short walk to catch a bus in the opposite direction to Victoria which went through Kensington Knihtsbridge etc so could most of London via bus or tube The staff were very welcoming and when asked advice they knew all the answers Definately stay here again 
257074,88 Studios, The first night we were put in a tiny cramped room which should have been for 1 person and was noisy due to the main road We complained and were moved to a better room The internet stopped working on my laptop the last 2 days Complained but the receptionist looked helpless , The location the bathroom and the good airconditioning
257075,88 Studios, The fixture in the shower was a bit awkward until you were actually in there but it wasn t a good deal , Clean comfy bed nice fixtures and furniture good location nice exterior quiet quick check in check out
257076,88 Studios, The room was quite small Not much room to move around especially relevant when staying for 7 days as we did , Clean modern bright friendly helpful staff 
257077,88 Studios, Room wasn t soundproof as mentioned as you could hear people walking though corridors and water passing though the pipes However its nothing that causes you to lose sleep A quick heads up rather than a complaint which is no fault of the hotel Kensington Olympia Under Overground only runs on weekends and Bank holiday However you can get the train to other stations but cannot return to the Kensington Olympia unless its within the dates i stated above , Quick and easy check in and out The room was very clean and nicely presented Staff was very friendly and accommodating Fantastic area with shops cafe s 5 mins away and only a 10 15 min walk down the main road to Westfield shopping centre and shepherds bush underground I definitely will book another stay at this hotel when i next visit London 
257078,88 Studios,No Negative, 88 studios is a brilliant hotel It is impeccably clean modern and comfortable the staff could not have been more professional and helpful The location is also excellent and I am looking forward to a return visit in the future 
257079,88 Studios, Wifi was really bad Room could use a bit more space for luggage, Decorating was great location a little far out but still great with nearby public transportation 
257080,88 Studios, Things that i didn t like was the fact that you don t have enough places were to hang your clothes and so even if they are dirty you have to put them back in the baggage We stayed at the floor 1 which was more or less under the reception and so sometimes in the mornings we could hear the people walking and their trolleys The studios are 900 m far away from the Shepherds Bush Station underground so sometimes it might seems to be to far away until you get used to it Near the station you can find a lot of coffee bars as well as Starbucks Mcdonalds cinema ecc where you can eat breakfast lunch dinner and enjoy London so I guess that is a plus , Staff very kind and ready to help you We needed to print our check in ticket for the airplane and they did us the favor immediately They also speak different languages and they give you assistance 24 h The bed was very comfortable and cozy We found our room clean everyday Towels changed bed changed every 2 or 3 days bathroom cleaned The kitchen was provided with all the facilities even if it is small Every room has windows for me is very important 
257081,88 Studios, The only negative is that it s on Holland road which is busy all night and the road noise did disturb my sleep I suggest the windows are upgraded at the front to more than single glazing or ear plugs are provided as standard If I stayed again I would want a room at the back , Great room modern decor comfortable bed fantastic rain fall shower I stayed 3 nights on a business trip and was great to have my own mini kitchen 
257082,88 Studios, The location was not very good in terms of public transport The closest subway station actually only works during the weekend The room overall was clean but the towels were not clean at all , The room for 3 people was spacious and having the little kitchen is useful 
257083,88 Studios, More handles in the bathroom shelf for the towels we r Lachine these, The location the clean less of the room the picture during the booking is the as the reality it is well equipped the house keeping is perfect
257084,88 Studios, Apart from the pub down the street which the food was actually very good they closed early and there aren t any pubs and restaurants in the near vicinity The subway was also a 15 min walk away , The rain shower was divine The compact kitchenette was great to have for morning toast and coffee Our room was a family room and it was very spacious which was a very nice surprise We also loved that it was far away from the maddening tourists and you feel more like a local staying here which is great 
257085,88 Studios, we did not really bother but if you are noise sensitive you must be aware that the water system can be heard a bit Meaning if someone above or beside you uses shower or toilets you will hear the water rushing through the pipes The kitchenette is fully equiped for 3 people but there are not enough chairs so you have to eat breakfast sitting on your bed We stayed for 7 days and had wonderful weather Unfortunately there is no terrace or any place to spend time outside If you return to Hotel you need to stay at your room There is also no Bar or any lounge area in the Hotel The invoice has to be paid in advance upon arrival which we found a bit unusual especially if you stay for 7 days It does not allow you to change your plans and for example leave a day earlier All towels were changed everyday there was no way to indicate to use towels twice to protect the environment Even unused towels were changed each day , very clean and modern room as shown on the photos comfortable beds nice and helpful staff when we arrived we first were a bit concerned whether this place would be a bit too much off everything as the neighborhood looked very quiet and we didn t see any restaurants or shops nearby But actually there is a bus stop nearby and buses leave every 9 12 minutes and you can easily reach several tube stations Kensington Highstreet for shopping and lot s of nice places to go out for dinner For us it was even walking distance as we like to walk and explore the neighborhood We enjoyed the place very much and it felt like a relief when we came back from buzzling city centre and crowdy tourist attractions and we were glad to stay there The area is clean safe and has a lot of nice houses to look at and as mentioned lot s of places to go out nearby We would stay there again 
257086,88 Studios, Nothing, The room we had was fantastic we had everything we needed all in one place The cleanliness of the room and bathroom In Particular was second to none I am an amputee and therefore have to sit on the floor when showering and we all know what people do in the shower I was more than happy because of how clean everything was Staff were always polite and very welcoming and the location was perfect We will definitely return 
257087,88 Studios, No restaurant on the premises or even a small cafe I had a double suite which was just about okay for a single occupancy Double occupancy would be an issue with luggage storage and the like , A comfortable room for single occupancy and a proper shower A decent location within walking distance of High Street Kensington and Shepherd s Bush 
257088,88 Studios, We stayed for more than 8 nights and no one time did they changed the bed sheets They wifi was horrible and they didn t clean at all just swap the floor and make the bed The bed was actually really small for two persons Also don t stay in the ground floor because you will hear all the water coming down when someone else is using the toilet , The location was superb and the staff was really nice I loved that there was a 24h desk and the rooms are good for a 10 15 days stay 
257089,88 Studios, Bed mattress not as comfy as looked, Friendliness and very clean Brilliant you can drop bags in and leave after until your off to catch transport home Not far from 2 tubes plus buses close by
257090,88 Studios, Nothing really We only stayed for one night so perhaps we didn t have time to properly see what could be done better My friends did say that the room above them was noisy during the night but that can t really be helped , The whole hotel was very clean and well presented the beds were very comfy and the rooms very clean and modern with very good facilities The staff were very helpful and friendly 
257091,88 Studios, We had a few steps down int the room right at the entrance which was a little difficult with us all having bags etc Also there was a lot of noise from the neighbouring rooms It didnt seem very sound proof , Everything was great it was very clean and white which is something I like Modern furnishings Everything worked Very compact 
257092,88 Studios, 88 studios had booked out my room as a day room and it wasn t going to be available until 7 8pm as the people in my room didn t check out until 6pm I think double booking rooms is unacceptable and asked the receptionist to call the manager Dennis hung up on her when I asked to speak to him I left my number for him to call me but unsurprisingly he didn t When I eventfully met him he was unconcerned about double bookings and denied being the manager,No Positive
257093,88 Studios, Tip ask for a room in the back of property That will be nice and quiet we hardly heard any traffic , Comfortable beds great shower clean great location as just 10 min walk from Shepherd s Bush and 3 from Kensington Olympia 
257094,88 Studios, I would have liked a tea towel and cloth in the kitchenette , It was a very comfortable stay in this brand new 2 months old studio Clean good beds up to date great shower 
257095,88 Studios, Although we had a fully stuffed kitchenette the room lacked a proper table and chairs to eat if one decided to cook The triple studio had only one chair and very small coffee table or so for three people But they said that they are considering supplying more chairs to the room And the bathroom sink is too small and narrow to wash your face You can wash only hands in it The hairdryer is strangely fitted in the room in a wardrobe and you cannot take it out to the bathroom which is inconvenient because one usually needs a mirror to dry one s hair The Internet kept falling and interrupting every minute but got much better after our complaint It is very important to foreigners like us since we cannot locate places of interest find directions check timetables etc without Internet , We liked the location close to Westfield Shopping center which means you have many shops and restaurants close buy Everything in the hotel is new thus very clean Very nice discrete lights in the room We booked two rooms for three adults one of which was a double and the other was a triple studio Kind and helpful staff The triple studio had a kitchenette with everything in it a fridge a kettle even a microwave 24 hours reception desk which is very nice 
257096,88 Studios, Wifi extremely poor Not suitable for work or booking flights Plumbing very loud when room above flushed toilet or took a shower , Bed very comfortable room extremely clean staff very helpful friendly 
257097,88 Studios, The rooms located on the main street are extremely noisy as there is traffic all the time , Fantastic property with brand new facilities Located within a 2 min walk from the Olympia overground station Excellent staff 
257098,88 Studios, I found it a bit noisy if you want to have a good sleep ask for a quite room, Staff was lovely and location is good comfortable bed and room has everything you need
257099,88 Studios, The kitchen is really a cupboard but there is a full size fridge Quite small rooms so for instance no room for a chair to sit at the pull down shelf if you wanted to work on your laptop , Very newly refurbished great shower room nice toiletries good linen hairdryer safe slippers iron air con free Wifi late checkout 12 noon luggage storage 
257100,88 Studios, It s not really a bad place but there are no facilities and it s in a noisy area The room is very small and wifi hardly worked , It s not really a bad place but there are no facilities and it s in a noisy area The room is very small and wifi hardly worked 
257101,88 Studios, It would be nice to be informed that there were a few builders right outside of our room who were doing some building work for the basement of the building This was absolutely shocked for us and immediately I wasn t amused by this at all Apart from the builders there were quite a lot dirty bags outside of the room which were part of their building work Builders work outside of our room from 7 30am until 5 or 6 pm in the evening we couldn t lie in a little bit in the morning they were like the alarm to wake us up every morning The problem is builders talked loudly and smoked in front of our window too so that we couldn t open our window at all because we didn t want to hear what they talked about foreign language and smell the cigarette That was the biggest no no for us actually for any customers walk into the building bit heart dropped moment Building work makes the front entrance very dusty It also affect my room s cleaniess dust for the first day was bad I had to clean all the surface with wet wipes It is getting bit better from second day of our stay Receptionists were fine one of them had to provide water and toilet roll for us which I had complained a few times at the front desk Seems quite a thing trying to buy two bottles of water should be easy and acceptable however I did feel receptionist made me feel she has done us a massive favour made me feel well guilty even asked about it which I thought totally wrong I didn t feel I was offered any enthusiastic service which I should have The Thing made me laugh was staff seems spent huge amount of time making the shape of towels on the bed however they couldn t be bothered to put enough toilet roll for us and clean the floor properly We accept there will always be good thing and bad thing about a hotel however if hotel had been measured as a 4 star hotel they should have happy staff clean room good service and quiet environment , The hotel is very new and a fantastic location One of biggest shopping centre Westfield is just about 20 mins walking distance away Overall the hotel is fairly clean and safe to stay around Facilities are very good modern Little kitchen in the room is fantastic tiny but they got everything you need Bed is super comfy Thanks very much for that especially after a long day walking around in London Inside of hotel is very quiet which is very nice Quiet neighbourhood is alway the bonus for the guests 
257102,88 Studios, An extra chair table would be useful in the triple suite , Very high quality of fixtures Very comfortable bed excellent shower and modern wardrobe units Everything you need to make breakfast just add food There s a little Sainsburys just a few minutes walk away 
257103,88 Studios, Not clean enough Lots of dusts on furniture Some chips crumbles was found in one of the drawers Lack of a storage in the bathroom Need a little storing furniture under the sink for toiletries Or in the the shower for shower gel shampoo etc The room we had was next to a busy road We could hear lots of traffic at night , Liked where the hotel was situated Easy access to all public transport Friendly staff Kitchenette well equipped 
257104,88 Studios, They take a reserved payment 2 days before your stay then you have to pay again when you arrive I have to wait for my 1st payment to be put back into my account still waiting 4days later , Great facilities 10 min walk from tube Recently refurbished so very clean and new

257106,88 Studios, We had a room at the front and as I m a light sleeper the traffic did interrupt my sleep , Quality bathroom fittings and build Very helpful staff Shower was excellent with nice bathroom products and comfy bed 
257107,88 Studios, Ground floor facing the street is very noise with big traffic every day till mid night and the new finished decoration smelling is strong since i was staying for five nights so requested to change to 2rd floor it is a little bit better Location is not so convinient need to take bus 49 or C1 to tube since the district line to Olypic train station only available at weekends or holiday , The double bed room is very nice designed confortable staying And the price is fair enough to take Mini kitchen is excellent 
257108,88 Studios, a little bit noise from the street, very nice place great value for money the stuff was very helpfull the triple room was spacious and very comfortable the kitchenette was great and the shower was the best 10 minutes walk to bush garden tube station 1 minute walk to bus station that will take you there in 3 minutes holland park 5 minutes walk is the best place to relax after a day of sightseeing
