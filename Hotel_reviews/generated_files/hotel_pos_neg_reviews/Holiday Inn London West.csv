176061,Holiday Inn London West, My stay in this hotel was in Holly month of Ramadan when all Moslims are fasting and our reservation was including breakfast I tried many times to fix it and the staff promised that they will fix it before checking out but unfortunately they charged me the full price including the breakfast charge, Quite and neat place to stay in 
176062,Holiday Inn London West, This hotel was advertised as being convenient for Wembley stadium it was a good half hour taxi drive away No easy access via underground or on a bus route It is situated near business units and student accommodation only one pub within walking distance ,No Positive
176063,Holiday Inn London West, Reception poorly sign posted shower blocked told some one would sort out disentangle turn up waited 1 hour not good as waiting to go out had to change room ordered a magnets cider ok wanted another but they only had 1 bottle bar tender poor English reception could have wished us a nice stay on checking out could have asked us if we enjoyed our stay also area didn t feel safe groups of male youths hanging round area so we did not want to stay out later than 10pm quite scared actually spoilt th trip, Beds comfy clean rooms

176066,Holiday Inn London West, The managers attitude towards helping us with our requests Her name was Maria and she was no help what so ever her attitude was disgusting and she just kept walking off halfway through us trying to talk to her , Nothing 
176067,Holiday Inn London West, Parking is a problem at this hotel there is only a very small car park and no option to park on the roads nearby without a permit The staff were very kind in trying to find a solution but ultimately the car park is too small for the size of the hotel,No Positive
176068,Holiday Inn London West, Under staffed at breakfast no tables free when we eventually got one we put our coffees down whilst we went to get food and when we came back someone else was sitting at our table as the waitress had cleared it toaster wasn t working and bread had ran out, Location and room
176069,Holiday Inn London West, Room was rather small The bed was creeky and reception ordered us a cab to Wembley which did not arrive we were then informed a larger vehicle would pick us and 4 other guests up as we were all going to a concert and it would be cheaper to split the cost of 18 but the taxi driver charged us 15 per couple so we ended up all paying 45 for an 18 journey , Location
176070,Holiday Inn London West, Went to holiday inn Wembley in error They informed me they couldn t check on system whether we were booked in at the London west and couldn t get anyone to answer the phone when they rang Had to get a taxi across to check ourselves Astonished it is not linked up to other hotels in chain Not the best , Clean room comfortable bed overall good hotel with his and tube station close
176071,Holiday Inn London West, Location Stated on the internet is said it was near to Wembley stadium 2 5 miles however it took us 1 hour in a taxi to get there even thought it was actually 4 8 miles the traffic was horrendous and for the tube you had to go into London then come back out included 1 change so journey was at least 45 mins We wished we had just went for a hotel in the centre of London as we had to leave our cases at Kings Cross at a cost of 6 per item for 3 hours then couldn t get a taxi tickets to pop into London centre as the que s were too long so ended up walking around the Kings Cross area so Friday was a wasted day, Cleanliness staff
176072,Holiday Inn London West, Someone put their food on our room number despite us saying we would not need a tab , Room was a good size Beds were comfortable Breakfast was very good
176073,Holiday Inn London West, There didnt seem to be enough parking on site for the amount of potential guests that may have been staying Limited in house menu which seemed a little overpriced for what was available, Very close to tube and shops Relatively easy to get to Room was spacious and comfortable 
176074,Holiday Inn London West, Had problems getting to hotel and getting off the main road if you miss turning you had to at least two miles on this main road to turn back, Was upgraded to an executive suite
176075,Holiday Inn London West, Limited parking may cause some travellers problems at peak times , The breakfast was very good The bar restaurant menu choice is reasonable well cooked and presented and available throughout the day D cor and layout was friendly and inviting 
176076,Holiday Inn London West, The car parking was totally inadequate for size of the hotel The breakfast was under cooked eggs sausages , The beds were comfortable the shower was good
176077,Holiday Inn London West,No Negative, hotel was great clean and comfortable location wasn t so good but it was closest we could get to Wembley only 7 tube stops away tube approx 150 yards from hotel 
176078,Holiday Inn London West, it was not quite a way from Wembley stadium which is where we were going but it was the nearest we could find for that date Our fault for not booking earlier, restaurant was excellent service was great throughout the hotel and room was very comfy and clean 
176079,Holiday Inn London West, There was no air conditioning it was one of the hottest days and there was also no windows to open in the room This was unbearable and really had an impact on our stay We asked the staff to rectify but nothing was resolved This was an executive suite and felt this wasn t up to standard On this basis I probably wouldn t book again , The bedroom and facilities The bar was also fantastic 
176080,Holiday Inn London West, The air conditioning was on all night and temp only altered from 24 5 degrees to 24 so putting up with the noise all night was pointless The picture on the wall opposite the bed was not restful a jumble of diagonal lines , All staff pleasant Bed was comfy Shower brilliant plenty of room to move 
176081,Holiday Inn London West, The view from the bedroom was of dixons carphone wear house however it was only for one night and didn t spend much time in the hotel, The bed was comfy staff friendly and helpful
176082,Holiday Inn London West, The rooms were really hot during the night and the toy can t move the tv to the correct angle that u are laying or sitting at and you can t have the tv at like 20 because you still can t hear it so it has to be a bit louder other than that I really enjoyed my stay and would say it s one of the best hotels in the area so far, Beds were very comfy and when food was ordered it was ready to collect 10 mins later the staff were amazing help and check in was earlier than listed and so was check out which meant I we got an extra hours lay in and a phone was given if we was looking to travel about and needed help 
176083,Holiday Inn London West, No hot running water in basin Drinks vastly OVERPRICED Kept awake for the most of one night of stay due to VERY noisy occupants in adjoining room Had to repeatedly knock on walls and shout for them to shut up Should be signs in rooms to request consideration be given to other guests regarding noise levels and if not abided by perpetrators will be removed , Late bar Able to order pizza to take to room Lifts Nearby bus stops 
176084,Holiday Inn London West, After paying for parking just received a penalty charge notice from Parking Eye for 60 amazing customer service that the hotel couldn t relay the receipt of payment of parking to Parking Eye now it is a waste of my time to sort out this inconvenience and a stupid con by the company to extract money from undiscerning customers ,No Positive
176085,Holiday Inn London West, Booking com had messed up my payment and taken payment twice The hotel sorted this when we got back just a little annoying as we had already paid and had to again at the hotel , We booked the hotel for the stone roses gig at wembely hotel location was good 10 for a taxi to wembely hotel staff very nice and the room was lovely apart from we were on the 7th floor and it was like a sauna Aircon wasn t great but it was one of the hottest days we ve had in England Car park was fine with plenty of spaces
176086,Holiday Inn London West,No Negative, Overnight stay before attending Hammersmith Hospital for which it was well situated being a 10 taxi ride to the hospital at 6am in the morning Staff were very helpful and friendly although service in the restaurant became less attentive when it filled up Rooms were clean and had a fair amount of room but lighting was a little dim Room had aircon which was needed on a hot night but came with the expected background noise Sealed double glazed windows kept out the traffic noise as it is on the junction of some major mult laned roads Restaurant menu was ok but but the food was not outstanding although there was far too much of it I would happily stay again if I needed to be in that location although probably not if it was at the full room rate 
176087,Holiday Inn London West, When we arrived our room has been cancelled So the receptionist told us only 1 room available in the hotel due to a lot going on in London that weekend We asked the price it was 230 an extra 120 than we have originally paid We had to pay the difference otherwise we would have been stranded in London for the night When we paid and went to our new room we were shocked and horrified to see the last guests belongings still all over the floor nothing had been cleaned house keeping hadn t even been in the room So I went straight to reception and they told us to use a different room even though they told us the dirty room was the only one in the hotel We got lied to There was no apology for the mix up nothing the guy just gave us the room key and said come down for breakfast in the morning on us No emotion nothing Good job they gave us free breakfast we were skint as the additional cost for the room was all we had saved to spend over our weekend in London So even the night we had planned for our anniversary was ruined instead of lovely romantic meal we had to settle for a bottle or water and a cheap take out pizza near by to our hotel So upset and angry at the situation , Nothing 
176088,Holiday Inn London West, I went down to breakfast when I returned at 11 15 I was locked out of my room but no notification of this was given before this although check out time is 12 noon , The convenience of getting around to see my relatives in the area and those in south East London 
176089,Holiday Inn London West, Had to pay for my breakfast was disgusting the bacon was stuck together big lump Only thing hot on breakfast was beans and they were warm The tea was from this metal jug think it s been there for ages as the water was like warm Example I could pour into cup and stick my finger into it without burning my finger I put milk in then was like drinking cold tea Very poor breakfast Car parking paying to stay at there hotel when I come back second night couldn t park as carpark was full even though I paid for parking Everyone should have a designated space for free , Room was clean and tidy would of liked option of a bath not just get a shower 
176090,Holiday Inn London West, Booked an early check in for 11 12 which I received an email to say that would be fine After being up at 4am and travelling for hours I was not very happy when I arrived to find out no rooms where available until 2pm which ment I couldn t freshen up or get changed before going to my event in the afternooon If I had know that an early check in would not be possible I would have booked a different hotel , Booked an executive room which was very nice and clean

176093,Holiday Inn London West, When we arrived there was no space in the car park I had phoned the day before to check whether not there was space and was told it was not a problem Initially we were told we could loiter and wait for a space or alternatively park in Park Royal a 10 min walk Neither option was viable We were then given a permit to park in Portal Way , Room was great Bed very comfortable 
176094,Holiday Inn London West, Didn t sleep well during the stay as the air con didn t work we even asked to get it fixed but they didn t Furthermore during one night ordered room service at 10 30pm after numerous phone calls and finding out that a restaurant worker didn t even put the order onto the system the food turns up at 12am Breakfast was promised to me at 19 95 previous phone call for the whole stay but when i got to the hotel they charged me 9 95 per person per night just short of 60 pound , buffet breakfast good view from room clean and great service from some people 
176095,Holiday Inn London West, Reception staff could be lot more responsive Nice and polite but slow paced Breakfast has different prices for cooked and non cooked food a tad surprising and disappointing , Size of the room was impressive bed very comfortable and the overall ambience was nice throughout Breakfast was good 
176096,Holiday Inn London West, Room service if requested food requested 5 Pound to connect to the room The restaurant has a dishonest employee coming to ask for money I was dating with a friend who felt angry with him, The room and bed were comfortable the room cleaning service was excellent the atmosphere was lovely there I enjoyed the hotel too The bath was very fluffy and very sweet
176097,Holiday Inn London West, Here are the issues for which i would like credit from the hotel 1 I was given a room for handicapped 2 The room had this alarm cord in the bedroom 3 the bathroom Had a small sink on where I could not place any of my personal things 4 I had to sit to urinate Please let me know how I can get credit from the hotel , Location
176098,Holiday Inn London West, Would encourage staff to practice their English and pronunciation During check in had to ask staff to repeat themselves more than once The price is steep especially given the location and breakfast was extra Breakfast not worth the money Complete free for all Fried eggs undercooked Tinned mushrooms Mushy sausages Half cooked bacon Toast takes to goes around the machine Breakfast area and dining area too small for the size of the hotel Tables and chairs too close together The bathroom in our room Don t think there should be a glass partition between the shower and the rest of the room I don t want to see the ankles of the person I m sharing room with as they re dropping the kids off at the pool Paid 90 quid for two people 1 night Actual cost was 125 00 including breakfast and parking It s just very steep considering you are not in the heart of london , Very comfy bed Room clean and modern

176102,Holiday Inn London West, Made booking through booking com who got the booking wrong Was meant to be 2 rooms but only one reserved Also description on search described hotel as near Wembley but underground travel took 45 minutes , Hotel staff friendy Nice and modern and clean
176103,Holiday Inn London West, No smart tv for Netflix, Was a good size room and the staff very good only thing I would do is add smart TVs so guests can watch Netflix or use YouTube as most free view channels are borring lol But that s in all hotels This hotels was very good and would stay again 
176104,Holiday Inn London West, I think having the TV on to me when a guest comes they can put on the TV saving u money and the curtains should have being drawn, Didn t really go out as came for a family venue but would come again
176105,Holiday Inn London West, Too far from wembley and didnt seem to have much nearby Parking was expensive, The room was lovely and had the best nights sleep ever The food portions were very generous too
176106,Holiday Inn London West, Room temperature a bit too warm Also we booked 2 taxis at reception to take us to Wembley stadium 60 in total for 2 taxis 10people HOTEL should consider not using this taxi company again , Very pleasant and cosy hotel Staff were very friendly 
176107,Holiday Inn London West, Nothing It was all good , The bed was really comfy It s made us want to treat ourselves to a new bed at home Air con in rooms Superquiet even though it s on a major road We were on the 7th floor and so had amazing views of the London skyline 
176108,Holiday Inn London West, Executive room was anything but that shower toilet were in the bedroom so any bodily functions were audible etc Handheld device supplied in room didn t work for the whole weekend Ordered food and was fobbed off with excuse there was no chef to cook what I ordered but the overpriced menu was available, Nothing
176109,Holiday Inn London West, There was a lot of confusion over the rooms because I had booked two rooms via booking com but only one was paid for When I spoke to a member of staff before getting there over the phone she was not helpful at all When I finally arrived there it took over twenty minutes to check in even though my family and I was the only ones there There were a few issues with the rooms which was finally resolved When I finally got to bed it was clear that the bed sheets had not be changed A member of staff came and changed the bedding , The breakfast was good 
176110,Holiday Inn London West, there was no fault i could find, the restaurant was fantastic breakfast was amazing so much selection all nice and fresh a hot nothing was to much trouble the staff were really friendly and the room was luxurious 
176111,Holiday Inn London West, Everything was good nothing negative Little far from Central London, The beds in executive rooms are sooooo comfortable and cozy Till date i had never found such comfortable beds 
176112,Holiday Inn London West,No Negative, What an amazing staff This was a great way to be introduced to London It s off the beaten path but a convenient taxi ride and tube ride from everything which is perfect for a New Yorker like me Close to the city but an opportunity to vacate away from the noise and daily grind Great accommodations Nice staff Wonderful selection of alcohol 
176113,Holiday Inn London West, The distance from the city centre but if u want a cheaper deal that is the catch i won t b central , The breakfast is very good but don t forget u r in England so it will also have the typical English breakfast as well The room was an Executive room very nice indeed located in a different building connected to the main one so as to offer the guest more quiet if needed I know i will book it again

176116,Holiday Inn London West, We were booked in amongst a group of badly behaved school children Next time put all the school group together and with their teachers and they can keep each other aware all night but not bother others , Your staff dealt with our complaint without any quibbleO
176117,Holiday Inn London West, I reserved two executive rooms On arrival my colleague was told that his executive room had been given to another guest and that he could have a twin room The receptionist called Fernando was flippant and unapologetic about this and did not make eye contact at all It was only after we told him that this was unacceptable that he miracously found an executive room It turned out that a previous guest had decided to stay an extra night which the hotel agreed to , Did not eat in the restaurant 
176118,Holiday Inn London West, Anticipated the service charge to be included in the menu prices in the restaurant instead it was an added additional cost to the bill Hence got a surprise when the bill was more than expected , Handy location for visiting west London reasonable rates and clean comfortable room Staff were friendly 
176119,Holiday Inn London West, I was kept waiting at reception while 3 members of staff were chatting to one guest then casually made his way over to me after , Beds were very comfortable good selection of breakfast nice lady on the bar
176120,Holiday Inn London West, I didn t like that I payed for a room for 75 on booking com and was charged 104 at the desk as they didn t have the double bed room available that I booked Not really wat was agreed and I felt it should have been upgraded , Bed was comftable and the room was nice good bathroom a nice bowl of fruit waiting for you Good stay
176121,Holiday Inn London West, It s slightly away Located at the edge of zone 2 and 3 But we knew that and the central line runs to this area so we were not so bothered , Very friendly staff Particularly at the reception I wish I had memorized the name of the gentleman at reception So helpful Was on a daytime shift Helped us on everything from calling cabs to showing directions Thanks Facilities comfort and cleanliness were above par Loved it Recommend this place
176122,Holiday Inn London West,No Negative, The staff the restaurant staff in particular were extremely hard working and friendly One man dark hair was amazing the group we were with all said how nice he was he didn t stop the whole time we were there and it would be nice for him to be rewarded for this We had a meal Saturday night around 8pm The girl who took the payment was very friendly too LOVED the Handy device too never seen anything like it 
176123,Holiday Inn London West, There is not much closet space to hang your clothes The room can become noisy when people pass by in the hallway outside your room The room is quite warm by default 24 degrees celsius and it is difficult to adjust the temperature with the thermostat , The hotel is comfortably located near the tube for those relying on public transport and also near a small supermarket for those who want to buy small groceries The room is spacious has good facilities iron hair dryer coffee tea kettle and comes with large windows that provide a nice view of the area The bed is comfortable good sized and there are both soft and firm pillows to choose from The shower is clean and there are good well sized towels The staff is friendly helpful and efficient 
176124,Holiday Inn London West, Our room was disabled friendly which we didn t need The wet room shower spread water all over the bathroom floor including around the toilet The water pooled and went cold unpleasant Breakfast looked nice but was mostly tasteless , Very comfy bed Sunday night so a great price Our room was also very quiet
176125,Holiday Inn London West, The fact I payed for a double room and only got a single bed room then had to wait till 3am to get what I paid for I would not be staying there again, The second room I got was good
176126,Holiday Inn London West, It doesn t sound any intuitive to rate the reception staff as customer friendly , the hotel is roughly 300 meters way from North Acton Station which is quite comfortable 
176127,Holiday Inn London West, The soap in the bathroom was empty I don t always travel with shower gel had forgot to pack mine this time round Would have been nice to use the alternative option , The room was very inviting and comfortable Loved how relaxed the evening was all because of the surroundings 
176128,Holiday Inn London West, Car park was full despite it not being possible to reserve a space but website said it was possible to park I had to park on double yellow lines outside As I arrived late I was told the double room I had booked had been taken and so I had to have a twin not impressed ,No Positive
176129,Holiday Inn London West, The parking is 25 per night so I booked a space on just park much cheaper, The room was absolutely amazing the bed was really comfortable the room was clean and tidy 
176130,Holiday Inn London West, Wind noise on 4th floor VERY loud all night Shower not powerful but as wet room style flooded entire tiny bathroom Staff overall not as attentive as normally experienced , Handy location Convenient parking Clean bed linen
176131,Holiday Inn London West, Parking was a little expensive considering I d already paid quite a lot for the room , Room was large and comfortable The bed was warm and inviting I slept very well with no disturbing noises from outside 
176132,Holiday Inn London West, Everything fine, Due to a family illness we had to cancel the month before On arrival they upgraded us to premium room which I thought was a great gesture 
176133,Holiday Inn London West, We were allocated to room for physically challenged persons which i did not expect It should have been mentioned in the booking com description itself Disappointed with that ,No Positive
176134,Holiday Inn London West, Very loud Could hear other residents passing through the corridor at night and in the morning Room had a wooden floor which probably contributed to the noise levels and also made the room feel a little colder The walls were in need of some paint both in the room and on the corridor of my floor Scuff marks were present in the room both on the skirting boards and on the walls Hotel also took a thirty pound deposit which I wasn t aware of I didn t see it mentioned on the booking com website , Facilities in hotel proximity to North Acton tube station We arrived late our first night and popped down to dominos and tesco to get some food which were just next door and open until late 
176135,Holiday Inn London West, The wooden floors made it so you could hear everything in the next room we had a door adjoining the next room to ours which we had to ensure was locked everyday after the cleaners had been to ensure whoever was in 205 couldn t get in and on the Saturday night a lady in 205 was playing the TV loud and laughing until late Beds were really uncomfortable and kept moving away from the wall I checked out early on the Sunday instead of the Monday as could not bare to stay another night , The shower and that is it
176136,Holiday Inn London West, 1 Very disappointed with the Signposting to the property we drove around and up down the A40 until we had to stop and call for directions into the entrance Even then we were told by the receptionist to drive to the small street which I gather meant a side street Even then the signposts were so small it was difficult to enter at the right place 2 The floors in the room were laminate and not carpet which were very noisy 3 Whilst in the shower 2 people entered our room they were issued with the same room keys as us room 213 Thankfully we were in the room as they entered however we had valuables with us and had we already gone out as was the reason for our stay it could ve been a different storey as there was no safe in the room 4 No towel rail apart from 2 hooks in the shower Not impressed at all , Not an awful lot to be honest 
176137,Holiday Inn London West, Probably a booking com issue rather than the hotel But reserved first night at 79 but it was actually 95 , Guest Services Manager Sam Faek was fantastic Went above and beyond to provide excellent service 
176138,Holiday Inn London West, Staff well managers and the fact I haven t received my holding fee back yet after a month of my stay, The room was modern and good quality furniture
176139,Holiday Inn London West, Lack of bar staff at busy times Disabled member in the party with a disability parking badge but still charged for parking , Excecutive room was lovely queen bed very comfortable Higher floors very quiet during night but noisy from 5am onwards 
176140,Holiday Inn London West, Nothing Is a 3 star hotel but it has really a higher standard then London 4 stars hotels , Executive room are excellent Loved the idea of giving to the guests a smartphone and also the bad and shower box are good
176141,Holiday Inn London West, The fire alarm went off at exactly 7am two of the three nights of my stay If it happened once I could chalk it up to being an accident but twice means either the staff don t care that the fire alarm is malfunctioning or they don t care if they accidentally set it off , It s very convenient to the Tube and the room was generally nice 
176142,Holiday Inn London West, Tv in room didn t work neither did the kettle Some kind of alarm went off at about 6 45am Woke everyone up When I turned up to the hotel no recollection of my booking This was booking com s error not Holiday Inn tonne honest Holiday inn were good to sort it I was lucky they had spare rooms ,No Positive
176143,Holiday Inn London West, I added breakfast when I booked the hotel but it wasn t on when I got to the hotel I asked when I checked in to be added but I still wasn t on the list when I went down for breakfast , Nice bar and coffee area

176145,Holiday Inn London West, Our sleep from 8am onwards was constantly disturbed by slamming doors and knocking as well as attempts to enter our room on various occasions by the cleaners when we were already staying more than one day and wanted a lie in We also didn t put a sign on our door stating that we were in need of our rooms being clean so it made for an overall bad nights sleep Staff members should be made aware of what rooms not to disturb and not be aloud to just enter a room without knocking Also I requested for the invoice to be sent by email over the phone speaking with Sebastian he came over quite short and rude and till now I have yet to receive my invoice after being put on hold for 5 minuets This is not professional or expectable at all , The room tray service was excellent tasty food

176157,Holiday Inn London West, Our keycard stopped working several times during our stay reception never answered promptly when called from the room Tried to use room service and the staff redirected my calling abruptly without letting me know what was happening and then room service itself never answered Furthermore why the need to be redirected in the first place when the number gave the impression I would be put straight through to room service The air conditioning in the room was not up to standard it was either too hot or too cold even when we adjusted it An extra bed was provided with the room but no extra blankets or bedding for it Overall very unsatisfactory hotel , The bathroom was nice 
176158,Holiday Inn London West, Took me forever to locate how to get into the hotel my sat Nav kept taking me past the front I couldn t find the entrance via car Took me an hour and a half , Spacios and comfy room

176176,Holiday Inn London West, I went to the restaurant for dinner and was ignored for 15 minutes before I decided to go out for dinner at a local pub The wifi was rubbish and when it says free Wi Fi on a sign outside it means free for only 30 minutes which for 118 for 1 night is not impressive Its not a very easy place to get to and not a very nice part of London but to be fair that s not the fault of the hotel The guy on check in was really abrupt and not at all welcoming Shower was OK but could have been a bit more powerful , Room was good and the bed was comfortable

176178,Holiday Inn London West, Whole host of things wrong with this place impossible to find entrance rude and impatient staff I have stayed at a lot of hotels this by the worst will never stay here again what really annoyed me was the fact it says free parking when in fact they charge you 10 a night without mentioning this at all I even asked when checking in yes sir our car park is complimentary to our guests when I was checking out and revising the bill I asked what s this charge for and they said car park even after showing them that they advertise that its free and a member of staff confirmed this the clerk just looked at me and said I don t know why it says that even after talking to the manager expecting this charge to be removed she was even more clueless they did offer me a free nights stay but I declined as mentioned before I will never stay at this hotel or any other holiday inn rip off merchants , It was close where I needed to go

176211,Holiday Inn London West, I think it d have been nice to have a free WiFi or some tv channels not just the options we had We felt that paying 10 for unlimited use isn t worth it since we stayed for only 1 night and would only use couple of hrs of that service Neither did we feel comfortable using your device , Friendly staff lovely hotel cozy room and a good location So far the best experience we had in London hotels we visited When we come back to London Holiday Inn West will be our first choice for sure

176232,Holiday Inn London West, We arrived early and left the car and our bags Upon returning for check in at about 8 00pm we were a little dismayed to see our bags sitting on a bench in a corner on the Customer side of reception not very secure at all , Location is a very individual thing for my wife and I it was perfect We travelled down from Lancashire and it s position right next to the A40 was brilliant We had matters to attend to in the immediate vacinity and also take in a West End show The walk to the tube took 4 or 5 minutes the tube direct to Oxford Circus took about twenty minutes perfect We stayed in an Executive room on the seventh floor where the views of the city and beyond were fantastic Although not used the gym also on this floor looked well equiped with modern facilities This looks like a relatively new hotel the room was reasonably generous in size and immaculately fitted out and maintained The bed was soft and very comfortable Heating cooling worked very well The staff were a delight nothing too much trouble although in fairness we asked very little of them but even that sometimes proves difficult for some organisations The car parking was secure and under and around the building reasonable extra cost for this All in all a great experience only spoiled by the three hours it took to do the 8 road miles to Clapham on the Sunday to pick up our dogs from our daughters The idiot who decided to close all the bridges over the Thames and provide absolutely no diversion information on the day needs sacking 
176233,Holiday Inn London West, I am a coeliac and the hotel staff refused to cater for me Staff took all of the towels out of the room and did not replace them until I went downstairs to reception One member of the reception staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful , The beds were comfortable

176244,Holiday Inn London West, Bed very uncomfortable making a squeaky noise each time we moved One out of our 3 rooms was double booked which forced our other family to crash on a sofa of a friend that stayed 30 minutes from the hotel We were Devastated with being separated and our week end being ruined Very arrogant management with no customer skills, to be compensated for the inconvenience rather than the dismissive response we got from the management that they were doing us a favour giving us a refund for the room they double booked
176245,Holiday Inn London West, Staff v poor waited over 30 mins for a drink at the bar 2 staff and 6 guests really during which time watched several meals get returned which were cold or not what was ordered so walked down the road, Clean comfortable rooms Average buffet breakfast overall very average

176247,Holiday Inn London West, I ve been staying here 2 nights every fortnight for approximately 18 months or so I m sorry to report but there has been issues on each and every time I have stayed ranging from broken beds TVs showers doors preordered breakfast not showing up 5 times in a row and making my BF work a 12 hour shift without any breakfast belly my list of grievances is endlist but to put the icing on the cake 3 weeks ago we went back to our room after it had been serviced for a kiss cuddle and afternoon nap despite I d have let him burn some energy off , The staff are on the majority over worked underpaid under appreciated but they are the only things that I can be complimentary over without then the hotel would resemble Faulty Towers 
176248,Holiday Inn London West, Skirting boards were thick of dust Our plug socket by the mirror was broken so couldn t use it Very loud in the corridors at 8am , Comfy and nice bed the rooms were spacious and good shower Good for price paid
176249,Holiday Inn London West, Messed up our breakfast payment and didn t collect our room service order Limited parking and lack of consistency of information between staff , Comfy bed executive room was really nice
176250,Holiday Inn London West, The location in terms of getting into the hotel was a little confusing as we didn t know we re we were going I also asked for something special to be done in the room for my best friends 21st but nothing was done, Really like the breakfast and the bar staff were good
176251,Holiday Inn London West, The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful We were originally placed in a room that was already taken and when we returned to reception were spoken to as if we were lying In our new room the wifi didn t work and I was told that it did and I should go to reception to have it sorted When paying for a service I don t expect to run up and down to reception when it is your mistake And finally the new room key card didn t work and I was again told to go to reception and sort it out The hotel itself was nice but the staff need to seriously sort their attitude and politeness out Extremely lazy approach to their jobs at the reception desk, The bed and bathroom in the executive suite
176252,Holiday Inn London West, We booked a meal for Fathers day Ordered food drinks at 2pm received drinks an hour later after constantly raising this with the staff and food shortly after that It felt that you may as well have ordered food by the bar as no member of staff seemed interested in serving us where we were sitting in the restaurant area The booking payment wasn t processed despite an e mail saying this had been done One staff member was quite rude to my girlfriend who had requested a new door swipe card , Convenience of location for Wembley Comfort Cleanliness good 
176253,Holiday Inn London West, Difficult to access the car park round the back as its off a dual carriageway and if you pass the turning which is before the hotel you have to go several mile to be able to turn to come back Needs a sign to say turn left for Holiday Inn car park , Close to North Acton tube station Everything excellent 
176254,Holiday Inn London West,No Negative, Lovely breakfast Don t agree with paying ten pounds for tv and Internet Iv not paid in other hotels Iv stayed at But apart from that it was a comfortable stay with very nice staff
176255,Holiday Inn London West, My only negative comment would be the area the hotel is in North acton is not the nicest place on earth a bit rough rundown area of London , Modern clean very nice hotel good value for money 
176256,Holiday Inn London West, The room we staying in was very tired The mattress was pants It was collapsed in the middle so we couldn t get comfortable The show thermostat control was broken so it was difficult to turn temperature down My wife burnt herself as it got too hot The wooden floor was so noisy Every footstep made them creek and you could hear everyone in the corridor , Location was good for concert in Wembley Breakfast was good too 
176257,Holiday Inn London West, Requested an early check in which wasn t given when we travelled 8 hours had to get changed in the bathroom The staff weren t good with English and hard to understand we paid 144 for one night which is also outrageous when we spent all of 7 hours sleeping which was interrupted by two fire alarms going off during the night Wouldn t recommed ,No Positive
176258,Holiday Inn London West, The travel time to Wembley Although advertised as only 3 miles from Wembley Stadium it will take at least an hour to travel via bus or tube We managed to share a taxi with other guests which cost 30 per car , Friendly and helpful staff loved the Starbucks cafe and comfortable quiet room 
176259,Holiday Inn London West, Bathroom toilet and shower drained very slowly Breakfast area was packed at 08 00 no free tables so didn t bother eating in the end which is a pity as the food looked good, Room was good size and the AC was quiet and effective Bed very comfortable and plenty of space to work on the desk Internet connection fast Parking OK
176260,Holiday Inn London West, No radio paying extra for the tv which i did not do and worst of all the door to the next room we could hear them walking about using the bathroom etc it was almost like having them in with us and they were not making any real noise they came back to their room at 11 30 and left in the morning at about 6 , Nice staff comfy bed good shower bathroom
176261,Holiday Inn London West, I didn t need the chambermaid knocking on my door TWICE to clean the room when I hadn t put out the sign for her to come in There was no do not disturb sign There was a street sign telling me to turn left for the car park when it should have sent turn right it referred to another Holiday Inn with the result I had to drive 15 minutes up the A40 before I could get back to the hotel And then the reception staff started making excuses as to why the sign has to say turn left when it means turn right I told her I didn t care I wasn t complaining so I could listen to her excuses and to the guy who joined in but so that other guests wouldn t have the same problem most people won t bother telling you they just won t come again , Accommodation fine
176262,Holiday Inn London West, The shower was broken mouldy as we were only there for one night and rushed had no time to report Breakfast was more expensive than advertised parking never stated we had to pay until check out Very overpriced for the location Added extras boosted the price up what we could of paid for in the Hilton I wouldn t recommend this hotel was a big disappointment considering I booked this hotel for my husbands birthday , The bed was comfortable
176263,Holiday Inn London West, The entrance was not as obvious as you might think when arriving on foot You have to negotiate car park barriers with overgrown bushes blocking the paths Would have hated it if we had lots of bags Check in was chaotic no sense of organisation or urgency very amateurish bit disappointing for a Holiday Inn , Hotel was very clean bright an ideal spot for the tube at North Acton 
176264,Holiday Inn London West, The shower room was a little strange in as much as anyone on the floor could see the occupant on the toilet or in the shower The most irritating point is the lack of parking An area was opened to accommodate a VIP whilst my husband and I had been waiting for nearly half an hour for a space we were told that we could park across the road but may incur a parking ticket Apparently there was a conference taking place at the hotel which tied up many of the spaces it really did cause us a great deal of inconvenience and did make us 45 minutes late for our concert Its proximity to transport networks also caused anxiety and having decided to hire a taxi was told that the charge would be 25 something which we had not budgeted for To return to the hotel we incurred further taxi costs On a lighter note we found the room both comfortable and clean it s just a pity that its location didn t fulfil our wishes , We found the room both comfortable and clean

176268,Holiday Inn London West, Did not like the fact that we booked well in advance to get the best price but that our room went down to 67 00 we paid 109 00 although after speaking to the member of staff on reception they did give us a room upgrade and half price breakfast The whole hotel and restaurant was extremely understaffed bearing in mind there was a Coldplay concert on and it was Father s Day so very busy which apparently they knew nothing about so lots of queuing and waiting around The menu quite clearly states items on there which are available 24 7 on return from the concert we wanted to order several pizzas which firstly we were told the chef had gone home early and then told begrudgingly that there was 1 available , Very clean meal in restaurant very nice bed comfortable and room quiet
176269,Holiday Inn London West, We could not fault anything , We arrived at approx 3 30 pm and need to leave again at 5pm for Wembley for Coldplay concert Checking in staff had a queue of like minded guests and we felt nothing was too much trouble They helped us by booking a taxi and called our room on its arrival My friend and I arrived by London Tube and the Holiday Inn was literally over a pedestrian crossing and five minutes to get to On return we could take tube to Oxford Circus and then on to the Victoria Line for the Victoria Coach Station quite easily Taxi to Wembley was 20 which we thought fair It was also much appreciated to find we could still get a hot coffee or a beer when we got back very late 
176270,Holiday Inn London West, very noisy hotel rooms not well insulated and guests arriving or leaving early hours could be clearly heard building works going on next to hotel too, meals were good
176271,Holiday Inn London West, Wooden floors are too creaky and you could hear people walking through the corridors Not made aware of building works outside of the room either which woke us up early Staff didn t seem to have urgency at reception and weren t very receptive when we checked in and out , Bed was comfy and location was ideal from the tube station Rooms had what we needed and were spacious

176279,Holiday Inn London West, Those in the group staying in the standard rooms were disappointed some with the facilities they offered and others with the suitability for the disabled guest There was also an obvious lack of staff with the ratio of the amount of guests they had Staff did their best but were run ragged , I was upgraded to an executive room which apart from seeing into other rooms was excellent

176281,Holiday Inn London West, Watch out for the tubes between acton and central as they was not running on the saturday we visited which meant we had to endure a long replacement bus service to get us to white city this meant a 5 minute journey turned into a 35 minute journey in traffic Also meant we had to pay for a taxi from white city as it seemed no buses were running anymore , Brilliant member of staff who cooked me and my boyfriend two frozen pizza s that were on offer at 4 99 each delicious btw even though the promo ended at 10 and this was about 2am due to the fire alarms going off we was woken up so this made it a little better
