404270,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, well just one LITTLE detail the wi fi had to be reconnected everyday as the free wi fi for guests is for just one day Rather have it for the whole stay small detail everything else is super , This property is an absolute delight The service is 7 star From the bell man to the reception to the exceptional concierge Everyone goes out of their way to help My husband forgot his phone in a cab on the way to the hotel and we didn t earlier bother to look at the taxi number The bell man and concierge were a great help called up all the taxi companies described the driver etc and managed to locate our phone 3 hours later The breakfast is super They serve champagne everyday made to order eggs and they would oblige special requests for kids food as well The beds r super comfy And BIG The housekeeping does a excellent job They even leave behind a sleep spray for your pillows at night I LOVE this property n would recommend it to anyone Even with kids it s great as it s hardly 10 mins walking from the Duomo and main shopping streets Cab s available right outside the hotel bell man would call one for us Super super super also they have a good gym pool sauna steam Noodle bars and kick boards for kids as well 
404271,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, This hotel is exceptional everything is 5 star or above Our room was very elegant beautiful room and marble bathroom were huge and a foyer with closet More like a suite View from roof top patio was lovely and spa and pool were on the top flooor as well only wished we would have had time to use them 
404272,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, Amazing hotel with very friendly and helpful staff Our room was upgraded to a Mosaic Room it was very comfortable and stylish We had a wonderful dinner at the restaurant Acanto and also a delicious breakfast the next morning There is a complimentary limo that takes you to the main shopping areas and Duomo We had a fantastic stay and would definitey stay again in the future 
404273,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The Terrace should be open throughout and not closed during day , We came back second time in 4 weeks Pasquale made is feel very good and looked after us nicely 
404274,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Breakfast comparatively restricted choice and very poor value Better bar next door , One of the best rooms ever Best bed ever Room made up twice a day Great concierge service Good reception 
404275,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Would like tea coffee making facilities in the room Breakfast was expensive Hotel car service finished early evening But being very picky , The staff were amazing especially the conseige They helped with advice on restaurants trips and travel The room was perfect and I loved the pool on the top floor so nice to have a swim first thing in the morning Lovely touch to have a special something in the room for our wedding anniversary Great to have a hotel car to take us into the cathedral area 
404276,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, There was an unusual smell in the hallways Maybe the carpet It smelled a little musty Irritated that the movies cost 20E, The room was very attractive and comfortable The bathroom was beautiful 
404277,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Nothing , General manager was very rud The breakfast was rerribe after what with ambulance we go to the hospital And General manager was just complainibg that was our fault never recomend this hotel 
404278,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, It was extremely expensive with nothing included apart from charming staff , Breakfast fabulous Bed extremely luxurious The staff were charming helpful and faultless 
404279,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, They upgrade us for suit but the price was the same price like if we booked anyway and the suit was not o big for the money we paid Food menu for room service is very very poor , Great place for breakfast good location Fantastic staff 
404280,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, Staff was truly exceptional Above and beyond for everyone we interacted with The free shuttle mercedes limo into the heart of the city was a nice touch 
404281,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, On the left of the hotel is a roof top bar Don t stay on this side of the hotel Music often goes on until 1am Its very noisy I moved rooms as i couldn t sleep , The staff are wonderful Ive been staying here for 15 years Room service breakfast is better than ordering hot food in the breakfast room Not sure why 
404282,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, The service and people are the best An example the bellboy knows and calls you by your name My bags were lost so I ask them to keep tracking them They did a great job localizing them In Paris 
404283,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Not many options for a healthy breakfast including gluten or lactose free options for people either intolerant or allergic to gluten and or lactose , Great green juices in the restaurant of the hotel Concierge recommendations for restaurants near by the hotel were very good The location of the hotel is very good being close to all commercial areas either you want to buy fashion clothes or furniture 
404284,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, We were with friends and booked the same category of rooms but our room was extremely small smaller than our friends had under the same price , Clean comfortable nice atmosphere the best towels I have ever had in hotels Ther are a lot of business and fashion people around Very good breakfast 
404285,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Absolutely nothing no hesitation in recommending this hotel , The quality of the service the facilities and the food were outstanding In our experience hotels just don t get any better 
404286,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, We enjoyed the helpful and friendly atmosphere in the hotel The staff were very helpful Our rooms were well appointed elegant and clean We also enjoyed the breakfasts which had a great selection 
404287,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Th only trouble was the air conditioning It was impossible to adjust Also the free wifi was too slow to download anything , The furnishings are quite beautiful and tasteful and the staff could not be more friendly and helpful
404288,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The place is not for honeymooners as the hotel team dont pamper you the way it should be as others hotels give you fresh roses each day in your rooms with complimentary chocolates and much more to make a honeymooners stay memorable but here this is lacking after thought the message was given at booking time that we are in our honeymoon , The concierge team was the best with the full knowledge in there work and to guide the best of Milan to guests
404289,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, The hotel actually replaced my missing caviar which I had put in the fridge for coolness and which I had forgotten there The caviar went missing probably taken by some maid and the hotel replaced it by going to the same shop where I bought it Eataly That was super nice Also they upgraded me to a superior room without me asking 4 night stay 
404290,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Having to leave , The service was over the top My upgraded room was gorgious The Spa was magnificent The cocktail area was so comfortable and the food I had there was lovely The wonderful free shuttle service to town was icing on the cake 
404291,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Nothing all was perfect, The ambiance The professionalism of the staff The bed The breakfast the scented smell across the hotel the bar Absolutely and highly recommend
404292,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The treatment in the spa was great but tea served in a paper cup with plastic lid and not having a resting area after the treatment were the downsides of it , This hotel is one of Dorchester Collection hotels It met all our expectations We would like to thank the hotel for offering a inter connecting room for our family Tip a massage treatment from Manuela in the spa is highly recommended 
404293,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Nothing, Nice interior big bathroom clean room Friendly stuff good location and complementary transportation to the city center Metro station 1 minute walking from the hotel 
404294,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, Everything was perfect and then some They surprised me three times for my birthday with champagne and birthday cake and were spectacular in every way All of the staff were above and beyond and the hotel was perfect Will definitely be staying here again 
404295,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The pillows were too soft , Breakfast was outstanding in hot and cold choices with the most delicious marmalade filled croissants The other highlight was the Principe bar Old luxe yet modern decor is exquisite Fabulous cocktail menu to match Best bathroom fitout with products par excellence Loved the complimentary private car service into the city 
404296,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, It takes a lot to find anything worth suggesting to be in need of improvement with this hotel Perhaps the improved WiFi service should be included given the already high cost of accommodation but the free WiFi isn t bad , The level of service in the Principe de Savoia is second to none The staff are courteous attentive and efficient while remaining unobtrusive Everyone is polite and helpful When something is required it is provided without any fuss Nothing is too much trouble 
404297,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Bed was very hard so I found this a bit uncomfortable Loud aircon heater even when switched off, Overall it was great I would recommend to anyone else to stay here
404298,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, getting old some rooms vahe been renovated but not the rooms you get at deal price POOR breakfast not at all up to the standards of other hotels of the group like Plaza Athenee in Paris or Richemond in Geneva , the overall value for money
404299,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Some changes at breakfast area is not welcoming that was your strongest side and now the tables location and food not the same If you keep going this direction we have to find the other place Please stay as you was for years that was your quality , It s still our favorite hotel in Milan
404300,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Bottled water 9 euros, This hotel is in a great location The staff are very friendly and super efficient The breakfast has to be the very best The choice is amazing and the quality exceptional The pastries fresh juices great yoghourt Italian hams and and cold meats of the very highest standard added to which was crispy pancetta creamy scrambled eggs and mushrooms The best way to start the day 
404301,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, We booked an Ambassadors suite Although the frontal part of the building is old original a large part is newly build Our room was in the newly build part The suite only had 2 small windows so was very dark The decoration of the room was al wood so this made it extra narrow and dark and small They tried to make the room look original but it was a failed attempt , The breakfast was very good The staff very friendly 
404302,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, Beautifully appointed hotel with highly professional helpful and friendly staff It was my first stay here and only for 1 night but nearly all the staff I encountered addressed me by my name Superb and atmospheric bar where you are constantly supplied with delicious nibbles Top breakfast but many of the cooked options are offered la carte 
404303,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, As a young couple felt we may not have been treated as well as some older clientele We were told that a bottle of Complimentary champagne would be sent to our room to celebrate our honeymoon this never arrived We were asked if we would like a daily newspaper which also never arrived Slightly disappointing for a hotel of such standards , Beautiful building comfortable and quiet rooms Large bathroom Excellent breakfast Great limousine transfer into town 
404304,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, The staff paid attention to every detail and the property was beautiful spotless and the staff was very friendly and attentive Lovely place Great location Great for business or leisure travel 
404305,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Whilst complimentary transport is offered to the centre it was a little too far to walk to for me , The quality of complimentary toiletries bottled water and fruit in the room were a lovely added bonus The decor etc around the hotel is luxurious and made our choice of hotel and stay extra special 
404306,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Everything was just amazing, Great breakfast considerate caring and friendly staff convenient location just a little bit aside from the city buzz limousine service to get to the city center wonderful top floor pool and spa with terrace view to the city etc The Hotel where you feel good old traditions luxury in combination with the touch of Italian chic style 
404307,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Cannot really think of anything , Wow this hotel is amazing Cannot sum up all the good ones in a review but for me the most important things are location staff rooms food It has them all in a splendid combination So one word for the hotel bravo We will be back soon 
404308,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, many mistakes on the bell Also they charged me for breakfast several times and it was included it took long time to fix they apologies and gave me discount , every thing
404309,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, Amazing hotel delivering customer delight to our 14 person family group Met or exceeded every expectation Amazing attention to detail in everything 
404310,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, Great and very attentive staff in this large Hotel When we arrived as a party of 2 instead of 1 they upgraded our room instantly without us asking and for no extra fee They were extremely accommodating Anything we needed was delivered to our door in minutes Beautiful lobby and rooms are great and roomy the bathrooms have heated towels Highly recommend to stay here Stayed September 2016
404311,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Room No 119 on first floor was noisy during the night , Very nice hotel If I ever get back to Milano I choose this hotel to stay in it but only the front rooms that the view is to the garden 
404312,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, For 350 euros there was no king size bed as advertised anywher in the he hotel It specifically claims to be at the main station you t is NOT It s a very long drag of your case or 10 euros in a cab away, It was very up market and there was a pool
404313,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The bed was unbelievably hard and uncomfortable which was a great shame considering everything else was so good Mini bar and breakfast very expensive but I suppose that goes with the terrain , The room was spacious and comfortable and sumptuously decorated All the staff were very attentive The hotel retains all the grandeur of the original grand hotel but with all the modern facilities you d expect 
404314,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Horrible room Holiday inn has better beds you can feel the mattress bars under you The sheets and linens are seedy Shower curtain in a room that s 1000 a night The shower floods the entire bathroom The closet fits 5 shirts For the money it s actually a joke ,No Positive
404315,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The bar area was closed due to refurbishment which meant space was limited and sitting in the foyer isn t quite as nice , Breakfast was very good with a nice selection on the buffet Attentive staff Hotel is beautiful with lots of character Very convenient for the Metro system 
404316,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Cocktail bar was closed Double bed was made up of 2 mattresses Not clever for a 5 star hotel , Staff are very professional and very welcoming and friendly Made our anniversary stay extra special Great location
404317,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, it does take a long time for the car to be brought out from the car park Waited 15 minutes , Breakfast is amazing Grapefruit juice best in the world
404318,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Nothing, As always perfection and a special mention for your breakfast room staff I had a fantastic massage with Elizabetta would highly recommend her 
404319,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The concierge change everyday the carpet in the room did not seem clean enough The air conditioning was leaking through the false ceiling I have stayed at better hotels , It is a five star hotel They have a limo service to 3 key locations in the city The cleaning was excellent 
404320,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The charm of this hotel is in its old and classic style but still it needs renovation as it is smeling bad in the corridors and rooms, Staff are very friendly and helpful cleanliness is very high housekeeping service is too fast 
404321,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The room was similar to the photos but a mini version they must have used trick photography We stayed in an ambassador suite which is very expensive but the room is pokey and grim Oversized furniture made it impossible to move around comfortably The room was dark and felt old It was like being in a bunker extremely Claustrophobic Everything is old and outdated Baby cot and high chair where old and had it No coffee machine in room I usually expect an espresso machine in a 5 star suite Pool was sad and had no atmosphere Feels like being in a garage Nothing is included in the price parking breakfast nothing We paid 700 euro and had to add breakfast and parking Really was expecting much much more We usually stay at palazzo parigi which is 100 times better We tried this hotel for a change really wish we hadn t Is really disappointing , Location bell boys and concierge Very quick to get car and arrange luggage Staff in general were all very kind and helpful 
404322,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Room service was extremely slow and very expensive , Staff was extremely helpful especially doormen as we arrived at midnight with 2 bike bags 3 suitcases and a bunch of other bits Also the free shuttle to duomo was so practical 
404323,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, We only had a short stay at the start of our holiday but Savoia provided a perfect start after a long trip from Australia Starting with an early check in and finishing with a great buffet breakfast the next morning Savoia set the benchmark for a great Italian holiday 
404324,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The restaurant is fine for breakfast and a snack but not for dinner, Staff rooms breakfast are all excellent When busy bar is great fun Staff make the place welcoming 
404325,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, This hotel has lost the charm of the Dorchester s Collection Hotels Please fire the Hotel General Manager, The driver of the Courtesy Car and the Concierge Mr Giovanni the rest of the staff should have a crash course in politeness 
404326,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Wifi is really slow You get much better speed at other hotels Breakfast is pricey for what is offered , Good location Nice rooms Excellent service Great Value 
404327,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Nothing, Staff went out of its way to make everything perfect and it was a true value rooms are excellent best restaurant in area with organic a glutant free meals 
404328,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The Milan taxi drivers called a wildcat strike which threw our travel plans into disarray The concierge gave us a quick lesson on using the Milan Metro and we made our appointments , The hotel is located within walking distance of the main railway station It is a stately older hotel that offers very comfortable facilities The rooms are very delightful and furnished with very elegant inlaid furniture The hotel provides a regular limo service to Montenapolene and the Duomo areas
404329,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, My Room was originally booked and paid for in advance as a double on the hotel s own website but when my partner was unable to travel with me at the last moment no refund was allowed for single occupancy This would have meant a saving of approx 60 on the three night stay , Very efficient concierge service They may not have been able to secure a reservation in the restaurant I requested but they did organise a car driver for a full day during a city wide taxi strike Excellent bar as well Charming friendly service and lethal vodka martinis 
404330,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, This is an excellent hotel Excellent service food attention I have stayed here in the past and loved it However this time the bed was the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in which I thought appalling in this 5 hotel 
404331,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The concierge thought he was the be all and end all of local knowledge but in fact totally missed our idea of what we wanted for dinner , Felt like a little oasis of paradise
404332,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, The atmosphere the decor was very nice it s a bit outside the shopping district but this could be an advantage if you want a quite place after a busy day in the center There is only one restaurant in the hotel and the food choices are very limited The room service menu is good and breakfast is nice too 
404333,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, There is nothing to dislike whenever I have to visit Milan it is this hotel that pull my leg to do it , Every thing at this hotel is perfect whether it was the highly experienced and motivated staff the food the cleanliness the high end toiletries in the bathrooms to all aspects 
404334,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Wi fi was was weak and not stable , It is the best hotel I have visited in my life from all perspectives It also has a free limousine that goes to centre of Milan every 20 minutes 
404335,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, When the water cannot flow down the sink and fills up your sink you can describe it in one word scandalous When wifi is poorly performing it s in one word scandalous When the TV screen is not functioning and you need it to be replaced it s one word scandalous, Staff extremely helpful and welcoming
404336,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Nothing , The service was incredible and the room in which we stayed was beautiful We will definitely be going back to Milan and will be staying at the savoia again Would recommend to anyone 
404337,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Nothing, The hotel is really beautiful and luxurious I liked the location it s really calm and in a modern center area The cleanness of the rooms is really good and I liked everything about the room it s really comfortable 
404338,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Breakfast was a little lacklustre in comparison to other 5 establishments we ve visited For me not really worth the 45 person In general food drink was expensive perhaps the lack of other options in the neighbourhood allows higher prices , Food in Acanto was very good Spa services excellent rooms stylishly decorated There was in general very little wear and tear visible everything seems to be kept in good shape Service all around was very friendly and competent which is a huge plus for a big hotel The limo service is essential as the location of the hotel is not the best possible 
404339,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Couldn t take breakfast outside and the indoor breakfast room feels small and stuffy, Very good fitness facilties for a hotel very friendly staff everywhere
404340,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Sometimes the reception staff are not flexible , I like this hotel This is the fifth time I visit And would go back to it every time I visit Milano With no hesitation 
404341,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The prices of items in the mini bar were ridiculous 8 00 euro for a small bottle of water that costs 30 at the store Also the price of breakfast coffee for 6 00 or was it 8 00 euro I had delicious caffe macchiato AND a delicious croissant in Brera for a total of 2 00 euro These kinds of rip offs are what turn me off certain hotels I guess if you are on an expense account you don t care but I do Many luxury hotels are now offering these things included in the price I think that is the way forward The wifi was painfully slow also These two points were annoying but did not hamper my enjoyment of the hotel , Loved the room it was huge The bathroom as well Loved the swimming pool and having a spa with treatments available Really loved the gorgeous Bentley they use as a shuttle very convenient service and the driver was very nice The concierges were helpful I loved the overall grand old style of the hotel Dinner at Acanto was really delicious and beautifully presented The waitstaff at breakfast were all very kind Overall I really enjoyed my stay here 
404342,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Price is higher than the value Too far if you went for the 1 2 days shopping But perfect foe stay few days , Breakfast is much better than in other Italian hotels Room is big and bad is soft Bathroom is very well organized 
404343,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Matrass hard as a rock Very cold in bathroom Windows not well isolated All in all the typical markings of an old but renovated building , Excellent staff great service rooms with exquisite design
404344,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, None, Allways a exceptionnal stay it s really the place to be Perfect wellcome location and decoration in one word the palace in Milano Special mention for the Bar Andrea and his team let you feel like at home during a party The bar is a good place for dinner more relax and unconventionnal than the restaurant
404345,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, wifi is not strong enough didn t provide complimentary drinking water at first night, Staff are very helpful Bathroom is very spacious with strong shower Shuttle service provided
404346,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, I liked every aspect of this hotel , Excellent service from all the staff The hotel d cor is very impressive and the rooms are extremely well appointed The location is very central and it is an easy walk to the centre and il Duomo Concierge team are particularly helpful Drinking Prosecco in the cocktail bar is a wonderful experience 
404347,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, If your room is located at the back side of the hotel you will not feel comfortable as there is a tram stop at that side from 7am until 12am So ask for front side room, The staff are fantastic especially Marco Capello the customer relationship manager 
404348,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The coffee lounge is far too small for a hotel of this size We had guests arrive and we had to entertain them in our room because the lounge was full and the bar area doesn t open until 6pm Not an ideal situation , We have stayed at this hotel many times and plan to return as the staff are always very helpful attentive and willing to assist with any of our requests The limousine transfer to La Scala and the Galleria is so convenient If the limousine is full when you need it the hotel will reimburse the taxi fare if you produce a receipt 
404349,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, The parking cost 45 euro for 1 day is very high, The location the concierge is the best they are so helpful i recommend this hotel the wifi is very high speed incredible restaurant thanks for all the people there grasias
404350,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Drinks at the bar very pricey The cooked breakfast was not acceptable never mind for a 5 star On its own the breakfast is charged at 45 the food we got both mornings didn t justify that price , Staff were very warm and friendly Hotel beautiful pool and steam room etc lovely to have While the location isn t excatly central but a nice 15 min walk to a nice district and the hotel does a free shuttle to the main area 
404351,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Wi fi was poor kept dropping out Some noisy repair work outside my room for a whole day prevented me from working in the room , Pool Gym facilities were excellent and underused by others 
404352,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, Everything including the nice upgrade The Hotel has been revamped and what a surprise Love every second of it including in room dining which was excellent
404353,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Breakfast was ordinary what you can find at 3 star hotels yet extraordinarily priced 45 Euro pp Wasn t reminded that breakfast wasn t included or what the price was and was an unpleasant surprise at check out Up until the breakfast and check out the experience was very enjoyable , Staff was very helpful professional and customer focused from check in to spa services to concierge and luggage storage Overall worth the extra money to try a luxury hotel experience on last night in Milan as a treat 
404354,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Dinner food stylish but a bit bluffing considering price Advice on restaurants outside hotel seemed to be limited to some preferred partners , Style and staff just great Excellent breakfas ans servicet 
404355,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, The ambiance of this great hotel The friendliness of ALL the staff No noise from adjacent rooms or from other floors Excellent wine list Very alert security 
404356,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, On my floor the guests in the room next to mine during three days placed outside their door huge amount of discarded shopping bags boxes and food leftovers which remained there until the early morning and was unpleasant , Truly exceptional service The staff were very courteous and attentive I really enjoyed staying at this hotel and the quality of services provided 
404357,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, Lack of sockets I was obliged to unplug light fittings to charge my phone and my computer Even doing this there were only Italian sockets A hotel at this level catering to business travelers should have multiple sockets including some for US and North European plugs , Comfortable and spacious room 
404358,Hotel Principe Di Savoia, We couldn t stay longer , The staff was excellent from the concierge to the Lounge staff to the doorman Seamless perfection and wonderful professionalism 
404359,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, The moment we walked through the door to the second we left the staff were so attentive Even when we were dropped off in the centre by the limousine driver he stopped got out the car reach into the passenger side and gave us both a bottle of water We got engaged whilst here and the waiters at the hotel offered us a free glass of champagne which was extremely unexpected They were all perfectly kind and respectful 
404360,Hotel Principe Di Savoia,No Negative, Beautiful hotel great staff very good food in the hotel restaurant Everything was perfect The concierge was helpful in trying to retrieve our luggage which arrived a day late from JFK
