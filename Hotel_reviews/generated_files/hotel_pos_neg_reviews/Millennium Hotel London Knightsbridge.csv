69559,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Being charged 46 for a local telephone call I was having problems with my mobile phone and needed to get onto an important conference call I couldn t believe it when they had that on the bill These price gouging practices are long over in any hotel that really values their customers experience They offered 10 discount so I asked is see the manager and was told I was speaking to the Duty manager which explained everything He just didn t get it Well he will get this I was just starting to travel to London on a regular basis for business and was looking for a hotel I could stay at regularly I had decided that the Millennium hotel would be that hotel NOT anymore Hope the 46 was worth it as you lost a lot more than that for not putting the customer first and being so stubbornly bound by your out of date policies , The best thing about the hotel is the location especially if you love shopping located on Sloane st in between Harrods and Harvey Nicks everything else is reasonable Rooms are nice and clean however dated the full Breakfast is average however their express breakfast on the lobby level is great value at 6

69562,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Disappointing not to all be all placed on the same floor when three rooms booked under one reservation and having made a previous email request that was acknowledged Not sure why you would book three rooms then position everyone on separate floors Reception failed to tell us about the Club facilities we d already paid for at checkin We had breakfast included in our reservation but no mention at booking that it was only continental and not full additional 5 95 per person which is mis leading Times of Club facilities are ambiguous and therefore very little food and drink left when we arrived at 19 30 because we d been given incorrect times The Club staff did make an exception and brought us another bottle of prosecco there were 5 of us however this didn t happen willingly and was the club concierge was clearly less than happy A little disappointing , Overalll a good hotel fab location and very friendly efficient reception staff Beds very comfortable our three rooms were small but well equipped Disappointing not to all be all placed on the same floor having made a previous request and the booking was all made as a combined one Not sure why you would book three rooms then position everyone on separate floors

69567,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Poor customer service from staff at check in and also in the restaurant The hotel is extremely noisy at night time Very loud traffic noise and deliberate car engine revving into the early hours of the morning , Very close to public transport Very close to high end shopping like Harrods and Harvey Nichols 
69568,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The size of the room and specially the closet Hardly any hanging space Unbelievable that a hotel of that level or Price should have that type of closet space Furthermore the w ter closet did not work too well , The personnel All very attentive and efficient Breakfast and lunch space very agreable 
69569,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Issue with quality of breakfast that was resolved satisfactorily by management Some parts of room showing a little wear and tear , Staff very good as was location
69570,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, A very pleasant stay until we checked out and were charged 45 pounds for breakfast which was listed as 12 pounds per person on our booking confirmation and by the reception staff on arrival They said it was our fault for not ticking the box when booking to pre order breakfast No such box existed in our booking process nor was there anything in the fine print The staff then blamed us and booking com for the misleading information which they were well aware of and they were arrogant uncompromising and unpleasant The breakfast was ordinary with no orange juice it had run out and no one cared and we had to ask three times to get our tea and coffee A sour end to an otherwise good experience We will not be returning to this place , Location nice room

69583,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The hotel was clearly very busy and booked up when we arrived The first room given was by the lift and made a lot of noise The second room had an interconnecting door The final room looked great room 402 but as it turns out the cleaners room was right next door and they were in and out throughout the night 2am 3am etc with the door banging we had a terrible night of little sleep as a result Everything else was fine just noisy cleaners and no sleep so left feeling like we needed a break in a different hotel ,No Positive
69584,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Every things is ok except the A C it is only warm , Breakfast is very nice and they have best coffee I have ever seen Location Stuff Room service Kind people
69585,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, When the hotel says BF is included in the room rate this is quite misleading this is for continental BF at the Club Room only NOT for full BF they should be more clear and straight forward The bathroom is small but providing good toiletries Hotel staffers are always smiling and talking niceties but when asked for assistance they are slow to react concierge are ignorant At arrival I returned an Avis Prestige MB SE rental car at the concierge according to instruction nothing is done the car stayed on the curb for a few hours and I had to come back a couple times to ask concierge to call AP to pick up the car once done he never bother to inform us I had to reconfirm with AP to make sure they got the car back And after 4 nights when leaving in early morning we ask for a Taxi Van to LHR it took concierge a different person 1 2 hr to call a regular taxi to come to hotel which could not accommodate our luggages and 3pax while all these taxi vans are passing by in front of hotel so we had to go out on the street in the rain to wave for Taxi van by ourselves , Reasonably close to Harrods Harvey Nichol and brand name shops the club double room is small but comfortable enough for a London hotel Short walking to Knightbridge Station Checking in is fast and efficient Feeling welcomed Overall I give a B grade 
69586,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The room was tiny too expensive for the rate given They made double hold on my credit card for the full 5days stay which consumed my limit A lot of discussions with them and the bank where I checked out and still in contact with them to release the amount Anyways the location is good on Sloan street and near harrods and Harvey Some of the staff were helpful too, Being on Sloan street

69588,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, My Card was basically charged almost 240 of what I was initially supposed to pay They basically charged my card twice and told me they are sorry and there is nothing they can do about it I would just have to wait for the bank to release one of the payments I ended up not having money on me the last 2 days of the trip Thank you for ruining my vacation ,No Positive
69589,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Bed was v small double room v small right next to lift shaft Loud music next door at 4am Outside Knightsbridge is full of the rich boy racers hitting the streets in b loud cars all night Seriously don t go to this hotel if you want any sleep whatsoever My wife had a discussion with the manager in he morning and she never complains about anything She was offered an upgrade next time I really don t think it would make any difference to quality of he stay I stay in a lot of hotels in London over a long period of time I think this has to the worst experience in terms of sleep quality ,No Positive

69593,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, For Knightsbridge hotel and for a Millenium hotel I ve stayed in millenniums in New York and other places around the UK it was a little outdated in the room The chairs desk bathroom the hallway decor and the carpets throughout , The staff were excellent from the reception team welcoming you and helping you to the concierge team and cleaners all saying good morning and giving you information when they are obviously busy 
69594,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Noise you can hear everything in the street or the room next to yours slow elevators complemintory drinking water only for first arrival day conjusted tiny room and toilet even for superior rooms old furniture and carpet smelly rooms room service is it that tasty or great and not advisable expensive for whatever you get Small double beds they are queen size actually , The location 3 minutes from harrads and smiley staff
69595,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The hotel needs badly a renovation The carpets in the corridors are worn out the furniture and the woodwork is old and needs a refreshment It s a pitty in this location with all the amenities offered and with such a great personnel to have such an image Still the value for money is great , The hotel is a real bargain considering the location It has all the facilities you can ask and the personnel is great

69602,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, It doesn t give a 4 star feeling The place is cheap looking and could use a renovation You can hear it when people come and leave The bathroom has no lock and the door is cheap It s so small too One of our rooms didn t lock properly and you had to really make sure it clicked or else it wouldn t lock The room is super small They call it a twin but the two beds are right by each other as if it s one bed There s no room between the beds Even movement is hard when there s two people in the room because of the tights space between the tv area and the foot of the two beds I don t think I d ever stay there if it weren t for the location and for it being cheaper than Park Tower I hate staying there to be honest it s uncomfortable But I stayed there before and if they continue having better prices I might stay again , Staff were friendly and polite Location close to shopping and some great restaurants 
69603,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The style is kind a unspectacular and would profit from a clear modern update Especially the Lobby is energetically very unclear , The location is perfect Knightsbridge also in the evening lots of Bars Restaurants Pubs in close walking distance We booked 12 hrs before coming and got a low rate what was great

69608,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Walls are quite thin so you can hear what is happening around your room which is not very convenient Shower was a particular problem it was either super hot or cold and it was very difficult to regulate the temperature in the middle , Perfect location staff at the reception was very polite and helpful 
69609,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Only fault was the quilt on the bed could have been bigger as I felt it was a lot smaller than a double , Location was fantastic Staff so helpful and my room was ready early so I could check in 2 hours early Great hotel in a truly great place Right in the heart of Kensington We used it as a base to explore London Museums harrods Hyde park and the fabulous sightseeing hop on hop off bus stops within minutes walking Complimentary water in the room also on arrival

69615,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The restaurant service was a disgrace On the 1st evening we waited so long for our meal that we ended up eating separately as half the table did not have their meals On the next day for breakfast we asked for boiled eggs and they had never been cooked 2 raw eggs served Utter disgrace , The location is great
69616,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Breakfast is good but not great eg coffee is not very good and when specifically requested a cappuccino is possible , The location reception and view are great 
69617,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, rooms not clean up to the name of hotel breakfast very poor no variety for Muslims no siting area like a nice lobby only small space in the lobby for maximum 4 guests room service policies very poor had to pay for empty plates and forks, location reception lady Polina very helpful and cooperative in everything
69618,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, I was feeling a bit hot so I switched on the AC but instead of cool air coming through I got hot air at all AC settings Strange The wi fi didn t work on my iPhone or my wife s iPhone either I stayed only for one night so didn t bother speaking to anyone about it but it might have been nice if it worked straight out of the bag , The room was very well appointed I was in a club double room and had a Nespresso machine and a lovely entertainment system

69621,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Very minor I like a hand held shower which my room didn t have Towels could have bee fluffier , The English breakfast tea tasted like home my no 1 requirement Mushrooms tasted like they used to when I was a child Choices of everything were wonderful

69633,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Due to the location and price of the room I paid I expected more from the comfort facilities and over all appearance of the room I had higher expectations and have higher standards The price is mainly for location , The staff were very polite helpful and kind They were well presented and spoke good English 
69634,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, My room was noisy so hot dirty windows and bathroom the overall stay was a nightmare the location was fantastic they tryed to charge me 40 pound a night on my car when it was two bank holiday so u can park for free overall the hotel ruined my Christmas, Nothing

69637,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The hotel looks rather run down Rooms in particular are old some of the lights eg do not work Also lack of cleaning staff eg when we came back after our day s outing at about 5 pm our room wasn t even cleaned up yet We realised this is probably the only hotel that doesn t do evening prep up of the room with a couple of night lights on bed prepped up for sleep in also NO provision of any complimentary water Throughout my 2 periods of stay in this period none of my room was prepped up for sleep in ie I entered a dark room If some of this software can be improved I am sure we will be repeat customers Thank you for hearing us Merry X mas , The location hence my booking of this hotel Staff are friendly Meal discounts at in house restaurants are great ideas to encourage residents to dine in as long as restaurant can whip up decently good variety of food 
69638,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Queen size bed I paid for was two twins pushed together with no bed topper making it impossible to actually benefit from having a large bed Not worth the price,No Positive
69639,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The Restaurant LE CHINOIS was expensive and the wine white yes white or red was served at the room temp rature 23c There is a need of a serious training How to serve wine or stop to propose it to customers , Location little too expensive for the quality of the room 
69640,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The room I visited the property with my husband and we couldnt sleep well the bed was too small you can barely say it is not a single bed The rooms need renovation Also curtain in the bathrooms is unexceptable for a 4 star hotel in knightsbridge , The location 
69641,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The rooms were extremely smal for two people Bathroom unconfortably small The breakfast room and food availability was poorly managed empty dishes not immediately filled staff not helpful, Front desk clerk was nice location was perfect

69747,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The narrowness of the room I would kindly suggest if the make it slightly bigger Other than that everything was remarkable , The staffs were absolutely friendly and wonderfully hospitable The location is suitably convenient to all of hot spots of London Therefore it was worthwhile staying in Millennium Knightsbridge

69753,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Our suite needs a refurb desperately Also the club lounge compared to others is rather dismal even though the refreshments welcome, Position excellent and staff good
69754,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The noise the lack of facilities small rooms and instructions on working the room lights are not clear The noise by residents and from outside is just totally unacceptable Allowing families with screaming children to run about the floors until late at night and putting families with newborns amongst other hotel users is just inconsiderate and rude And worst of all is they served Halal food Heinous , Food was lovely although portion sizes small Staff pleasant

69759,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The hallways were dark hot and smelt unclean Rooms were dated and small Website says they have air conditioning but after three room changes they did not Hot air blowing in a small stuffy room was unpleasant Restaurant served mostly Luke warm overcooked reheated food , The location was excellent Staff were pleasant 
69760,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, First we got a very small and outdated room than upgrated for a bigger room and that made our stay a lot more pleasant The room service food before 10 30pm is good after that the food is terrible , Location is best for shopping
69761,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, I paid the whole bill in cash early and therefore my card was disconnected from my account I was told that my terms included breakfast in 1st floor When the dining room staff checked my account they couldn t access it so a reception manager had to come up to sort that out It was all resolved very professionally once he took over JHH, Very good location for public transport in the west end My contact with you is through the Sir James Reckitt Charity where I have been a Trustee for several years 
69762,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The Club lounge breakfast was good although there wasn t much left I guess we needed to get there early , Being met when we returned from Hyde Park after our morning run with freshly squeezed orange juice and towels by the concierge it s the little things They made a real effort to make our anniversary special 
69763,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Bathroom was a bit tired and a bit cramped but we didn t spend much time there anyway Bed was a too soft from what we are used to , Staff very friendly and attentive Location ideal 
69764,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Why have they not refurbished their rooms I personally know that this hotel is fully booked most of the year and its location is AMAZING i dont see why dont they start refurnishing the rooms at least part by part The bathroom is in need for an upgrade, I likee the staff at the front desk were very kind and welcoming I stayed at the club room which was spacious enough for me 
69765,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, On booking com I was given an option for a smoking room as my partner smokes I thought this would be great as he can relax without having to go outside the hotel to smoke his cigarettes However when we got to the hotel the staff advised us that there was a non smoking policy attached to the hotel although there was a balcony rooms for smokers They told us we would have to pay extra for these rooms but didn t think this was right as the website implied the room I had booked would be fine for my partner to smoke in I would not have booked this hotel at all if I knew that we were not going to be allowed what was requested in our booking All the staff were not very helpful and had very bad attitudes , Wasn t too far away from harrods and a great restaurant called caraffini
69766,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Bed was too small for an average sized couple the room smells really old and dusty no isolation whatsoever on the windows street noise is directly in the room even if the room was facing other way and was on the 10th floor The wind and rain made huge noise , Location is superb
69767,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, In a room next to the lift disturbed by noises from the lift shaft and by noisy guests returning after a drunken night out , Bar is nice and relaxing and breakfast has a wide choice of foods 
69768,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, I was discriminated against and treated shabbily by the receptionist even after I upgraded to a suite with a balcony for smoking even after I specified I wanted a smoking room I payed extra 80 to upgrade and an extra 210 for the second night One of the receptionists was very hostile and driscriminative towards me he called the police to harass me and evict me from my suite I payed a total of 443 for And wrongly accused me of being a drug dealer Because every black man who can afford the finer things in life Is a drug dealer This is core racism , Nothing

69773,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The room was cold and the water luke warm The mini bar was not stocked although we don t drink , Everything was excellent and staff helpful The room was spacious and comfortable The breakfast had a good selection of fruit cereal and pastries 
69774,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The parking should have been valet parking if they are charging 40 pounds per night 5 pounds for a 300 ml tin can of coke from mini bar is ridiculous expense in this hotel , I have to agree The location is fantastic but there are other hotels in same location that I d check next time to see my experience I won t stay in this hotel again due to the unfair price 
69775,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Didn t sleep at all because of the Ferraris and other cars revving up their engines most of the night and early hours of the morning Terrible although the room would have been lovely apart from that Complained to staff and they said that they have informed the police to help with this situation , The Staff were excellent helpful and friendly and genuine in their helpfulness first class 
69776,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Bathroom little dated Twin room requested but on arrival double allocated but resolved later On arrival only two staff on reception at a time when majority of residents booking out, Bed very comfortable and cleanliness excellent
69777,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The room corridor of the hotel did not have central heating or they had a problem because the room was very cold we asked the receptionist they installed a small heater which plugs in which I thought was very poor especially the standard price of the room The breakfast is terrible please please do not purchase there breakfast because its shocking cold horrible very disappointed we both were , Nothing about the hotel just that it is local in town area 
69778,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Room was to hot while at booking com it shows that there is an A C I called the reception asking them ether to fix the A C or change the room they said in winter the A C dose not work open the window I said the window is sealed it is not possible to open it he said yes you can I said no he said yes I said okay send some one to open it after that they find out that I m right the window is sealed the things is I don t know why they don t believe me while checking out I said to them my stay wasn t good I couldn t sleep last night they said the hotel management will call you unfortunately till know nothing , Location and prices

69780,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The lift noise aweful Room 1008 and all rooms with 008 are next to a noisy lift that grates Worth asking specifically when you book where your room is Receptionist were not as slick as they could be , Location is very good close to Knightsbridge Tube 3 mins walks

69782,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Found it difficult to get anything to eat in Tangerine Cafe on the one visit we made Plus the menu was very different to the menu in the bedroom , The breakfast was good
69783,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, 1 The air conditioning in the bedroom was regrettably inefficient with it seeming impossible to cool the room down 2 Having a shower curtain over the bath is awful as it wraps itself around you when showering In this day and age a glass screen would be expected or preferably just a good walk in shower rather than a bath Baths use far more water and older people struggle to climb in and out this cannot be safe 3 When there is a function above the breakfast room the staff are stretched and are not available to re fill the food trays or drinks containers 4 Unfortunately the bedroom carpet and decor in the bedroom lobby rm 705 was very worn I think a refit is due 5 Having paid for my room prior to arrival I found it unnecessary for the receptionist to insist on taking my card details again when I wished to pay for any incidentals with cash which I did anyway This came across as very distrusting especially when the receptionist asked if my card would cover the payment for the room and the payment had left my account weeks before 6 We asked for a double bed and were offered either a queen bed or two singles made up as a king size We chose the later hoping it would be bigger but discovered the beds were made up separately and just pushed together , The hotel has a good contemporary feel is very clean the staff are friendly for a London hotel and we found it well situated for our needs 
69784,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Including breakfast in offer could have made my stay more pleasant The food quality was rather poor though I once tried a soup Some of the sinks need renewal , The friendly reception and the spontaneous response to guests concerns are definitely the strongest points in favor of the Millennium Hotel Knightsbridge 
69785,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, I stayed in room 505 never stay there as the AC units or the kitchen extractor are placed outside the window of this room and you won t sleep a wink just like I didn t , Staff were very friendly and the location was 2nd to none 
69786,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Most of stuff are nice and friendly However in the check in counter there s a young lady with blonde pony tail has always been very unhelpful impatient and unfriendly when doing check in and other things This could be very disappointing because we have been stayed there many times and she has always been like that The rest of stuff are lovely Rooms are relatively small Facility is okayish , Great Location Delicious restaurant
69787,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, We couldn t enter our room 95 of the time as problems with the door lock The room wasn t very clean in terms of dirty Windows and hair clips and nail clipping on the floor When we left for the day our room was meant to be cleaned and amenities refilled but only the towels and shower gels were replaced , The staff were very attendant and charming seemed very happy to help us Breakfast room service was lovely Pancakes and waffles were incredibley tasty We liked the fact that after checking out we were able to leave our bags with the concierge for the rest of the day so we could go and do some more exploring before heading home 
69788,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, The service I forgot toothpaste and reception told me they would send some to my room but it never arrived I also found the room too hot , The location of the hotel

69796,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Room was a little small and the air con didn t seem to make much difference to the fact that it was a bit too warm , Service as I often visit the restaurants even when not staying I always find the service to be of a high standard with warm friendly team 
69797,Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge, Value of money for old rooms too much expansive and I was on the 14th floor I hear all the time drops of water to be honest I didn t report it because I payed extra 840 extra to have two connect rooms to be close to my children And the breakfast comes with the club room was very very poor, The location wifi free in the rooms and the staffs
