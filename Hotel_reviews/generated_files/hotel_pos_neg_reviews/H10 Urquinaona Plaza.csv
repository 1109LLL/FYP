413352,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Excellent welcome clean and bright room super comfy bed Staff experienced and very helpful Close to all public transport and walking distance to Les Ramblas and restaurants Loved the rooftop bar very cool
413353,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Booking com was a bit unclear in terms of rooms selection we thought that there will be 2 rooms with a balcony but they told us that the hotel is not possible to join 2 rooms otherwise we would have booked only 1 room and pay half 
413354,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Alexandra at the front desk was so helpful and proactive in helping us as we need to reschedule a new flight So pleasing to see such wonderful customer service when your away from home Thankyou to you all
413355,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Can t think of a single thing , We travelled to Barcelona as we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary We arrived in our room to a bottle of champagne and chocolates and a lovely letter from the hotel wishing us a happy anniversary The staff could not do enough for us They even called one day asking if we required any more complimentary water or pods for the coffee machine We had asked for a room overlooking the front of the hotel to add to our experience of our first time in Barcelona to get a feel for the buzz and not to be looking into other accommodation or other buildings as we were aware the blocks are in a square formation This was what we got Lovely experience all in 
413356,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The colors of the rooms very small rooms No good lamps lights were really disappointed I have never seen bad lamps like that , The bed was very good
413357,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, No parking onsite but the hotel has an arrangement with an underground public garage adjacent to the hotel Parking was a bit expensive at 21 per night Plunge pool quite small approximately 10 12 square meters , Incredible breakfast Pastries and fruit were fresh and delicious King bed was large enough for two adults to sleep comfortably Climate control very accurate and easy to use 
413358,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Keep in mind that it wouldn t look like the pictures I am really disappointed with the size of the swimming pool and the value of it doesn t really worth from my opinion they could invest a little bit more in furniture for that type of hotel , Location and the staff are great
413359,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, There was a problem with the keycard machine when we arrived but it was fixed within 24 hours and the staff handled it well , We chose this hotel for a week in Barcelona to celebrate my wife s 30th anniversary We both agree it is the best hotel we have ever stayed in Our room had a balcony with a view of Plaza Urquinaona The entire hotel looks and feels brand new the architect did a really good job turning an old building into a modern 4 star hotel The position is great for visiting all of Barcelona except Park Guell on foot We first planned to get the city tour but didn t have to since everything was within walking distance from the hotel Get the breakfast it may seem expensive at 21 but trust me it s well worth it Great variety with different stuff every day Their chef makes the best poached eggs I have ever eaten got them every morning They also have lots of fresh fruits I especially loved the pineapple Bonus points for the roof terrace it s a great place to chill for half an hour in the evening before going to your room Also good if you like sunbathing we don t We did love the small pool however though it feels more like a jacuzzi then an actual pool If I had to choose my favourite thing about the hotel it would definetly be the staff They are really nice and went out of their way to make sure we enjoy our stay We got 3 complimentary bottles of champagne from them during our stay one as an apology for a problem with the keycards that was fixed the next day another one for my wife s birthday and a third one just wishing us a pleasant stay 
413360,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Noise from rooftop terrace in room 601 Only an issue if youre planning an early night, Great Base for a trip discovering Barcelona Friendly Staff Comfortable bed Coffee machine
413361,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Glassdoor to bathroom, We had a private terrace which were really great Great room with plenty of mirrors which suits women Great helpful staff Clean room and facilities Perfect location 
413362,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, 1 layout of en suite wash basin in the main room space 2 Shower floor very slippery when wet Hand rail and non slip mat requested 3 Could see interior of en suite from main room i e not very private , 1 Spacious balcony with furniture although not very private wood type mesh separates adjoining room balcony 2 Very professional and friendly staff 
413363,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Room space was a little tight but overall of very high quality , Overall outstanding service very pleasant and helpful staff spotlessly clean nice decor in a very accessible and central location Very good and varied selection of breakfast foods including serials eggs meats cold cuts fruits yoghurt with freshly squeezed orange juice Truly outstanding
413364,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The bar during the day was not always manned and you needed to call via a buzzer the response was a little slow Otherwise nothing else , It was small enough to feel very comfortable it s close proximity to the centre of the city was ideal for entertainment and travel The staff were very helpful and informative 
413365,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Location brilliant Lovely staff who couldn t do enough especially when I asked for fresh towels Breakfast plentiful and eggs cooked fresh on order Terrace bar lovely 
413366,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, nice design and friendly atmosphere , The first lady who welcome us was so helpful and so friendly She quickly solve our problem as we arrive 24 hours in advance Thanks again
413367,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Menu at the hotel bar , The bed was extra comfy Good shower and Rithuals shampoo and body lotion Nespresso coffe machine and coffe capsule And the terrace we loved that
413368,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Honestly no negatives at all , The beds were very comfortable The employees were welcoming professional efficient and extremely kind and friendly We loved the entire experience and would definitely stay there on our next visit to Barcelona 
413369,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Shower flooring was extremely slippery and cost of meals was much too high We ate elsewhere which was more reasonable , The staff was most pleasant and did all they could to accommodate us 
413370,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The quality of the food on the lunch snack room service menu was extremely poor We ordered two pizzas at 10 euros each and they were easily the worst pizzas I ve had in a long time , Lovely rooms great location Lots of mirrors great for getting ready make up A little bit strange having the sink in the bedroom but we got used to that 
413371,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The layout of the room was terrible The basin is in the bedroom not the bathroom and is very inconvenient The hairdryer is located in a corner and awkward to use easily There is also a lack of storage space Both days we were there our room was not cleaned until at least 4 30pm and we had been out from immediately after breakfast This meant we had to sit in a communal area until it had been done ,No Positive
413372,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, We didnt like the wait at the bar A lot of the time we waited for over half an hour Although they have a silent buzzer no one responds to it Also the bar closed at 10 sometimes and bar staff weren t as friendly as reception Sometimes grumpy We waited for an hour one night which wasn t great as there were so many of usually, We loved our room We got upgraded for free as we had 50 friends staying for my wedding It was a deluxe and it was beautiful Reception and door staff are lovely and very accomodating
413373,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, I find the location of the hand basin to be a small issue as it is located in main sleeping area and not in the bathroom , The Staff were very friendly and welcoming Hotel was in a great location The beds were very comfortable Breakfast was very good too 
413374,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Would be nice if the roof terrace opened later on a night as it closes at 7 30pm , Staff were really helpful facilities were great lovely pool cocktail bar on the terrace Would highly recommend 
413375,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Weird room layout and drinks at bar overpriced Also recommendations given in regards to a taxi fee to premier de dalt region was not what we were told as we paid a 70euro taxi fee instead of a recommended 30 euro , Lovely reception and very nice touch with champagne on arrival
413376,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, The crew is very welcoming and helpful The hotel location is the best There is a little inconvenience with the toilets in the room so for family it s ok but colleges is a bit odd
413377,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, If I have to find a defect I must say the breakfast room is not so fascinating as the rest of the building that is an ancient restored palace , The beds where really comfortable I liked the balcony with armchair and additional blanket for the chilly nights as well The shower was huge and with a big showerhead The coffee machine was a wonderful plus and then there was always a bottle of water Very useful and comfortable the super soft sponge bathrobe and the sponge slippers The position of the hotel was really good right in front of Urquinaona metro just across the street and in 5 minutes walk you are in barrio gothic There are some nice touches arond the hotel like always a very good scent in the hall and some yummy candy jars around Forgot to tell when you check in they offer you some drinks The hotel bar has a nice outdoor area in a green courtyard Last but not least the reception staff was excellent 
413378,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Alexandra the receptionist was amazing She upgraded our room for free just because we waited a little longer than expected for our origional room Can t thank her enough Had a lovely time and stay at the hotel 100 customer satisfaction x
413379,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, I think everything was perfect but if i have to indicate something for a question of perfectionism I would say the lack of a bidet , Breakfast is a bit expensive but it is really impressive fresh and complete The position of the hotel is simply fantastic The personnel at the reception is very kind professional and supportive The room is very nice even if the layout is very original and it is possible that not everybody appreciates it 
413380,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Housekeepers attending adjacent rooms were really quite noisy in the morning , Hotel is in a lovely area rooms are spacious and airy with a good terrace area Complimentary cava on arrival and nespresso machine in room were very nice touches 
413381,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, All was good, The staff were excellent especially in the restaurant at breakfast The bed was really comfortable and we were upgraded to a room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard
413382,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The bed was a bit off but it wasnt a biggie after all If you guys would get a room with one double bed make sure that its not made with 2 single beds pushed together because they move easily , The staff were amazing they were always smiling and helpful through any situations possible The hotel is local and the city center is really close to the hotel which is nice The room was clean and neat and the room service did a good job The way they put candies and fresh apples at the lobby was cute and appreciable Bruno one of the staff was really helpful and he has a great sense of humor It was a wonderful experience after all 
413383,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Rooms were a bit small but tolerable , Very nice common areas especially the patio Great staff Very helpful as our travel plans were in flux due to a cancelled flight 
413384,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, bathroom I did not like to have part of the bathroom in the sleeping room I do prefer to have all bathroom facilities in the bathroom and not to have to hairdresser sink etc in the sleeping room , the quitness in the hotel good facilities friendly staff excellent breakfast Hotel serene quitness as soon as you enter the hotel from the busy city center What a relief The location is excellent Just within between the touristic city centre and the nice local parts like El Born
413385,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, It would have been nice to have an outside space as part of the restaurant so that on good weather days you could enjoy breakfast or dinner outside As it did rain during our stay it would of been handy if the terrace had some form of roof so that you could still enjoy the benefits of the hot tub and outside seating area on the balcony during the showers , Breakfast was large and varied and was good to have freshly prepared eggs as you like Staff were very friendly and informative and gladly adapted to any specific request that I had Recommend the junior suite for couples as the large terrace and hot tub were an excellent touch and not something that you find in other hotels in a city center 
413386,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Tax per person per night not informed about this from booking it through booking com but was told on checking out of hotel , Service room breakfast and location
413387,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, We booked this hotel hoping to use the rooftop pool and terrace as this was a main selling point however on arrival we was told it was out of use for the season We could have been made aware of this prior to our visit , Hotel staff couldn t do enough for you Went above and beyond to help us out The lobby of the hotel is amazing also

413390,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The room was very clean and comfortable however it was a little smaller than expected and without an outside facing window Although there was a window overlooking the reception courtyard it meant the curtains had to remain closed for privacy , The staff were very friendly professional and happy to help with any queries They also offered extra info before being asked 
413391,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Small room for the price with too much furniture when two people are sharing although large terrace next to lift doors, Great location comfortable beds helpful happy staff who kindly acknowledge my friends 50th by giving us a bottle of fizz very clean 
413392,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Having to wait to be seated for breakfast Range of fresh fruit was poor Staff weren t very attentive in terms of filling up coffee croissants pastries and bread weren t fresh and were chewy,No Positive

413396,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, There were no offers regarding upgrades little extras thrown in all were an extra cost on top of hotel price , The hotel staff were very friendly and accomodating Location is great central to get around Barcelona easily 
413397,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Beds very comfortable Wi fi excellent room was bright a good size love height ceilings Bathroom very roomy would have like sink in the same room Breakfast selection and quality was excellent Staff excelled themselves 
413398,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, We felt so bad because there was a lot of water drops from the ceiling in bathroom It was supposed to be repaired after my complain but the problem can t be solved after repairing again and again I hope if you re uncertain to fix the problem you should change a room for your customers , The location is so good and also I like the style of H10 and nice staff 
413399,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, My stay in BARCELONA exceeded all of my expectations from start to finish The Hotel was excellent especially as it was so centrally located and wonderfully designed Almost everywhere could be reached on foot The Hotel Staff were extremely obliging as nothing was too much trouble for them and they provided lots of information regarding the places of interest in the City I would certainly recommend using the City Tour Buses as they provide good value for money The one ticket can be used on both routes being east and west therefore taking in many many sights that could not be reached on foot As a tip to Tourists use the blue Autobus service to and from the Airport and buy a return ticket as it is just over 10 euros per person and the travelling time is only 20 minutes approximately Why waste money on taxis when you could be spending it on all that wonderful cuisine 
413400,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The opaque glass walls of the bathroom meant that using the facilities in the night slightly disturbed the other person with the light but it certainly didn t detract from a perfect stay , The bed was very comfortable Very clean Lovely fully furnished balcony overlooking courtyards at the back of the hotel Powerful hot shower Great touch having a glass of cava on arrival and as it was my husband s 40th birthday we were treated to complimentary cava and chocolates Thank you for helping to make our time in Barca great 
413401,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Poor service in the bar Had to wait ages to be served Given small bowl of snacks with our drink revealing a screwed up dirty napkin the bowl Then charged 2 5 Euro for crisps from room service turned out to be about 7 in the bowl Not enough floor space in the bedroom Nowhere to store second suitcase Hardly any storage space , Bed was very comfortable Shower was good Reception staff were really great Great location 
413402,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Once I asked for a kettle and they gave me one which was really dirty it looked like someone cooked noodles inside the kettle and the staff didnt realise it, Excellent location staff very nice i had a problem with the bathroom door because it was glass and it was not ecceptable for me so they upgraded me the second day to a very nice room with a huge balcony with a garden view and of course the bathroom has more privacy
413403,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, The staff were very friendly they were willing to help whenever needed ordering taxis etc They allowed us an early check in and even offering glasses of champagne on arrival The rooms are very clean and spacious A very central location close to bars restaurants and the shops also very easy to get to from the airport using the airport bus Easy transport links to all the sites A very good hotel to stay in when visiting Barcelona 
413404,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The pool was just a plunge pool not a swimming pool No tea making facilities as standard in the room Bar style a bit sterile Breakfast wax 18 pp, The location was perfect The bedroom was immaculate and beautiful Staff were friendly and efficient Beautiful building inside and out 
413405,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Nothing everything was fantastic, The location was absolutely superb right in the centre of town The staff went above and beyond everyone was just so lovely The decor in the hotel is stunning Little touches like a heated blanket on our balcony so we could still sit out at night even though it was cold were very thoughtful 
413406,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The room s layout 205 The door for the toilet is a transparent glass door and it doesn t close there is about 5cm all the way that is left open I ll let you imagine the odours once someone uses the toilet I m disappointed for the 172 paid for such room The price is not justified, Perfect location and friendly staff
413407,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Perfect hotel Great Rituals toiletries in the room and we were given a bottle of cava and chocolates because we were there celebrating my partner s birthday The location is perfect for exploring Barcelona on foot and was very quiet at night despite it s central location Staff were really helpful throughout our stay wouldn t change a thing 
413408,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Staff was excellent very pleasant and welcoming Gave us welcoming drink chocolates and complementary water stored our luggage gave us good tips regarding places to visit Room was cleaned every day Breakfast was perfect 
413409,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, There s only one issue we would like to raise The floor in the showering area is really very slippery especially when it s wet My husband accidentally slipped and fell I would suggest the hotel to put on an anti slip mat to ensure the safety of kids and elderly especially , The staff at the reception and entrance are all very helpful with all our queries They are super attentive to us On the epiphany day they even went an extra mile to help us make reservation at a very nice restaurant for dinner we really appreciate that The hotel really impressed us with the modern and grand outlook It really has everything a traveller needs Location is perfect Just a stone throw away from the metro station and walking distance to place de catalunya and the gothic quarters 
413410,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, rooftop bar closed as not summer season Minibar didnt work and after reporting it still didnt work no instructions for coffee machine , Friendly staff comfortable beds great location

413414,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The stay wasn t long enough , The hotel is an island of paradise nestled in the bustling city Classy modern yet comfortable with staff that can t do enough to help 
413415,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, There were fewer English language entertainment TV channels available in the hotel room than those for French German and Italian channels Not a big deal but as a business traveller choices other than news channels would have been appreciated for those evenings relaxing after work , Excellent location Stylish hotel with contemporary rooms and friendly staff We were there on a business trip and got a free upgrade to a room with a terrace Facilities were excellent 
413416,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Nothing, Friendly staff view onto the square and room nice and modern and clean Perfect for 2 people but no more Helpful staff also fixed my room keys which didnt work and also delivered tea and kettle to the room after a long flight which was nice Great location right next to Urquinaona metro and walk to Catalunya for airport bus Only stayed the one night but could not fault it

413422,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Price of breakfast extortionate at 18 each when your competing with many cafes around the corner , Fantastic location to access sight seeing sites of Barcelona Friendly staff 
413423,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Being woken up by reception every day asking if I was smoking The large windows overlooking the reception area meant the curtains had to be drawn all the time Seeing someone being robbed just in front of us in the park in the Pl Urquinaona , Comfortable bed Good shower with toiletries Good breakfast Excellent location 
413424,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Beautifully decorated hotel Complementary drink on arrive Fab location Was my husbands birthday I hadn t mentioned it to the hotel but they knocked on the door with a bottle of bubbly and chocolates A lovely touch can only assume they saw his birthday card in our room

413428,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Very expensive considering breakfast not included and they charged over my booking com established reservation price I noted the discrepency they brought the price closer to the booking com figure but still charged over the agreed price Beware , Comfortable beds Good location 
413429,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, the staff in the reception whilst welcoming in the 1st instance seemed to disappear when trying to buy a drink at the bar etc Decided to give up waiting and went into the city for refreshments This is very poor service for a 4 star rated hotel, the room layout was ideal everything was clean and inviting
413430,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The room itself was rather small with only an internal window , The hotel was really central but still very quiet The breakfast was varied each day very good 
413431,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The coffee at breakfast was bitter tasting that was my only complaint , Friendly helpful staff Comfortable beds and pillows Lovely fresh modern hotel in a great location 
413432,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Thought the breakfast was overpriced The Strawberry Daquari was more like a glass of flavoured ice Disappointing free cocktail , Very helpful reception staff Especially Thomas Great room and upgrade to junior suite was very welcome

413437,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Basin in the bedroom not a good idea and bathroom very small with no shelves or hanging space only hooks in the shower which is not the best option Proper bathroom would be a better solution , Terrace is such a bonus
413438,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, I didn t like the idea of them scanning my passport into their database system When I asked why it was needed the clerk assured me no one would have access to my information With all the identify theft going on I don t like handing over a document as sensitive as my passport unless it s to a law enforcement official , The staff was friendly and helpful They provided complimentary wifi and champagne upon arrival held our bags prior to check in 
413439,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Upgraded to a larger room Booking com says all rooms are the same size but they are not, Location excellent Clean Great sta Would stay in this hotel again for sure
413440,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Bed was stiff for us but this is personal as we are accustomed to a softer bed However staff were very helpful as they got housekeeping to add additional blankets to soften the bed which worked perfectly Sink being in the bedroom took some getting use to , Great location for sightseeing very close to metro staff were all incredibly friendly and very helpful Hotel is new modern clean quiet and tastefully decorated Great value for money Would stay again

413443,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Room 601 is located right near the pool and bar Music plays right up to 12pm most nights and the walls are not quite sound proof Barcelona has such a great night life that most nights this isn t a problem as you re out exploring , I stayed here while attending a conference at the CCIB conference centre The location was excellent A short walk down to the gothic quarter and across the road from the metro stop that took me to the conference centre located near the El Maresme Forum stop The hotel is well designed very clean excellent wi fi and the staff are friendly and welcoming 
413444,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Excellent all round up graded to a junior suite with jacuzzi and sunbeds on the roof top Excellent room towels and al round cleanliness I loved the sweets too in the room Also at the bottom of the lift brilliant stay Thanks to everyone involved Liked the champagne on arrival too

413448,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, 1 The bath and the shower s towels were really bad and old The hotel management should realy work onrenewing those as soon as possible this matter rune every nice appearence to this nice hotel 2 King size bed contains 2 seperate mattresses Although the management quickly solve this problem for me but really need to be taken in consideration at the rest of the other simmiller rooms 3 I really didn t like the wooden floor in my room i always prefer carbet wooden floor give it a beach style room I know its a hotel decision but i have to reflect my openion , This is one of the coolest hotel i have ever experienced It was really an excellent choice The location is great close to the market and to the famous Rambla passage de garcia street Most of the restaurants are near by Even the famouse site seens are also close The staff was great The manager SANDRA was very helpfull in solving my bed matress problem For a quality quite time I really recommend this place Specially the room with a private terrace People who are looking for beach time this is not the perfect choise Its far away from the beach area 
413449,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, No negatives, All the little things had been thought of right down to the candy at the lifts Staff amazing esp as one in our party lost their passport Staff made regular calls to authorities to monitor progress of searches etc My husband injured his foot so staff were also supplying us with plenty of ice for treatment The room whilst small was luxuriously appointed and use of space very clever The convenience of the sink outside the shower cubicle worked really well for us as it meant I wasn t hogging it to do my makeup when hubby wanted to shower 
413450,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, We had parked locally and didn t know that we had to show parking ticket on arrival at hotel to get discounted parking perhaps the question could be asked at check in to save any embarrassment , The welcome at reception was excellent liked the complimentary drinks the jars of sweets dotted around are a bonus for the children and adults reception very helpful and knowledgeable about the metro and gave us good instructions metro opposite hotel 
413451,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The entrance is at a bus stop with no good place for a taxi to drop off or pick up Directly inside of the doorway there is a staircase leading down to the reception area with no lift that we could see None of this was a problem for us but it might be useful for others to be aware of the physical setting when booking , Exceptionally good soundproofing of the street facing windows Large room with comfortable bed and very nice view over the square Good cafes across the street so no need to buy the hotel breakfast Just a few minutes walking distance to the airport bus end station And of course a perfect location for sightseeing 
413452,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, The service and friendliness of the staff could not be faulted Central location close to everything a traveler could need definitely value for money Just delightful 
413453,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Every bring was perfect Bottle of cava on arrival and a note congratulating us on our recent wedding Location ideal staff friendly and helpful plunge pool amazing Room very clean and modern and bed extremely comfyz
413454,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Rooms incredibly small No storage we had to live out of suitcases and could barely move around and we had a superior room with Terace Bad layout Good for 1 or 2 nights maximum Very plane room No counter space And the sink is outside the bathroom weird No concierge front desk staff good for simple direction but not very knowledgeable on the destination So good luck finding restaurants , Lobby and decor great Pleasant staff Roof top pool great 
413455,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Gym was a disappointment Service at the pool bar was rude extremely slow or non existing tried twice , Very stylish design staff in the reception was exceptionally good Balcony was a nice surprise Breakfast was excellent Wifi worked well Excellent location near Plaza Catalonia and metro station 
413456,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The difficulty I faced for late checkout , Everything about the property was great location is awesome in Barcelona city centre Staff are very friendly and helpful as they helped me a lot and they were my guide to visit most of city attractions In terms of cleanliness it was awesome And for the decoration and the hotel style it was perfect and their breakfast was great as well 
413457,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, The property is in an excellent position for exploring Barcelona The welcome on arrival was excellent and the glass of champagne was very gratefully received after a long train journey We had some problems with our door keys when we arrived but the engineer was called to resolve asap and in the meantime we were given a master key so that we could leave our things and go off to explore Overall very happy with the whole experience and look forward to staying there again 
413458,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, One thing that could be changed is possibly have a kettle in the room Also the roof terrace to be open till later at night would be nice We had one bad experience in a restraunt which I HIGHLY recommend NOT going to as its over priced and awful This restaurant was the DO Boutique hotel and restaurant in a historic square off the la rambla To give you a clue the warm meal I ordered for 13 was FOUR pieces of asparagus with some ham on top with three dollops of mayo Not a meal when complained staff were very rude and said would call the police Due to the fact they also wanted to charge my boyfriend 22 euro for a squished sausage and brought the wrong drinks as well , The air con in the room as well as the roof terrace was lovely especially in the evening for cocktails especially mojitos The staff were always helpful everything was brilliant The location of the hotel was brilliant not too far from la rambla the gothic quarter and much more Definitely recommend going to the Manchester bar that s ace Also would highly recommend eating off the la rambla and not on the main streets 
413459,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The air condition in the room made us sick It is impossible to adjust to avoid cold air directly on the bed , Great location excellent staff nice roof terrace with tiny pool nice rooms 
413460,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The staff kindly but noisy near th room We have a small room near the housekeepers s background route I didn t know to have paid at check in This is prepaid without previous information , The location is excellent Breakfasts were very good The courses were tasty and the waiters are kindly breakfast room is nice 
413461,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The rooms were extremely small yet the bathroom was large in comparison and the shower much bigger than needed Would have liked a few extra inches to walk Also didn t like that bathroom had no privacy only a glass door Hallways outside of rooms very dark poorly lit Not enough hooks , Loved the public lobby rooftop lounge Staff very pleasant and helpful Rooms were ready earlier than we expected so we didn t have to wait to check in 
413462,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, The decor of the hotel is fantastic The rooms are exceptionally clean and comfy we had a balcony which had very comfy furniture to sit and relax especially liked the drapes covering the balcony We stayed for my partners 30th birthday The hotel surprised him with a bottle of cava and chocolates The staff are very attentive and friendly I would definatley recommend this hotel not only for what i have mentioned above but also for the location and value for money 
413463,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, The location was probably the best thing about this hotel Staff were very friendly and accomodating Facilities room and common areas were modern comfortable and clean I highly recommend this hotel in Barcelona 
413464,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, That my boyfriend and I shared two single beds that have been pushed together And that the wash basin is oddly situated outside of the shower toilet room Also the signature smell of the hotel is a bit too strong on the nose , The location of the hotel cannot be more perfect 
413465,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, I felt a little anxious in the shower as the floor was slippery , Staff were a highlight making us feel welcome and comfortable Location fabulous with great cafes nearby 
413466,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Can t think of a thing , We were greeted by porter who took care of everything Received upgrade to room with terrace and jacuzzi Lovely surprise great way to spend last night in Barcelona Very impressive breakfast buffet too Verticle garden in ground floor lounge a real stunner 
413467,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Having the sink in the main room outside the bathroom is a bit inconvenient But that s really all I can complain about , Everything is very modern clean shiny and pleasant We booked only a few days in advance and got a great price on a room with a balcony overlooking the patio The location Urquinaona is central and convenient to all attractions and public transport 
413468,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The only thing I can think of is the voice in the elevator that announced the floors couldn t understand it , The most important the service really great Our room was small but so well arranged and decorated that it felt huge The bed was extremely comfortable 3 pillows each 6 total Wonderful
413469,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, This hotel was top notch from check in to checking out A glass of champagne upon check in was superb and the location was excellent The entire staff was wonderful and the room was well laid out Also the plunge pool was nice on a hot afternoon The dinner recommendations and directions we received from Nacho Peinado were great Many thanks to the Staff

413475,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Breakfast is exxy you can get it a lot cheaper from any cafe around the square , Upon arrival we got an upgrade to a suite with a terrace the terrace was spacious and very comfortable We loved hanging out there after hectic activity packed days The room had everything we needed a hairdryer teas and coffee complimentary water It was clean and modern The location was the best thing about this hotel we aren t strong walkers but were able to easily stroll to majority of the sights listed in guide books The catalunya square is a three minute walk there are buses A1 and A 2 that take you to and from the airport Bus 24 also leaves from the square can get you to Park Guell in less than 30 minutes Definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona 
413476,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Booked with Double room but it is very tiny for two people No room to relax at all it made me feel breathless when staying in the room as it is too small Overall not value the price it was charged, Thanks for the welcome champagne Hotel is just located in the city centre Staffs are very helpful 
413477,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Breakfast is good and healthy but with limit choices Basin is in bedroom which feels a bit odd , Location is great Very close to many attractions Staffs are helpful when we asked how to get to places

413481,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Our room was on the street side so it was a bit noisy at night There is a nearby bar and people talking loud during late night hours Otherwise everything else was perfect, Almost everything
413482,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Bathroom was odd the entire floor gets wet when showering The sink was outside the bathroom and had little counter space , Breakfast that was available for purchase was very good WiFi was excellent Staff was great they gave us some restaurant recommendations Cava was served upon check in Location was perfect Easy to get everywhere and walking distance to LaRambla There was a bar available on the first floor 
413483,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The rooms were not great no window and very small Not great help getting taxis from the hotel , The staff were great and overall look of the hotel was lovely 
413484,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, This was our 2nd stay at a H10 hotel and we weren t disappointed The staff were so professional hotel facilities were spotless and the location was super Our trip to Barcelona was to celebrate our 3rd anniversary and to our surprise the staff at the hotel had taken note of this On our first day we returned to our room having spent the afternoon at the hotels lovely rooftop terrace only to be welcomed by a congratulations card and bottle of bubbly Having worked within the hotel industry i know it is the little touches and the attention to detail that makes a hotel stand out and this hotel certainly does 
413485,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Not enough loungers at the rooftop in the sun never got to sit out while the sun was out , Great location and very central friendly staff and hotel was to a very high standard

413487,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, small yet stylish rooms great location the bathroom sink located inside the bedroom strange staff were realy helpful but only one person at the reception during checkout time took along time,No Positive
413488,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Noise from the inconsiderate woman in the room next door in the early hours of the morning This happened on 2 consecutive mornings waking both me and my husband When I spoke to one of the hotel staff they replied that there was nothing they could do to help me , The bed was extremely comfortable The staff were very helpful and courteous Nothing was too much trouble 
413489,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Nothing, The location was perfect walking distance to most places The staff were extremely polite and helpful Our room was lovely the bed so comfortable I slept really well the whole time It was my partners birthday whilst we were there and had put a bottle of bubbles and a box of chocolates in our room with a note to wish him happy birthday which was a lovely unexpected touch Would definitely stay here again
413490,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, There is an extreme lack of storage space Dresses and trouser cannot hang properly because of the location of the safe The glassed in toilet is inappropriate and the wash hand basin in the room rather than in the toilet is unhygienic One teabag per day is unacceptable The entry doors both from the street and from the hallway into reception are very tall and extremely heavy and difficult to open The roof terrace while lovely was very small and the plunge pool far too small and shallow All in all I would not rebook this hotel , The bed was very comfortable the location excellent and the staff friendly Sweets in hallway were a nice touch The roof terrace was lovely for sunbathing on 
413491,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Everything about our stay was exceptional The staff were amazing efficient and went out of their way to help which made the trip all the more enjoyable The location is perfect 20 mins from the airport and central for all the main places to visit and explore We will definitely booking again for another trip

413493,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, We were upgraded to a bigger room if we joined the H10 club which we did Well I would have hated to see the smaller room Our room was very clean and very comfortable but oh so small for 5 nights and the terrace has no privacy whatsoever due to being separated by others with just a blind so we never used it We also hired a car to get us to and from the Grand Prix well that was a bad idea as the hotel has no parking facilities and it makes this very clear but the local car parks are very very expensive for an overnight stay and you have no other option, Staff were excellent and room was clean Love the sweets at the foot of the elevator lovely touch
413494,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, booked a suite with a hot tub for our anniversary and it did not work Despite informing staff it still took 2 days before the hotel fixed it we only stayed 3 days expensive one session in the tub, beds comfy very polite staff great location gin and tonics
413495,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, If they had a coffee shop or if their breakfast area were available for the purchase of food would have been nice Rooms were a little small and not too much space for clothes etc , Staff were very polite and friendly Very modern hotel breakfast was excellent Would stay there again 
413496,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, We received a room with windows that looked to the lobby we couldn t open it and it was kinda dark and we missed a lot the sunshine The terrace was closed that week and we only find it out at the check in the terrace played an important role in choosing this hotel so you could imagine our frustration , The room was cozy and the staff was exceptional It s in the heart of the city you can walk almost everywhere from the hotel beach 20 min Sagrada familia 25 Placa de Catalunya 5 min 
413497,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, A few things we would recommend to improve the hotel but nothing major that would make us change this wonderful hotel We request a one bed queen or king however the bed were 2 single beds pushed together which was sometimes uncomfortable The sink in the bedroom is a bit awkward as well , This is our second time here and would go back each time we visit Barcelona The staff are beyond amazing so helpful and friendly The location is centralized and perfect for shopping The rooms are clean well decorated and the beds are comfortable We got a room with a balcony which was lovely

413514,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, As others have said the sink in the bedroom is a bit awkward and the rooms are cleaned really too late We returned to our room at 4 30 and it still wasn t made and wasn t prepared until after 5 30 We had hoped for a shower and nap before an evening concert but it wasn t possible The staff did apologize and sent us a bottle of cava Also we found the breakfast staff not as friendly and helpful and a bit on the rude side but overall I would stay here again , The front desk reception staff are extremely helpful and gracious We were offered an upgrade when we checked in along with a welcome glass of cava The location makes it perfect for getting to see everything easily accessible by public transportation or walking distance to almost everything The breakfast is nicely varied with really good and real scrambled eggs The decor is lovely with lots of places to sit and enjoy and relax in comfort The library has large computers and is cozy and welcoming The rooftop area is stellar with great seating and another nice place to relax 
413515,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Only small criticism is the heavy doors on entrance They are tricky to negotiate with bags or pushchairs Automatic button activated would be better Note the sink is in the room which is fine but was slightly noisy in the night for a sleeping baby , Balcony was great nice and spacious Bed was big and comfortable Cot provided was good quality clean and comfy for the baby Overall decoration and ambience was great staff made us feel welcome and gave a nice present for my birthday Breakfast was nice had a good range Would definitely reccommend

413519,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Shame the roof terrace bar was not open but understandable seeing as it was still February even if the weather was good , Great location decor and amenities
413520,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, We paid for a room with a view in reality it overlooked a rather ugly courtyard There were a few issues in our room that had to be fixed on request late housekeeping came on request broken bed fixed broken lamp on balcony that was not fixed For some reason housekeeping came really late around 4pm every day The sink is next to the bed instead of inside the bathroom which is a little strange , Very convenient location for exploring Barcelona airport bus drops off 5 mins walk away Breakfast was good Free sweets in lobby The reception staff were friendly Good wifi 
413521,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, Amazing location staff were so helpful and friendly and as it was my first time in Barcelona they reccomended places to eat things to see also giving us a map and marking out the spots and where the hotel was located so we could easily go and explore by ourselves Room was amazing and the view Cleaness was a solid 10 10 would 100 go back to this hotel Bar staff was lovely and the rooftop was just amazing to chill down of a night and drink a few cocktails before bed

413525,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Bathroom size Very small and not comfy with the sink that stands out the restroom Wardrobe could be improved in size since the room has the space to have a bigger one , Best location ever Everything reachable in a walking distance in the historic center 
413526,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, I booked a double room for 6 nights I was given a twin No 511 they advertise 22 sq Meters but the room was only about 13 sq m the toilet 1 5 sq M Separeted by glass not isolated against smell noise or visualy the sink was not in bathroom but in the tiny room about a meter away from the beds for about 3 hours I was trying to talk to somebody but no one was available finally I visit the reception and after a lot of pressure the manageress appeared I ask we visit the room in order to proove my claim she reacted with an extremely vulgar behaviour and said to me get out also she refused to give me her name of course I mooved to another normal hotel They charged my credit card 1100 euros forty days before my arrival and only after booking com pressure the accept to refund 980 euros the refund delayed another 40 days that means totally 3 months holding my money I lost and spoil my holidays because they advertise falls info about rooms and have a behaviour far of any hospitality meaning ,No Positive
413527,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, WIFI in the room didn t work except if we stood by the door Breakfast 18 euros too expensive , Loved everything from the hotel decoration and staff Very friendly and helpful hotel Beautiful rooms and the roof terrace was gorgeous We will defiantly be returning Cleaners do an excellent job All the places we visited we would defiantly recommend the area beautiful Near to the port next to the main road 20 mins in taxi from airport Lots to see and do in the area and the Metro is next to the hotel

413533,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The fact that the sink is in the room not in the bathroom Also there is no gym , Clean and modern add to that a perfect location with a reasonable price 
413534,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Extremely small room bathroom sink next to the door not in the bathroom Room not soundproofed Couldn t sleep well Wardrobe was extremely small for a couple or even for one individual No place to keep clothes No place to keep the luggage Lobby and external facilities are all right but rooms are not a 4 star hotel level In general we are very dissatisfied for the price we paid , Staff and location Terrasse view 
413535,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, The hotel was really close to the subway and Catalunya plaza The staff was extremely helpful especially Ali who welcomed us very warmly The room was very clean and had everything we needed I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay there again myself anytime 
413536,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The central control of the room temperature , I like the location and the courteous staff I also left a computer cable behind me when I checked out and it was found and kept for me by the house keeping department
413537,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, This is a hotel that has a great potential but the staff has lots to do to improve the quality of service It is sloppy and bordering unprofessional They confused our booking let us without breakfast and the restaurant recommended by the concierge was terribly bad We felt almost cheated and ruined the mood , The inner garden 
413538,H10 Urquinaona Plaza,No Negative, I was pleasantly surprized with this hotel and their staff It is very clean and private though in the middle of the city Great choice if you want to wonder arround Barcelona and visit the popular sights

413540,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Nothing , Just a few minutes walk to Plaza Catalunya and metro Perfect location for tourists visiting just for a few days and don t have enough time to commute The rooms are uber modern and clean I would suggest booking a room with a balcony Ours looked out to the garden very nice at night when its lit up Staff were fantastic I don t think I saw a single staff who didn t greet you with a warm smile and is ready to help It means alot especially to a foreign tourist Thumbs up and definitely would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona 
413541,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Bathrobes were taken away once used but not replaced Toiletries were not replaced with fresh ones , Location Staff friendliness Room size Amenities 
413542,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, They close the bar too early in the evening , The staff was very nice and easy going We really enjoyed that they offered complimentary gummi candy at the lobby level in front of the elevators Nice detail 
413543,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The area around the sink in the room is completely non functional There was no room for my things and everything around the skimpy area was always getting wet I had to keep a towel on the floor so that I wasn t traipsing water everywhere Sinks belong in bathrooms not out in the open , The staff particularly one gentleman at the front desk who answered all my questions helped with directions and restaurant suggestions and even mailed my postcards I can t recall when I ve had that kind of service Unfortunately I didn t catch his name But he should get a raise or a promotion or both 
413544,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, I d stayed before but with my daughter and we had a brilliant room with a balcony plenty of space This time alone and got a room that was so small there wasn t even sufficient space to open a suitcase Never mind only one night business stay comfortable bed slept well , Great modern renovation of a majestic old Barcelona building Excellent breakfast Really pleasant staff with good attitude Good value

413546,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Room was really small No hooks no luggage stand Nespresso machine was broken When I complained at checkout the ckerk did not offer a coffee from the hotel bar which is 10m away and would have been the natural reaction Instead I had to walk to Starbucks WiFi was below average with a better selection of the provider it would improve they use Telefonica , Stylish place bathroom shower Tiny fitness but sufficent for me Good for one night but too small for a longer stay 
413547,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The only thing I didn t like was that the private deck on the junior suite is actually adjoining the other two suites decks Seemed like it d be very easy for intrusion , The staff was very helpful and attentive Super fast internet The junior suite was excellent

413550,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The bathroom was very tiny so small that the sink area was in the bedroom It was fine but I prefer the sink to be part of the bathroom , The staff were very welcoming upon arrival and offered a glass of prosecco while checking in Nice touch Excellent location 
413551,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, Tiny too small room with wash basin located by the bed and no wash basin in the bathroom Windows coming out to the closed atrium so no fresh air and no view in the room No closet space Room shows some wear and tear We were repeatedly waken up by drunk guests who came back to the hotel late at night and hung around reception bar area in the lobby due to the location of the room , Location was great hotel has distinctive decor in the atrium area and provides little treats Staff is attentive and friendly Coffee machine in the room 
413552,H10 Urquinaona Plaza, The bar closed early and the heaters outside were shut off , The arrival staff were great after forgetting passport they said it was ok to get a family member to email it other whilst continuing to check in The bed was really comfy and loved the espresso machine
