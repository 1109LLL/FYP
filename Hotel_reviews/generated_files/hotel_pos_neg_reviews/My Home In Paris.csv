201694,My Home In Paris, No tea and coffee maker tea or coffee from the machine in the lobby was charged full restaurant price , Stylish interiors super bed very quiet Great shower Nice lobby and breakfast area All very new and well designed Good location close to metro Breakfast looked great although we did not book with breakfast 
201695,My Home In Paris, Nothing of note This is a small family run hotel with simple but well done facilities , Extremely friendly Quiet calm and tasteful small hotel in excellent position Simple but good breakfast elegantly presented 
201696,My Home In Paris, The hotel manager was not happy that we didn t want to eat breakfast in the hotel 15 Euro person it was our first day in Paris and we wanted to go out and explore and eat in a Parisian cafe We ended up eating breakfast there one morning because the manager basically told us we were rude for not eating breakfast there after they upgraded our room from Classic to Deluxe for our anniversary stay The Deluxe Room was quite small so I am sure the Classic Room would be even smaller For perspective there s just enough room to stand in the restroom between the shower and the toilet and the vanity sink is right next to the bed Our room faced the street which had several bars around it there were people talking yelling and laughing in the street until 0300 in the morning which made for difficult sleep I saw several people rate this as a 4 star hotel but this is not comparable to a USA 4 star hotel in my opinion , Lovely furnishings metro stations all around numerous bars and cafes within walking distance grocery store on the street corner umbrellas if needed during a rainy day Bastille Place and Bastille Opera House is about one mile away which is easily walkable or even easier by metro train If you re up for a 1 5 2 mile walk you can get to some absolutely incredible bread cheese wine chocolate and macaron shops 
201697,My Home In Paris, Breakfast was 15 EURO s for a section of pastries cheese and cold meats If you take a 2 minute walk you can get the same for 5 EURO s The room was very nice but there was no desk not great if you are travelling on business, The d cor and general feel about the hotel was great The owners have obviously put a lot of effort into this The location was good very close to the Metro and only a 5 minute walk form a decent choice of cafe s and restaurants The internal courtyard was a very nice peaceful place away from the busy city
201698,My Home In Paris, We loved exploring the area a new neighborhood for us in Paris as we have not stayed in the 11th arrondissement previously We really liked that the neighborhood didn t feel heavily tourist it felt like a very residential area If someone has not pervasively been in Paris this may not be the ideal area to tour from although we found the transportation very easy from the hotel to everywhere we wanted to go the Louvre St Germain The Marais , The hotel is meticulously clean and well cared for The design is beautiful and the team there is absolutely lovely Liz was wonderful and allowed us to see different rooms so we understood the categories and all the rooms were absolutely perfectly designed and very functional We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel as well There is also a lovely outdoor area to relax in on nice days 
201699,My Home In Paris, Towels could be newer Bed linen also not as clean as one would like when we first opened it there were a few hairs around Breakfast could improve if serving natural juice not tropicana , The bed was very comfy and we slept very well Our room was on the 1st floor with view to the internal patio which made it very quite and it was a great size The breakfast was great lovely bread choice of fruit and the room they serve it is lovely with glass ceilings Cristina was extra helpful and super welcoming Location is also fantastic very close to the buzz os Marais many restaurant options Plus it is a 15min ride to Gard Du Nord 
201700,My Home In Paris, Bathroom was extremely small Room very small Breakfast was average Desk staff couldn t speak English so very hard to get any assistance , It was clean bed was comfortable 
201701,My Home In Paris, I picked this restaurant on the basis of two key points A bathtub and a good breakfast There is not a single bathtub in the entire hotel even though its advertised as such on booking com When I complained I was told by the check in desk that bath means shower and when I argued that she is incorrect she dismissed my point saying that she is right The breakfast was different cuts of ham which both my wife and I do not eat cheese selection breads and cereal No variation and no hot cooked items , Comfortable room at a good location The receptionist was describing the tourist spots for some customers and she seemed to give them excellent advice 
201702,My Home In Paris, Couldnt fault the hotel at all to be honest , Whole experience of the hotel was wonderful The staff were lovely Room and bed was great super comfy and spotless Very easy to relax in this hotel 100 precent would stay again Loved it 
201703,My Home In Paris, Was great no negatives , Fantastic rooms wonderful showers great location 3 mins walk from Metro and a great Metro line 4 stops to Gard Du Nord and 7 or 8 stops into the centre with no changes cheap supermarket nearby for water and snacks We also had inter connecting rooms which was great for our daughter to be close but not too close 
201704,My Home In Paris, The patio area is lovely but they have two rooms on level with the patio so you feel you have to talk in hush tones or not at all , Hotel was lovely very clean and lovely helpful staff easy to visit sites from This is a quite hotel no bar although you can order a drink and tea coffee available at a charge breakfast continental not a lot of choice though room was very spacious with matching decor and spotless the only fault with room was only 1 mirror in bathroom and no long mirror no good when you have two women fighting for mirror ha would definitely stay here again 
201705,My Home In Paris, Location was short walk from sights approx 15min from notredame but wasn t a problem for us may not be perfect for some other people but I would definitely stay again, Great room and accomodation and breakfast Friendly staff
201706,My Home In Paris,No Negative, Loved the breakfast and the cozyness of the decor The big rooms but most of all loved the way i was treated by the hotel staff They were extremely nice Very good service for the money It was always nice to come back from the busy Paris and have a quite place to relax 
201707,My Home In Paris,No Negative, THE BED WAS AMAZING As was the coffee served by our friendly host at reception What helped a little was their understanding of English as well as our French was very basic 
201708,My Home In Paris, Rooms could have been slightly bigger but it worked well and we were extremely happy with our stay , We spent the weekend walking all over Paris and the hotel was perfectly situated from our perspective 30min walk from the Louvre and about 45mins to Montmartre on foot Lots of fantastic restaurants in the vicinity and we found one called L Epouvantail which we could not recommend highly enough about 15mins walk from the hotel near Place des Voges The hotel itself was small but very well presented Our room overlooked the central courtyard and was extremely quiet and we slept very well We also loved the fact that it was close to the canal which meant we could go running first thing before breakfast which was a continental affair only but with very good produce we loved it 
201709,My Home In Paris, Bedroom was small and maybe two bottles of water daily would be appreciated Breakfast could have been more extensive , Lovely bar breakfast area Very pretty place settings for breakfast Helpful staff Beautifully decorated 
201710,My Home In Paris,No Negative, Went for New Years Lovely place cosy and beautiful lovely and very helpful lady at reception and same for the young gentleman in the evening could not say a single bad thing about the place or the staff had a lovely time 
201711,My Home In Paris,No Negative, I booked this hotel as a present for my daughter and her boyfriend They were made to feel very welcome by the lovely staff The room was comfortable and clean and they loved the breakfast They were able to walk to do their sightseeing and found nice restaurants nearby Would highly recommend 
201712,My Home In Paris, Nothing , 2 minute walk from the Oberkampf metro station and from there you can take all connecting metros around Paris which is Eur7 50 per day and another Eur1 90circa to Disneyland Room was super clean we couldn t complain Hotel staff were so polite nice and helpful I will go back in here in a heartbeat 
201713,My Home In Paris, I had a superior room but many things were missing like a big mirror a bedside table soap in the shower a bathtub a bin under the super tiny desk or a bottle opener It s way too expensive for what is really is And they charge 19 euros for a simple breakfast you don t even have eggs only one kind of bread pastries are not the best and fruits are limited The cheese and ham were delicious though , Very good quality bed and mattress very clean hotel nicely decorated and lovely location Very attentive and friendly hotel landlord 
201714,My Home In Paris,No Negative, Everything was amazing Very nice rooms comfort and decor delicious breakfast very kind attentive and helpful owners and staff Also very cool neighborhood 11e arr Close to Canal St Martin and Marais 
201715,My Home In Paris,No Negative, very new renovated hotel with big modern rooms stayed there twice already Great staff I was provided with free ironing service of my shirts as they do not give iron and ironing board to the residents for safety reason 
201716,My Home In Paris,No Negative, The standard of care and attention given to so many details made this hotel a wonderful place to stay The breakfasts were delicious served in a delightful conservatory area exquisitely furnished The beds were really comfortable rooms quiet and the area idea for sight seeing in Paris 
201717,My Home In Paris, The standard room was too small enough for 1 person but with 2 people it s too tight , The hotel is stunning and very clean The bed is comfortable and I loved the nice smell in the room The staff is very friendly and were very welcoming
201718,My Home In Paris,No Negative, Great Breakfast not an extensive choice but all the more very delicious very helpful staff good location Room sizes are compared to other Hotels in Paris very comfortable 
201719,My Home In Paris, The only thing that would have made a difference was that there was no coffee available in the bedroom , The croissants were delicious as was the breakfast and Lisa does a fantastic job of going the extra mile
201720,My Home In Paris, nothing , nice staff good service perfect location there s lots of restaurants nearby and u can go everywhere in paris u want by the metro because the metro station is so closed maybe just 50 meters away from the hotel and there are 3 metro lines 
201721,My Home In Paris, No irons allowed in the hotel at all Only ironing service is to send your clothes to an outisde company Bought an iron from next door electrical shop and was told not allowed to use it , Brilliantly laid out and modern decorated hotel that has only recently opened The freshness shows Location absolutely ideal with metro only yards away and a main eating shopping plaza only 5 mins walk away 
201722,My Home In Paris, Facilities were appropriate for a 3 star hotel but price was for a 4 star hotel Very little hanging space for clothes , Room was comfortable very nice shower pretty good location
201723,My Home In Paris, No choice at breakfast I love a hot meal and my wife is gluten and dairy intolerant but neither was catered for Whose says the French are well known for their GOOD FOOD , Comfortable bed and clean room
201724,My Home In Paris, No in room breakfast service , Very swift check in and out process Room quite big by Parisian standards well furnished and spotlessly clean Location great and central Room very quiet Good air conditioning Personal is very friendly and helpful 
201725,My Home In Paris, Being told just 10 15 minutes wait for the room to be ready but it turned out 40 50 minutes we could have gone out to lunch or started our visit Just a small cultural difference be straightforward and tell us to leave our bags and go out for a bit and not seek to please and then over promise , The Hotel is very newly opened and presented beautifully The Owner was on hand to ensure everything was perfect Very compact rooms but every detail was carefully thought about to maximise our comfort 
201726,My Home In Paris, I was surprised to see the shower literally in the room The shower doors were clear so there were no intimacy I would have at least blurry the glass as it can be a bit awkward if traveling with friends , The room was very clean and recently redone The staff was very welcoming and attending to all guests needs Breakfast was very good and bright glass roof and doors 
201727,My Home In Paris, Room wasn t stocked with soaps or water on the second day needed to ask for them Second person working nights didn t seem to know the area very well Also I don t remember having a phone in the room to make calls to the front desk or even for emergencies , Staff were friendly and the morning breakfast food coffee and juices were all good 
201728,My Home In Paris, Nothing, Everything about the hotel was next to perfect Metro was just around the corner Staff were more than helpful and super polite Room was beautiful and very clean Great experience and will definitely recommend it to couples most especially 
201729,My Home In Paris, The room carpet is more like a chillwhich table setting than a proper floor covering Bathroom is part of the actual bedroom so it s impossible to use it without disturbing your partner at night Akward shower the shower head is inside of a tiny nook at the back corner of an already small ish shower The room safe is lightweight and not bolted down could easily be stolen directly out of the room , Amazingly helpful staff Very friendly and attentive plus great food recommendations Good walkable location with some younger nightlife Very clean lobby and rooms 
201730,My Home In Paris, The room wasn t huge perfect for one person Two suitcases would have been a tight fit , The bed was super comfy with super soft pillows Unusual for Europe The room was super clean everything was brand new The staff were lovely and the location was nice and quiet And close to the metro I didn t want to leave this hotel 
201731,My Home In Paris,No Negative, Standard room review Breakfast was lovely lots of it and special mention of the array of Croissants that we re all very tasty Comfy bed nice staff great location Had it all Definitely would stay again 
201732,My Home In Paris, It would ve been nice to have coffee and tea facilities in our rooms It was difficult to get tea or coffee outside breakfast times , Owners were friendly helpful and professional Lovely fresh continental breakfast Location was superb Easy access to transport great places to walk to Finally the hotel was like an island of tranquility in the very busy sea of Paris Our room was so quiet 
201733,My Home In Paris, Even for a couple with no children standard rooms are extremely small Toilet is merely a closet I know that rooms are generally small in Paris city hotels but for a more comfortable stay an upgrade is a must in this lovely hotel , The couple owning this boutique hotel are very helpful They clearly enjoyed decorating this hotel as it presents their delicate taste Rooms hotel entrance are all very tastefully decorated It is extremely close to the Oberkampf metro subway station merely a 2 3 min walk Beds are comfortable breakfast is decent and the value for money is quite good We enjoyed our stay 
201734,My Home In Paris, Room space a bit tight but however relatively bigger than most similar hotels in Paris A kettle in the room would be great , Nice clean well located hotel with friendly staff Pleasant breakfast room with delicious baggette and coroison 
201735,My Home In Paris, no bar no eggs with breakfast staff was a bit nervous when asking questions Customer service could be better very small room no separate bathroom , clean cosy rooms very quiet rooms
201736,My Home In Paris, The breakfast buffet needs a little bit more variety Some fresh fruit would be a good addition , The decoration is very classy romantic and posh The staff is very polite and helpful The wifi connection is close to perfection Everything is brand new and clean This hotel is a must for the perfect stay in Paris The neighborhood feels safe enough despite what anyone would think 
201737,My Home In Paris, There is no desk on which to work nor a place upon which the luggage can sit The sink in the bedroom is a bit quirky Wi Fi was not working apparently due to a power outing from Orange the telcon provider In general the space is small but of course this is Paris , Very clean and proper room good shower great location if you have business around the 11th Very comfortable bed Simple but decent breakfast Kind and helpful staff 
201738,My Home In Paris, That I had to checkout so soon I will go back again without question , The modern furnishings were excellent The location was 30 seconds from a Metro Loads of restaurants to choose from Fantastic staff very helpful
