22434,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, the hotel itself seems a little old I stayed there a few years ago and loved it they could do with a little renovation of the furniture which was bad and old specially at the entrance of the hotel reception looks old and not very practical , prefect location quiet excellent if you dont want the noice of the city plenty of nice restaurants
22435,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Should have more Introduction about city tours and others , The staff are nice Rooms are exactly what I imagined when booking large and comfortable Everything are good 
22436,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence,No Negative, A very confortable and affordable refuge in the centre of Paris There are many restaurants nearby and you can walk to the Jardin des Tuileries in five minutes 
22437,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, While booking I picked a room with a balcony and paid extra but on arrival I ve been told that there is only 2 rooms at the whole property and both are occupied The lady at the reception agreed to transfer us to a room with a balcony on the following morning as someone was vacating it and as a courtesy we have been offered a free breakfast The temp room we were accommodated for the night was bit on the small side and wasn t very pleasant as there was strong smell of mould I was annoyed by the gap of the toilet see pic s and the bathroom doors Don t know it might be a French thing but I like my privacy while I m on the toilet seat Anyway after moving to the balcony suit the next morning everything was fine the room was bigger as well , The TV was pretty good size bed was nice and soft Tuileries station is literally 5 mins walk 
22438,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Nothing, Location and helpful kind staff clean room and bathroom Breakfast was enough Anything you need what i close hotel staff everytime there for helping for us that Perfect chose for first time in Paris 
22439,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, The hotel staff were so so the wifi was extremely poor which was really an issue since I needed to work while there , Nice cosy boutique hotel in the heart of Paris A stroll from the Louvre jardin des tuileries and the metro 
22440,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, No problems at all Would certainly book again, The staff were particularly fiendly helpful and professional The evening glass of champagne was a very nice touch Rooms were a reasonable size and well fitted and quiet Very comfortable beds
22441,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, I have chosen this hotel for my short holiday Staff was unhelpfull and unkind My mum left her charger in our room We came back after 2 hours staff agree for checking the room but it was already clean and there was no charger inside Moreover cleaning staff entered the room without knocking Staff is terrible Hotel is cozy but staff is counter advertising , Very Good location
22442,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, I enjoyed everything about our stay at the hotel , Excellent location within walking distance of the Louvre L Opera and Galleries Lafyette Large bedroom with comfortable bed tea coffee making facilities in the room also fridge safe large modern shower and bath slippers and 1 bathrobe provided fluffy towels shampoo shower cap body lotion provided Our room had a small balcony large enough to stand on not all the rooms did Didn t have breakfast so can t comment on it Receptionist very friendly and helpful with excellent English 
22443,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, No frills Only 24 rooms in all and simple Blah Close to a hostel in terms of decor but more private Cheap, It was friendly and conveniently located 
22444,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, The staff took our own towels by mistake when doing room keeping We have our own towels for traveling because we don t like to use towels from hotel Unfortunately the staff failed to give us back our towels and refused to replace us brand new ones , Location is very good 5 minutes to metro and lots of restaurants within walking distance 
22445,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, It is a small hotel and the rooms are very small they look much bigger on the picture The air conditioning heating was very noisy I would put this more as a 3 hotel and have stayed at nicer 3 hotels in the area , The location is good and the staff were friendly 
22446,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Some of the lighting in my room didn t work and the door was hard to get closed Breakfast was ok but I wasn t told until check out that it wasn t included in my room cost Location is fantastic Close to attractions and great restaurants Also I requested a itemized receipt via email Hope it comes soon ,No Positive
22447,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, SERVICE AND CLEANESS OF ROOM, not a 4 star hotel in any place in this world TODAY WOULD NOT PAS 3 HOTEL EVALUATION THE HOTEL SERVICE WAS AWFULL ALTHOUGH THE ROOM WAS GREAT AND THE LOCATION ALSO
22448,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Sadly I felt the room was too small for the price no little kitchenette not much space to really breathe for a couple The bathroom was also difficult as there was only a bath tub with no shower or glass panel In order to have a shower you would have to be extremely careful not to flood the bathroom which I accidentally did when washing my hair Whilst I always loved the look of this hotel and feel the property is lovely I was let down by the 4 star rating price room size bathroom issue Could be better for a single traveller on business , Top location in the 1st arrondissement right off rue St Honore and near shopping like Colette The room decor was light and easy the property was quiet and felt safe Room and hotel was tidy and clean 
22449,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, the douche spells water out on the floor it leaked , the location the staff the room nothing is to be left out of excellence this is my 2nd stat in this hotel and i think it will always be my choice in paris everything is near by parking metro station and taxis 
22450,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Coffee machine at breakfast, Friendly staff who went the extra mile to enhance my experience the complimentary champagne wine between 6pm and 8 pm The location was superb 
22451,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, The rooms are a bit small In our room we had a bath and not a shower it was not very comfy We had to change the keys twice because they didn t work in our rooms The night and day receptionists seems not to talk to each other about the room organisation , The location is very convenient You can walk the centre from the hotel Nice restaurants around The rooms are really silent 
22452,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence,No Negative, The rooms were a great size by European standards the location was good Close to shopping restaurants We had 2 rooms they were adjoining which was very nice 
22453,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Poor service and overall terrible value for money Had to move rooms twice poor design means bathrooms flood evidenced further by damp damage insect roommate beetle inedible breakfast ,No Positive
22454,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, I had higher expectations for this hotel based on the reviews and pictures The rooms were exceptionally small I know that s to be expected in Europe but I ve traveled extensively throughout Europe these were closets the bathroom was the size of a cruise ship cubicle The luggage took up the walking space completely around the bed Breakfast was very expensive for what was offered For 18 I expected a few more selections The hotel boasts a Marie Antoinette theme but other than a couple of pictures in the lobby the rooms named after historical figures of that period there was nothing special about the decor Definitely paid a fortune for the location only , The location was great The building was charming 
22455,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, tooooo noisy bars cars people in the street under the window small reception desk small room old elevator broken room card i asked myself why this hotel could be graded as 4 stars and how dare it calls itself RELAIS DE SILENCE , location service

22458,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Although the room was modern it didn t appear to be that well looked after , The location of the hotel was great Very close to the main attractions and the Metro The bakery around the corner does an excellent breakfast 
22459,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Value for money was hard to find This was supposed to be a 4 star hotel yet we had a cosy room with a double bed which was actually two singles pushed together The shower leaked onto the shower room floor the shelf in the shower was hanging off the room was not properly insulated for sound and you could hear banging pipes and people walking around all night the aircon did not work and the bed linen was dirty 500 for three nights in April was way off the mark , Location
22460,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, They need to rethink the bathtub arrangement one must be able to take a shower without having all the water running on the floor The room it s just as small as its says 16 sqm Not much time can be spent inside but that s normal in Paris Make sure to ask for a room with view or you ll be watching just the restaurant roof , ideally situated for visiting Paris good restaurants around Don t miss the Ducasse chocolatry just around the corner it s just fabulous Staff very welcoming and helpful 
22461,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, I was very annoyed that my room internet didn t work for the duration if my stay 7nights considering I was there for business First I was told I can sit in the lobby which had no privacy and work which I found most inconvenient as I was working late Then I was only asked if I wanted to move rooms a couple days before I left which didn t help I didn t have the spare time to move rooms This was very inconvenient I would highly recommend this is looked into The breakfast was limited in choice Also when my taxi arrived for my departure I didn t get any help with my bags It would have been nice as I had more then one suitcase , The rooms were very comfortable with a very nice decor and I liked having the bath in a decent sized bathroom The rooms were sound proof and the lift was promt The hotel is in a very central location Perfect location as near restaurants shopping and sightseeing All walking distance The staff were friendly and occasionally offered a light refreshment of Champagne on arrival

22464,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, It wasn t a 4 star hotel The room was pretty small but for Paris standard I guess it was an ok room but for exemple no room to leave my suitcase couldn t close the toilet door cause my legs didn t fit etc Also trash was borken holes in the towels pretty noisy could hear the neighbors talking Had the fire alarm twice during my stay extremely early because something burnt in the kitchen Wifi was very poor Breakfast very poor too very small breakfast room so I guess no room to display food so limited choice Came late twice during the week and door was closed and had to wait a long time before someone opens the door they say 24 7 but none at reception and had to buzz for 15 minutes before someone comes to open the door Location was excellent and staff was great especially the girl at front desk but definitely not worth paying the price , Location was perfect in the middle of Paris next to everything 
22465,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, There is no loopy just a reception also you can t use that one elevator more than 4 persons their rooms are very small with smallest refrigerator Don t try to eat your breakfast at this hotel , Nothing there
22466,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Therewere only 2 problems the beautiful bathroom would benefit to have a shower curtain because it was almost impossible to take a bath or a shower without a flood on the floor Also one might want to watch TV without any lights the electricity, The staff was very helpfull and friendly The location is great I will recommend this hotel to my friends and family
22467,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, the room was just tiny The toilet was placed in a cupboardlike area and the door wouldn t close properly so not very comfortable when you have to do your business and someone else is in the room breakfast not that great either , location is brilliant 5min walk from Louvre The staff is very helpful and friendly 
22468,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, Wifi in the bedroom was sometimes patchy so had to reconnect by going down to lobby area , Excellent location 5 min walk to Tuileries or Pyramides metro stations Quiet modern bedroom cosy room is perfectly okay for a couple Friendly and helpful staff Complimentary champagne each evening was a nice touch 
22469,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, The room was a four step walk up which was difficult for us being elderly The so called shower was a high tub which we found out later was not a shower but just a tub We could not get in it because it was so high We were told that if we had said something we could have had the room next door which had not step and a real shower The breakfast was not worth the money We found a place to eat around the corner that was better , The location was excellent The hotel was clean and the bed was fantastic We also had a coffee maker in the room with biscuits and chocolate snacks Nice touch

22472,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence, I absolutely loved the place but if I had one criticism it would be that more mirrors are needed in the rooms We only had one in the bathroom which made it difficult for two people to get ready Otherwise everything was perfect , A lovely boutique hotel in a great location All the main areas of Paris were in walking distance with the Louvre just around the corner The price was fantastic for somewhere so central I will definitely stay here again when in Paris 
22473,Hotel des Tuileries Relais du Silence,No Negative, Location is perfect less than 10 minute walk to the metro and the Louvre Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful Rooms are probably average for Paris which most Americans would consider small but well appointed and comfortable Very clean The air conditioning is a huge bonus in the summer Breakfast is overpriced for what it is but very convenient
