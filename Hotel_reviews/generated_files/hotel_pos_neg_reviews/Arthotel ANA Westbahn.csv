403358,Arthotel ANA Westbahn, Good value for the money but don t go there in hot summer as there is no AC and the rooms are really hot even in the night The fan in our room did not help , Perfect location near to Westbahn and close to all public transport 
403359,Arthotel ANA Westbahn, In the biggest heat wave air condition would be appreciated However there was a big fan in the room so we could cool the air down , Breakfast eggs are real eggs and nutella is real nutella Nothing more to say Big variety of food everything fresh replenished all the time by the nice breakfast lady Breakfast is served from 6 30 until 10 30 which is amazing and quite a long period You can come to the breakfast room any time of the day for free tea or coffee Room we had a renovated modern room however the hotel itself is not that modern but very nice vibe interesting art everywhere In the room there is a free safe hair dryer and shower goods Also mini fridge for you to use Bed is rather hard which I like Location the hotel is located on the corner of two streets with quite a traffic especially during the day so do not expect completely quiet nights unless your room faces the backyard where you can by the way sit The room is not completely sound proof but I am a silent freak so guess it would be absolutely okay for normal people My company slept well I used earplugs as usual So if you can request backyard room Hotel is just a few minutes from Westbahn station and next to the top of the biggest shopping street Mariahilferstrasse running down to the city center Reception all the receptionists were extremely polite and helpful but we did not need much though You can store your luggage for free in the hotel on your check out day Reception runs 24 hours Overall very nice stay in Vienna absolutely great value for what we got Cannot fault it

403381,Arthotel ANA Westbahn, The location on a busy crossroad made the room very noisy when you opened a window When all windows were closed you couldn t hear the noise but we needed to open the windows to cool down the room at night as it was strangely hot in the room about 20 degrees I would guess even though it was only about 10 degrees outside We also experienced a lack of hot water on our last morning which was being looked into so I had to forgo a shower on my last morning before returning home , Right next to the train station so in easy reach of public transport Easy to find Decent breakfast esp the freshly made waffles were a hit We were lucky to have a corner bedroom which was huge The bathroom was tiny but perfectly serviceable All receptionists and breakfast ladies were very kind and helpful but I would like to make a shout out to the half Italian receptionist was extremely friendly and especially helpful in locating a restaurant for tango dancing

403391,Arthotel ANA Westbahn, The rest of the hotel other than the room still needs to be renovated as it is not , A special and amazing thanks to Eduardo working at Reception who really went overboard in helping us with everything and anything we needed From explaining the city the map the metro to every thing that happens around The rooms are completely renovated in the hotel and the rooms are really modern and nice
