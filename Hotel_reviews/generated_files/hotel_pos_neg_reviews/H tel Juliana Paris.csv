17381,H tel Juliana Paris, Efficiency and reactivity of staff Shower layout was not comfortable at all no door and therefore the whole bathroom becomes messy We asked for high story room we got the one on GF I couldnt found something suitable for me to eat the night of my arrival i informed the room service that i dont eat meat being vegeterian got chicken in my salad ,No Positive

17385,H tel Juliana Paris, Rooftop terrace not available , It was nice overall we weren t there very long but we re disappointed that the rooftop terrace was not available Staff very friendly and helpful and rooms nice 
17386,H tel Juliana Paris, Bath room the entrance to shower is very narrow the sink looks good but not functional darkness not enough light Electrical wall outlets located not for tourists who need to charge cameras and phones They are located under the table between windows without places to put your phones and cameras , Design comfortable bed breakfast location and people working there
17387,H tel Juliana Paris,No Negative, The service is exceptional the beds are super comfortable the food is fantastic This is the best hotel in Paris You can walk to the Eiffel Tower and stop at some lovely caf s The staff is very helpful and provide restaurant recommendations 
17388,H tel Juliana Paris, There is a design fault with the bathroom sink if the water tap is slightly turned on then it is OK when at mid way point the water splashes over the sink on to the floor or the person could ruin a silk outfit , The breakfast was very good and fresh with excellent service on arrival and departure the reception was highly efficient Rooms were nicely furnished A hotel I would recommend without doubt Location was very good 
17389,H tel Juliana Paris, Only complaint was it was my new wife and I were on honeymoon I emailed ahead a few times about getting some champagne and stuff in the room for our arrival and got no reply And there was a questionnaire before arrival that asked reason of stay I put honeymoon and we were put in a twin room it was lovely but not ideal , The staff were excellent and a hot option with breakfast was good Perfect central location for walking distance to everything 
17390,H tel Juliana Paris, I liked it all, Great Staff Very warm greeting when we arrived always very friendly when we were coming or going Minutes from Eiffel tower great location near Rue Clar as a bonus 
17391,H tel Juliana Paris, The room was extra small we called booking com to cancel last 2 days of one room which they did and helped us supposedly at no charge but that room NOW WAS CHARGED 50 EUROS MORE Breakfast was now included and awful and our relatives did not want The front desk person was not nice and was quite rude maybe because we were Americans The second room was nice and the manager helped us with that We would stay there again Now that we know what to expect , The bed was nice breakfast was over rated and TOO expensive Room was way to small but they did upgrade us after 2 days Manager was very nice tried to accommodate 
17392,H tel Juliana Paris, Need to make the atmosphere a bit more vibrant as my Mrs had to request for some music to liven the atmosphere up when we arrived Our toilet seat was too close to the wall and hot radiator A swimming pool will be nice , Staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome Bed was very comfortable and feels really nice Breakfast was nice too Hotel location is close to most major tourist attractions in Paris within walking distance Nice and quiet neighbourhood 
17393,H tel Juliana Paris, The view from our room was poor and the pillows not very comfortable The hotel is a bit pricey however in line with the market , The comfort and the cleanliness of the room The bed was big and the mattress very comfy The breakfast was very diverse and tasty with fresh exotic fruits and freshly squeezed juices The bathroom is very modern and clean Finally the staffs were very helpful 
17394,H tel Juliana Paris, Nice Hotel The first room we got was very small and the next one the bathroom was dirty The 3 room was great So what they say all good things come in three the reception was super friendly however the breakfast stuff was unacceptable She did not speak english and gave you the feeling you are not welcome You had to ask for everything as the buffet was empty no bread cheese etc Not what you expect from a first class hotel , Nice Hotel
17395,H tel Juliana Paris, Small rooms and too dark need to add more lights especially the furniture are dark and no light even in morning I have to open the bathroom door to get more lights need more security especially in the elevator area which takes you to the rooms doors are opened any one can enter the floors and no security are available,No Positive
17396,H tel Juliana Paris, The breakfast was quite disappointing all the good stuff was gone when we got there at 10am , Room was awesome especially the bathroom and bed The staff was really sweet except during the breakfast 
17397,H tel Juliana Paris, room was really dark the interior architect was not practical minded in the least Faucets drenched you when turning on water you banged yourself getting out of bed on one side also due to no light , location
17398,H tel Juliana Paris, The room service is not good enough for a 5 star hotel and she doesn t clean glasses for 2 days in row, Room is very clean and pillows very nice and soft The location of hotel was very good
17399,H tel Juliana Paris, This hotel did not offer the 5 experience I was expecting The room was extremely small and there was a very small closet in the room which barely was able to fit my suit The sauna is at best a 4 person sauna and that is stretching it They even charged us for the coffee in the lobby while we waited I am not sure why this hotel is rated as 5 star This was a standard 4 or maybe a 3 5 star experience , The location of this hotel is excellent The staff was friendly and very accommodating 
17400,H tel Juliana Paris, Only a few good restaurants near the hotel No free bottle of water is provided low speed wifi in the room , They have mondern and beautiful salon with bar Very kind staffs Located in calm area It is good to sleep 
17401,H tel Juliana Paris, no turn down service you need to ask for it many times complementary water as well you have to ask, Juliana is in a residential neighborhood arr 7 very boutique hotel i guess 40 45 rooms very luxury however very small great value for money
17402,H tel Juliana Paris, Only one minor fault it was missing the complemntary bottle of water that the receptionest noticed and said they would bring one up which never happened, Lovely hotel room 
17403,H tel Juliana Paris, Nothing all good , The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful It was a great location and our room was wonderful The breakfast buffet was delicious We hope to come back some day 
17404,H tel Juliana Paris, There was a problem with the safe in the room 304 and 5 hours after reporting it no one had been to the room I ended up being moved to another room , I loved the pillow and the shower 
17405,H tel Juliana Paris, No room service after mid night no laundry facilities inside the hotel no mirrors in the room lighting is very poor in the room tiny gym, The modern and beautiful furniture clenn and comfort bed friendly staff
17406,H tel Juliana Paris, Our stay was adequate but there are some serious issues with customer service Firstly I was nearly charged for an early check in when I simply asked for my partner s name to be added to the booking not an early check in time Secondly we asked on SIX separate occasions for a larger size of slipper On every occasion we were told they were on their way immediately and they never arrived and I was there for four nights If no larger sizes were available it would have been polite to inform me of this instead of ignoring my request every time Thirdly the bath plug was broken and the sink tap was faulty so we had to change rooms just an hour after arriving and unpacking , The bed was very comfy 
17407,H tel Juliana Paris, Water was not draining properly in the shower so had to stop the shower twice before finishing my shower Problem reported to the maid but nothing happened so this is not what you expect from a five start hotel Also breakfast was terrible compared to a year ago when I stayed around the time they first open so not sure if things are going down I invited people for breakfast and they were not happy so made me a bit uncomfortable To the credit of the front desk she took off one breakfast out of three I would have been happy to pay and get the breakfast I had one year ago at the hotel,No Positive
17408,H tel Juliana Paris, Room a bit small Too dark at night in the room Didn t like the scent in the lobby at first but then I got used to it XD , Beautiful decor everywhere Big bathroom Sweet receptionist girl Fast wifi Comfortable bed 
17409,H tel Juliana Paris, Could be clearer this is a boutique bed and breakfast experience not a 5 start hotel The comfort room is so small it s unusable the rooms are dark and have no central lighting some rooms do not have a stand up shower concierge service is patchy and no on duty on the afternoon we needed help no evening turn down service The property is not marketed accurately , The quiet room comfy bed relaxed atmosphere A lovely luxury b and b experience I would visit again now I know what the venue offers 
17410,H tel Juliana Paris,No Negative, The location was excellent Our room was amazing Really spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable We would definetly stay there again The staff were helpful booking us tours 
17411,H tel Juliana Paris, 1 The hotel doesn t have a very friendly welcome we expected them to serve us some drinks or snacks a gesture that a professional 5 stars hotel would normally have Instead we had to do it by ourselves perhaps we re quite picky when it comes to hotel services 2 The housekeeping staff was very unprofessional She didn t know anything in the room e g when I asked the staff if I can change the sparkling water bottle to mineral water bottle she looked at me very confused and shaked her head And when she finally understood what I was talking about she was pretty annoyed that I requested a different type of water bottle 3 Not enough of complimentary items there were no comb no rasor Furthermore everytime we ran out of shampoo or basically anything in our room we had to ask for more No extra water bottle when we finished our water bottle in the room 4 The breakfast didn t impress us very little choice of food , I really love my room very spacious beautifully decorated despite the hotel size The toilet is very clean highly functional The T V is very big the system is very sophisticated lots of movies available to watch The staff in the reception is very friendly and helpful and always in their post at anytime The hotel s location is very ideal situated in the 7th arrondissement of Paris very close to the metro and to the Eiffel Tower 
17412,H tel Juliana Paris, A receptionist called Alena was unfriendly and has upset face all the time even not responding to a greeting, Location room design and good furniture
17413,H tel Juliana Paris, Classic room too small No place to put my bag Breakfast very minimal and breakfast area very dark Location is a little far from champs elysees, Very clean Nice staff Rooms ready on time
17414,H tel Juliana Paris, Our tv to watch movies was broken the entire trip That should never happen for any hotel let alone a 5 star All that was given was a half bottle of champagne Service is good but the service and hotel itself isn t a 5 star hotel Maybe 4 5, Bed was super comfortable
17415,H tel Juliana Paris, Staff very take care from start but Staaff on the night he not so nice with my Asia lady , Excellent of breakfast and services Wonderful of design and exclusive furniture Bed very comfortable High technology of TV in room If we back to Paris we will choose this hotel again Good location and easy to go everywhere by Bus and Metro train Price is very good for 5 Stars Hotel 
17416,H tel Juliana Paris, The Hotel is not a 5 Star property by any means Breakfast is very poor and there are no facilities in the hotel , The bathroom was very clean and nice 
17417,H tel Juliana Paris, The facilities were limited , The hotel is super cute and artsy Close to the Eiffel tower and nearby shopping I booked for a club room but got upgraded to a junior suite so my room was spacious and the bathroom was very clean and tiles were so pretty The bed is by far one of the most comfy beds I have experienced in a hotel I ll definitely go back 
17418,H tel Juliana Paris, No complaints, The hotel has a modern feel with large rooms and lovely bath rooms The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful Breakfast was included with our room and a great value Location was close to so many sites and in walking distance from everything 
17419,H tel Juliana Paris, I would ve liked to order just coffee for room service but was told that I had to order the full breakfast and that if I wanted coffee to go down to the breakfast area and ask nicely if I could get it to go or to drink the coffee from the machine in the room which was terrible The television s movie section was not working No one seemed able to fix it I was told that the engineer wasn t working It wasn t that big a deal but at the end of day it s sometimes nice to get into bed and just watch a movie or wake up in the morning to a nice cup of hot coffee while still in your pj s especially in a 5 star hotel , The room was beautiful and very clean and the bed was an absolute dream The bathroom was spacious and really beautiful with great water pressure in the shower The location of the hotel couldn t be better 
17420,H tel Juliana Paris, Would have enjoyed a continental breakfast and wasn t going to be pay 29 euros for it , The most comfortable beds I have slept in Perfect location of Eiffel Tower The staff was so friendly and accommodating Felt really welcome Beautiful hotel 
17421,H tel Juliana Paris, Absolutely nothing , A comfortable beautiful hotel in a great location Stroll away from main attractions and main streets for shopping and lonely food The staff were incredibly helpful and so pleasant It felt like a home away from home 
17422,H tel Juliana Paris, Housekeeping while always superb in keeping the room very clean was a bit inconsistent in refreshing toiletries Not a big deal and quickly corrected upon request We just chalked it up to growing pains , The room was exceedingly clean and comfortable Bathroom was very spacious Location superb quiet residential yet in the heart of the 7th Beautiful design terrific breakfast with very accommodating staff Delightful experience 
17423,H tel Juliana Paris, The price is pretty high compared to the location Thare are many places with high standard like this hotel but lower price and better location , Bed and all facilities are awesome 
17424,H tel Juliana Paris, Nothing that we can think of All was perfect, Everything is super classy and well designed Extremely high quality of furniture and fixtures And super service with a smile
17425,H tel Juliana Paris, The only thing we might have wanted to change was the amount of light in the room When we were packing the indirect lighting in the rooms was not sufficient , From the moment we arrived to the time we left the hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful providing us with directions and attending to our every need The rooms were spotlessly clean which is a very big deal to us The bed was big warm and comfortable thereby giving us 4 wonderful nights of restful sleep We will definitely be coming back to stay at Hotel Juliana again 
17426,H tel Juliana Paris, There was an odor in our room It was a bit overwhelming Front desk offered to move us but didn t want to lose our view of the Eiffel Tower They even tried to give us something to use to help with smell Consistency wasn t there when our room was cleaned daily The bathroom floor wasnt always clean didn t have right amount of towels some nights or missing face towels Toilet paper was low and there wasn t an extra one in room Assumed housekeepers would replenish but didn t Our last night we got a small bottle water next to our bed candy and clean feet towel next to our bed This never happened any of the other nights One other thing to maybe help better overall stay was the temperature in sauna area It was too hot and no air coming in It s okay to be in actually steam room or dry sauna but the lounging area was uncomfortable to sit because of no air circulating , Front desk crew was superb Always courteous and willing to help or answer questions Breakfast was a ten star Food was terrific and staff was also phenomenal Location was awesome and quiet neighborhood 
17427,H tel Juliana Paris,No Negative, We stayed in a club room which was a good size for a Paris hotel room The hotel was very quite clean and staff was very friendly Hotel was decorated with a elegant taste and the items used were high quality and very well selected In addition location was very good a minute walk to Seine 
17428,H tel Juliana Paris, Certainly not 5 star in common sense of classification Can rate it max 4 star Compare to other experiences I stay in different hotels around he world minimum 150 days a year it is much overpriced, Location convenient but isn t great Staff is very friendly and helpful but we had to remind about bottle of champagne that was included in the price three times and finally it was delivered to the room on a last day of stay so could not be used Overall filling is OK 
17429,H tel Juliana Paris, no restaurant small rooms was advertised on your site as airport pickup however the price when we inquired was greater than the taxis fare , location was good
17430,H tel Juliana Paris, Cleaning staff needs to be better trained Several issues both days with parts of the room cleaning being incomplete floors not cleaned towels not replaced etc , Very friendly and helpful staff A very positive mood in the hotel Lovely decor 
17431,H tel Juliana Paris, There was no fitting on the wall for the shower head so I had to hold it and it was a bit too short , Great location within walking distance from the Eiffel Tower and the champs Eliseu Room service breakfast was included in the room You can order whatever you like We had eggs salmon pain au chocolate toast coffee tea hot chocolate orange juice cranberry juice All brought to the room within 20 mins of ordering It was the first time I ve ever ordered room service so I was quite excited The bathroom was excellent too with quality shampoo and conditioner Staff were really nice too

17435,H tel Juliana Paris, For the high price and 5 stars I was surprised to be in a room when we booked a suite The TV didn t work properly for 4 days and details like mostly no water in the sauna and too hard to find any were a bit of a let down Otherwise fine , Lovely comfortable bed very quiet room area good location for the river Eiffel Tower nice breakfast and quiet environment

17441,H tel Juliana Paris, As most of the feedback I read about this hotel it is having bad smell coming from the toilet and hotel management can not solve it I need to keep the window open all the night even the weather freezing to get some ventilation Breakfast is under the ground Resturant If you take shower water will flood to the room carpet and where you wash hand you can t control the water and all time you will get massive splashing of water on you because the bad design of basin , It is nice location and new facilities

17449,H tel Juliana Paris, The bathroom design was not good enough chase when you take shower the water will flood all the bathroom, Good location good service the most important is very comfortable bed
17450,H tel Juliana Paris, Small slightly larger than a cruise ship stateroom and poorly illuminated room Bathroom features style over function as exemplified by the sink bowl which is oversized but sloping surfaces eliminates useful space for toiletries while using The sink faucet must be operated at extremely low volume lest the user gets soaked by over splash Oversized tub fails to hold water due to poor drain seal Overspray from shower results in a wet bathroom floor Toilet positioned too close to sidewall for 200 pound man , Very helpful and attentive staff Great location on quiet side street Super comfy king size bed Excellent and diverse breakfast offerings Invigorating shower with multiple settings Heavy drapery provides darkness during daylight 
17451,H tel Juliana Paris, None, The staffs are service straight from the heart They are polite professional and patient They greet me with a friendly smiling and offer to show me around the hotel before I get in to my room They give me the very detail and helpful information about the sightseeing places restaurants and bars They care about my feeling and offer everything I need before I ask such as giving me the map taking care of my mails arranging the transportation for me to go to the airport from the hotel and so on They make you feel like you are home The location of the hotel is good It is all walking distance to the famous places shopping center the subways and the nice restaurants The room is very comfortable and fancy Everything is perfect I have an amazing staying there Excellent
