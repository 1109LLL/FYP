495543,Hotel Lombardia, The restaurant in the hotel was closed and did not serve lunch or Dinner but only breakfast was served in the morning and our room was smaller than we expected Otherwise the Property was nice , Not very close to the Milan Centrale station so don t bother walking take the 24hr pub transport pass so it will take 15min to reach buy bus and you can travel the whole city also its not very far from corso Buenos Aires the shopping street there are some eateries nearby also Overall a good place
495544,Hotel Lombardia, We arrived 30 minutes late due to a delay in flight and yet the room wasn t ready yet for check in We had to wait for more than 30 minutes in the reception There was no one to help with the luggage We called room service from the room to order food and we were told that we have to go down to the restaurant to order ourselves and we can t order through the phone ,No Positive
495545,Hotel Lombardia, It is possible to hear clearly talks in the other rooms and smashes of the doors by neighbors But I must admit this hotel doesn t promise soundproofing and still is relatively quite and well suitable for good sleep , The bed was very comfy the breakfast was excellent with a lot of different food Staff was kind Great air conditioning Check in is after 14 but they provided me a room already at 11 a m I was also able to leave my bag for the last day to walk around before the plane Thank you for the good hotel 
495546,Hotel Lombardia, We got experienced racial discrimination It was the most terrible in my whole life As I think the chief man is very sly They are kind and talkative only for white skin Because we are Asian all they were very rude to us I still feel crappy and disgusted about their vulgar treatment , nothing It was just hotel
495547,Hotel Lombardia, Reception Staff was a bit rude rest of staff very friendly Careful there is no parking available you have to find your own on the street Triple room is very small , Nice comfortable beds beautiful lobby 
495548,Hotel Lombardia, The bedroom needs updating but was confortable and clean The lobby and the lounge restaurant and bar were lovely so going in the room is a bit disappointing as it s dated , Beautiful outside breakfast area Very good value for money 
495549,Hotel Lombardia, The room design was a shock compared to the public areas Old design no handshower only one headshower etc Also if you want to catch a metro you have approx 15min walk in a neighborhood that isn t that pleasant, Loved the public areas really modern and comfy the breakfast was really cute and it felt like it was homemade the staff were pretty nice too
495550,Hotel Lombardia, The room was small and not too comfortable I was charged extra for parking even though I had the impression I d paid for it beforehand , Breakfast was ok parking was safe 
495551,Hotel Lombardia, Room looked completely different than in the photos a lot older The nice shower from the pictures did exist but it was broken only one of the body nozzles worked No power sockets near bed Room directly below the dark metal roof therefore too hot to even sleep AC was broken inactive Breakfast only toast white buns No juice the one they had was mixed with Sirup very low quality mozzarella No fresh fruit only canned fruit plus they were decorated with anis which ruined the taste All remaining stuff was mostly very sweet Service okay only the minimum giving the key asking for credit card which I don t consider good service Location out of the city center in a rather shady seeming district 10 min from next metro station , The room itself was clean the balcony not there was a weird smelling and looking plastic cup with cigarettes and liquid in it Wifi was free and fast 
495552,Hotel Lombardia, Room decor a bit outdated but that s just the style they are perfectly modern , Good clean functional business style hotel Eastern side so handy for airport quiet residential area Breakfast selection is the highlight 
495553,Hotel Lombardia, The staff at breakfast was not friendly, The room type was excellent I like the laminat floor very much as it was much more cleaner than the ones wuth rugs floor 
495554,Hotel Lombardia, The noise Rooms not sound proofed Any conversation in corridor sounded as if the guests cleaning ladies were in the room with us Breakfast a basic desperate sight to behold No ambiance at all in the place either , Outdoor terrace 
495555,Hotel Lombardia,No Negative, Very comfortable bed In the first day the shower did not work well however the frontdesk was very fast in order the repair service Next to public transport 
495556,Hotel Lombardia, The bathroom was too packed the shower area too small to move With the big shower from the ceiling not a hanging flexible shower it made taking a shower more uncomfortable I haven t come across such toiletries in the bathroom in a 4 hotel in similar containers hung on the walls were liq soap shampoo body gel all the same and no bar soap So I properly took a shower after moving to another hotel No meals in room service or a place to eat in the hotel except for morning breakfast buffet Location is a bit far away from city center and Metro No solid food in places around they open in the evening and close soon The do not disturb sign didn t tell anything to a cleaner She knocked at the door I had to wake up and tell her there was a sign on the door didn t it mean anything Her reply was yes but do I need a cleaning The staff in general was nice and polite except for one receptionist Luca who really made me upset and disappointed of my stay The receptionist didn t allow my son visit me in the room The purpose of my visit was to see my son on international volunteer service in Italy and explore Milan together The explanation was the Rule or even Law in Italy not allowing guests in single rooms I couldn t believe my ears The receptionist said we could meet in common areas of the hotel but not in my room So in the morning after calling me from the reception and my confirmation like in every hotel it is done he didn t allow my son to come to my room in the evening the same At first his behavior was rude to me not even what he said but how he said After my verbal argumentation he calmed down and explained what can I do This is Italy There is a law I m sure he s a good man whom I don t want to harm by this review I assume the receptionist was instructed by the management and this was not his initiative , I liked really good and tasty breakfasts served and the staff working in the cafeteria The room was small but clean The common areas were nice and silent too Wifi worked well too I guess breakfast and wifi are the only things to attract clients to the hotel
