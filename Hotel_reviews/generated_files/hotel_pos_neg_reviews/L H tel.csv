43609,L H tel, The coffee tea making machine was tricky to operate , The bed was like sleeping in a cloud So soft and comfortable it was tempting to remain tucked up all day The location is second to none in the midst of cool cafes bars and galleries This was our third stay at this curious gem of a hotel Our most enjoyable to date Thanks L h tel for looking after us so well 
43610,L H tel, Too expensive for what it is lives on Oscar Wilde myth Rooms small hotel needs some refurbishing weird smell in reception area Never again, Great location of hotel
43611,L H tel, The rooms are so small the bathroom was minute and the plumbing impossible The pipes make extraordinary sounds when other guests use the facilities Very funky hotel not for the faint of heart , The staff was very friendly and helpful 
43612,L H tel, There was pubic hair from the former guest in the bad as well as long black hair Also when you putted on the shower it was to spray all over the bathroom instead of on you I understand you want to keep the charm and you need token the authenticity but cleaning a bathroom is very important , The hotel has a great atmosphere 
43613,L H tel, There is nothing substantial at all to dislike the breakfast buffet could be a little more substantial but continental breakfasts are what they are Also there are so many amazing things to eat in Paris going light on breakfast is probably a sensible thing , the rooms were beautifully decorated and the service was impeccable we were offered assistance with restaurant reservations and airport transportation unsolicited prior to our arrival The location was also stellar being within walking distance to all the main sites without being overly infested with tourists Bathroom products were an absolute dream we bought additional bottles of their hair conditioner to bring home 
43614,L H tel,No Negative, The first time we stayed here after I proposed to my wife and she absolutely loved the place this time we returned and will definitely do so again in the future L hotel is the best hotel in Paris if you like luxurious but small boutique hotels and personal service It has a very cosy bar area with a good selection of special cocktails for a nice aperitif and the restaurant setting is beautiful We did not have dinner here however only breakfast which I highly recommend Don t forget to reserve the complimentary 1 hour private hamam very nice to do when you arrive at the hotel or just before after dinner One of the best hotels I ve stayed in and we will definitely return 
43615,L H tel, The bathroom was tiny but quirky and somehow appropriate to the room so I forgive its shortcomings Fittings need a little TLC, Very charming very French very friendly unique really excellent service Restaurant was lovely the food was excellent and breakfast in the morning was also excellent Our room on the fifth floor was lovely and peaceful no traffic noise at all even with the window open 
43616,L H tel, Not one thing , This hotel is perfect in every way it is the definition of a luxury boutique hotel Each room is unique and the hospitality of the staff could not be exceeded The rooms are absolutely beautiful I booked this for my daughter and her husband s 1st anniversary and they graciously were able to stay in the same room as they had on their honeymoon This is without a doubt a first class establishment 
43617,L H tel, Lighting was a little difficult to manage and I needed more empty space for my belongings, All the stall went beyond the call of duty to make sure we were taken care of 
43618,L H tel, A little expensive Elevator was down for maintenance when I left , Unique historic feel and charm Close to center on the left bank with shops galleries cafes and restaurants Great included breakfast and service

43621,L H tel, Restaurant not open Sunday and Monday which we were not told about at time of booking Tv in room did not work they tried to fix it but couldn t so they just shrugged and left 350 a night , Beautiful decor and architecture

43636,L H tel, The bar and sitting area overwhelmed me with all its Americans Perhaps a way around this is to have a silent area When I visit Paris very frequently I am always looking for a hotel that has many French guests as well as other countries This I feel strongly enough not to recommend to my friends such as those in lawyers firm of Gide Loyrette Noel Paris Incidentally some of my closest relatives are American I would say the same if there were too many English people there should be a balance in life , The very friendly and helpful staff and naturally being surrounded by pieces of antique furniture in a gem of period architecture
