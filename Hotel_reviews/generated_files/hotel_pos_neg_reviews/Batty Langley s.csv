38139,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Hotel Batty Langley turned out to be a real treasure If you are looking for a romantic place BL is definitely the place to be The room with a bath was luxury with good sence of style Service was hostile and warm Small details made the visit unforgetable Refreshing lemonade By the reception and the rooms named by charactes The stay in Jack Sheppards room was plenty 
38140,Batty Langley s, Nothing, The hotel has been beautifully restored but contains many beautiful antique pieces Everything about the hotel reflects opulence and luxury Everywhere you look is beautifully constructed furnished and decorated Just perfect 
38141,Batty Langley s, We were little disappointed to not have a bath in the room when all the photos show lovely roll top baths but the rain shower was good Our cold tap was running hot too not something I d expect in such a pricey hotel but it is an old building I suppose As mentioned before they did let us take bottled water for free in recompense The breakfast options were a little limited and incredibly over priced considering how much the rooms are so we did not bother , The staff were absolutely brilliant they did everything they could to make our stay as comfortable as possible We had a problem with our tap and they let us take as much water from the mini bar as we liked free of charge They even brought more up without being asked The design and decor of the hotel is beautiful it s very charming The 12pm check out time was appreciated 
38142,Batty Langley s, We were enjoying a quiet drink from the honesty bar in the drawing room when two separate groups came in to have meetings One left but the other a group of six men continued their meeting including a conference call without even asking if they were disturbing us A table next to the bath for toiletries would be very useful , Boutique hotel 29 rooms in the style of a Georgian gentleman s residence on a lovely old street off the very modern Bishopsgate Equidistant from Shoreditch and the city and an easy walk in both directions There is a decent pub with nice terrace opposite 5 mins from Liverpool St The three reception rooms are charmingly and elegantly furnished with antiques and the whole hotel has a quirky feel rather than stuffy and old fashioned Our room despite not being contemporary had all modern requirements including plenty of sockets and good wifi The antique bed was supremely comfortable with luxurious bedlinen The room and bathroom were charmingly furnished The bathroom with its copper shower bath and REN toiletries was a treat to spend time in Staff were friendly helpful and efficient We enjoyed a breakfast in bed of delicious bacon sandwiches one morning Highly recommended Considering that a few weeks ago I paid 200 for a night in the Victoria Premier Inn we feel that Batty Langley s is excellent value 
38143,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Batty Langleys is really special great service gorgeous decor and comfy bed I would invent meetings just to stay here if I thought I could get away with it 
38144,Batty Langley s, Nothing, We stayed here for one night having been recommended by a relative who stayed at a sister hotel What can I say it lived up to all our expectations a beautifully decorated and furnished hotel We had a room with a four poster bed with a huge bathroom including a bath and a shower that 4 people could have fitted in It has features no other hotel I have stayed in has Including an honesty bar We had a complimentary tea tray and breakfast delivered to the room The staff could not have done more to make our stay any better We stayed in the William Godwin room which was the quietest hotel room I have ever stayed in We will come again Room Tip William Godwin or at the back of the hotel
38145,Batty Langley s, The hot water was far too hot could scald I needed a better mirror to do my make up in maybe an extendable shaving mirror , Hotel was fabulous Great quirky location near Spitalfields market Bedroom was lovely with a super comfy four poster bed Bathroom was huge with a walk in shower roll top bath 
38146,Batty Langley s, I didn t find anything I didn t like A wonderful if a short stay I WILL come again, The beds were very comfortable although a little high and I wasn t told I could have a step to help me The bathroom and shower were excellent The decorations were tasteful and the many antiques were interesting There was also a comprehensive history of the historical area that the hotel is situated in A thoughtful touch Breakfast brought to the room as standard was a bonus An honesty bar for drinks an unusual and unexpected touch respecting the guests trustworthyness and the staff without exception were helpful in the extreme I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to be pampered and comfortable I give the hotel 10 stars or more if possible
38147,Batty Langley s, No Tea Coffee making facilities in the room as standard although the staff did bring a tray when asked if we d like some and without prompting No bar restaurant and no breakfast room I should have checked when I booked and honestly it didn t adversely affect our stay at all but I do like a hotel bar before after going out in the evening , Bed was amazing Room was really immaculately appointed with a small comfortable sitting room area Apple TV system worked a treat there was a speaker in the bathroom so we could listen to music in there too The bathroom itself was a spotless work of Victorian art The terrace provided an awesome London rooftop view and a great place for drinks breakfast although you d struggle to get more than 2 people out there Extremely friendly welcoming staff and a really nice atmosphere A great base from which to explore Spitalfields and Shoreditch and only a couple minutes walk from Liverpool Street station Underground with it s new bars and restaurants Black Cabs also in abundance nearby because of the station I would absolutely stay again without hesitation 
38148,Batty Langley s, that i wasn t there longer, REN toiletries are a lovely touch and the use of antiques from bathroom items to wardrobes adds to the charm i used this hotel for an overnight post concert treat ive been lucky to stay at some of the best hotels in the world and this is a firm favourite its quirky special secret luxurious wonderfully finished a thanks to the staff as well we had breakfast in bed and that was of a high quality as well my only criticism is on the tea tray there was no coffee yes i know i said tea tray but thought coffee might be there however i know with 100 certainty that if i had rung and asked for coffee it would have arrived so i refuse to deduct even 0 1 points rating
38149,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Great place very comfortable bed supernice service lovely breakfast and an honesty bar A hotel with a personality Plus the night receptionist was a lady finally a hotel with a mind 
38150,Batty Langley s, N A, I had booked a deluxe room but on arrival we had been upgraded to a junior suite which was a really kind gesture The staff were as helpful friendly and polite as any hotel I have ever stayed in across the world The hotel was so quiet which makes a change from normal hustle and bustle of London hotels I loved the d cor all the original artwork sculptures were out of this world felt like I was back in the early 1900 s The bathroom was amazing with a massive walk in shower free standing bath and toilet which was a thrown never have I enjoyed sitting on a toilet as much Honestly the hotel is a little out of my price range but it was a special occasion and I would 110 stay here again for something special 
38151,Batty Langley s, I didn t really like the neighborhood too built up Not much good architecture left Spitalfields market is uninteresting, The staff was very helpful and friendly

38155,Batty Langley s, More shower bubble bath but I m being picky , The bedroom was amazing incredibly comfortable bed brilliant facilities comfy bath robes loads of towels very clean huge stocked and reasonably priced mini bar and the most amazing bit was the bathroom I spent about 2 hours in the super hot extra large bath Truly the most comfortable room I have stayed in for years I would also add that the staff were also spot on you are greeted and shown to your room by 24 hour service Brilliant The rest of the hotel was also finished to the same high standard with a very comfortable lounge that has an honour bar and is well stocked and well maintained with ice and anything you might need there is a library and the whole place just has an amazing feel to it Breakfast is all room service and has a great selection that again is reasonably priced The rooms have Apple TV which is enabled to play content from your phone tablet Netflix etc which is a nice touch and it works Overall I think that this is the best stay I have had in the last 10 years

38157,Batty Langley s, I can quite honestly say that there was nothing to dislike , Fantastic hotel close to everything and the room was great Massive high old fashioned bed that was really comfortable The bathroom had the old style toilet and washbasin but a super modern shower The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was served in the garden area Will definitely visit again 
38158,Batty Langley s,No Negative, This unique hotel more than lived up to the high expectations we had when booking It was like entering a different world The period decor fittings and furnishings were meticulous in every detail The service was pitched at the exact point of helpful friendliness without becoming overbearing or overfamiliar 
38159,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Arriving at the hotel 5 hours before checkin we were pleasantly surprised to find our room ready for us The concierge gave us a tour of the wonderful common areas on the ground floor and explained the facilities of the hotel Our room was beautifully designed and impeccably clean Overall Batty Langley s is well worth the premium compared to other hotels in this part of Central London and offers a rare example of a very English kind of luxury We also took the opportunity since we were right next door to visit Dennis Severs house highly recommended if you have a spare 45 minutes and an interest in the history of London

38162,Batty Langley s,No Negative, The hotel was lovely quite different to most hotels a very interesting property and more like staying in a private house The location was excellent for the things we wanted to do 
38163,Batty Langley s, Honestly i think the hotel is pretty much spot on , The rooms are really well sound proofed We didn t hear any other guests even though they were busy The furnishings and room sizes are excellent the en suites are very big too and we had a separate large shower and rolltop bath The bed pillows and duvet were all perfect and in spite of my husband s snoring i had an excellent nights sleep It was our wedding night so the hotel gave us a complimentary small bottle of champagne which was a nice touch We didn t order breakfast or coffee in the morning but we did utilise the honesty bar The extras are reasonably priced for London and the standard of the hotel Batty Langley s is my go to place now if I ever need want to stay in town 
38164,Batty Langley s, No Morning Newspapers or magazines on London and whats on It would be nice to have a dinning room for breakfast No Sky sports which is a bit dissapointing when our room had an Apple TV, Great Location 5 minutes from Liverpool station loads to do and see Staff very friendly Rooms small but nice 
38165,Batty Langley s, At a push the view from the window is just overlooking other buildings however this is Shoreditch so its the nature of the area There was nothing I didn t like the staff and facilities were exceptional as was the location , The hotel is sumptuous gorgeous and elegant Its not the kind of hotel where you ll find groups of debauched drunken people paying to stay at or hang out in so in terms of location party central Shoreditch it s quite a rare find in that part of town If you weren t looking you d walk past and never know it was there It is truly a hidden gem and a very grown up and exclusive place to stay I stayed in the Box Room alone which is the maximum number of people you could get in there Its small but perfectly formed A small double bed separate shower wc and beautifully tiled throughout 
38166,Batty Langley s, For 400 for one night there wasn t even a kettle in the room You had to use the communal rooms to order and pay for a cup of tea coffee Very expensive for a room with no kettle no iron ironboard and no seating area other than than sitting on the bed to watch tv which didn t make for the most comfortable or homely accommodation Value for money not good , The bedroom was lovely staff very nice and the communal rooms available were delightful 
38167,Batty Langley s, The only issue that the bed was too small for us Would be excellent if we have a bit extra wide bed , We love the decorations of this total Victorian hotel The only issue that the bed was too small for us Would be excellent if we have a bit extra wide bed

38188,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Staff were helpful without being intrusive They were also quick to action my requests Couldn t recommend it highly enough looking forward to a return visit 
38189,Batty Langley s, As it s a small hotel it can be noisy between rooms Prices should reflect the size of rooms small , Staff were friendly location great for Shoreditch Cute boutique style 
38190,Batty Langley s, If I m completely honest the bed was a little hard to our liking and we did struggle to get a good nights sleep even after walking round London all night The pillows and bedding was great just the mattress let it down, I loved the location and how the hotel entrance was descreet I think the rooms are set out brilliantly and made the weekend very special what with the walk in shower speakers in the bathroom and general theme to the rooms Staff were fantastic and breakfast facility was very good

38203,Batty Langley s, Nothing , A warm friendly hotel sumptuous bathrooms and delightful bedrooms A lot of thought has gone into the restoration of the building A show house for Farrow Ball paints and quality furnishings It matches the Rookery in achieving a period feel but with the comfort of a modern hotel Plenty of good restaurants nearby and within easy walking distance of Liverpool Street station The breakfast was a bonus 
38204,Batty Langley s, A chair in the bathroom would have been useful but I expect they d have brought one if we d asked The club double room was comfortable but not very big I would go for the luxury double if I stayed again, The furnishings give it a lovely atmosphere and it was wonderfully quiet The staff were very helpful It was a great location
38205,Batty Langley s, Wasn t so much didn t like but if you want a buzzy trendy hotel which we didn t then this probably isn t the place Very close to Spitalfields etc though but very quiet and intimate hotel , Very unique and beautiful hotel Wonderful rooms and very nice staff Very quiet and intimate hotel 
38206,Batty Langley s, If I m being so super critical The light of a night time that came through the bottom of the doorway from the hall was quite a distraction when sleeping But nothing the bathrobe didn t fix If that s the only fault you can find in a hotel then you must be good , We had a great stay Staff were super friendly Bed was so comfy Location of the hotel was perfect Short walk from Liverpool Street Right by spitlefield market

38209,Batty Langley s, There was nothing I didn t like, A wonderful place to stay Staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are just fabulous A little oasis in the madness of London The sister hotel The Rookery at Farringdon has the edge on location with it being a very short walk from the tube 2 minutes and a plethora of restaurants pubs as soon as you walk out the door 
38210,Batty Langley s, We missed clothes hooks in the rooms however our room offered a big wardrobe , Staff was absolutely helpful and the rooms beautiful Great location with good connection to the public transport system Pub directly around the corner but yet it was quiet by night We loved all of the some details of the room 
38211,Batty Langley s, The fact that I was charged a no show cost when in fact I could not have showed myself even if I wanted to I can understand the spirit of the charge but it was enforced to the letter which I dont like one bit, Location is great and you can walk taxi to most places 
38212,Batty Langley s, Nothing really How often do you say that , The athmospere real luxury to a reasonable price And staff treated us like royalty Beds comfortable and rooms large for being London 
38213,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Beautiful comfortable and welcoming I had a great night s sleep It s a fantastic step back in time and a great antidote to corporate meeting places The staff were charming and helpful and the honesty bar in the comfortable library felt like home 
38214,Batty Langley s, Probably typical for some hotels but I thought for the price they could have included some form of breakfast Try the Breakfast Club at Spittalfields around the corner amazing , The decor is amazing Being able to listen to the FB in the bathroom was a nice touch Very clean and comfortable Didn t spend much time in the hotel as we were busy doing other things Very close to Liverpool Street station

38216,Batty Langley s, Can t think of anything , Wonderful welcoming staff lovely refuge with a great sense of history only a few minutes away from Liverpool Street Station 
38217,Batty Langley s, I was down with food poisoning shortly before check out I asked for a half hour grace period was given 15 mins only and told absolutely no longer than that before a trek across London to Heathrow airport a few hours wait at the airport and a 14 hour flight home I am now booking my next stay in London fand have decided not to come back for this reason , Decor is quite unique beds are comfortable Rooms are individually decorated with strong attention to detail some rooms are better brighter bigger than others so its luck of the draw The complimentary fruit is a nice touch I also felt safe on the premises The staff were very accommodating when I wanted to pick my room for the above reasons 
38218,Batty Langley s, The price to pay per night is a bit high especially if you think that no breakfast is included , The decoration atmosphere in the hotel is unique the staff helpful and the area quiet The location is great if you want to visit the local area also surrounded by amazing independent shops but not if you want to do tourism all around London 
38219,Batty Langley s,No Negative, We stayed at Batty Langley on our wedding night and it was such an amazing experience An absolute gem of a place right in the heart of London We were upgraded on arrival to the suite and offered free champagne as a welcome it was such a lovely touch by the staff and really appreciated The hotel is like stepping back in time and a world away from outside which makes for the perfect tonic to city life for recharging the batteries and jumping back into the mix We would like to say a big thank you to the staff for being so considerate and kind and for making our wedding day even more special We would love to go back and if you are looking for a place to stay that makes you feel comfortable and relaxed without the gimmick that other high end hotels in the city provide look no further 
38220,Batty Langley s, There was nothing we didn t like , Fabulous historic little hotel absolutely beautiful The staff were welcoming and attentive The bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in This hotel was a true delight a real find I honestly felt I d gone back in time and had to remind myself I was staying in a London 5 hotel Would definitely stay again thank you x
38221,Batty Langley s, The breakfast is over priced so we never had breakfast at the hotel there are lots of options for dining very close by , Excellent location and a little gem of a hotel So quiet and relaxing We will definitely return 
38222,Batty Langley s, Nothing the whole thing was just great , The staff were incredibly responsive and polite The hotel itself is lovely very personalized but also super clean and comfortable Just a really great overall experience from someone who normally stays in five star hotels 
38223,Batty Langley s, Nothing I can think of We all wished we could have stayed longer , Upon arrival we were greeted by the very friendly and helpful staff at reception just as with every time we returned from going out The rooms were very clean beautifully decorated with lots of character and very comfortable The location is great with many restaurants and shopping nearby Spitalfields Market is less than 5 minutes walk away Liverpool Street station is less than 10 minutes walk 
38224,Batty Langley s, If they could add Bubble bath along with the other toilet supplied for the amazing baths, Had a brilliant stay here for 2 nights for our honeymoon Loved the fresh breakfast brought to the room Bathrooms amazing staff all lovely 
38225,Batty Langley s, The lighting in the room was poor it wasn t sufficient to read by at night I think breakfast should be included in the price of the room , The room was lovely as was common areas Lovely courtyard garden Great location central but in a quiet spot Staff friendly 
38226,Batty Langley s, based on facilities you get pricing should be cheaper bathroom shower although it has a nice old style its not very practical room could benefit of more light no complimentary water, great bed in a very central location the staff was very friendly and the room well decorated and quiet We enjoyed our stay althought due to the type of location be aware that you wont get all usual services facilities that you find in a 5 hotel 
38227,Batty Langley s, Nothing they catered for everything we asked for , What a find We would definitely come back again as this was a superb hotel The staff couldn t do enough for you and the rooms were beautiful Spitalfields market was just round the corner offering some great eating places It was a great start to our holiday 
38228,Batty Langley s, Very little storage for clothes The floor in our room and the stairs leading up to our room were not at all level due to the age of the building Hard to adjust to Some noise from people in pubs nearby , Location Friendly staff 
38229,Batty Langley s, Shower controls difficult to work Seemed expensive for size of room , Elevator Exceptional lounge and library Trendy location in the old city Train station and subway fairly close Hotel and room had a historic Georgian property with feel of a club Very quiet 
38230,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Everything the ambience of hazlitts hotels is just perfect for us Really sums up London Love the little lounge and courtyard Room was typically amazing 
38231,Batty Langley s, I d liked to have had breakfast included in the price as all of the other European hotels we stayed in did in Milan Riccione Venice and Paris , The bathroom was great especially the shower The bed linens were luxurious 
38232,Batty Langley s, No tea making in the room Limited in house menu I had expected to be able to have my main menu instead could only have soup and a sandwich A salad and chips would have been better There should be a slip mat for the bath made available, Bedroom was beautiful
38233,Batty Langley s, For the price of the room and the quality of the hotel I think it would be a nice touch to have breakfast included 14 for a bacon roll no matter how good it is does not represent value for money We were looking forward to our breakfast in bed but instead walked to Brick Lane for a lovely breakfast at half the price , Staff were extremely helpful It is an oasis of calm and luxury in the heart of Spitalfields Spitalfields Market is a great place to be at weekends 
38234,Batty Langley s, Everything was perfect, Lovely room fantastic bed fabulous bathroom and most importantly amazing staff and perfect location We found our home in London 
38235,Batty Langley s,No Negative, This hotel made us feel that we really were staying at a home away from home Unobtrusive but friendly and helpful staff Service when we required it was efficient and prompt Lovely rooms whisper quiet with windows shut and a c on despite the fantastic inner city location We enjoyed our initial 6 night stay so much that on our return to London we changed a planned one night stay to a further 4 nights 
38236,Batty Langley s, Only didn t like the fact we had to leave Could of stayed forever , Absolutely stunning hotel Great facilities great location incredible rooms helpful and polite staff Will definitely be going back 
38237,Batty Langley s, Pricing will always be an issue for London however you can pay over a hundred a night for a basic travel lodge so value wise it s good , Special hotel great authentic feel without being stuffy Huge bed copper bath felt like staying in a manor house right in central London 5mins from Liverpool Street tube 
38238,Batty Langley s, There s nothing to not like, We had a lovely stay at this gem of a hotel once you stepped inside and closed the door you would not of thought you was in a busy city it was quiet calm and relaxing the staff were friendly and very attentive the room was a good size as was the bathroom bed was very comfortable we had breakfast in our room which we enjoyed overall a great stay
38239,Batty Langley s,No Negative, We stayed here on our wedding night and it was absolutely perfect The Batty Langley suite was beautiful and the bathroom and bathtub were wonderful I would recommend it to anyone and would love to stay again Breakfast in bed was delicious and a real treat Nothing was too much trouble and the staff were so helpful 
38240,Batty Langley s, I struggle to think of anything Even the minibar was well stocked and half the price of the usual top end hotels in the London area , great location easy access to Shoreditch Amazing old world style luxury fittings with none of the usual drawbacks old bath but amazing new plumbing antique furniture but apple TV Great service bacon sandwich for bfast highly recommended 
38241,Batty Langley s, Nothing, Great service Great staff Great location Great bath room On request a tray with tea or coffee will be delivered in the room free of charge We would definitely love to come back in the future and recommend this hotel 
38242,Batty Langley s, Surprised to be charged for still bottled water in the room No biscuits on tea tray No tidy up turn back while we were out in the evening, Cheerful and very helpful staff Beautiful room and facilities great shower and TV radio streamed into bathroom Very quiet Close to Liverpool St Station
38243,Batty Langley s, I feel that for the price the facilities were not quite up to scratch At this price I don t expect to have instant coffee and no complimentary bottled water in the room , The bed was great and the staff were very helpful
38244,Batty Langley s, The room was a bit on the dark side with very little natural light coming in from a small window, The bed is amazing as is the bathtub it was a very pleasant stay
38245,Batty Langley s, There was nothing not to like about this perfectly placed beautifully decorated hotel exceptionally clean and super comfortable Really wonderful and within a short stroll of lovely restaurants and the fabulous old Spitalfields Market, We were a group with ages varying from 7 to 80 and all the challenges we presented to the staff were met with friendly helpful and informative responses Nothing was too much trouble The hotel is beautiful and really special but it s the people who made it an wonderful stay Thank you
38246,Batty Langley s,No Negative, It tied so well with the community history of the area you felt you were visiting with locals past and present Everything of interest was walking distance The bathroom was a delight with luxurious water pressure and toilets that FLUSH Concierge happy to photocopy the local history info provided so we could take it out with us The common library and parlour areas were so unusual and restful and furnished with books you d actually enjoy reading Extremely helpful exceptionally beautiful it was the perfect treat for my husband s 40th birthday 
38247,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Very quiet location and it was just 3 minutes walk from my office Staff is exceptionally kind and helpful Rooms are not big but they are very clean and well equipped I regularly come to London on a business purposes and for sure will be coming back to this hotel
38248,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Really well appointed rooms felt like being at home but nicer These are rooms not a full hotel so you don t get all the facilities as you do with a hotel but if you are ok with that it is a very comfortable stay 
38249,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Good food comfortable and plush rooms Just plain quality all over Classy staff too they still understand the old fashioned hotel approach Courteous service oriented etc 
38250,Batty Langley s, There is no proper bar or restaurant as such the feel is more of being a quasi house guest This said you have access to all the bars and restaurants you could need just around the corner Perhaps a hot breakfast would be the only omission really then , Quality of accommodation beautifully restored Wonderful staff and proximity to both Liverpool St Station and Spittlefields 
38251,Batty Langley s, Could not fault it , We loved everything about this hotel The staff were brilliant the bed was cosy and the bathroom was incredible We ll definitely be back 
38252,Batty Langley s, Each time I stay I really don t want to leave , I have stayed before and like last time this is still my best hotel experience I really enjoy the hotel ambience and the thoroughly professional caring staff 
38253,Batty Langley s, Stayed for my wifes birthday which was made clear during booking No mention of it made or any actions made which was disappointing No atmosphere due to no bar area , Unique luxury hotel with excellent location right next to Spitalfields 
38254,Batty Langley s, More bargain special away day prices would put this firmly on snap weekend away , Outstanding d cor and service great bathrooms totally engaging location Plenty of eating places locally to suit all tastes and so many vibrant places to visit in walking distance if you research and plan it you can do it in a weekend just and want to come back 
38255,Batty Langley s, It s a bit of a hike to the Liverpool Street Station but the hotel s location was very convenient for my business meetings in Broadgate Towers , The hotel is beautiful and combines the charm of an old fashioned historic preservation property with all the conveniences of modern life it just opened last April The public rooms are gorgeous 
38256,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Lovely hotel I think breakfast could be included in the room rate that would be my only criticism The staff were really friendly and the bed was super comfy Would recommend for sure 
38257,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Lets make this review easy It is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I suspect perhaps the best I will ever stay in The junior suite d cor and facilities were simply superb The staff are attentive discreet and very professional I loved every second of my stay I have already booked to return 
38258,Batty Langley s, Discarded men s underwear x2 in the street outside As a stranger and female solo traveller I was a little perturbed about where I d come to , Room decor was lovely and luxurious Location was very close to the event I was attending 
38259,Batty Langley s, Nothing not to like you just could not adore this place , Staff were so friendly and helpful with such a warm welcome Most excellent 5 star boutique experience Having stayed in many 5 star locations in London this intimate hotel is our favourite so far We will definitely stay again soon 
38260,Batty Langley s, No tea or coffee making facilities in rooms this was disappointing Also the Breakfast is quite dear for what you get considering you are paying as much for staying at say the Waldorf and breakfast is included Feel by not providing a good English break fast and including in the cost is penny pinching , The style and the furnishing where very good With nice location and good pub near by
38261,Batty Langley s, Basic facilities around room service in house would have been ideal They did a room service menu but I think it was food delivered from restaurants outside , Location very central to Liverpool St tube and restaurants everywhere Great staff that went out of their way to help and I was upgraded to a luxury room 
38262,Batty Langley s, I only wish it had a gym , Loved everything The friendly staff paid attention to every need and detail The hotel is overflowing with charm and character It turned a business trip into fun It would also be a great setting for a cozy little murder mystery 
38263,Batty Langley s, Room service menu was a little sparse I think adding something like a cheese plate would be great , Beautiful hotel gorgeous furnishings extremely comfortable great location Lovely staff 
38264,Batty Langley s, Bathroom is classically great There was nothing to put our shower gel and shampoo on whilst showering however it would be good to organise a shelf on the bathtub , The setting of the room is excellent the downstairs room with fireplace is stunning warm and welcoming the staff is friendly and very helpful and the decorum fantastic Appliances are all new and carpets are extremely comfortable to walk on 
38265,Batty Langley s, The lack of a real sit down breakfast was disappointing and unexpected The only place to eat food is with room service and sat in your bedroom The other small gripe we had was no bottled water We have never stayed in a hotel that does not supply it each day , The rooms were absolutely stunning
38266,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Took my partner for a surprise night away we fell in love with this charming hotel It felt more like we were staying in someone s house than in a hotel we really enjoyed exploring all the little common areas with their open fire old books Nice touch was the honesty bar the luxury of having breakfast in our room although breakfast is extra wrapped in the fluffy robes provided Gorgeous furniture fixings stunning bathroom Would love to stay there again next time we want to treat ourselves Ideal location near spitalfields market 
38267,Batty Langley s,No Negative, I loved the bed usually I don t sleep well in a strange bed but I fell straight to sleep here was worried about noise as opposite a pub but didn t hear a thing will definitely be back 
38268,Batty Langley s, Room was a little small and breakfast was served in my room as there was no restaurant , Location was great and staff were very helpful friendly and professional Hotel is beautifully decorated and I loves the lounge areas The honesty bar was a great idea to counteract the lack of an actual bar I will be returning again 
38269,Batty Langley s, Air con , Beautiful boutique house hotel with excellent service and great location close to Liverpool Street A quiet oasis but close to the city and hustle and bustle of Smithfields market Room service was superb and a very comfortable stay overall We just struggled to get the temperature right in the room either too warm or too cold Will stay again Highly recommend 
38270,Batty Langley s,No Negative, The whole experience gave us a stay we will remember with pleasure for a long time The d cor was full of lovely touches making it warm and welcoming and the staff were all great 
38271,Batty Langley s, As above, No complimentary water Second towel too small Tea tray afterthought Only one soap two people No toilet extra considering how expensive it was
38272,Batty Langley s, Teeny tiny hairdryers with all the power of a gnat s fart I so dislike it when hotels forget that women are customers too , Very quiet hotel yet in the bustling heart of the City of London by Liverpool Street Honesty bar also has reasonable prices for an honesty bar 
38273,Batty Langley s,No Negative, I stayed for one night at the beautiful Batty Langley s It was the best Hotel I could choose The staff was fantastic very helpful and gave me an amazing Restaurant recommendation The room was big enough for myself or for a couple That I had to ring the door bell to be able to enter the Hotel gave me a very safe feeling The breakfast to the bed the next morning was the perfect ending of my short trip to London I will come back for sure 
38274,Batty Langley s,No Negative, The hotel staff were really helpful It was a wonderful place to stay The rooms were lovely A fantastic boutique hotel that isn t try hard at all 
38275,Batty Langley s,No Negative, everyone that we met at the hotel were very friendly When me and my bf arrived they already knew to expect us and who we were The location was amazing breakfast was generous and was served in the room it was raining the weekend we stayed and we did not have an umbrella with us and they had an umrella prepared for each guest so we used it whenever we wanted to go around the area The room and the whole hotel was very cozy and full of character Definitely going to stay here again 
38276,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Small luxury boutique hotel georgian period antiques charming Great location 5 minutes to Liverpool St station aldgate east and shoreditch Great restarants bars clubs near by walking distance 
38277,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Brilliant hotel The staff are friendly and the room we stayed in Joseph Moser was amazing It had a canopy bath Speakers in the bathroom which you could connect to using your phone and a massive bed On the ground floor they have a private patio for you to smoke from They also allowed us to checkout a little later I will definitely be coming back 
38278,Batty Langley s, Food options and quality did enjoy but could be better for that quality hotel Add parking website to email re parking, Quiet grew staff great looking hotel Good linen
38279,Batty Langley s, It is all most like they had a wonderful plan started well and then stopped there are none of the little extras all of the competition have no tea coffee making facilities newspapers complimentary water all the little extras on booking site it advertises bar but only a small courtesy set up Absolutely it has potential but at these prices there are much better options I will not be returning , All ok but nothing special nothing memorable
38280,Batty Langley s, No tea making stuff no shower cap in a room with a shower that makes it impossible not to get wet hair Two tissues in a box instead of a full box Tiny room small bed for two , Decor good bed linen good location 
38281,Batty Langley s, Nothing, Hotel with classic character and personal touch Super helpful and friendly staff The surrounding area is full of art open markets and restaurants Loved it
38282,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Beautiful small hotel Full of antiques including the WC being a Throne Not far walk from Liverpool Street Station Close to shopping and lots of resturants The staff were excellent and could not have been more helpful or friendly 
38283,Batty Langley s, It was a nightmare to journey to central London in a cab took an entire hour on a Saturdag night It s perfectly do able by tube but not in heels dressed for dinner The room lacked a comfortable armchair and a dressing table or an area with a mirror for a lady to make up was very much missed , Beautiful hotel decadent in style beautifully furnished Breakfast in bed was fantastic we loved the honesty bar and areas such as the library and the courtyard Staff were very helpful and concientious 
38284,Batty Langley s,No Negative, Eighteenth century charm everywhere you see even TV is hidden behind mirror doors only the push button phone looked too modern Loved the stylish and cosy bar and the library where you can enjoy reading old books sipping a single malt in front of a fireplace 
38285,Batty Langley s, Should have been breakfast included for the price paid , Amazing hotel absolutely spotless and luxurious staff were lovely would definitely stay again 
38286,Batty Langley s, we would have appreciated free tea coffee making facilities , We thought the hotel was excellent and the style and decorations were I keeping with the area The room bathroom and furnishings were lovely The bed was comfortable and there were lots of nice features throughout the hotel 
38287,Batty Langley s, The location was a bit inconvenient for us , We were really impressed by hotel design concept and close attention to every detail We we happy to meet designer when we were checking out and express our delight by the brilliant work she and her team has done
