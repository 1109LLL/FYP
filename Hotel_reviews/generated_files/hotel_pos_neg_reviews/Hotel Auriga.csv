475409,Hotel Auriga, surroundings of the hotel homeless people old school bathroom with difficult managing of water temperature very bad almost not working airconditioning, Proximity to central station interior style of the hotel 24 hour reception
475410,Hotel Auriga, Each room doesn t have a coffee machine even when I request for a hot water machine they just sent me a hot water in a bottle Air condition doesn t work last day before we check out It s just switch off automatically while we do nothing I found a smell shirt in the wardrobe at the first day I came into the room, Good location friendly staff
475411,Hotel Auriga, Everything was very nice , The bed was extra comfy The bed linens and the towels were very soft and extra clean The location is great two minutes from the main train station 
475412,Hotel Auriga, Everything was good, Very delicious breakfast we had a room on the sixth floor and a big balcony with a beautiful view on the Pirelli Tower The hotel is in a very convenient location 5 minutes from the railway station and 20 minutes from the city center We will definitely choose this hotel again when staying in Milan 
475413,Hotel Auriga, The breakfast was adequate but is your typical European breakfast variety We tended to go have breakfast at local cafe s just because we wanted to experience the local food , The hotel was just like the photos The hotel was clean and the rooms very nice The staff were very friendly The hotel had a nice boutique feel to it and was very close to the metro and train station that we were using Would stay there again
475414,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, Hotel with old but well maintained equipment In general everything fuctioned pretty well Garage is behind the hotel Garage 2000 however one has to leave keys of the car to the garage staff In vicinity is also an other garage not sure whether you have to leave keys also there 
475415,Hotel Auriga, The staff member who did my check in had plenty of attitude he appeared to be bothered as he ran through my check in and gave me a key But that s all I had to ask where s the elevator What is the WIFI access code What time and where is breakfast He is not the kind of guy I would want greeting my hotel guests , Location was great Room was clean and quiet comfortable bed Most of the staff was very helpful 
475416,Hotel Auriga, The pillows could be softer for my taste , Friendly staff The fact that we got a parking spot right in front off the hotel though that was more by luck I suppose The breakfast was good and the wait staff was attentive 
475417,Hotel Auriga, Staff were rude and this was such a contrast to the other two accommodations we had in Italy Also the online description included airport shuttle and we had to go to a bus stop near the train station and buy our own tickets The staff wouldn t provide any times or information about this service ,No Positive
475418,Hotel Auriga, Would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room Otherwise all good , Proximity to train station metro and airport shuttle Decor was very interesting and we liked its effect Good breakfast Restaurants nearby Cafe Pirelli Nouvo next door was a gem and had great happy hour with very jovial proprietor Quiet room even though area was busy Easy metro access to city center 
475419,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, Located just across the square from the railway station this hotel was perfect for an overnight stay The reception staff were a little off hand but check in was smooth and efficient and our room was quite lovely Most of all the bed was super comfy and exactly what we needed after a long day of travel Next morning we enjoyed an excellent breakfast buffet with plenty to choose from 
475420,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, Even the single room has the enough and comfort space The decor n style inside of the room really impressive Breakfast was wonderful n various each days Staff are kindly Good location definitely 
475421,Hotel Auriga, Everything was OK , Excellent location just 2 minutes from central Station metro station is 100 m away good breakfast comparing to Italian standards very clean very good wifi connection large beds 
475422,Hotel Auriga, The decor is a bit dark Could do with a brightening up , The location which is close to the central station The staff also were very accommodating and stored our bags overnight for us when we went on an overnight trip 
475423,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, Not a 4 start hotel but nice for a quick stay in Milan Comfortable and clean Localisation was practical for reaching the airport or when we come by car 
475424,Hotel Auriga, Lots of homeless people near the hotel The rooms are a bit old Breakfast is rather plain, Really close to the railway station and the metro The rooms are very quiet Unusual interior design
475425,Hotel Auriga, Hard to locate English TV channels Lighting a little too dark , Very comfortable clean hotel in a very convenient location for all public transport Polite friendly staff Appeared to have fresh linen towels every day 
475426,Hotel Auriga, The hotel is far from 4 stars When we arrived first thing we noticed was a very strong cigarette smell I am a casual smoker and are not usually bothered but this was only you could smell The receptionist did not say hello instead decided to take phone calls and ignore us for 10min Once he finally decided to serve us he just handed the keys and sent us off The room was smelly small and not comfortable the slightest Our beds were rock hard and we found out that two towels were used as sheets on both beds We decided to stay for one night and see how the breakfast was Another disappointment Boiled eggs from the day before no toast or anything fresh What they called coffee was some kind of dark brown muddy water that was not drinkable at all This was the worst hotel experience I have had We checked out and stayed in a lovely Starhotel Ritz 10 min walk from the Central station , The location 
475427,Hotel Auriga, The shower head was in the middle of the bath which meant there was not a lot of space to move and the bath is very slippery , Very spacious rooms and the connecting rooms were useful for three people traveling together Decent wifi connection and the continental breakfast had a good selection 
475428,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, Walk out of the train station into Plazza and you can see the hotel across the road on the right Breakfast basic continental but adequate Bed very comfortable king 
475429,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, This was a wedding anniversary trip and the staff gave us a room with a garden balcony of which there were only 3 or 4 We thought this was a nice touch The included breakfast was nice and had a good variety Our room was spacious and had a sitting area in addition to the bed Location was right across from the train station 
475430,Hotel Auriga, We have never stayed in an hotel that didn t have tea and coffee making facilities Is this normal in Milan , The location was fabulous and the room very comfortable Breakfast was great 
475431,Hotel Auriga, Our first impression during check in was that the reception staff was not very friendly It could be that they are not fluent in English Although the hotel is within walking distance there is a building nearby where quite a number of homeless sleep overnight this may pose as a security risk we didn t run into any issues though The breakfast was so so with a very small selection some cold meats cheeses and biscuits No warm hot food , The location of the hotel is okay as it is walking distance from the train and metro station The hotel room does not have a kettle but the staff at the bar will gladly heat up some water and put it in a teapot complete with a set of tea cups when requested 
475432,Hotel Auriga, the pictures for the double bed room did not reflect the actual room but most likely a more exclusive room type, The coffee was really low quality for Italy Otherwise everything was fine and the hotel was very kind in accommodating me with my 2 kids in a double bed room without extra charges 
475433,Hotel Auriga, Room was very small Breakfast is horrible few options and not even those are of the best quality Absolutely no vegetables and fruits were mostly canned than fresh , Great location right by the central station very easy to get from the Bergamo airport Metro station 3mins walk 
475434,Hotel Auriga, The room is small then I think , The bed is good And we can rest in bathtub The hotel is closed to milan center station The staff is kind And breakfast is nice We was fun at this hotel 
475435,Hotel Auriga, Its really old fashion It doesnt look nor feel as a 4 star hotel It should be updated The whole hotel is old It has a 20 tv , The beds were really confy Its super closed to the train station The breakfast is really good The personel was helpfull and nice 
475436,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, Very very bad staff There was an old man in the front desk who just ignored me many times in a 5 min conversation He was so impatience that he just left me go to my room without saying any word All the staff here should be trained to be more polite Very slow WiFi 
475437,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, Great location for use of central train station to continue your journey across Europe Outside the main train station there s a presence of people that doesn t present the city in good light needs addressing 
475438,Hotel Auriga, The WiFi signal was really weak it was completely useless , Very close to Malino Centrale and some Great restaurant in 2 different directions The Staff were are really helpful I Was thinking about Baggage Deposit service in central station but they helped me and keep my baggage for 3 days with out fee Even they offered this and I didn t know about it 
475439,Hotel Auriga, The breakfast was for a 2 star hotel There were only two tiny bottles that were shampoo and shower gel together The towels smelled awful and were not soft The hotel should be a 2 star hotel for sure and deserves no more than 40euros per night, It was next to Statione Centrale
475440,Hotel Auriga, It took us a while to figure out how to use the airconditioner and the hot water system wasn t working properly so we had almost cold showers , We were in Milan for only one night so the proximity to central station was fantastic and the room was comfortable and met our needs after a long 24 hours in transit 
475441,Hotel Auriga, There is nothing to mention All was perfect , 1 Great location 3 minute walk from Milano Centrale 2 Superb wi fi connection 3 Calming soundproofed and very comfortable room 4 Rich breakfast 5 Helpful and kind stuff I d highly recommend the Auriga hotel and I d stay here again 
475442,Hotel Auriga, Breakfast has too less of variations but they offer a great drinks such as selections of coffee hot chocolate , Location is perfect very convenient from the Central Station Very outstanding decoration style The room is very clean and the staffs are very friendly and helpful 
475443,Hotel Auriga, Just a bit tired From the outside to the lift to wifi sometimes works to keys on massive weights Missing bedding in first day Response was they must have thought it was for one person No apology Never sorted Not the end of the world but kind of summed up the experience, Location excellent 24 hr reception Staff were on the whole friendly
475444,Hotel Auriga, We stayed in family room on first floor facing the road The windows had shutters but the windows do not block any noise at all They should up grade windows in that room or get heavy curtains to block noise Very noisy in the am , Location and area is excellent with great conveniences around The rooms were large and clean 
475445,Hotel Auriga, Receptionists were unhelpful did not tell you any information about the room breakfast check out etc There was no bread in the breakfast we were waiting half hour for it When the save in the room broke down he said you must wait till tomorrow morning After then I persuade them to come tonight Also nobody was there to help with a luggage This is unbelievable for the four star hotel in Milano ,No Positive
475446,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and kind The room was lovely location is fantastic very good breakfast with lot s of choices Would choose again this hotel in the future
475447,Hotel Auriga, Tea coffee maker not in the room is a real down side if like us you need one first thing in the morning, Great location for the central train station plenty of restaraunts close by but use the underground to get to the shops and duomo 
475448,Hotel Auriga, I was really unhappy with the hotel choice Very old needs refurbishment Poor breakfast Small room Not value for money One of the reception staff was not friendly at all Never again , Location was good 
475449,Hotel Auriga, There is no facility for boiling water in the room Travelling with a child in tow this would be great convenience , The hotel is small and cosy I had the double bed It was big though not very comfortable The hotel is relatively quiet I definitely like that the location is close to the train station If like me you have to lug around two luggages then short distance is important 
475450,Hotel Auriga, White bread at the breakfast Lobby and bar are not cosey Restaurant choice is very limited but taste , Close to central station and centre Some restaurants in the area Very silent room at the back Great beds Very friendly and helpful staff 
475451,Hotel Auriga, There are very many homeless people a few metres from the hotel entrance that you have to pass on your way from the train station , Nice hotel close to the station 
475452,Hotel Auriga, Breakfast options could have been better , The Barman also prepared the limited meal options but was very happy to offer to provide alternative choices with ingredients available to him 
475453,Hotel Auriga, Slightly annoying whistling sound coming from window seal due to venting in room Not sure if it was just our room Wouldn t notice it if you had the heating fan on though , Spacious room and bathroom stylish classic decoration comfy chairs in room good breakfast choices and nice bar area for drinks or coffee Close to Stazione Centrale 200m and only 15 min walk to Stazione Garibaldi Several good restaurants in area to the north of the hotel Tram close by to get to Duomo area but we walked even late at night and it was a very pleasant 20 25 min walk with lots to see on the way Overall very happy and would stay there again 
475454,Hotel Auriga, Room old and drastically in need of renovation Desk staff surly over charged tax on departure no heating in room Lots of homeless people on the streets nearby , Breakfast
475455,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, The location is fantastic as its just a stone throw away from Milan Central train station staff are fantastic specially the asian staff very corteous and helpful Highly recommended place to stay Breakfast was superb Thank u
475456,Hotel Auriga, The only negative i can say is that I asked for a double size bed and what i got was 2 single beds put close together At first i thought to address the issue with the reception but it was late in the night and after that i just didn t bother with it , The personnel of Auriga where very nice and well mannered even when i had some questions about the security deposit they where more than happy to help and address any issue i may have The guy at the reception gave me his card to contact if i had any issues after i check with my bank Great location near the Centrale if you like to move around with public transportation 
475457,Hotel Auriga, Unfortunately around the corner from the hotel slot of homeless refugees so sometimes a stale smell of urine from the night before, The location was very good the bedrooms had big beds and the rooms were all clean
475458,Hotel Auriga, The hotel decoration is a nightmare Striped dark gold green and red with wallpaper peeling off in places Old fashioned place old and grumpy staff We will never go back again to this hotel , The location is close to the central station so easy to move around the city 
475459,Hotel Auriga, Everything was perfect , Elegant hotel near the main train station in Milan Very comfortable beds good size room with large bathroom with tub and separate shower Fantastic service at the Reception very good breakfast with lot s of choices Would choose again this hotel in the future 
475460,Hotel Auriga, I worry about the danger of the shower being located in the bath and the fact that there is a shower curtain rather than a solid glass door I had trouble adjusting the hot water to the right temperature for the shower I also couldn t work out how to open the safe using the given instructions Otherwise all worked well for me price is a factor and this compares well with other hotels close by , Great breakfast plenty of choice and lovely dining area Comfortable bed and nice sitting area great location and a perfect choice for a short stay I like the fact that this hotel is not huge and that the room I had offered a nice view of Stazione Centrale and surrounds A very convenient location for restaurants and transport to the airports and the Metro station for yellow and red lines connecting to all other lines It s an easy walk into the city centre and Duomo area My room was very quiet despite being located in a busy area I really like the interior design of this hotel quirky and interesting and fun 
475461,Hotel Auriga, Not sure if its a misunderstanding on our part but we are quite sure that the reception said our taxi fare was fixed fee However when we got to the airport the driver asked for more than what was mentioned to us at the hotel Even though its a small amount we left Milan feeling cheated Hopefully the hotel can rectify this problem from happening to future travelers Photo of taxi attached below , Good location walking distance from the Metro train station 
475462,Hotel Auriga, The hotel may look old fashioned compared to some of the newer hotels but other than that it was probably one of the better places we stayed at during our whole trip Elevators are a bit slow though and there s really just one available , Breakfast had plenty of choices and portions were refilled regularly I liked that they had an adjoining room option Location was also great walking distance to the central train station and a 10 12 minute taxi ride away from Linate Airport 
475463,Hotel Auriga, the hotel doesn t provide a kettle every time we need water we have to go downstairs to ask waiter in the bar for water and the room for family 3 people is not so spacious as the photo shown on website but our family only have one night stay it s okay, really like the location very close to central railway station so it s very easy to take a train and take metro to get many places within 30 mins
475464,Hotel Auriga, The signal strength of the Free WiFi was so poor I logged in using the WiFi offered by the Hotel next door , The service in the bar was excellent and the barman very pleasant Other front line staff could take a leaf out of his book 
475465,Hotel Auriga, In side the hotel inside the room looks dark Atmosphere of the hotel three decades ago At my room it took much time to get warm showering and I have caught a cold ,No Positive
475466,Hotel Auriga, Maybe because I stayed on a Saturday night the room rate was very pricey for it s offered The design of the shower was a bit interesting not the most practical design but it does to job anyway , Very close to Milan station Staff were fairly friendly and could speak pretty good English 
475467,Hotel Auriga, The hotel does not have its own airport shuttle as implied in the booking com website however there is a train to Malapensa airport from Milano Centrale which is a few minutes walk away , The hotel is very easy to find when arriving at Milano Centrale More savoury options for breakfast would be good The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable 
475468,Hotel Auriga, No complaints , The room was very comfortable Plush towels and bed linens Buffet breakfast was included but we had to miss it because of our early flight We were pleased to get a room with a balcony It offered a good view of Milano Centrale It was a quiet area too but close to the Metro for visiting the more touristy areas This area had plenty of restaurants close by to choose from for dining 
475469,Hotel Auriga, A little run down and out of date could use updating The location is a little far from the more happening parts of Milan but within walking distance generally , Nice staff members
475470,Hotel Auriga, Could have done with a little extra light in the bedroom , We travelled by train and were able to walk out the front door of Milan Centrale and see the hotel signage Only about 3minute easy walk with the luggage Twenty minutes walk to Duomo Plaza with many photographic opportunities along the way and shopping The hotel has a quirky Art Deco interior that I loved The room had a large comfy bed with a sitting room area and balcony Staff were always helpful Breakfast had a wide variety of options I had no issues with the wifi 
475471,Hotel Auriga, Limited breakfast choices No tea coffee facilities in the room , Spacious room with fantastic bathroom Friendly and welcoming staff especially the barman who looked after us during dinner Easy walk from the train station 
475472,Hotel Auriga, Internet was perfectly adequate but signal strength could be improved , High calibre staff knowledgeable friendly efficient After checkout needed to spend a few hours in the lounge to complete some work this was no problem 
475473,Hotel Auriga, The bathroom was a bit old fashioned i e bath tub with shower curtain But all very clean, Very friendly staff really close to the station large room with comfy bed
475474,Hotel Auriga, Not much, Good location beside central station Staff is courteous and helpful But the hotel is outdated and furniture although has antique feel but visibly tired
475475,Hotel Auriga, I stayed there for 4 nights and I booked 2 rooms there was no kettle in the rooms and when i asked for a hot water and i took only one English breakfast tea bag they charged me for 5 euros which is not reasonable as the the whole pack is less than 5 euros and it contains much more Also there was insects that you can t see but it pinch in the room from the frist night so we couldn t sleep and I asked them for a spray for those insects they provided me but the problem was that it didn t kill those insects and we spent the 4 nights almost without sleeping because of that , Only the location
475476,Hotel Auriga, Breakfast was average not good bread selection no hot food and the food was not fresh Also no tea or coffee facility in the room and no complementary water provided in the room Finally the wifi was really bad the connection dropped frequently and it was very slow , Good location near Milan central train station Clean and comfortable beds
475477,Hotel Auriga, Some family room arent up to date than need to be modernized , Very comfortable beds and also larger than usual Good choice of sweet food for cakes croissants for breakfast excellent coffee 
475478,Hotel Auriga, The staffs could be nicer and there should be a complementary bottle of still water for each guest as other hotels do , The bedrooms are nicely decorated very clean and comfortable The location is excellent Less than 5 mins walk to Metro and very close to the central train station 
475479,Hotel Auriga, It s and old buildind with a fare decoration Not so much for the price But can t complain , The location it s great a few steps from Milano Central It s also waking distance to Brera de fashion district and the Duomo cathedral 
475480,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, The bed was excellent wide and comfortable A generous bathroom Breakfast was delicious and plentiful The decor cheerful and individual For us the location was perfect as it is 2 min from the railway station 
475481,Hotel Auriga, The entire hotel has good wifi right through the building with units on each level However our room at the back of the hotel on level 2 was very week , Good location short walk from Milano Centrale Railway station and restaurants The included breakfast was excellent quality 
475482,Hotel Auriga, Poor lighting in the rooms , Excellent location just opposite the train metro station Clean and comfortable room Very big bathroom Nice breakfast and excellent cappuccino 
475483,Hotel Auriga, The noise I think the walls are too thin and we could heard all the bathroom noises from our neighbours bathroom The breakfast is really sad and poor no vegetables at all only highly processed cereals and even the cheese was bad Awful coffee as well , Very clean and comfortable beds 
475484,Hotel Auriga, Guest computer old slow a more up to date model would have been useful , Breakfast was best out of all hotels we used in Italy Room was large bed huge staff helpful very happy 
475485,Hotel Auriga, Didn t meet any future husband, Rapid efficient check in Room has all but perhaps another plug outlet would be ideal The place is immaculate The service is exceptional The food is good at breakfast I look forward to recommending to buddies again 
475486,Hotel Auriga, The breakfast menu was fine but a choice of cereals rich in bran would have been appreciated , We were very pleased with the room comfortable beds and bathroom the cosy atmosphere of the reception and breakfast bar the nice staff and the central location 
475487,Hotel Auriga, The bed was a little hard One of the employees in the front desk was quite rude The TV was programmed only with Italian channels , The location next to Milano central train station was excellent for tourists The room was very confortable and spacious and the bathroom was very big The breakfast had a lot of choices The hotel was very clean 
475488,Hotel Auriga, Old furniture in the bathroom There was also some smell from the drain system in the bathroom There is no a tea kettle in the room , Close location to the Milan central train station Good choice if you visit Milan for a few days and then plan to use transportation by train 
475489,Hotel Auriga, guy in the bar does not know the difference between whisky and brandy had poor English, close to railway station Centrale calm metro station nearby
475490,Hotel Auriga, Hotel has seen better days Interior felt very dated elevator squeeked and felt like it would stop any second I could hear every word from the hallway and the neighbouring room The shower was merely a drizzle Terrible value for money I was expecting something much better at this price and ratings , Centrally located
475491,Hotel Auriga,No Negative, It s good enough for its purpose which is just staying overnight to catch a train next morning being a block away from train station But other than that nothing to rave about it s very outdated and kind of old and grimy looking 
475492,Hotel Auriga, Windows insulation was not really good in my room Construction works on the floor and rooms next to mine normally ok but loud during the morning in case you plan on sleeping till late , Excellent location very close tot he main station Good wi fi connection it should be a given but it s not the case in Italian hotels so it s worth mentioning
475493,Hotel Auriga, The staff was OK but not particularly friendly The place is a bit worn Low pressure in the shower Wifi comes and goes I got a good last minute price I would not have been too happy if I had paid closer to the full price , Comfortable bed Decent breakfast buffet included in the price Very close to the central station but the area felt calm and safe Amusingly opulent old world decor 
475494,Hotel Auriga, A person in a neighbouring room happened to be a chain smoker on a non smoking floor apparently I fell asleep to the smell of cigarettes and was awaken by it How did I know the person was a chain smoker well I could hear the distinctive sound of the old style toilet flusher every 10 mins effective in getting rid of cigarette butts but noisy If I m on a non smoking floor I don t expect to smell cigarettes , Staff lovely personable and helpful The room was a very good size It was comfortable and clean 
475495,Hotel Auriga, the elevator was old and made a squeaky noises unfortunately we couldn t connect Wi Fi in our room no matter what , the location is great just 2 minutes from a Metro station at the lobby there is a computer with printer for the guests use free of charge the room was big and tidy comfortable bed 
475496,Hotel Auriga, Shower is not great as they have this thermostat to control the water and is not very friendly, Breakfast was very decent compare to other hotels I stayed in this area Excellent room space
475497,Hotel Auriga, Little noise not very high coming from the bathroom probably the fan , Position of the hotel close to the central station Courtesy of the staff Good breakfast 
475498,Hotel Auriga, It s very very noisy The AC fan and especially the elevator are very noisy From 6AM you can no longer sleep due to the elevator noise The elvator is very old ,No Positive
475499,Hotel Auriga, Being close to the station you are also close to the homeless 40 for a bottle of prosecco is high in my opinion Don t have them do any dry cleaning , Great spot close to the train station and metro Fantastic restaurant nearby Great size rooms for the price When you get out of the train station look to 1 o clock and you will see the sign for the hotel 
475500,Hotel Auriga, One member of staff on reception having to check people in and answer the phone Thus waited ages for duration of long phone call to check in , Chosen for proximity to main railway station which was good Area felt fairly safe although a little tired Hotel room was a little dark but adequately furnished and equipped overall Limited public space Very good wifi Good breakfast buffet 
475501,Hotel Auriga, The wifi in our room wasn t working at all despite us making a few inquiries with reception , The hotel is in walking distance from Milan Central train station which was great
