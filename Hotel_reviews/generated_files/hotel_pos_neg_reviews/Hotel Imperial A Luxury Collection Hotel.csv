352737,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, The only small thing we did not like was the need to order a boiled egg at breakfast We had to wait 5 minutes before it was ready Why not have boiled eggs ready So easy Also 109 euro s for parking for 3 days , Friendly and professional staff Nice silent and clean room with good airco Fast internet Great food at the restaurants GREAT bed with good pillows Nice bar where you can sit comfortable and quietly I would recommend this hotel to my friends if they wanted to stay in Vienna Very happy we stayed here 
352738,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, My room I was disappointed with My friends room was far bigger Same price mine a double bed theirs twin Mine was a bit faded glory Neither room had any tea coffee facilities The other two hotels we stayed at in Vienna and Bratislava did Considering the price I paid not impressed , Beautiful setting Special birthday for me and my two friends to celebrate
352739,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, Breakfast as stated No other criticisms , The room was spacious and comfortable We had a newly refurbished room Staff were of high calibre Lunch and dinner were excellent but breakfast was very poor We went out for breakfast as the location of the hotel readily permits this The location of the hotel is very good for taking advantage of the superb things that Vienna has to offer For example across the street is the greatest concert hall and 250m away is the State Opera house Fine restaurants are within a short walk The concierge service was also excellent 
352740,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, it is expensive but luxurious , Imperial Grandeur with attentive service at a price Absolutely beautiful interior great Jazz bar very good location 
352741,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, Shame our taxi dropped us off at the back entrance which meant we didn t have anyone to greet us when we arrived , Fantastic bar Beautiful marble stunning chandeliers and very opulent Delicious cocktails served by friendly staff Had a great meal in The Opus Restaurant too Top class food and great Austrian wines 
352742,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, Nothing You get what you pay for, The most elegant hotel in Vienna You are treated like royalty with grace and elegance I felt as though I was a guest of the Emperor himself
352743,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, A little bit tiring Since the building was very old Front desk staff are a little bit old and lack of some and passion Unlike Hotel Scher , Grand hotel very historical 
352744,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, The value for money the hotel is not justify the price, Nothing in particular I won t stay in this property again It is not a luxury property which I expected it to be 
352745,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, Shower did not work no response from staff to repair Food NOT 5 star Hard to get any food reservations in hotel , Location concierge staff 
352746,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is simply magnificent grand and impressive but at the same time cozy and welcoming My room had a very comfortable bed and was very silent qualities I greatly appreciate The concierge Orlando has been extremely kind and helpful with all my requests 
352747,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, Size of bath room in a De Luxe room did not exceed 35 sqft Internet did not work properly You need to be a computer guru to get it going , Everything was perfect except the items on the right I can suggest the hotel by all means 
352748,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, All was very satisfactory, Turkish gentleman at the Front desk Cengiz was extremely helpful he is an great asset to the property where he creates memorable experiences 
352749,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, Nothing, Professionalism of staff Excellent restaurants able to provide gluten free fare which was lovely this is VERY unusual even in5 star hotels in U K Location was superb The sheer joy of intelligent courteous informed staff who care about their guests experience 
352750,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, expensive breakfast with very limited choices of food , great location elegant furniture and design very friendly staff valet parking wifi they really care about their costumers and they let you feel like king they gave us free upgrade to a doplex suite with complementary fruit and sweets for our wedding anniversary definitely will come again to this fantastic hotel 
352751,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel,No Negative, Luxury hotel with excellent facilities Beautiful decor in both public areas and bedrooms Very helpful and knowledgeable staff Walking distance to most major sites in Vienna but public transport cheap and easy to use Tram stop within 50m 
352752,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, What is there not to like Except perhaps having a spa would be a nice option to have , Having stayed at this hotel 6 years before and I was so looking forward to returning back to it Staying at this hotel is a trip back in time surrounded by the exquisite decor that evokes romantic feelings truly luxurious room super comfortable bed bathroom is a delight breakfast is a feast welcome was impeccable 
352753,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, The bar area was a little small We would have liked a drink in the bar after dinner but some tables had been reserved and some had only 1 or 2 people sat at them most tables had 4 armchairs around them so if only 1 person was sat there it left no availability for others to sit down The bar staff also did not seem as friendly or attentive as other staff members and if you were not sat at a table did not seem in a hurry to serve you , Wow what a hotel We stayed in a standard room but this was one of the best rooms we have ever stayed in If this was a standard room then the other rooms must have been really impressive We had amazing decor and chandeliers in both the bedroom and bathroom The hotel was beautiful and we were able to park easily outside The hotel was also centrally situated within easy walking distance of the Hofburg Palace and main shopping area right next to the Musikverein and close to the underground to get to the Schonbrunn Palace The staff were all friendly professional warm and welcoming and were very happy to help with anything we needed

352762,Hotel Imperial A Luxury Collection Hotel, We decided to treat ourselves and have breakfast at the hotel even though it is not cheap we though it would make a perfect end to our holidays However the cafe let the hotel down We ordered coffee and it only arrived after a reminder Husband ordered an omelette and I the fruit salad we had expected to eat together but the omelette came first and husband had all but finished it before my fruit arrived This should not happen it can t be too difficult to get the two items ready at the same time Service seems chaotic but I can t understand why it should be so in a 5 hotel , Lovely treat at the end of our walking holiday in the Alps Very friendly and welcoming reception staff Beautiful bedroom stunning bathroom and ultra comfortable bed Nice touches like fruit in the room and fresh water and chocolates at turn down time
