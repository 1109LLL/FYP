422777,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Could be more English speaking tv channels Bbc world news and USA stock exchange news didn t entertain our teens and Disney channel too young , Friendly helpful staff Comfy beds Nothing too much trouble 
422778,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The pool area is VERY small and it was boiling hot during the day Even the tables and the bar area were poor I would not consider it as a rooftop alternative to the beach , I only stayed one night and had to leave extremely early to the airport but even then the stay was really good and I wish I had more time The location is great if one wants to be near the beach Otherwise it is quite far from all the classics Barcelona itineraries However it is beautiful and in the summer especially it was a plus to be able to walk by the beach in the evening and have a nice run The hotel in itself is really nice 
422779,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Not quite like the photos but I liked it anyway Teeny tiny roof top pool , Close to convention centre train bus light rail and beaches Fantastic staff Clean rooms comfortable bed 
422780,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, There were not many choices of restaurants It is isolated from Barcelona s main attractions but thenyou do have the Metro close by , Hotel was close to the beach and the Metro It had a parking garage that cost extra but was well worth keeping your vehicle safe I would hate to drive in Barcelona but this location was easy to get to arriving from France 
422781,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Some of the staff were good but some less so One of the reception staff was adamant that you couldn t get the airport train from El Clot station which you can and was a little abrupt about it It is also unfortunate that you cannot adjust the air con in your room , Nice hotel good room
422782,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, It was slightly annoying when every morning the beds around the pool had towels placed on them to reserve them but yet the people were nowhere insight for hours so maybe a sign or something to say that you cannot reserve the beds and possibly more sunbeds We were there 3 days and didn t get a single opportunity to sit around the pool But other than that which really isn t the hotel s fault more that people are just rude we had a lovely time and could not find any fault in the hotel , Absolutely loved our stay at Attica 21 I emailed the hotel many times leading up to our stay to confirm the few extras I had booked as a surprise for my husband and to also check payment methods etc They replied instantly and were very helpful therefore I have been very pleased with their communication Fantastic location and the breakfast was absolutely delicious 
422783,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar,No Negative, Friendly staff Buffet for breakfast offered healthy choices and friendly staff working breakfast area made it pleasant very responsive front desk staff to requests great access to beach pool is nice to cool off from hot days out and about the city 
422784,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The location was a little bit out of the way in terms of Barcelona city centre which was slightly misleading from the Booking com description It wasn t even on our guide book map Saying that it took about half an hour by tube to get into the city so it wasn t major , The room was lovely and the cleaners were very good The hotel pool was great and was extremely relaxing although towards the end of visit when it was the weekend it would have been better to fit in more sun beds Extremely pleasant and relaxing stay
422785,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The location was a long way from the centre and there wasn t much luxury to the hotel it was abit like an upmarket holiday inn I question the star rating,No Positive
422786,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Everything was great no negatives, The man who checked us in was lovely let us leave luggage in the storage as we arrived early and provided all the answers to my questions before even asking Nice breakfast and the pool area also
422787,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The bed wasn t very comfy and was disappointing there was no cafe or bar area on the roof top with the pool , The staff were lovely and helpful the hotel was so clean and always smelt nice when you walked in 
422788,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The staff was very impatient unhelpful and snarky We did not have power the first night of our stay we were not offered any refunds or change if rooms since they were fully booked The pool closes at 9PM sharp which was disappointing as well , The room was very modern clean and close to the beach 
422789,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Location too far out had trouble getting taxi to bring us back to hotel late at night had to order a taxi at reception every time we needed one as taxi rank right outside always empty Swimming pool is only 2 feet 60cm deep Reception staff some helpful some not so Charged 7 euros for room key at early arrival First time ever happened to us If the rooms ready it s ready isn t it 15 euros each for optional breakfast forget it Cafe locally coffee and pastries 2euro Bland euro hotel more suited to conference delegates and business people , Comfy beds clean hotel
422790,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, I was dissaponted from the bar at pool it was advertised but it wasnt there maybe only in some weeks in year Not in May in 26 C , Amazing breakfests and good service also very clean 
422791,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Breakfast dining area very basic Closed off breakfast room as 2 guests arrived slightly late for breakfast and would not serve them I felt that was very harsh Pool was tiny and dirty when we arrived No bar beside pool as advertised , Hotel was generally quiet but there was a group of women in a room next door to us and they seemed to be having drinks parties at all hours of the day and night 
422792,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Nothing to complain about , Nice quiet location short walk to nearest metro Clean room and spacious bathroom Breakfast had good variety Helpful staff Would stay there again 
422793,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Noise from other rooms no kettle just coffee jug, Beds comfy however noise from other rooms walls very thin tea facilities poor no kettle just a coffee machine 
422794,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, We enjoyed our overall stay at this hotel but we wouldn t stay again if we came back to Barcelona The walls between the rooms were so thin that you could hear everything We was very unlucky to have selfish and noisy people next door to us We could hear them snoring one of them coughing every 2 minutes continuously throughout the evening and night using the hairdryer and talking amongst themselves at 5 45am This disturbed our sleep so much but when we asked to move rooms the next day we couldn t as the hotel was fully booked So we had to move our beds to the opposite side of the room so the noise was more bearable , The selection of food at breakfast time was very good and there was everything you could hope for which was all very nice The staff were all very friendly and the facilities were good 
422795,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Room temp did get a bit hot noisy aircon so left window open all night which was OK as it is not a noisy area Not many sun loungers picture on website makes out pool is bigger than it is , Breakfast Bar well stocked Short distance to Beach Metro and places to eat 5 stops on Metro to centre of Barcelona Open top Bus tours stopped 100m from hotel Hotel very clean and staff very friendly comfortable beds and could not hear other rooms 
422796,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, My partner didn t think that the breakfast was up to the mark as there was no bacon or fried eggs , Crossants extra flakey bed very comfortable location very good metro station very close sea beach is not far from the hotel
422797,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The pillows were long and not that comfortable We had only coffee without caffeine , I liked the room and hotel lobby spacious and elegant The room was clean and windows faced a nice view of Torre de les Aig es del Bes s The personnel was nice and helpful The location is nice next to the beach and beautiful parks I would recommend it particularly to travellers with families kids 
422798,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Coffee sachets were not replenished so had to ask for them, The staff were brilliant Specifically the day staff on the desk the cleaner on floor one and the bar man 
422799,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, No restaurants bar in immediate area but there were plenty by the beach 33 min walk and the Metro was 2 mins around the block , Staff attitude and cleanliness Very modern and comfortable Just what you need when you re there for a few days exploring 
422800,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Holidaying with young son and placed in adjoining room with loud girls who were partying untill late Better planning on hotel s part would have been prevented this disturbance , Comfy bed Clean room Safe area 
422801,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, We couldn t control our own air con We could turn it on or off but there was a sticker on the wall explaining that the temp was centrally controlled It was blasting out warm air on days when it was 23 degrees outside Made getting to sleep in a hot room difficult as there was no breeze outside opening the window was futile , Bilingual staff who were always willing to go the extra mile 
422802,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Nothing we enjoyed our stay and would go back , We liked the big room comfy bed helpful staff the hotel bar Easy to reach by metro beach front in easy walking distance Restaurants nearby were good 
422803,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Breakfast restaurant could serve room service s dishes, Great location for a congress at Centre de Convencions Int far from a 10 min walk Clean and very comfortable Great internet Very good room service 
422804,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Poor room wall isolation, Located close to metro station quite room and district spacious comfortable bed close to the seashore and shopping center and supermarket
422805,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The walls are very thin and you can hear everything going on next door I also found the bed very hard I also found the reception staff somewhat unhelpful at time I wanted a beer at 5 30pm and was told that the bar was closed until 6 30 I m a guest and I had just finished work for the day open the bar They did after i had to plead with them , The breakfast was great wide choice and plenty of it 
422806,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Did not like the attitude of the Reception They charge a fee for late check out and likewise for early check in Therefore very inconsiderate and unaccommodating to those who come in early Service mentality was missing The Reception was very cold A little away from Barcelona city centre so if you are going for the beach area its probably a good idea to stay here , The rooms were spacious and clean They had a very nice lobby area Did not try their restaurant or pool area since it was during the month of February If you can ignore the service of the Receptionist one particular lady only maybe I was looking forward to a nice smiling receptionist who is willing to help its a nice hotel to stay at 
422807,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, One reception staff member was very unpleasant beds were very uncomfortable no cofffee in room only decaf location not great 30 minutes by Metro into town centre and nothing around Had a good time in Barcelona but wouldn t stay here again , the look of the hotel was nice when you enter but that s pretty much it 
422808,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, One of the receptionist I think it didn t like us he was looking at us in a strange way all the time when we went out But didn t affect our staying at attica a lovely palce and location, Position quality 
422809,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar,No Negative, Friendly and very helpful staff The hotel has a great location for access to the beach or the Metro Bus Tram into the city Would stay here again 
422810,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, There was a leak in our room we had to put a towel on the ground Everything else was perfect, Location not central but in a quiet neighborhood 20min from all the major tourist spot Room very clean and spacious Staff professional and friendly
422811,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, more coffee and milk in the room please this would be nice , The staff were so nice to me I hurt my eye and they helped me Thank you to guy who helped me make a plaster too kind caring hard working staff
422812,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Pool hours Internet in room was very slow , Staff was very accommodating We arrived very late and they kept the kitchen open for us Breakfast was awesome something for everyone Train was nearby only 10 minute walk and lass than 20 minute ride to Barcelona city center You can buy tickets for hop on off bus at hotel Shopping mall is 10 minute walk up from hotel If you don t want dinner or breakfast at hotel there are restaurants around the corner from hotel parking is free on street if yellow but if it is blue car will get towed or nice ticket Bathroom and room was standard no complications or problems Staff was nice answered all our questions We arrived with two teens and were given two interconnecting rooms which was a plus Supermarket is less than 5 minutes away 
422813,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Staff was not very friendly when we asked for separated receipts This is mandatory in business travels in order to get reimbursements so it should be possible to get it in an easy way I would also appreciated to get free range eggs for breakfast instead of number 3 eggs , Nice location for business close to convention center also close to the sea perfect for jogging Breakfast was very complete but I suggest them to offer free range eggs and oat meal 
422814,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, is quite far away city center you should take metro but it is close too it takes 15 minutes to reach city centre by metro , big room clean helpfull stuff
422815,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Not really a criticism but the shower pressure was fairly weak , Room was well equiped and very clean Good quality towels also for pool and the room overlooking the square behind the hotel was very quiet Good breakfast with practically everything that would be wanted Good onsite car parking Location of hotel was great 5 minute walk to the Metro 15 minute ride to the centre with a shopping complex housing good restaurants within a 10 minute walk We took the Metro for one stop towards the centre and found an area with lots of good restaurants Indian local and bars very lively Would use the hotel again on future visits 
422816,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The beds weren t very good and it appears the mattresses might need replacing The pillows were of typical hotel low quality Water pressure wasn t very strong and made showering a bit of a pain , Everyone was very friendly Front counter was able to speak fluent English and explain everything to me Area very safe even for walking back at night Appears to be near a school so lots of kids walking in the morning with families Close to the beach and restaurants in the area Walking distance to the Diagonal Mar mall about 10 minutes Near taxi stands and public transit Internet was very good and free 
422817,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Dust in my room wobbly toilet complimentary water was only in day of check in , Breakfasts are good and delicious Availability of air conditioner and pool on the roof Hotel personnel speaks English Hotel is not so far from sea metro station Selva del Mar and Diagonal Mar shopping center 
422818,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Small pool for a hotel with 75 rooms only 6 sun loungers Strange to have a electric kettle with a short cable and the only socket is on the flor , Modern bright everything worked great staff Good breakfast 
422819,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, You couldn t not like this hotel The pillows the only complaint but who can get that right for everyone visitor, Clean hotel very well equipped Freindly helpful staff
422820,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Noisy airconditioning and drain pipes Electrical sockets are falling apart very snobbish but civil reception staff A staff member accused me of breaking the air conditioning in the room when I reported it wasn t working Quite unhelpful when asking for information they do not like being asked questions If you are not bothered by this stiff behaviour this is a good hotel to stay in Although there are better value more modern hotels nearby , Brilliant location for conferences at the convention centre Near the beach shopping mall restaurants and very near public transport Clean spacious room Brilliant breakfast lovely coffee 
422821,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, I have stayed for 5 days and my bed sheets didn t been changed the lady which used to come and clean my room should know how to smile as she looks like angry all the time Once I arrived the hotel on the first day I been asked for my master card NO even I have paid my room charge in advance plus when I make check out I didn t receive my bill so there is no guarantee that i paid for every thing after I left the hotel, The hotel near to diagonal mall which is one of the best mall in Barcelona Also near from many cafe shops and resturant
422822,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Breakfast was kind of poor for 15 per person we stayed 3 days at the hotel and ate twice there the 3rd breakfast we took in a diffrent hotel nearby also paid 15 and the breakfast was much better with many more choises , The crew was very nice and helpful we pay 25 extra so we could stay until 7pm for a late flight 
422823,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The tea cups were dirty on arrival We also had a connecting door to another room I could hear the people next door really loudly which woke me up in the early hours of the morning and kept me up for hours , The location is brilliant a bit out of the way but I enjoy that as I like mixing with the locals The hotel was beautiful the roof top pool really makes it Clean and friendly staff who are always on hand to help 
422824,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, There wasn t anything we didn t like , The staff were lovely and couldn t help enough with any requests such as I asked for a room high up with a double bed and we were given a premium room with queen bed The hotel also held our bags kindly on check out day as we had a late flight They gave great directions for all the sight seeing places Modern very clean hotel in great location with both the beach shopping and metro link very close by Would stay again 
422825,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar,No Negative, The room is very comfortable the breakfast really good great coffee and the staff super friendly It is easy to get to the touristy bits from here but this location near beach and convention centre is comfortable and has everything you need without being too touristy Great place 
422826,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The breakfast was not amazing and closed at 10 30 which was a little early for me however this isn t a big deal Also the pool is fairly small and in the summer there is a bit of a fight for sunbeds , Really amazing location restaurants really close and a 5 minute walk to the metro station We also took the tour bus around Barcelona which you can get from just around the corner which is a great way to see the city The beach is also very close and is a nice beach 
422827,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The air conditioner was noisy with sudden surges of loud buzzing Though the room was cleaned quite well on a daily basis the chambermaid s long dark hairs were left on the mattress and on the bathroom floor probably hairnets would be a solution Unstable WiFi signal on 5th floor Absence of minibar double room though it was declared there was just an empty fridge and a complimentary bottle of water on the desk , Location is perfect 5 minute walks both from the metro station and from the beach The hotel is in a quiet residential area Room service quick delivery tasty food available till midnight All receptionists are friendly and speak English quite well 
422828,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar,No Negative, Bed was very comfortable great location friendly helpful staff Have stayed here twice over the last 12 months for around a week duration Lovely hotel 
422829,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The room was really shabby for a four star hotel Fridge didn t work there was a hole in the wall next to the bed Lack of privacy in the room you could even hear what people say in the neighbour room The cleaning ladies vacuing since 9 am Together with zero sound proof walls this basically meant no sleep after this hour , Great location close to the subway station and sea Breakfast above the facility s standard 
422830,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar,No Negative, Lovely and quiet very clean pool was super near to the metro Staff were aware of the fact that we would be arriving late and were all prepared Very comfortable bed and pillows 
422831,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The price could be more agree to the place where is the hotel because is a little inside and far in that aerea , The location the tranquil staff and cleaness
422832,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The roof top bar non existence don t expect nice views from your rooms either but overall I did enjoy the stay , The location with close proximity to Diagonal Mar shopping center Metro station and the beach friendly staff rooms cleaned daily and nothing gone missing as previous reviews mention stuff missing from the rooms tho we did use the safe for most valuable things 
422833,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Rather small pool area no balcony stayed in room 416 but the people coming to work in the morning to the office besides were very load and woke us up every morning , Very friendly cleaning lady 
422834,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Expensive city , The hotel was very clean Close to the beach and not in a busy area perfect for us The metro was 5 min walk and supermarkets in surrounding area and great bakeries for breakfast as the hotel breakfast was VERY expensive At the hotel 30 per day for two persons at the bakery 8 breakfast and two take away coffees and croissants for mid morning snack No brainier 
422835,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar,No Negative, Room service was available til 12 midnight One day our train was delayed and we didn t get into the hotel til after midnight and hadn t had a chance to eat The hotel staff were very accommodating and even opened the kitchen for us to make a pizza as we were starving 
422836,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Couldn t get food drinks room service in the middle of the day , Really close to the beach unfortunately didn t get to use the rooftop pool as was raining 
422837,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, On this visit I didn t have any problems The staff were excellent and very accommodating , The place was perfect for watt I was looking for The hotel is close to the beach and has a nice pool on the roof 
422838,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Getting drinks at the pool was difficult and expensive I either had to walk down to the bar and have them call for someone to wait on the bar or hope another guest was getting something delivered to the pool area and ask the server when they walked by There was a service charge for getting drinks at the pool , The rooftop pool was nice The location was close to the beach by foot and close to shopping as well 
422839,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Too far to walk to to centre of town so had to use cabs 15 each way No tea coffee facilities in room Double bed was actually 2 singles pushed together with separate sheets , Room was fine staff were helpful but didn t seem that happy Very close to beach 
422840,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Bed a little hard but only a little Pool area cosy but would have liked bar to be open but appreciate it was early in the season Only realised could have had a kettle at the end of stay maybe offer on checking in , Lovely size room and double bed Plenty of storage Quiet hotel with lovely staff Good quality toiletries and fluffy towels Shower and bath useful and shower had good power 
422841,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Only minor Criticism is it would have been nice if the roof pool was open later as we always got back after sightseeing and would have looked to relax with a few drinks , Staff were very polite and helpful room was very modern and fresh given the price
422842,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar,No Negative, Reception was excellent I checked in 2 days after my sons and they found me a room on the same floor as theirs Barman was cheerful and helpful Breakfast was adequate 
422843,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, My only slight complaint would be Breakfast wasn t what us English are used to Fry ups There was plenty of juice with fruits bread cooked meats yoghurt a other stuff I didn t really try The staff all very friendly though and greated with a smile and Hola every morning , Location nice and quiet with a corner shop 90 seconds walk and 3 4 bars tapas just around the corner The beach just 10 mins walk and Port Olympic between 5 8 in a taxi 
422844,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar,No Negative, Attentive staff clean room and comfortable beds good wifi access Convenient location near the conference centre and metro tram bus stations 
422845,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, It was priced fairly and we had no complaints , Within 2 blocks of the Subway system it was close to several local restaurants and an awesome bakery that catered to lunch and breakfast visitors The city is very well planned Even the park behind the hotel was being swept every second day The local walking tours of the city are great value and informative The Sagrada Familia basilica semi complete but with 3 of the facades still under construction started in 1882 with Gaudi getting involved from 1883 to 1926 is one of the most stunning Cathedral projects worldwide a definite must see 
422846,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Beds were not ok Both of us had backache There was no view from our room A building about 7 mtrs away We pre booked with no cancellation possibility but it would have been better to wait as the price just went down , The hotel staff was ok 
422847,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, They barely had any outlet converters so we had to purchase our own , Great location less than 5 minute walk to the beach one of the biggest malls in Barcelona metro station supermarket and really good restaurants 
422848,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, I was running the marathon and it took 45 minutes to reach the start on the Metro that is not a criticism because it s close to the beach and sports centre but it wasn t easy with sore legs , Wonderful stay Everyone polite and some really made the difference My room was kept spotless by a lady with a genuine smile And service at breakfast was spot on left to sit where I wanted get what I wanted in the order I wanted Didn t notice anyone working yet my table was cleared when I returned with my next plate and everything restocked when I went back for more 
422849,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, There was no coffee facilities in the room which to me is silly I was told to buy my own coffee and milk but where was I supposed to store the milk , Staff were extremely helpful and friendly apart from one night receptionist who was extremely moody man 
422850,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Quite far out of town 3 miles but within a 10 min walk to Selva Del Mar metro which gets you into town quickly, The room was comfortable breakfast was sufficient and the staff were nice
422851,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The non discounted price would have been to high for the location and for the basic services included Room walls a bit too thin and no sound proof Rather late check in hours , Good English speakers at front desk 2 minutes walk to the beach Easy to reach by metro though not close to the city center 
422852,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Would have liked tea coffee facilities in the room , The staff were very friendly the rooms a good size Bathroom was huge with toiletries included the towels are really soft We were given a voucher for a free drink in the restaurant if we had a meal there which we did included wine or wee bottle of cava nice touch Food was lovely Only 5 minute walk to underground beach Rooftop pool looked lovely if weather had been warmer we would definitely have used it 
422853,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Beds were so hard that we couldn t sleep well at all We have travelled quite lot but never have slept so bad in hotel as now I can t understand why You don t have possibility to use extra mattress , Location was quite good 
422854,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, I could hear the voices of people in next room talking quite clearly , Close to CCIB where the event I joined was held There is a shopping centre which has got various types of eating places super market near that is very convenient Stuffs are nice kind 
422855,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, No air con available in November Rooftop terrace and pool were closed , Good location Near enough to the metro station Some bars and restaurants close by Try the cooking school for dinner very good value Its about a 3min walk from the hotel 
422856,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Nothing to dislike , Great location for conference stays near to the CCIB also close to the sea front for running or walking and near to a metro station for easy access to the centre 
422857,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, When family rooms are separated as single rooms the door between rooms don t block any sound , Good clean and modern hotel Nice pool at the roof top 
422858,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Only the fact that the trip into city was further than we would have likded A 4, Hotel close to beautiful beach Easy access to bus to city Nice to get out of city and stay in a quiet and safe location 
422859,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Breakfast was overall good but a bit expensive My bed was ok but my friend s was quite soft not bad if you like it soft , Staff was helpful Room was clean Location of the hotel is excellent
422860,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Advertised as sound proofed walls most definitely not as the couple next door demonstrated There appeared to also be some issues with the cold water system creating unusual noises , Great location friendly staff and the room was incredibly clean Wifi was ample for the requirements 
422861,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The walls are thin if this puts you off you can here when others turn on the shower and breakfast is pricey at 15EUR per person per day However the noise did not wake us or stop us from sleeping and breakfast can be obtained for a fraction of the price from the local supermarket The twin bed set up was also a bit problematic because they can come apart leaving a bit of a gap Also the pillows are on the thin side but a spare pillow was available and my wife asked for another from reception , It s within walking distance of the beach the Diagonal Mal Shopping Centre a supermarket is around the corner and the Selva Del Mar Metro station It s about 10 minutes away from the centre of Barcelona Our room was clean the Wifi Access good the staff friendly the room was a decent size the mini bar fridge we put our own drinks in there and basically we would stay there again Reception staff could not do enough to help they were excellent 
422862,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Wifi slow at times had to sign in more than once Would have liked tea coffee facilities in the room , Good choice for a summer break close to beach but not too far from the city Staff were so helpful particularly reception and cleaning staff Room very clean
422863,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Several little problems in the room that can be resolve with a control of the room before and not have to asked all the time Th room don t have a small terrasse and cannot open the window , The roof terrasse and the swimming pool even if it is small and have to come before 10 o clock if you want to have a seat The place is good near the sea and greatest Hotel 
422864,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Occasionally our key malfunctioned and didn t work in the door , Staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was excellent Spotless and modern decor 
422865,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, Noise from other rooms but you get that everywhere was not a problem , Fantastic location close to beach and local restuarants and large diagonal mar shopping centre Very helpful and friendly staff 
422866,Attica 21 Barcelona Mar, The room was ok but not a room you expect in a 4 star hotel Really in need for a good cleaning dust and dirt in many places and also in need for some new furniture The staff was ok but nothing special apart from the waitor in the pool bar who was very nice The walls in the room were PAPER THIN and we could hear a person in the next room snore and cough as well as people talking together even though they weren t that loud , Great location close to the beach Lovely sun beds and swimming pool on the top floor The waitor in the pool bar was very nice and the best experience we had when it came to staff Nice food from the menu Good beds
