423947,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, Picture of terrace misleading booked the two bedroom apartment because of it then realised should have booked one bedroom penthouse suite instead Building work right next door not forewarned Assured by reception staff no need to book a taxi in advance to airport despite there being a football match on but had to walk to taxi rank and had great difficulties getting a taxi from there in the end , Space of the apartment Staff tried their best Value for money because we booked well in advance 
423948,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, Nothing, The staff was excellent treated us like royality upon arrival We stayed at the W which had great views but was 4x the price of this hotel we rented the 2bdrm apartment and there was so much room and a family room where we could all hang out as a family We had to have a suite and an extra room at the W The location of this hotel was central to everything We would stay here again and we are picky travelers There is a great place to eat Around the corner Pepito Don t think twice just book you won t regret it 
423949,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, The design of bathroom The shower head positioned in wrong place so the floor gets wet everytime you have a shower No fan to ventilate and if you open the window the people opposite get a good view No tea coffee facilities in room , Helpful and friendly staff Good recommendations for dinner etc The look of the room bar restaurant Location is brilliant 
423950,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, The night concierge told us everywhere for dinner at 11pm was closed so we ended up going somewhere local but we later discovered loads of nice places open late to eat ,No Positive
423951,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, We didn t stay for longer , Hotel staff in the lobby and in the bar were excellent went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect for our stay Location was also ideal 
423952,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona,No Negative, Overall good professional staff Some are more welcoming and helpful than others The 2 receptionists 1 male 1 female and the porter when we checked in were especially welcoming and helpful Breakfast staff were good on both days 
423953,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, Unfortunately there was construction in the building right next to us The banging started before 8am every morning We would have liked to have been told about it at check in and given the option to change rooms When we informed the management they knew nothing about the construction which we found strange The manager said she would get back to us regarding options and never did We mentioned it again the following day and were told the manager was not there but she would call us we left a cell number both times Never heard back disappointing and mentioned it again at checkout so at the very least they could inform the next guests who were going to stay there about the noise issue before they moved in and unpacked , We stayed in a residence The apartment was fabulous We were there for 6 nights so it was nice to be in a larger space as opposed to a small hotel room Great location Near shopping great restaurants and the metro 
423954,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, More variety for breakfast , Staff were very friendly and helpful Our room 601 far exceeded our expectations The patio was a real surprise and bonus 
423955,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, No tea making facilities in the room despite paying for an upgrade and the bed was two single beds pushed together rather than the king sized double bed specifically requested in the booking , Staff extremely kind and helpful
423956,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, There were no negatives for this hotel Everyone went out of their way to make our experience unforgettable We did not eat breakfast in the hotel so we cannot make a comment on that , The helpfulness of the front desk personnel The location was perfect 
423957,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona,No Negative, Great location Contemporary interior designed by Kelly Hoppen Large bathroom with walk in shower Really comfortable bed Adjustable lighting in room Extremely friendly and helpful staff Great food Lovely roof sun terrace
423958,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, The carpet in the room was dirty and needed to be cleaned The bathroom could have had a towel rack to hang wet towels Also better lighting in the bathroom and a larger mirror would have been nice , Loved the location and the staff was excellent Comfortable but small room Nice sheets on the bed And the air conditioning worked great 
423959,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, The sofa bed is nothing more than a juvenile cot totally inappropriate extremely uncomfortable and not at all as advertised total mispresentation from the website description You have been warned ,No Positive
423960,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, No room service Hard to contact room service in the hotel using the phone The lighting on the bathroom too dim and moody Difficult to have a shave , Location location 
423961,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, Two connected beds on wheels maybe fine for some people but definately not for a young couple , Everything especialy the staff at the reseption Will definately stay again but not at the appartment with two teraces becouse of the bed 
423962,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, a bit too pricey, super location friendly staff Ana at the reception was really helpful reasonable variety for breakfast comfy beds terrace was worth paying extra
423963,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, Nothing to dislike , When we arrived we had immediate help with luggage and any queries Staff went out of their way to assist Can t wait to go back 
423964,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, When we just arrived we were shocked of the room size it was not as big as described in booking Com When i contacted the reception they have informed me that they gave us one of the biggest rooms in the hotel Additionally There was some road work which was creating noise all the time Surprisingly no kettle for a 4 star hotel It was the first time to see a duvet without cover They just put a sheet to cover it so while you move the duvet will move and this was not comfortable at all The card key will stop working every two days I think the hotel is over priced , The location was great near the metro and restaurants Nice modern decoration and helpful staff
423965,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, They didn t make up our room before 14 00 so coming back to the hotel for a siesta to unmade beds was not good We were disturbed because they then wanted to clean and when we put a no disturb notice on the door we were called by reception , Very helpful and friendly staff 
423966,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, I asked for a double bed and it was two single beds put next to each other which I didn t really like, The room was absolutely beautiful and we had a room with a balcony which was extra special I requested a birthday package for my boyfriend and when we walked into our room there was a balloon with champagne and cake etc the staff were super friendly and always doing more to help The food was absolutely beautiful will definitely be returning 
423967,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, The wifi system is a bit complicated to log on , We booked a two bedroom suite It is well decorated very comfortable and a bargain It felt like home as we enter from an individual gate 20 meters from the main hotel gate The hotel is located near Casa Mila Casa Batilo and only 5 minute walk from the subway station where a few lines meet So we can go to almost every tourist site without transfer 
423968,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona,No Negative, The location was great We were able to walk to all the sites we wanted to see The staff was very helpful The room was quiet and extremely comfortable I would highly recommend this hotel 
423969,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, Most hotels in Europe don t offer coffee makers in the room and to be fair I didn t ask so I really have no complaints although an espresso machine in the room would have made the stay extra special , Polite and friendly staff excellent central location comfortable King bed large towels quality bath products adjustable lighting designer decor bar restaurant and outdoor dining 
423970,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, On our arrival reception said we have 2 bookings in their records we only had one and said we will have to pay for both she said she can t do anything about it and I needed to call booking com directly It wasn t a good start to the Barcelona leg of our trip but the representative of booking com resolved the issue , Location was great 
423971,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, Cannot think of anything I would add here, The staff were extremely helpful and very welcoming Great restaurant recommendations Hotel was in a good location for just wandering and people watching Room was just what we needed for our pre cruise stay 
423972,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, Our room could be a little noisy at night as we were overlooking the ramblas but I only noticed this on the saturday night a minor point , The staff were really friendly and helpful and even provided a special welcome as I was celebrating my birthday The room was beautiful with the most comfortable bed and lovely bathroom The interior of the hotel is lovely and the service was excellent we could leave our bags after we checked out we asked for an iron and it arrived within 5 minutes etc The location is also great very central 10 minutes from casa batllo and next to the metro 
423973,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, I reserved an upgrade and never got it When the hotel credited the amount already taken from booking com I lost 10 00 in the exchange The shower is not convenient at all and the window is very impersonal for outsiders to see inside , The staff was very responsive to my request The terrace in my room was outstanding 
423974,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, The warm water in the shower got so hot burns a little every 3 mins The wifi was terrible that it lost its signal every 2 mins and then I had to start over again and again and again , Location is good there was a metro station just 2 mins away and it was on the main street with restaurants and bars The design of the room was nice and cozy 
423975,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, The congiere service was unknowledgeable of fine restaurants directions are minimal at best don t expect too much from the front desk other thank they are cordial if wanting to book tours or events They Will give you a very limited selection You might want to do your own research , The hotel is beautiful with superb location Gorgeous fresh flowers in the lobby Please make sure you get the breakfast add on 
423976,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, The wifi services need to be improved since it keeps cutting off, The staff are extremely helpful and respectful They helped me arranging for booking for football match in few minutes with tickets being delivered to my room 
423977,Hotel Murmuri Barcelona, I had a medical emergency and had to postpone my trip Even after calling to explain to the hotel and with them promising to do their best to be hospitable i received a very nonchalant email the next day saying that there is nothing they can do for me not even shift my dates to when I was well enough to travel So I did end up paying and not losing my money The hotel would have at the most lost only one day s but just couldn t care less ,No Positive
