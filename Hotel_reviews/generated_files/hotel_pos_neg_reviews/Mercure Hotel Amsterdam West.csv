392954,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, My only complaint about the room is that there are no teaspoons with the tea coffee making I did tell reception as we left My bedside lamp didn t work BBC 1 2 didn t work for 2 nights , The walk in shower was lovely Very clean hotel 
392955,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The shower was pointed so it sprayed right out and all over the floor we had to shower in the corner to keep the bathroom frok flooding Also we could not adjust the room tempature for some reason and it was very warm in the room thankfully we coukd open the door and let a breeze in, The room was nice updated easy to get to
392956,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Hotel was a little to far from city centre although there was a bus stop close by , Rooms were nice and bed comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful 
392957,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Avoid the restaurant Our Mercure burgers where cold and the bread was old not really what you expect for the prices they charge Parking across the road is easy and will safe 17 50 a night , Staff is very friendly and helpfull
392958,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Temperature in the room became extremely uncomfortabe and hot in the wee hours of the July morning we awoke there Terribly sweaty and unable to drift back off Also Room 312 is located many rooms from the lone miniature elevator It was a long trek with 4 bags for weary travelers , King bed in room 312 very comfortable Could not hear air traffic at all Hotel shuttle bus to airport 10 min trip very good Spacious hotel restaurant good cooking with indoor and outdoor seating beside a small pleasant green space To get in out of Amsterdam red city bus 197 picked us up at a stop on the street the hotel was on an easy 10 min walk away Rode in to Leidesplein for 5 euros for 2 riders but why 10 euros for 2 to get back to the hotel 
392959,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The breakfast was too expensive for us coming from South Africa So we decided not to include breakfast and to have something light in the town , We liked the freshness of the hotel especially the rooms 
392960,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, No cups or tea in room when we arrived but quickly sorted out bar menu had not English translation at all but the waitress offered to translate, friendly staff easy access to public transport Ito city
392961,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Location is terrible Fine for a day or two but journeys to and from city centre are long Not even very accessible from the nearest bus stop , Fine hotel Very comfortable beds Very nice interior 
392962,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Even though I prepaid two nights including tax through Booking com for three rooms we we charged an extral 21 20 euro per room at checkout total of 63 60 which was almost an entire nights rate Also when we arrived at the airport we were told that the airport shuttle cost 5 euro per person With that in mind we took a taxi to the hotel there were 3 of us and paid 18 euro plus tip When we arrived at the hotel I questioned that fee because when I booked the reservations the info said the shuttle was free Turns out that because we booked before June 1st there was no cost to us for the shuttle Other than all the added fees which added up to almost 100 euro the hotel was nice and a good value Would have given it a higher score , The free shuttle but it is no longer free 
392963,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The rooms are small but the orientation of the furniture made it very hard to move around The same space could have been utilized better We were given a doubles room we booked it a single queen bed but received 2 separate single beds and the room wasn t t garden view we weren t t asked for our preference because the other view had very low level of privacy from the outdoors , Location was very close to a gas station a bus station which was very convenient to get to from downtown The room was very convenient with all what could be needed the front staff were always very helpful specially during check in 
392964,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, We opt not to make use of cleaning service and receive 5 euro vouchers daily Would appreciate it if explained to us before the time that could only be used towards drinks in the bar , Room was spacious with a nice view Shuttle service from and to airport was excellent driver very helpful
392965,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Room keys didn t work on a few occasions but this was easily sorted out by staff at reception desk, BED SOOOOOO COMFY AND HUGE Safe and little fridge included in the room for no additional price Bathroom was lovely 
392966,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Customer service TV not working housekeeping guy knocking the door three times starting at 6am for cleaning even after telling him to come after we check out I selected a double bed while booking but got allotted a twin room not sure if this is by booking com or from the hotel, Hotel shuttle to and from the hotel
392967,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel restaurant was poor My meal a well done burger came out dripping blood My husband s burger came to him with a moldy bun Upon my burger being cooked properly it tasted horrible My meal was comped and we were each given a glass of wine Our room was not properly cleaned as there were peanuts on the floor Comfy bed for 1 night My brother and sister in law were with us all rooms are to be ready for a 2 pm check in Their room was not ready until 4pm and not until my brother in law checked at the front desk and complained he was given 1 coupon for a free drink As a Travel Agent I would not recommend the Mercure brand of hotels to any of my clients , I picked this hotel because it was in close proximity to the Amsterdam Airport for our very early flight the next morning 
392968,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, No in room dining after 11 00 PM we couldn t even order water and had to go to the lobby to buy from a vending machine It is very close to the hotel but a bit far from main attractions, Not much
392969,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Hotel ring fenced an additional 180 on top of the hotel costs just incase we used the breakfast facilities which was charged at 45 per day Bed was dirty and was throughout our stay Asked for some more tea bags and was told they would be right up but wasn t received at all even two days later 20 minute bus journey into town every day with no safe path to and from the bus stop Wouldn t recommend, Nothing special
392970,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The only real option for eating in the area is at the hotel We were there five nights and the menu didn t change Not bad food but we we would have liked a little more variety , The hotel is located across the street from a very nice park ideal for walking around a small lake We have been staying at this hotel for 12 years and the staff are unfailingly pleasant and welcoming The breakfast though a little pricey is outstanding and the waitstaff is wonderful 
392971,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, My iron and ironing board were not in the room as requested and service at the restaurant was slow despite being one of the only five people there Check in time should be earlier , Food was excellent great decor comfortable beds 
392972,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, No complaints, Hotel is outside Amsterdam and cheaper than central prices but there is a local bus nearby which gets you into centre of Amsterdam in 20min and runs every 10mins so don t run for a bus we had half price breakfast deal for weekend 11 instead of 22 excellent breakfast choices but wouldn t pay 22 for it also served breakfast till 12 at weekends
392973,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, I took 5 minutes from the bus stop just this hotel is too isolated so it was bit scary to come back Overall it was okay , I liked the bed after coming back from all day walking 
392974,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel held 700 of our money for 3 4 weeks while we were travelling We contacted our bank who informed us the hotel had taken it from our account as well as charged us for the hotel We asked the hotel to fix this immediately yet they didn t We were unable to use these funds while travelling and when our holiday was over and had returned to Australia we had the money returned Very disappointing accounts management from the hotel and a stay we ranked as 10 10 Mercure Amsterdam please improve on this service for future guests , It was an easy process getting from airport with the shuttle bus which took 10 15 mins The hotel is surrounded by beautiful park lands and water ways to walk jog bike ride swim or have a picnic The bus station is out the front and takes 20 25 min to get to canals in the city center Free bar service in room was a treat Also breakfast was nice If booking room ask for view over the park rather than the freeway 
392975,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The breakfast was not very good , The hotel is located across from a park with a lake The Lake has a family beach area that is clean and within a 5 minute walk of the hotel The park has nature trails as well as a lakeside cafe where you can purchase food and beverages 
392976,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Very Expensive food and 40 euro at check in from your credit card no free water at the room and if you check in late at night you will be hungry and thirsty until the other day, Good location quiet 
392977,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Staff If room was stocked with what it was supposed to be Staff told of problems and said would fix it and still next day had to complain again till they fixd problem, Bed was amazing
392978,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, I didnt like the fact that it was a 25 minute bus ride into town where you could have some breakfast at a reasonable price 22 50 euro is a very expensive breakfast so we bought bananas to have in our room and then travel into Leidseplein to have some brunch which cost less for the both of us than the Mercure charged for one person Also we were very shocked when the taxi pulled up at the hotel as we didn t realise that it was out in the middle of nowhere the petrol station next door being the only other building around , The bed was comfy but I prefer a top sheet rather than just a doona as I get really hot at night and like just a sheet over me 
392979,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, When we were at the bar we asked for lemonade and lime cordial and the bartender didn t have a clue but we was happy with the 7up, The bed was amazingly comfy and massive Very clean Just a lovely room
392980,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, It was a bit away from city centre on a dual carriage so difficult to cross to get buses Should provide bike rental services for guests to ride into town, It was clean and located next to transport and airport The main bonus was the reception staff All were super helpful kind and friendly Even the Trainee was very impressive 
392981,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The breakfast was not included and a bit expensive 11 euros per person , The bed was really comfortable room was clean and it was nice that it was a bit away from the city center and near a nice park and lake The bus stop was also just around the corner though we rented bikes in town and just biked to and from the hotel during our weekend stay The breakfast buffet was also very good with small pancakes fresh orange juice machine and variety of breads and yogurts The staff at the reception was nice and friendly 
392982,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, It is hard find groceries shops around So buy your stuff from the city mainly water , Great place to get away from the buzzz after spending whole day in the city Highly recommended place and do not suggest to book your stay on the centre of the city We loved the park across the street lake trees small pond staff and quietness of the area 
392983,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Well if it wasn t for this debacle i would have given the hotel a 5 star rating but unfortunately there are far too many hidden charges which neither Booking nor Mercure Hotel tells the customer about I will warn you that it might be a long read but nevertheless it s important that people hear about it so they won t face the same misfortune as I Upon checking in despite having paid the hotel three months in advance they made me pay twice without neither giving me a form or any kind of paper where there is any type of agreement that i will accept another payment Pay close attention They ll ask you for your card because of a guarantee as they put it what will happen is that they ll charge your card again for the same price you booked the room and an additional 40 euros I unfortunately found out about it when i noticed i couldn t use the ATMs anymore because of this unethical practice When talking to the staffers i was told that this is an authorization and not a payment well what they don t understand is that the funds are frozen since they are reserved and the customers are not able to use them meaning that if you travel on a tight budget well prepare for the worst if you re checking in here It doesn t take them more than a second to take the money but returning it seems like an impossibility at this point I was told by three different staffers that they have released the authorization at three different points in time and they are still frozen I will have to wait at least a week more before I file a report for fraud against this hotel , The room was comfortable and very clean The beds were soft and the furniture made the most use out of the space while not being too intrusive There is also a peaceful lake nearby perfectly suitable for evening strolls and it s not more than a minute s walk there 
392984,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The airport shuttle took an age to arrive and is five euros when returning to the airport Great public transport links but not walking distance to city centre or airport , Very comfy bed decent location by a beautiful lake Very near 197 bus stop which is a great and easy way of getting to city centre or airport Hotel was clean and staff were friendly 
392985,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, we didn t really like how far it was to the centre but that can t be helped it was nice to be away from the noise and crowds uber was a savior costing about 20 euro to get to the centre of dam from the hotel though there is a bus we also didn t like how it was expensive for a glass of orange juice to a beer as it was more for juice than it was alcohol , very clean and comfortable lovely views even though your near a main road but looking out seen lovely green grass and rabbits running about it was so relaxing the bed was very comfortable maybe to soft of some people as you just sank in to the bed shower had good pressure so was nice to have lovely hot water pick up with the hotels shuttle was very easy once you figure out where your at check in was simple enough 
392986,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, We thought we d be able to walk into Dam central havin dogs a 6km walk is nothing to us but not really the place to be walking around busy roads etc and not a straight forward route However this was our mistake and not the hotel just wanted to avoid anyone else thinking the same However Uber taxi s were fab and a much better price than those scouting for business , Lovely big comfy bed not too hard but not soft and lumpy either Room Cleaned every day to a high standard would definitely return 
392987,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The shower handles easily changes it setting when you turn in the shower Got almost burnt 3 times when turning around as would set itself to the hottest way too hot and almost scolded myself Be very dangerous if a child or person who could not move quickly had this happen Maybe turn down the water temp or change the tap layout ,No Positive
392988,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Not all of the lights were working in our room maybe worth doing a check before people check in and letting them know, Bed comfy room was really nice staff super friendly answered all my questions
392989,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The entrance to the hotel is inconvenient for pedestrians as there are no sidewalks next to the road , The room was very clean and luxurious all the facilities in the room worked perfectly and there was a free wifi which was very useful in order to plan the journey around Amsterdam The staff was very helpful with tourist information and gladly answered all to all the questions we had about our stay and advised us about the trip around Amsterdam One of the greatest perks of the hotel is the lake on the other side of the road Overall great location amazing apartments and helpful staff members 
392990,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, The hotel was lovely clean towels changed daily bedding re made every day toiletries replenished daily had black out curtains had free transfer to and from airport although not in the city they gave us help with bus or travel into city with a discount deal on busses and also the bus stop was literally 1 minute walk away from hotel The food was amazing Not cheap but you get what you pay for The bus is about 15 mins but takes you right into centre where it is easy accessible We didn t get discount for bus travel so cost us 10 a day for a return to city centre Near a massive lake which is nice to walk around 
392991,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Location The hotel will give you the bus time table for the 197 and they are very frequent It costs 5 00 return to Leidesplein but two times we had a problem with driver and we had to pay 5 eur per person for one way I would recommend getting a bus tram travel card to avoid such problems with some drivers And I also suggest hotel stuff to inform bus company about that problem some drivers want 2 50 eur OW other drivers 5 eur OW That is unnecessary problem when you are on holiday , Stayed in the Mercure for 5 nights in May 2017 Found reception staff friendly We had a double room our beds were comfy and the room was lovely clean and quiet Hotel has good wifi The hotel is only 10 mins from the airport and they run a shuttle service 
392992,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Unfortunately there wasn t a pool or spa area in the fitness centre And it was quite a way out from Amsterdam Town centre , The room was spacious and very comfortable with a lovely bathroom Clean fresh towels and free mini bar
392993,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, everything was good, the room was beautiful and the bed was the most comfortable ive had in a hotel could have been a little closer to the city centre but I was glad we booked this hotel you get to see more of the city than if you stayed closer in only 1 downside when your walking to get the bus into the city there is no real safe walk to the bus stop you have to walk through the petrol station and then cross a road to the other side and when your coming back your on the wrong side of the road they could make a pathway from the hotel on the hotel side to the bus stop for guests to have safer access to the bus stops but this is only a minor thing
392994,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, nothing, We loved everything The location of the hotel was perfect The shuttle bus very convenient and the bus driver very helpful and kind The staff at reception kind and gave us all necessary information to reach downtown by public bus The room very comfortable and well equipped and the mattress superb slept perfectly I would definitely reccommend the place for a brief stop over like our between flights or for a long vacation to visit the city 
392995,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, The room is very comfortable spacious and the bathroom is very clean There s onsite parking and it s just right next to petrol kiosk so it s very convenient to just walk out to buy snacks and food from the kiosk if you need You can also top up petrol just before you leave for your trips or to the airport It s a slight distance from the airport compared to another hotel airport that I stayed which was much nearer to the airport I actually preferred this better The luggage deposit service was good I can deposit my big luggages at ease and pick them up on my trip back I will stay at this hotel again if I come back 
392996,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Wish there were more options like restaurants shopping within walking distance of hotel , Very convenient location for stay prior to early morning flight 
392997,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Hotel staff could be bit better with information about how to get to popular places of interest and we would have appreciated being told the buses stop when Ajax had a match screened in the city as we nearly missed out flight home, The outside terrace and grounds of the hotel and the nearby park with lake 
392998,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, It was a bit out of the way Nothing within walking distance although the bus stop was close Not much to choose from on the food menu , The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice All staff were very helpful with giving information about the area where to eat drink and how to get to where you wanted to go 
392999,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The cleaniness of the room isnt good enough esp floor outside the bathroom still have strands of hair Teabag and sugar sometimes forget to refill after taking the small towel and the mat they forgot to give the new ones , The view in front of the window
393000,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, It would be better to drive to the hotel cuz there was only one shuttle pre hour , The hotel is close to the airport about 15 mins by shuttle The room is comfortable 
393001,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Breakfast a bit disappointing for a 4 star hotel I would have expected a bigger selection of hot foods e g Mushrooms tomatoes fried eggs etc Continental breakfast plentiful but not much else , Although the hotel is not in the centre we preferred this Very close to airport and lovely setting beside a huge lake We preferred being out of the bustle of the city and it certainly worked out cheaper Bus No 197 into centre is only 2 50 That s a lot cheaper than a city centre hotel stay Public transport is excellent and buses run every 10 minutes and start early end late If you don t mind being on the outskirts then this hotel is ideal We got bus into museum area and then walked our way everywhere It means you see everything can explore all the shopping areas and little cafes etc Location will not suit everyone but if you don t mind a 10 minute bus trip then it s ideal If you want to be in the buzz of the city then this hotel is too isolated Bed was amazingly comfortable and the shower strong with plenty of hot water Bar area lovely but very quiet so if you looking entertained then this place is not for you 
393002,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, I found the breakfast and dinner menu limited in choices , The bed was very comfortable The staff at the hotel were all very helpful and friendly The shuttle was a nice berk 
393003,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, See above, Not much if you were flying the location was great nothing near to do or go taxi 50e to town or 50 min bus ride restaurant overpriced with limited menu most places would not deliver food felt stranded
393004,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Nothing really can t complain staff was helpful room were tidy , Yeah the croasiants were extra fluffy the breakfast was really nice the hotel is really close to the airport bit away from the city centre which was ideal as I wasn t there to party access to public transport was close by so didn t have any trouble getting in and out of city centre 
393005,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel shuttle bus was not very frequent I got the public bus and was advised the hotel was across the road from the bus stop It was a little further than just across the road The main entrance of the hotel was also not very visible when walking from the main road , The room was very comfortable and the food in the restaurant at dinner was very good The grounds are very restful and pleasant with the canal and trees nearby 
393006,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel shuttle bus was not available when we arrived but the public bus was easy to catch and dropped us close to the hotel , rooms were bright and modern staff were really welcoming and the bar staff especially were great Food was plentiful and varied and the chef was happy tp provide special dishes for members of our group with allergies 
393007,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, I was appalled to find that the hotel doesn t have baths I d specifically chosen it from the images on your website which showed baths because I need a hot bath each evening to ease arthritis pains I should point out I m not old just unlucky Also the cost of breakfast at 22 euros is shocking and certainly not worth the money This was a business trip for me and I will be recommending to my company that we don t use this service in the future , The bed was comfortable 
393008,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Staff was cold and unfriendly didn t seem like they were their to help I felt they behaved differently to Dutch speaking guests but remained dead faced if you spoke English and specifically if you were South East Asia or indian , It was a quite place but not very well connected via public transport it s close to schiphol so may be good for business travellers The rooms were nice and clean but the staff was rather cold and unfriendly 
393009,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Breakfast was very expensive and so were drinks at the bar which was disappointing as the rest of the stay was so lovely , The room was very clean with tea and coffee a tv mini fridge safe air conditioning and towels etc all supplied making it good value for money Staff were very friendly and helpful 
393010,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Would love to have had a pool in the fitness centre and the bikes we hired to see the Tulip fields were not in great condition One was broken and it took us a long time to ride to where we wanted so perhaps invest in bikes that have higher gears than 3 and maintain better , Lovely to have complimentary mint lemon water and coffee at reception and airport shuttle was great 
393011,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, There is nothing right outside the hotel except for a petrol station and it takes some time to get to Amsterdam Central , Breakfast was good staff was really friendly and accommodating which made our stay in Amsterdam really enjoyable 
393012,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Mercury Amsterdam Be very careful 22 22 50e for a slice of toast and a coffee products not available scrambled pancakes Sullen disinterested staff who state ask her After we had got over the shock of 90 for four breakfasts We see a sign that states if you pay in arrival you get the second breakfast for free surprising this was not mentioned or offered when we checked in that would have made the breakfast a more reasonable acceptable 11 each Pick up bag ask for a courtesy room to get changed in assistant on desk had to go and ask then told you will have to change in the public bathroom As people are walking in whilst changing How degrading after having paid so much for a room oh and the breakfast Customer service friendly forget it 2 3 star definitely NOT a four star hotel We will never stay in this chain of hotels again Take this as a note of caution do not book this hotel if you are looking Transport bus 197 to Olympic stadium then get on the 24 tram, Bed cosy clean good size room quite
393013,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Not in the city center, Hi The staff are very kind and helpful always smiling The hotel is very clean and tidy room survice is great There is a free shuttle to and from airport Also the bus station very near 5 minutes walk The only thing the hotel is not in the center of the city it takes 30 min with the bus to reach there
393014,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, A little too far from the centre of Amsterdam but there is a good bus service just outside the hotel that runs every 10 minutes , Very clean with friendly staff 
393015,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Its not near any public transport but Ubers are nearby and cheap enough , Very quiet location quiet and clean room There is nothing near by just greenery so you need to take taxis to get to restaurants and things but the price differential made it worth it Its a 7 minute taxi to the airport I didnt use the hotel s free shuttle It was a 10 minute taxi to my meetings I recommend using Uber as it was cheaper than the taxis and they were always not more than 5 minutes away from the hotel I had a room in the back and it was silent 
393016,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, How far away it was from city Staff problems check in wasnt good the lady asked for 219 more than we had confirmed on our booking I questioned it straight away and she said it is for an authorisation incase we wanted breakfast I then said to the lady we did not want breakfast so asked her to take it off so she reduced the amount but it was still 41 euro more than expected but I did not question this as I thought that was a refundable deposit on the room I then put my pin in and paid for the room all was fine and we started our holiday The day after I happened to check our account to find that a further 178 had been taken from my account without my pin or permission which surely is not legal I spoke to a manager about this and they said it was for an authorisation for breakfast even though I had already said I will not be using their facilities manager was not helpful at all and refused to give us the money and said we could check out that day and with it being bank holiday there no available hotels the manager said we would get a refund when we check out which I am still waiting for The hotel should not be advertising room only options as this is clearly not the case For this reason and how unhelpful the staff were I will 100 not be staying here again which is a shame as it is a lovely hotel , Hotel was clean tidy room was nice and bed was so comfy Free shuttle to and from airport was good 
393017,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, It was a little distance out of the centre We had to take a bus and tram to get to get into town It would take us about 1 2 hours depending on the time of day night, Close to airport Free hotel shuttle bus Friendly staff helpful staff Clean modern rooms Comfy bed 
393018,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, Free airport transfers in private minibus and close to the city centre 2 50 euros to get into city centre via the bus which had a stop just down the road from the hotel 
393019,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The toilet continued to run after flushing As it was after 11 00pm we decided to fix the problem ourselves The shower enclosure allows too much water to splash onto the floor which makes it a bit dangerous We d asked for a wake up call and didn t receive it , The beds were very comfortable The room was very much like the few pictures displayed The staff were very efficient and helpful 
393020,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The location is not that good If you go there by bus you need to walk a bit Although there is a shuttle bus service the number of seats is very limited You may not easily get on the one you want , The service is great The staff of this hotel is very kind and they are willing to offer a helping hand whenever you need Also the room is comfy too 
393021,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, We didn t like been so far out from the centre it was a lot of travelling on buses and trams back and forth to the hotel plus we got a taxi back on the last night he screwed us big time told him where our hotel was he drove us around for ages brought us to the airport saying this was our stop we told him no he rang the website said he knew it he passed our hotel and brought us off on another direction when we told him he passed it he was getting mad that far as he was concerned our hotel was in the airport he tripped himself up a few times cause he did know where it was he told us before we got him 40 then he put us on meter topped up over 100 we eventually got to our hotel we had a big argument we weren t paying that much he said it was all our fault he is a taxi driver he ment to know where all the hotels are located we still had to pay him 70 plus we got a taxi the night before he had no problem bringing us straight to our hotel so I would advise not to get taxis but other than that we had a great weekend , We loved the hotel staff very friendly and helpful beautiful surroundings to Hotel and easy access to buses for city centre It helped been so close to the airport not worrying about any delays 
393022,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, Lovely clean room friendly staff very helpful not far from airport and only a short bus ride to the city center Would definitely recommend and would stay there again when I go back for another weekend away
393023,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, You need almost half an hour to get from the Hotel to the city center using the bus Not a big deal for us but it may be for others Consider renting a car Depending on your family group size it can even be cheaper then using the public transport We paid 30euros 6 bus tickets and carried the luggage around 500 meters to from the bus station instead of receiving the FREE airport transfer No one at the hotel had a driver s license they said Apparently the designated driver only works in the morning and evening At check out they did the math and told us a sum that was more then we expected with almost 100 euros it was a single bill for three rooms We showed them the booking prices reminded that for the weekend the breakfast is at half price and in the end we payed the correct amount , The location is decent pretty quiet area there is a big park nearby great for a morning run not too far from the airport The rooms are really nice big comfortable bed clean nice bathroom AC TV free safe One of the better breakfasts we had all 6 of us agreed to this two are vegetarians Very well priced for what it offers at least in the period we were there beginning of April We payed 75 euros room night I doubt you can find something better at this price in Amsterdam Also the breakfast was totally worth the price of 11 euros 2 for 1 in the week ends You get a 5 euros ticket for the bar restaurant menu each day you use the please do not clean the room sign We often do this anyway because cleaning the room and changing all the towels daily seems such a waste So it s not the 5 euros I applaud but the initiative to encourage a more thoughtful approach from each of us 
393024,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Could only pay for the restaurant food on card not in cash which was not appropriate for us , Lovely room such good value for money would definitely recommend Staff are extremely helpful and buses run a 2 minute walk away that go into the city centre There is a petrol station right next door which sells food so is very convenient 10 10
393025,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, There was damage to our bathroom door when we arrived but the staff resolved this issue very quickly, The room was nicely decorated it was perfect for a city break as we were out all day and did not spend that much time at the hotel
393026,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Everything in Amsterdam is expensive but luckily there was a discount from the breakfast that weekend so it was okay prize Would rather have a cheaper option than all the possible kinds of food that you may not even have time to eat or even can t fit in that much Breakfast would be very good still even with less options It took quite a while to finish check in even we had already paid to get to the rooms Since we didn t have much time to sleep and were already very tired would have been nice to just sing the papers and go I don t know what took so long In the morning we d just needed to get our luggage to be able to leave to the airport early on sunday morning but there was only one person working and lots of people by the desk Luckily the driver of the shuttle waited and eventually he gave us the bags and didnt miss the flight Wouldn t have put it there if we d known it takes ages to get them back As a customer server I would have given the bags and then answered tourists questions about transportation and attractions since there was a shuttle waiting for us , Good location if you jsut wanna stay the night close to the airport and continue travelling The airport shuttle is very important fast and had good schedules except the late evening and the driver was nice Room was very clean and good also quite fancy and good breakfast Didn t hear any noises from the corridor which was very good Good air conditioning fresh air in the room 
393027,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, the food and service in the restaurtant was terrible we ordered peking duck and it was definitely not worth the 21 euros per piece extremely dry and not true peking duck also staff at the hotel was not very nice especially not for a four star hotel check out took forever and they first charged us with double the breakfast price if you do not come by car be aware that you have to cross a four line road to get to the hotel as there is a general lack of foot paths , comfortable bed clean rooms on the other side of the road there was a lake to walk around good breakfast
393028,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Could have used a robe and maybe slippers in the room bottle opener extra towels only 1 per person room was clean but missed the extra touch of having the above Check out took a very long time as there was a line of over 15 people with only 2 people at the front desk , Bed was very comfy night staff was very pleasant and helpful 
393029,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The only issue is to work out transport as there isn t much within walking distance The best option if staying at this hotel is to get the bus to and from the hotel 69 or 197 from the airport The bus stop is not far from the hotel and the buses are frequent Then get the bus back to the airport and get the train from Schiphol Airport every time you want to go into Amsterdam Central Getting an Amsterdam Travel Ticket is a cheap way to do this as it allows you access to all transport methods It sounds tedious but does not take long at all , The hotel standard was excellent and the room was lovely and modern with friendly staff 
393030,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, I sent two emails to ask how to reach the Hotel and nobody answered , Very nice Hotel rich breakfast Far Away from the city that you can reach by bus stop mese the Hotel in 20 minutes 
393031,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Didn t have breakfast as it was 22 per person per morning which seemed totally excessive Location was poor 20 minute walk to the tram to the city centre Close to the airport with good shuttle service however , Very clean rooms strong shower and very comfortable bed Nice restaurant area and very friendly staff 
393032,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, When asked the staff how to reach the city they advised me with a different bus from Amsterdam main public transportation company GVB instead of the 69 bus that doesn t go straight to the city centre but is included in the 1 2 and 3 days GVB travelcards and crosses many other tram lines headed for the city centre they only advised me about a different bus company Connexxion red buses that indeed go to the centre but are not included in the travelcards and cost FIVE EUROS one way Stay clear of this if you don t want to spend 10 return just for a bus ride when you can buy a 12 50 48hrs travelcard that covers all trips on GVB Also the toilet in the room did not have a fan taking rid of moisture and smells was quite hard Lastly the access from the bus stop to the property is a bit inconvenient No clear road crossing and walking along cycling roads not very welcomed in the Netherlands , Bed was very comfortable and the shuttle service to the airport is very convenient Very close very fast enough to take you there in time to catch a 7 15 early LCC flight Might seem far from the city centre but by using a bus 69 and a tram 2 or walking 15 minutes to the said tram the city centre is less than 30 minutes away 
393033,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, The breakfast buffet was amazing and the room and shower was fantastic even though the location wasn t in the city centre the bus was only 2 50 each day so it was perfect
393034,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, No public transport from Amsterdam Centraal You have to go to the airport everyday and take the hotel shuttle , The bed is extra comfortable Staff is kind and friendly Clean and silent room 
393035,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The place was TOO far from central No easy access to Metro or Tram I would have preferred to stay somewhere else, Nice hotel comfortable and very clean room
393036,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, Staff were extra helpful gave us lots of very very useful leaflets Helped us with busses bus times directions Even looked up the zoo for us Couldn t have been more helpful bed was extra big extra comfy Such a great hotel amazing staff 
393037,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, A little far from the centre although bus stop 100m from hotel , Nice clean re furbished hotel free wi fi with free airport shuttle bus Really friendly and helpful reception staff 
393038,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Would be very useful to include toothpaste with the available toiletries of the room It is good that the hotel is very close to the airport but slightly time wasting the distance to city center , Very comfortable bed Very clean room Nice view from the window Two Russian TV channels Tea coffee available in the room Nice lake near by 
393039,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The side lamps wouldn t work whenever you pressed the switch it would turn on the hallway light but there was a big lamp that did light up the room just wasn t great that you had to get out of bed to switch it off, The bed was a great size and so comfortable
393040,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The person at reception can be more friendly with customers , The breakfast was good and the in house restaurant had good food options I specially appreciate the courtesy and attitude of the shuttle driver 
393041,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, There was some building work going on during our stay but that cant really have been helped and as it was only noisy from about 9 5 it wasn t a problem in the slightest We were under the impression that the room would have a bath A little disappointed with just a shower but it was the only thing wrong with our stay , The room was modern clean and bright the bathroom the same The beds were really comfy Staff were very helpful and it has good transport links to the City Center and Airport just dont get a taxi as its very expensive Great value and a great stay 
393042,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, The hotel was quality prices of rooms were excellent Beautiful memory foam bed staff were quick to reply to requests looking forwards to our next stay in Amsterdam 
393043,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel is having a major make over GREAT but we was told by the reception host that the building work doesn t start till 10 which is good as we would be out of bed by then half past 7 every morning we was woken up with the sound of drilling and building work Not happy, lovely hotel room clean modern comfy bed helpful staff 15 mins bus from the centre a timetable was given to us which helped massively 
393044,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The heating was not the most efficient especially considering there was a minus temperature outside Also the elevator was not working which was a bit annoying as I had a rather big suitcase , Staff was extremely helpful and the hotel has a shuttle bus service to the airport 
393045,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, When we first arrived they said we had to have an extra 540 in a bank account to have as a deposit which was very awkward for us we arrived late at night and wanted to go to the city so this delayed us even more meant one of our friends had they re money tied up with the bank so couldn t withdraw cash We was then told there was building work going on never heard anything like it we had to demand a room change cause the drilling from the builders was so loud at 8am 6pm we couldn t hear each other speak never mind get some sleep Also the wifi kept cutting out every 10 seconds which was extremely annoying And the taxi s cost 40 each journey to the city Definetly the worst hotel experience I ve ever had even though the hotel room was nice and clean, The double bed was big and comfy
393046,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Breakfast was a little basic but only ate there at the weekend Only BP garage next door no other shops, The bed was so comfortable 2 for 1 at weekend for breakfast Fridge and safe in the rooms
393047,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Nothing, Staff are wonderful Check in is too much easy and fast You can enjoy from free shuttle service from to Airport You can acc ss bus or train in 7 minutes 
393048,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Time to check in was quite long the twin room was marked for refurbishment but there was tape on the shower head and the carpet had not been cleaned under the beds when seperating them There was no clear footpath to the bus stop , The direct 197 bus into the city the free shuttle from the airport Refurbished room was finished to a good standard 
393049,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, We have dinner one evening I didn t like it Expensive simple and not high quality of ingredients , In the midway between the airport and the city Clean tidy and confortable 
393050,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, We had an unfortunate dining experience with a hamburger from the menu We asked for medium cooked since we were asked about this specifically by the waitress The hamburger appeared rare and raw inside We sent it back but it came back again raw inside and went back to the kitchen a second time Finally we left the remaining raw flesh on the plate being too embarrassed to return the burger a third time The waitress offered a coffee or desert from the house but by that stage we had had enough to eat , we had a pleasant stay and the shuttle to Schiphol Airport was quick and helpful 
393051,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The design of the bath shade is not good Water easily splashed out of Tw bath tub causing wet floor , The service was excellent Stunning view from our room and the bed was really comfy 
393052,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, the rooms were slightly lacking in sound proofing so when the cleaners were cleaning next door rooms I can hear it fairly clearly, Everything was good 
393053,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, We asked for connecting rooms during booking and they were able to fulfill it for us which was excellent as we were traveling with children Friendly staffs 
393054,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, They helped us with travel and answered our questions in the simplest way possible very helpful and friendly staff The location is not bad at all and transport was very easy the hotel looks great and our beds were extremely comfortable best bit about having a long day out in the city was coming back to soft and warm beds and knowing we would be well rested for the next day 
393055,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, They charged me extra on my credit card as an insurance but have not returned me my guarantee It seemed weird and staff could not properly explain to me why this was needed The hotel is very far away from everything , The room was clean and comfy they offered me the special suite due to room constraints 
393056,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The layout of the room was a bit strange Would prefer a regular rectangular layout that my friends had , The location is good and I like the green initiative I also like the shower but I can t recall which aspect of it 
393057,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, A cross walk or something to cross the busy dual carriageway to get to the hotel from the nearest bus stop could be awkward to cross if there was a lot of cars going by Label the hairdryer as a hairdryer was confused as to where it might be and didn t even think what was in the bathroom was a hairdryer until I rang the reception team, The king size bed was so comfy and big for us to sleep in we overslept in the morning Loved the safe in the wardrobe idea as well for valuables
393058,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, This hotel quality was like 2 star absolutely The heater was enough for the rooms and it was so cold We wanted to change our room because of seperate beds but we couldnt The workers started to work in the morning at 08 00 oclock The hotel location is near the airport it is far away from the city center you can arrive there by bus in 15 20 minutes ,No Positive
393059,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The second bed was faulty It collapsed in fact and could not be fixed because the wooden bars on the bottom were missing We reserved for four but didn t have enough towels and the second bed sofa was not prepared ahead of time We would like to know whether we can get part of the price restituted Looking forward to hearing from you about this ,No Positive
393060,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, It was not very near from the city centre but it was never an issue There was a shuttle every 30 minutes from the airport to the hotel so for the whole 3 days of our trip whenever we are getting back to the hotel from exploring the centre we get down to the airport from centrale station and take the shuttle back to the hotel We also do the same in the morning shuttle to the airport then takes the train from there to wherever we want to go The staff was also very friendly and accomodating 
393061,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, We specificly booked a room with two single beds since we were two friends traveling But when we arrived they said that they only had rooms with on big bed for us and that it didn t matter what we had booked I ended up in an extra bed for kids ,No Positive
393062,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Location is not the greatest but the staff was helpful in getting us across to the city Only if we did do some shopping it is a bit difficult to carry them across Maybe a Shuttle by the Hotel with a nominal fee would be helpful The housekeeping should be a bit more attentive to keep the blocks of the sink at bay , The breakfast was great Staff was very courteous and helpful All staff from reception housekeeping restaurants the shuttle were great Hotel should be excellent during summer as we came on the first day of winter specially with a nice garden and the park on the opposite side 
393063,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, There was no hot water Informed the hotel and noted they would send someone round After waiting no one came and then reception informed us the boiler was down Cold shower and conflicting reasons ,No Positive
393064,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Asked how much breakfast was and wasn t given a straight answer Asked if I had to pay for it and was told not to worry about paying Then was charged 96 for two breakfast for the two mornings, Bed was amazing hotel was spotless didn t look great from outside but was amazed at how nice it was 
393065,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, This is currently not a hotel but a construction site I was terroized from early morning and all day with unacceptable building noise while resting after a long trip and working in the room People were working all day i e with jackhammers in the adjacent rooms I asked for a room change but no silent room was available To make thinks worse I was overcharged I checked out in the evening since I had to leave very early flight and received an appropiate bill A day later the hotel made another charge without my concent in excess of booked price It s a terrible place Don t punish yourself by booking here , Nothing Terrible place Stay away 
393066,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel is located outside town far from the center definitely not a problem if you don t need to go back to the hotel several times during the day The only shop in the area is a gas station There were metallic grit in the water when we used the shower in the evening , Located right on the way between city center and airport Free shuttle service to and from the airport all day it takes less than 10 minutes There s a bus stop for lines 197 and 69 it takes less than 25 minutes to reach the center of Amsterdam Bus 69 is cheaper You can also use these buses to get to the airport The hotel is located by the highway but in a lovely green and quiet area There is a nice lake and park near the hotel Comfortable beds clean room and bathroom Room is cleaned everyday Very strong wi fi signal and free parking near by 
393067,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, They charged me more than the agreed value and still they didnot refund me the money They were making renovations and a lot of noise since in the early morning Staff were not kind Location is horrible It worth nothing I dont advise to reserve at this hotel, Nice view but far from center and no transportation 
393068,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The water ran black initially they charged for things without making me aware very noisy from 8am onwards, Comfortable warm well lit rooms with a friendly staff base
393069,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Hotel was booked on knowledge bus was 10 15 minutes from city centre however due to disturbances on the route we were forced to get taxis during our stay and this was very inconvenient ,No Positive
393070,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel is currently undergoing renovations I was given a room that was connected to some pipe work upstairs but hotel staff did not check the condition of the pipes I had dirty water that contained metallic grit in my bath When I alerted reception I was asked to wait for a renovation worker to fix my problem He did this but asked me to keep on flushing the pipes and bath until the water runs clean If anything this should have been hotel staff duty yo do In the morning I heard another guest complaining indicating that many rooms were effected by this I had in fact drunk a glass of water on arrival and clearly am very likely to have drunk contaminated water I asked Mercure management to contact me by email but they never did , Clean bed
393071,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, We had a bad experience in checkin because we booked room with two beds but it changed in check in and receptionists changed their minds three times and each one of them has an opinion about our reservation it was disappointing actually far away from center of amsterdam, It was good so far clean staff was very helpful place quite calm
393072,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, There is an extra charge of 112 46 euro on my credit card that I just found out the next day of check out I called the hotel and she explained will return to me in 5 working days It s ridiculous they took extra charge for no reason and no inform me even they already took 20 euro each room for the deposit This money issue is very unpleasant ,No Positive
393073,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, I was not told that the hotel is being refurbished At 5pm I got back to the hotel to the noise of a hammer drill the noise was so loud I left the hotel I asked at front desk what time that is going to start in the morning and was told 10am Which was fine with me At 7 40am the next morning the works started again Very unhappy when I had a 7 hour drive ahead of me Misleading booking , The Bed was very comfy 
393074,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Easy to get from the airport by shuttle only we were not aware that between 13 00 and 17 00 hrs there is no service without requesting this and we arrived in the afternoon and had to take a taxi for 22 , Very good hotel room and friendly staff Bus 197 brings you to the centre of Amsterdam 
393075,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Staff service can be improved more I missed my breakfast because they didn t tell me about the different breakfast timings on weekends and weekdays Similarly I missed shuttle to airport while waiting in the lobby , Room was good I liked the breakfast Garden was really good but I think you can make the garden better 
393076,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Breakfast could hav been much cheaper or at least more option on the type of breakfast cheaper option , Im sure they were but we could not afford the breakfast Didn t spend too much time in the hotel we were comfy when we did 
393077,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The breakfast was cut off an hour before advertised time 11 and not 12 because of the marathon We talked to the lobby the day before many times and nobody told us about the cutt off and we had already paid for it and only got a granola bar and some bread and nutella It was not so nice But it was just a small inconvineance so no big deal , It was clean and stylish lobby and bar Extra points for the best foam coffee machine in the bar The room was nice 
393078,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Free shuttle was overbooked we had to order a taxi Reception staff was inexperienced, I have stayed at Mercure Schiphol many times and it is always reliable quiet and clean 
393079,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Bathroom fulfills its purpose but it s not really up to modern standards Cramped shower Mold in the shower whereas it would have been so easy to remove , The free shuttle service to and from the airport all day The fact that you can rent a bike a must in order to explore Amsterdam Comfortable mattress Hotel is located across the street from a large lake and lovely nature reserve with bike paths leading you into city center A lovely way to start your tour of Amsterdam
393080,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, No early check in unless pay and extra 30 euros , Gave good advice on how to get into Amsterdam by bus very easy and the fare to expect Enjoyed a good dinner with friendly service 
393081,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel room doors are very stiff and the lift is very old school If the shuttle bus could be more frequent it would be very helpful , The breakfast was good The bed was comfortable The hotel had a green policy to conserve the environment 
393082,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Have no complaints, Very friendly hotel beautiful gardens on a greenbelt with canal flowing past Tranquil location Shuttle to and from airport very easy and prompt Beds comfy and room a good size 
393083,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, There is no airport courtesy vehicle between the hours of 11 30 and almost 17 00 hours Had to pay extra for a taxi , Rooms were clean comfortable Staff are friendly The tranquility of the hotels location
393084,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, At the begin they ask to pay a deposit of 40 Then it took us 2 weeks after our stay to be refund after 2 3 mails The price of the parking is overpriced with 17 5 for the day But you can cross the road and leave the car on a parking along a canal and then walk back to the hotel The hotel is far from the center you need to take a bus 30mins which cost 10 go and return , We spend 2 nights on this hotel The room was fine and clean The staff was correct 
393085,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, When I booked it it was called the Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Airport And probably it was once the closest to the airport These days it is a decent bus ride to the airport and a long bus ride to the city so sort of in the middle of nowhere Now it seems to have had a name change which is good If you have a car it would be a good place to stay We didn t and it was not , The staff the room the food They do good food but maybe a little on the expensive side 
393086,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Located outside of the city in the middle of nowhere , Located right on the way between city center and airport Free airport shuttle Located by the highway but quite
393087,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The food at the resteraunt was very slow to show up The service was very slow nice but very slow , The staff was very competent The shuttle driver was very freindly and his service was way above average We took the shuttle to the air port every day of our stay since we went to the city from the airport 
393088,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The staff Generally useless and awkward The map they give you for tourists is also useless Do some research on your own ahead of time Location This is in the seedy part of town next to some gross looking sex toy shops The automatic check in check out system is totally useless and clunky A staff person has to be there to do it anyways Remote control didn t work curtains and carpet looked really old and sad Croissants are gone in minutes no free coffee , The place is clean and there are elevators to get upstairs The mattress was comfortable and sheets were decent Vending machines had pads tampons and general hygiene products 
393089,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, still thinking that cost of breakfast a little expensive but selection is good , excellent location for our needs central but far enough away from the city noise
393090,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West,No Negative, Very comfortable beds clean room and bathroom very quiet location Room is cleaned everyday and you get fresh towels whenever needed Showergel and shampoo are free in the bathroom The only thing you must consider is that the hotel is located outside town in the middle of a green area the only shop in the area is a gas station close to the hotel but it was enough for our needs they have lots of snacks drinks and other items you might need As I said far away fom the city center but definitely not a problem if you don t need to go back to the hotel several times during the day From the airport the free shuttle takes you to the hotel in less than 10 minutes And to reach the city center there s a bus stop for line 197 which takes you to the museum area in no more than 15 minutes 
393091,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Not much in the way of restaurants in the immediate vicinity Internet speeds poor in the evening time frame , Great location with parking Very easy to catch a bus to the city center and back to the hotel Very close to a large body of water with walking trails along the perimeter 
393092,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Location wise its about 10 20 min from central What I didn t like is that the walk towards the bus stop is a bit dangerous as there are no proper lane for walking I Know its not the hotels fault but maybe it would be nice if it has had a proper walking lane , I like the ambience and that it feels like a 5 star hotel for a small price The room was very clean and comfortable 
393093,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Not fits for families with child after checking out they could not provide any convenient place room to sleep our child while we are waiting our evening flight in the hotel,No Positive
393094,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, It was a bit far from the center and the surroundings weren t really stunning , Very comfortable beds clean hotel Our first room was missing safebox but we got a new room instantly what was really nice There is also a bus 197 which will take you straight to the center of Amsterdam for 2 50 and night bus N97 for 5 you can also use these buses to get to the airport There is also a nice lake and park near the hotel Free shuttle bus was very convenient 
393095,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Seemed to be understaffed at the check in reception desk , Handy location near the airport ideal for our one night stopover Nice surrounds and great evening meal Average room but clean and comfy bed 
393096,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Gym could have had a bar rack The rooms could do with a lighter duvet , Great on site restaurant with good sized meals Nice little gym room free early morning shuttle bus to the airport Perfect last night in The Netherlands hotel I arrived early and my room wasn t ready but they sorted it all out so I didn t have to sit around for 2 hours 
393097,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Amsterdam taxi drivers are rubbish rude and unhelpful , Staff were incredibly helpful nothing was too much trouble The free shuttle was an excellent service even out of regular hours Easy journey into city centre by reliable bus service 
393098,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, I liked everything A bit more variety with the mains I only eat beef and chicken and had burgers on both days About three more mains that included meats such as lamb would improve the menu as people are becoming more specific about what they eat I want clear if the bikes were were for hire or free I could have asked but kept forgetting If I knew immediately it could have helped my planning , Great breakfasts Get there early so you can take your time with the variety Small gym that is conveniently located Free pick up from airport and local bus tp airport and trains within walking distance 
393099,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Tons of hidden fees 23 Euro for mandatory breakfast that was worth maybe 8 Euro This added up to almost 200 Euro for breakfast for 2 days family of four with two small children they changed full price for children Added a hotel tax for over 60 Euro a night Parking fees too Over all the hidden fees were higher than the actual price of the room I don t like feeling taken advantage of and this place made me feel violated Read the fine print they are going to take advantage of you at every chance they can get , Fine accomidations but deceptive pricing
393100,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, A bit far away from the city center Buses were not running during our stay due to some works , Very good hotel The staff was great Clean and comfy Good price for what you get Would definitely recommend for other to stay here 
393101,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The door to the room had the tendency to attack from behind The Bath has a high entry , The bed was the best we ever had My missus wanted to keep it and bring it back home The location was perfect and despite the close vicinity to the airport and motorway silent 
393102,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Again ladies and gentlemen I think the room was awesome and the staff is great but the price has to be a little bit different than what was on booking com what they charge me was different than what was quoted I am still looking for my refund that they said that was going to be refunded to my account , Had a wonderful stay but on booking com I think the prices was a little different and I think I ve been charged a little bit more It was an awesome room The staff was excellent But I think there was a little confusion about the cost I would stay there again and recommend it to all of my Airline friends 
393103,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel has no shops nearby or any specific attraction to visit in that particular area Also you cannot walk towards the city centre because it takes a lot of time and the road is not pedestrian accessible , The hotel offers you a variety of services it s a quiet place to spend the night and has a very beautiful park across it where you can watch a wonderful sunset sunrise Also the bus stops are really close and you arrive in the centre of Amsterdam in less than 20 minutes 
393104,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Staff wasn t overly friendly Free shuttle bus to the airport wasn t available even when we have requested it specifically We were only told minutes before having to leave Very disappointing , The huge beds were extremely comfortable
393105,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The hotel is very far from city center I would only stay here if I will transit in Amsterdam , The rooms are big and clean The bed is very comfortable The hotel has all the facilities you might need 
393106,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Not recommended to those without a car , For those with a car really good as you can park outside the hotel without paying The city center is not far away 
393107,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, I thought the restaurant s menu was somewhat limited both in choices and prices however the food was good When they tell you the shuttle is first come first serve believe it I was there at 5 10 for the 6 00 shuttle but there is no sign in sheet or anything so while I was waiting inside with the blessing of staff who knew I was waiting people went outside and waited thus bumping me I made it onto the full shuttle but in think a reservation system for the 8 seat shuttle would being peace of mind my only other thing is a little unusual I thought the tub was very narrow while trying to shower I had to turn sidewise the entire time and the glass shower door needed to be a few inches wider to keep water from going everywhere Again not big deals just little inconveniences , I walked out of the airport located the shuttle and walked right on to it The location is about 10 minutes from the airport The room was quiet despite being on the road side of the building and clean The bed was very comfortable I just needed a place to rest my head between flights not a place to stay while touring Amsterdam and this served the purpose perfectly 
393108,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Not helpful Dirty hotel even after cleaning it seems they don t know how to clean They don t change the covers and blanket they don t clean them at all There are yellow color on the white covers Someone used them before me and have love on the same blanket I have used to sleep on , I like nothing Very bad hotel Horrible hotel Even the free shuttle bus time is not correct and accurate 
393109,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Unfortunately despite checking with the hotel before making the booking the taxis into the centre were 40 each way not 20 as suggested This included using the Hotel s preferred taxi company and the booking being made via reception at the hotel very disappointing , The beds were comfy and the reception staff were helpful 
393110,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, expensive breakfast and parking some of the staff was not nice to each other which is not nice when your standing at the frontdesk as a costumer, location
393111,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, too expensive breakfast little bedrooms and bathrooms no proper ventilation and fresh air in the rooms, rooms were very clean and quiet personnel was always available kind shuttle to the airport very useful also to get the train to the city center from airport train station 
393112,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Automatic phone from airport to the hotel did not work so we were obliged to take a taxi rather than the advertised free shuttle Price for breakfast was higher than it should have been, Location next to lake was excellent
393113,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Can NOT think of anything, Room very nice clean and quiet Staff very helpful Great location Shuttle service excellent Good value and I will return when traveling to Europe again 
393114,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Early check in is not cheap , The hotel was a in a lovely green and quiet area it was both close to the airport and city center There was a big park across the street and also so was the bus to the city center The rooms were clean and comfortable Free shuttle to the airport was convenient Very happy with our stay 
393115,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Breakfast was only one choice a buffet at 22 Euros person which we considered to be too much money and food no other choice was given so we had to find breakfast elsewhere which was very inconvenient , Staff were very helpful giving us directions to bus into town 
393116,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The restaurant is nice looking out over the garden but the menu is bland comfort food no refined cuisine wine card very limited Airport shuttle is proposed but cannot be guaranteed so that you have to leave too early in order to secure a seta, The location close to Schiphol from where we took off next day
393117,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The location is terrible This is not an airport hotel The hotel is located in between Ams and the Airport by the highway , The rooms were clean and of good quality 
393118,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, We stayed at a number of other Mercure hotels during our recent trip and this hotel is a blight on their chain definitely the worst Mercure we ve ever stayed in The lift is a disgrace and has to be experienced to be believed it is halfway down a long and narrow ground floor corridor and is the size of a shoe box with non automatic closing doors The Addams Family would be right at home in this lift The overall feel of the hotel is that demolition would be a kind renovation the only thing that saves it is the location close to the airport service is ordinary and the breakfast is overpriced do yourself a favour and catch an earlier flight so you don t have to stay there , It was close to the airport and the wifi is good 
393119,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, pretty expensive, very friendly staff very clean good pickup service from and to the airport even though it was far from city center there is a direct bus you can take 5min away from the hotel
393120,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, in the bathroom the ceiling was too low because of the false ceiling I have 185 cm so it was uncomfortable to take a shower , close to airport and city centre with the same buss i think 197 you can go at the airport and to the city centre with 2 5 from the hotel

393124,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Rude staff even the manager I sent the message to the hotel via Booking com app that we will arrive late after midnight There was no response but I assumed that everything is fine as hotel states 24x7 working reception We arrived to the hotel at 02 00 after midnight and met the person on duty Hasim He looked bit lost and informed us that our reservation was cancelled half a day ago because there was some payment problem There was no information via e mail or via Booking com app that they had any issue I asked and what about my e mail Didn t you read it He said that they had no time to check messages and couldn t explain why they cancelled reservation without informing me He said that he has only one available room in the hotel and offered it to us with a higher price than originally booked I didn t agree and asked for a manager There was some dutch guy Wil who was acting as a manager but he was useless as well they bot said that I need to pay new higher price for the room It took 1 hour for us to get the room in this hotel remember hotel is in the middle of nowhere and it was 2 00 at night otherwise I would be definitely going to another place the most ridiculous thing is that after 1 hour dispute we received the room and breakfast for the original price at the end while in the beginning Hasim and Will were telling that this is completely impossible I would dismiss such customer unfriendly staff if I were the manager of this hotel , Nothing
393125,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, The internet connection was difficult to access The acceptance page did not come up on my tablet Luckily one of the staff knew a trick to make it work type in www google nl That allowed my tablet to access the internet Everyone on staff should know about that option for international travelers who may experience difficulty Also the printer in the lobby did not work for printing out boarding passes , I greatly appreciated the free airport shuttle which I used for both of my visits this month When I had to get a taxi to the airport before the regular shuttle hours started I was surprised that it cost so much to go such a short distance That service represents a real savings The staff was extremely helpful and kind They went out of their way to make me feel at home and answered all my questions cheerfully There was also the option to rent a bike on site which I took advantage of doing I only had an afternoon and evening in Amsterdam so exploring the beautiful countryside magnificent Vondelpark and city center by bike was absolutely a delightful experience 
393126,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, Our lunch was disappointing far too much salad dressing on tuna salad and the tuna tasted off I didn t receive what I had ordered the bread had been toasted and dried out It just crumbled when I bit into the sandwich , The staff were most helpful 
393127,Mercure Hotel Amsterdam West, High parking fee When I booked this hotel I remember it provide free parking or else why I book this remote area hotel When received confirmation I never check and only when checkin was told I need to pay 17 per night so two night end up I need to pay 35 I don t think I was so careless to miss the parking need to pay statement for others hotel I know which need to pay for parking And I will pay for the parking in advance if needed Very bad experience and I think I will never consider this hotel any more , Clean room
