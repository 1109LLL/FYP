389730,COMO Metropolitan London, Breakfast food was good but the room lacks soul Staff were not as friendly as we would have liked check in was fine but further enquiries to the front desk about late check outs were painful, Gorgeous room with a view over Hyde Park Location was outstanding Great bathroom All so comfortable
389731,COMO Metropolitan London, The only criticism was that the shower wasn t hot in the morning on the maximum setting it was Luke warm Didn t raise with staff at the time though , I loved the brightness airy feel to the room the decor was simple stylish every detail of the room had been thought out to perfection The dressing gown and slippers felt lovely as did the bed linen especially the pillow which was beautifully luxurious the best I ve ever laid my head on Air conditioning just right and the location was great Staff were very accommodating friendly and very helpful The best hotel room I ve ever stayed in 
389732,COMO Metropolitan London, Our room 401 evidently adjoined a staff laundry room and it was unbearably noisy We moved and the next room 505 was much better , Room was exceptionally well laid out and designed with electrical outlets to fit every continent and bluetooth access to the room s audio 
389733,COMO Metropolitan London, Our room was noisy on a couple of occasions but the noise went away Could have been the restaurant staff cleaning , The staff is very accommodating the rooms are very clean and the location is tops 
389734,COMO Metropolitan London,No Negative, Excellent service from first arrival as expected with a 5 star hotel Breakfast service quality of food was fantastic Great location near Hyde Park with in easy reach of Green Park tube station We will hopefully be back in the near future 
389735,COMO Metropolitan London, The bathroom was a bit too warm Coffee could be better , The general style feel and atmosphere of the hotel is what we like most Staff were excellent and helpful especially for the valet parking assistants wonderful The room deco is modern and comfortable and minimalistic Plenty of good restaurants around and getting public transportation was easy The bar for live FA Cup final was excellent arrangement We came to London to the Chelsea Flower Show and it was an excellent stay Thanks for all the staffs services 
389736,COMO Metropolitan London, Tub shower Never been a fan of the half shower glass walls I always get water everywhere I found the desk a little tight to the bed It was really long so it could have been a bit narrower , Location and staff The staff we have experienced at London hotels are all professional and the Como was no exception Friendly personal staff who really know how to take care of people Wonderful stay
389737,COMO Metropolitan London, Placed at back of hotel so the view was not good at all and only high lighted when going to breakfast and you see the splendor of Hyde Park but Hotels only have so many rooms and its the luck of the draw but this did not take from our trip and I did not plan to stay in the room looking out of a window, Brilliant staff all round room was not ready on arrival but was taken to the Met Bar and offered complimentary glass of Champagne could not be more attentive it was my partners Birthday and was given a beautiful Chocolate birthday take delivered to our room after a hard days shopping Wonderful If you are going to treat a love one to a weekend in London this is the only place to stay 10 10
389738,COMO Metropolitan London, Expensive 30 each for breakfast We were upgraded butvto a room next to the lift Lots of noisy adults partying in corridors until 3 am, Great venue
389739,COMO Metropolitan London, It s not the first time we stay there and this time our room was in the 1st or 2nd floor do not remember exactly and we didn t like that people were working in the terrace or roof that is in the middle so we didn t have privacy and there are lot of machines there so the noise was not nice The other thing is that the gym was under construction and nobody told us that before and for us the gym is the 1st thing for choosing a hotel So we had a bad experience with that ,No Positive
389740,COMO Metropolitan London, Nothing , I liked the hotel welcome the friendly informal staff The location is fantastic I stayed in a 2 bed apartment it felt like my own place One attention to detail which didn t go unnoticed was the fact that the shower temperature dial was kept at a perfect setting after cleaning I can t tell the number of times I have to fiddle with the dial for 5 minutes 
389741,COMO Metropolitan London, Faultless Will stay again , Nothing too much trouble Friendly helpful and professional staff Upgraded to well equipped well laid out large room with view over Hyde Park Housekeeping and room service speedy

389744,COMO Metropolitan London,No Negative, We liked everything The friendly staff the very clean and big rooms the excellent breakfast the room service just everything 5 If we will come back to London we will only stay at COMO We travelled with our 2 years old son and they were all very kind with our son 
389745,COMO Metropolitan London, Housekeeping On the second day the dirty coffee cups and the expresso tubs were not replaced English breakfast Uncoordinated breakfast team On the first day our breakfast order was taken by three different members of staff The main course arrived before the starter then the starter arrived and my main course was put to the middle of the table so I could watch it go cold The cooking of the main course was woefully bad Two members of staff hovered continually around the table picking up every little piece of rubbish while we were eating sometimes reaching across us as we tried to put some food in our mouths Staff were constantly asking if everything was all right when it was clear that it wasn t Bar closed for a private function so residents were excluded Over zealous and nosey door staff Very poor value , Nothing really 
389746,COMO Metropolitan London, Hotel price a bit high but that s expected from a five star hotel in London , Best location in London 10 minutes walking to Harrods or Oxford street also if you cross the road you will be in the Hyde park Great service and staff all they are helpful 
389747,COMO Metropolitan London, The bathroom could be better if it is dry wet depart It was nice that the hotel offers yoga mat however there was no space for yoga as the room was a little bit small lol , I like the coffee machine and the room was clean and tidy Staffs are friendly and helpful Location was great 
389748,COMO Metropolitan London, Hammam in the GYM was cold no sauna facility itself was not comfortable My wife did not like massage as well compared to Metropolitan in Bangkok , Good value for money in London Park view room was excellent and larger than usual in London

389753,COMO Metropolitan London, When I checked in they said I could pay on a foreign currency and told me how much I would pay When I checked out they charged me an extra 85usd on top of the price they gave me saying the conversion was different to the price they told me the day before Also really poorly equipped fitness centre , The decor is nice nice close to park
389754,COMO Metropolitan London, That breakfast was included in our room but you still get a service charge added to your room bill which I thought was quite cheeky We also got charged for something from the minibar twice , The room was very modern and really clean The location was great it was walking distance to everything we wanted shops restaurants theatre The hotel smelt amazing everywhere you went They also left me some chocolates in the room as it was my birthday which was a lovely touch Would definitely stay here again for a special occasion

389760,COMO Metropolitan London, The sink was clough up and the water pressure is weak The eletronic control is a waste of time We should not be learning how to manipulate a system to turn on lights close blinds etc , Size of room 
389761,COMO Metropolitan London, As i checked in they gave me a very different rate than the one i booked around 30 40 more expensive I had to show them my booking com confirmation and the rate that i booked After 20 mins of checking and some digging they told me it was a mistake and they gave me booking com rate I usually understand that mistakes happen and dont complain however this felt like it was an intentional mistake I could be wrong After check in everything was great,No Positive

389768,COMO Metropolitan London, The apartments building is in the back and is not even connected to the main hotel building which makes it a bit dangerous especially at night The hotel tried to make the checkout at 10 AM although the booking is till two hours after that , Location and space
389769,COMO Metropolitan London, Our room was not available at check in time and we were requested to come back an hour later Duly did so and was still not ready so we were asked to wait in hotel bar Manager gave my daughter a free teddy and postcard book as an apology which was very sweet Room Debbie breakfast was appalling at 28 each plus service you would have expected better It was not late not all there the waiter went back twice to get missing items and absolutely every single item was stone cold I would definitely stay here again as the location was amazing and facilities in the apartment were great but not order any food , Apartment was huge and perfect for 5 people Amazing location to visit Hyde Park

389772,COMO Metropolitan London, The friendly receptionist looked up a room within our category but with some extra space as we needed a crib for our baby She failed to inform us that it was on a smoking floor which we didn t notice until we were back to put baby down as we originally just went up to get bags put away and then went straight out to meet friends The room smelt fine but each time we opened the door there was a bad cigarette smell that came in from the hallway Room was still great but smell in the hallway was quite off putting , Staff were friendly and helpful Room was perfect clean and bright yet simple

389781,COMO Metropolitan London, The service at Breakfast was good but would be good if they can spend it up slightly as we had to rush a little , Excellent room and view with free upgrade They receptionist accompanied me to me my room and demonstrated how all of the controls work It was worth them doing that as everyting is electric automated Also well kitted for the modern requirements including I phone dock etc
