265181,Hotel Les Th tres,No Negative, The staff in this hotel were amazing I booked a room that was not quite what I wanted and they did everything possible to accommodate my needs The room I was moved into was larger than most I have seen in Paris The front desk worker Franck was great as was the lady manager with my requests These workers are a valuable asset to this hotel 
265182,Hotel Les Th tres,No Negative, Overall a very good hotel Friendly and helpful service Room was quiet clean and well serviced The complimentary cell phone to use was great for getting around town 
265183,Hotel Les Th tres, No view from the window Would have liked a theatre guide as in the theatre centre There were a lot of vagrants in this area , Interesting quirky little hotel Loved reading the theatre posters Friendly helpful staff Good choice at breakfast Very comfortable bed Able to have a night cap in the bar 
265184,Hotel Les Th tres, It would be great to have fresh orange juice for free for breakfast wifi was not always stable but generally fine Bottle of water in the room would be a nice compliment during hot summer , Mobile for internet and international calls comfortable bed croissants for breakfast Funny room design
265185,Hotel Les Th tres, The room was not cleaned or serviced on our 2nd day no replenishment of used soap and shampoo make up spilt on floor was left where it was was our accident but it would be normal for this to be swept up when housekeeping serviced the room The Bathroom was the smallest that I have ever seen just about room to stand between shower and basin to wash but no room for a toilet that was in a very claustrophobic closet on the opposite side of the bedroom with no hand washing facilities which is not ideal in the middle of the night or any time for that matter How this has 4 stars is beyond me 2 at best The neigbourhood seemed to be in the red light area with prostitutes lurking in every alleyway and sex shops and brothels on every block This may suit some but we will not be back Hope this helps other find what they are looking for , Bed was comfy and the front desk staff polite
265186,Hotel Les Th tres, room was very small even by Paris standards It was also decorated very dark making it seem even smaller The neighborhood was very busy though the hotel is on a quiet street We will stay in the 5th or 6th arrondisment next time, less than 200 yards from 2 Metro stations they had a honor bar which worked well Wine selection was limited though using a funky dispenser 
265187,Hotel Les Th tres, Our room was not available when we arrived and had to wait another 45min to 2 45pm Could have been acceptable if they hadn t known we were coming in at 2 but we arrived the first time at 11 asking if it was ready and said we d only go out for lunch and then get back at 2 They then offerd us a free drink but no one came to take our order until 5min before our room was ready ,No Positive
265188,Hotel Les Th tres, Very tight space Not a great neighbourhood One reception staff member unhelpful but others excellent , Super comfortable bed and pillows Very clean Great sleep 
265189,Hotel Les Th tres, no restaurant or bar inside the hotel as you arrive and would to eat or drink something there are no facilities but just out of the hotel is full of pubs bistro and brasseries , nice place in nice area 15 minutes walk from Notre Dame the neighborhood is funny with some strange situations coffee shops brothels etc but definitely safe which in paris is not easy at this days the whole stay has been nice and relaxing
265190,Hotel Les Th tres, The room is very small and there was no privacy in the bathroom Is very open , The hotel is nice and the location is very good The breakfast was very good The terrase was great 
265191,Hotel Les Th tres, Small room with even smaller bathroom , Good location close to gare du nord so easy access for everyone traveling by eurostar Also not far to centre Pompidou and louvre 
265192,Hotel Les Th tres, My only negative point is the ongoing musty smell originating from the shower due to the old inadequately maintained Paris city pipe system a typical Parisian problem which a lot of hotels and buildings must bear with and on and off overflowing into the bedroom area , Highlights are the excellent breakfast buffet and by usually poor French standards all the better the dedicated service minded staff whether day or night the stylish and tasteful Napoleon III style and decoration of the breakfast area the lovely private 8 sqm rooftop terrace featured en suite to my room 5th floor 504 in cramped Paris an absolute luxury and rarity Thank you for this 
265193,Hotel Les Th tres, No noise isolation Weird room plan with bathroom and toilet in opposite parts of the room See window view in the attached , Location is reasonable Rooms are decorated nicely but not really comfortable see below 
265194,Hotel Les Th tres, The air conditioner was not working properly Room was very hot and it was therefore hard to sleep We informed reception but while being sympathetic were unable to get anyone to fix it , Bed was good Staff were very friendly Great location 
265195,Hotel Les Th tres, Despite the fact that hotel is located near a metro station it is located in a small street and it s difficult to find some decent place to dine around , The bed was amazing pillows and linen were fresh enough and good quality Price is reasonable if you have limited budget but still want to stay near by city center Staff is always ready to help It was very pleasant to had the check in earlier than 2 PM as it is scheduled I have arrived to the hotel very early around 10 30 AM since I landed at 7AM But the reception arranged my room by 12 30 AM and kindly gave me the access 
265196,Hotel Les Th tres, Air conditioning in our room was not working but it wasn t needed at this time of the year, Very nice and friendly staff very good breakfast great location
265197,Hotel Les Th tres, I ve never found a shower in a Parisian hotel that drains properly and this was no exception , Restaurant and staff were excellent room was spacious and surprisingly quiet for the location
265198,Hotel Les Th tres, I didn t like the bad it has a cover on that was really uncomfortable and the reception very small The attention for the client and the confort could be better , I like the WIfi service and the silent of the room

265200,Hotel Les Th tres,No Negative, I requested a room with balcony when booking but it could not be guaranteed however we did end up with the top floor room super nice and its huge terrace where we enjoyed our breakfast and a few drinks under amazing sunshine an overall perfect stay
265201,Hotel Les Th tres, The lift was so slow and really small We were staying on the top floor and the lift only went to the floor below , They gave you a smart phone to use with internet and free call to Europe USA and Canada 
265202,Hotel Les Th tres, nothing , The rooms are aesthetically pleasing and rather spacious We liked that it was located next to the metro and bus stops We love the fact that the hotel provided us with a samsung mobile phone that allowed us to commute with much ease in Paris Honestly this was a big thing because we did not have time to get a sim card in Paris upon arrival And on Sunday everywhere is closed The mobile phone was a very plus point there The staff was really pleasant and helpful We got lost on the first day and the duty manager came out to take us to the hotel We were also upgraded to a larger room as it was our honeymoon We really enjoyed our time in Paris and Les Theatres was part of the reason 
265203,Hotel Les Th tres, Enjoyed the stay bed was abit hard but it s personal preffearence , The location was excellent in terms of the metro and the staff were friendly No noise at all at night which was great in a city 
265204,Hotel Les Th tres,No Negative, I liked everything but the free phone to use that had GPS on it free of charge to use during our stay was great I also liked that it was close to the metro and amazing food spots
265205,Hotel Les Th tres,No Negative, All staff where plesant but one young lady on Reception was amazing and was a huge credit to the hotel and herself I am sorry that I didn t get her name Good location for getting around paris great balcony in the room great IT and very useful cell phone that added to our stay Would go back again

265207,Hotel Les Th tres,No Negative, Excellent Customer Service good selection for room service bed was very comfortable when other reviews say the bathroom doesn t have a door that is actually false as the toilet area does have a door and the bathroom has a very nice open setup Front desk was helpful and very courteous Overall a great hotel for the price and it is very near public transportation restaurants and more
265208,Hotel Les Th tres, The elevator broke down on our last day which was a little inconvenient with us on the sixth floor My husband got food poisoning from the bacon at breakfast on our first morning and the staff did not particularly care Did not even discount the meal we had to have in the hotel room because of it Not very helpful , The croissants and cheese at breakfast were lovely Beds were quite comfortable as well The staff on average were quite welcoming and polite 
265209,Hotel Les Th tres, Only have one Mineral Water in the first night we stayed 5 nights at this hotel Evian is luxurious product but you can serve other brands , Tout va bien 
265210,Hotel Les Th tres, Nothing worth noting , Great hotel Great Service Rooms were a little small but that is Paris for you Honesty bar is excellent idea Mobile phone which can be used for maps etc is a great idea too We used it each day Fully recommend this hotel
265211,Hotel Les Th tres, Breakfast a little expensive Many places have good breakfast for 8 Euros if you take a 5minute walk , Excellent small hotel Clean and comfortable two minutes walk from Metro Maybe rooms small for some people but typical of Paris and very attractive Good staff and service Will use again when I am next in Paris Many restaurants and bars close by And easy walk to Notre Dame and the Louvre

265213,Hotel Les Th tres, Aircon was OK but not brilliant But the weather was v hot Shower room was a touch small but just about OK , Very convenient location opposite the Strasbourg St Denis metro Easy access from GdN A mile from Notre Dame It s a lively area for restaurants and bars Very well featured for the price Comfortable and quite spacious vs typical hotels in this price range Nice breakfast room and a well stocked honesty bar 
265214,Hotel Les Th tres, The hotel is lovely but the area isn t great turn left it s nice but right is hectic and I saw too many prostitutes which made me feel uncomfortable Rooms are snug , Friendly staff who encouraged me to speak French even though my skills are basic Nice breakfast beans bacon eggs plenty of bread and pastries 
265215,Hotel Les Th tres, The breakfast could have had either more variety or should have been cheaper so it was worth 15 euros , Great value for money the hotel even provided a free phone with Internet for our use Great boutique theatre theme in the bedrooms 
265216,Hotel Les Th tres, We weren t very happy that you could see the shower from the bed would have gathered more privacy Would have appreciated being told about the room tax on arrival instead of on our departure date , Location was excellent Staff very welcoming and helpful Cleaning staff did an excellent job and very helpful Room was a great size 
265217,Hotel Les Th tres,No Negative, The location is very good with very close metro line connecting it to anywhere in the city 1 5km to Louver Musium and Notre damn AND a very big plus is that they will provide you with a cell phone with 4G connection which you can take out of the hotel room and navigate through the city for free 
265218,Hotel Les Th tres,No Negative, They gave us a smart phone to use while we were there Free of charge We could use it for calls text and data I have never experienced that before it was very helpful and awesome bonus to the room 
265219,Hotel Les Th tres, The AC in the room was quite noisy and as there was a heatwave when we visited we had to keep it on all through the night The breakfast was ok but nothing special for 15 I also would ve appreciated that the eggs had been cooked instead of having to cook them myself when you re traveling with a baby then you don t have the time , The beds were excellent and the room was lovely quite spacious The staff was helpful and made us feel welcome The location made it very easy to get to various places all over Paris 
265220,Hotel Les Th tres, The Walk to the hotel was a bit uncomfortable I would suggest you advise in advance to use the metro with the numbers etc Make it easy for a 1st time to Paris traveller , Staff were very friendly 
265221,Hotel Les Th tres, No parking at the Hotel But Public parking not far away 40 a day , Had a nice room in 6 Floor with big balcony wich is really Special for Paris in this Price category
265222,Hotel Les Th tres, Nothing to say It was a very positive experience, Given we had just been caught up in the journey from hell at the Eurostar terminal and had to book a hotel suddenly the staff were fantastic sympathetic and warm hearted This made all the difference on the strength of this warm welcome I would stay here again when I visit Paris in the future The room was very comfortable

265228,Hotel Les Th tres, There was practically nowhere in the room for our clothes One hanger in the tiny hanging space and no drawers one small shelf View of the room from the door when you come in very good view from the bed not so good fine if you don t mind being looked at in the shower Hairdyer kept on a hook in the loo It seemed to us the room was designed for fun mini bar huge TV and of course hammam downstairs perfect for a possibly younger perhaps not couple on a very tete a tete weekend , bed was very comfortable location was fantastic staff were very helpful and kind 
265229,Hotel Les Th tres, The prices at the bar were far too expensive , calm and tranquil hotel amid the hustle and bustle of Paris super comfy bed and great theatrical d cor throughout Great location for access to the metro and loads of bars and restaurants around Very multi cultural area We loved it

265231,Hotel Les Th tres, Night staff not up to same high standard as day staff, Day staff were fantastic the hotel is in a great locale to discover Paris with authentic bars and restaurants aplenty

265233,Hotel Les Th tres, diffcult for taxis to get to the hotel miss the ramp at rue st denis lights and have to go all the way round again as rue de clery is one way also weather bad when we were there which didnt help , unusual and quirky decor friendly concierge small but very adequate room loved the little bathroom liked the main reception and the way breakfast was laid out 
265234,Hotel Les Th tres, There were no places to hang the towels in the room which is not what you expect in a 4 star hotel, The personnel was extremely friendly and helpful at any time of the day night I loved the concept of the honesty bar The hammam was super nice and cozy

265238,Hotel Les Th tres, The breakfast is very expensive for what you get But the food is pretty good and there is decent variety But 15 euros per person sure adds up The hotel room could have been a bit cleaner The carpet needed to be vacuumed around the baseboards better and the shower walls should be wiped down better The staff was polite enough but I feel like they were a bit short with us at times The neighborhood is a bit seedy There are prostitutes on the streets at night although they dont bother us and there are some erotica stores in the area and a strip club We never had any issues though , The location is good because it is very close to a metro station making it easy to get around The hotel is quirky and interesting and pretty nice Our room was very quiet and had three windows and a great view of cute Parisian rooftops 
265239,Hotel Les Th tres, Although not the fault of the hotel having to pay around 50 for breakfast for 2 people on 1 morning due to city tax isn t great , The rooms were spacious the shower was good and the staff were able to help with any query Great wifi speed was able to stream better than at home

265243,Hotel Les Th tres,No Negative, A very nice friendly hotel providing a great choice for breakfast comfortable room and the honesty bar was well stocked and is a wonderful idea It is very convenient if you are arriving via Eurostar 3 stops on the Metro and the location is lively and interesting to say the least
