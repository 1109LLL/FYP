314748,Primero Primera,No Negative, The hotel is immaculate The staff were friendly and happy to help The location is good outside the centre but easy to reach by metro The rooms are very clean and had everything you would need in them Even has a small pool which is great to relax by 
314749,Primero Primera, I thought staff could be a little more helpful helping with bags etc it depended on who was on duty , It s a great boutique hotel and perfect if you want a break from the action and tourists We loved staying in a residential neighborhood where locals live and away from tourists The property was accessible from the metro We loved the cozy breakfast eating area the small pool and just the overall vibe of the hotel 
314750,Primero Primera, Nothing, The rooms were amazing especially on the top floor The pool area was perfect and we could hsve spent our whole holiday there The service from star was exemplary 
314751,Primero Primera, unhelpful staff got double charge dark room someone did room service on our room number a better system need to be put in place to avoid this the price we paid was different to what booking com said BE CAREFUL, nothing
314752,Primero Primera, E bikes were not top battery off loaded too fast Swimming pool not used New building in construction making it not comfortable to sit next to the swimming pool, Very nice atmosphere and very kind personnel 
314753,Primero Primera, Like any good hotel in Barcelona it s not inexpensive but in our view it was worth it , This is a very classy tranquil boutique style hotel in a leafy nice neighborhood It s not near the city center but served our purpose for visiting family in Sarria St Gervasi Public transport is nearby so getting downtown is no problem The staff were all very helpful and kind making our stay very enjoyable 
314754,Primero Primera,No Negative, Everything was perfect and the friendly staff went beyond expectations Thank you Primiero Primiera We will only stay here when visiting Barcelona 
314755,Primero Primera, None I liked everything about this hotel , Though it is located bit far from the centre of the city it is in a very nice quiet neighborhood Also it is close to many nice restaurants I found the hotel staff service room excellent It is cozy and comfortable and the breakfast was also very good 
314756,Primero Primera, On our first visit it took some time to find the hotel It was dark and I hadn t done my homework on the location Entirely my fault but something to bear in mind for first time visitors , The staff are really friendly and helpful This was a return visit and standards are still maintained to an excellent level 
314757,Primero Primera, My only request would be for brighter lighting at least in the bathroom and at breakfast , This beautiful hotel is in a quiet leafy residential street about a ten minute walk from the closest metro stop It is away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Barcelona making a nice retreat at the end of a busy day sightseeing The staff were helpful and spoke pretty good English Our room was large and very modern and exceptionally clean And breakfast was delicious 
314758,Primero Primera, Everything was top notch , Beautiful property staff were great and helpful accommodations were excellent breakfast buffet was amazing great location comfy bed 
314759,Primero Primera, The bathroom facilities are appalling with a see through blind straight into the bedroom The wood surrounds made the hotel very noisy as did the plumbing On arrival were were given a form to sign and it was explained to us that breakfast was included It turned out that this was a mistake but I think when a form has been signed and an emphasis has been made of this that should be honoured We had to honour our bill despite appalling bathroom arrangements , There was nothing especially good
314760,Primero Primera, It is away from the Gothic Quarter We took trains to get there not a big problem , Very nice room large and well appointed Parking on site no charge 
314761,Primero Primera, Very unstable wi fi Common areas on the ground floor feel a bit dark , Exceptional staff Spacious and nicely done rooms Perfect location in a good non touristic neighborhood 
314762,Primero Primera,No Negative, The hotel is an easy metro ride from the centre and is located in a quiet residential neighbourhood so no night time noise There are interesting tourist sites nearby if a change of pace is needed from the crowds in the city centre We were in a spacious attic room with a superb bathroom with views to the Norman Foster communications tower and the Parc Tibidabo from the shower There was an outside seating area on the roof for the attic rooms as well as a small garden downstairs where meals can be taken We didn t use the pool area but it looked a great place to relax on warmer days The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellent We loved the comfy lounge with honesty bar where we made our own gin and tonics before heading out to eat Free coffee is available all day in the library computer room It is well worth being outside the city centre to stay at this quirky hotel
314763,Primero Primera, Its was not a problem and still easy to there but a little far From downtown , Great staff and awesome room clean place and very awesome vibe Staff was so helpfull 
314764,Primero Primera, Nothing, Our room was gorgeous and the property itself very elegant in a lovely part of Barcelona away from the noise and crowds Thoughtful touches everywhere including free soft drinks at the pool bar and in room A really great stay 
314765,Primero Primera, The location of the hotel was a little far from the main tourist sites , We had a large spacious room with a very comfortable bed Complimentary mini bar was a nice touch 
314766,Primero Primera, No fresh vegetables at breakfast expensive pet fee of 25 night , The hotel is great we stayed only for one night but we would have stayed more if we could The hotel staff were very professional and we had free access to any nonalcoholic beverages trough the hole day and complementary minibar as well It is a very chic and clean hotel It was a bit far from Barcelona center but we drove by car and it was no problem I definitely recommend it 
314767,Primero Primera, The pool was nice but very small There is enough terrace space to expand the pool so it is more of a feature and you can actually swim in it The food selection on the menu for dinner could be better we would have dined at the hotel more if this was the case , All the staff were wonderful and accommodating especially with our little one The breakfast was delicious We were very lucky to get an upgrade on arrival thank you The room was extremely well presented spacious and clean The free minibar and food and drink in the chill out room downstairs is a lovely addition 
314768,Primero Primera,No Negative, Delicious breakfast beautiful room friendly staff It was so comfortable staying here felt like a second home Will definitely be back for our next trip to Barcelona 
314769,Primero Primera, The breakfast can be improved by having more variety of food and warmly cooked food instead of having mostly bread , The staffs are very friendly and helpful The room is clean and comfy I enjoyed my stay very much Location is also nice very close to the metro station 5 min walk from the station 
314770,Primero Primera, Nothing comes in my mind , We had a very nice room with a balcony a huge bed and at all a perfect room The breakfast was to the point All you need for breakfast A very very comfortable room for breakfast to stay to drink wine and some good dinner snacks 
314771,Primero Primera, Nothing was wrong, We stayed for one week This hotel was a perfect match for us Transport and location the hotel is outside crowded tourist areas but within walking distance from 2 different metro train stations Sarria lines S1 S2 metro L6 and Les Tres Torres L6 There is also a stop of the trourist hop on hop off bus nearby The surrounding area is quiet especially quiet at night comfortable and green Nice to walk around in the evening The area around Sarria station is very nice with low rise buildings There are several restaurants cafes in the walking distance from the hotel and a hair studio just opposite the hotel I did not visit the salon but after all it is nice to have the opportunity Interriors The hotel has charming interriors reception area lobby bar area decorated with good sense of style Our room was spacious and had everything needed Wooden furniture particular items appear vintage which is appealing to me nothing like plastic ikea style items The beds were comfortable No complains as to the sound proofing in the room no noise from the outside or from the corridor Wi fi internet connection was stable and reliable The hotel staff were very helpful 
314772,Primero Primera, Nothing The place was just perfect , Great location very clean rooms excellent food and friendly staff They all speak English provide free breakfast and a very cozy atmosphere 
314773,Primero Primera, There wasn t much not to like though the immediate environment was very quiet and a little lacking in good restaurants and bars Easy to jump on the Metro though and very quick to get to the centre of town or to Sant Gervasi which we liked a lot try Blavis restaurant you ll need to book , The room 38 was lovely very generous in size and the bed super comfortable The location was nice and quiet which was great after time in the busy centre The breakfast room was well laid out very relaxing as the whole hotel and the breakfast itself all you could want 
314774,Primero Primera, Although zona alta is a perfect place for us to be in Barcelona because we have been there many times pay atention to location if you come for the first time ,No Positive
