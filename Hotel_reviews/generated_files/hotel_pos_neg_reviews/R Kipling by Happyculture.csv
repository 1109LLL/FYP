229137,R Kipling by Happyculture,No Negative, The superior room was very specious and of a high standard and the location is perfect only a few minutes walk from the metro and the in the heart of Montmartre Overall we had a great experience and wouldn t hesitate staying here again again 
229138,R Kipling by Happyculture, Room size for the price i paid there was barely room to swing a cat and for price i paid i felt like i paid way more than was worth and that was not even including breakfast And i wouldn t say i disliked this particular part of my stay but no shower curtain i felt bad every morning when showering and the water spilling onto the floor could cause an accident and a claim from someone who is out to make a penny , I loved my stay Umbrella s available to use by the day with no charge Free water tea and coffee in the morning Portable wifi and for 3 euro a day was a steal and ingenious idea Afternoon tea and Wine reception at lunch and evening times complimentary of the hotel The honesty bar great touch really liked that and the staff very polite and helpful 
229139,R Kipling by Happyculture, The price is a bit steep but worth it , I was greeted by positive staff who clearly explained the hotels proceedures The bed room was fabulous the bed was extremely comfortable I can we why check out is so late The complimentary glass of champagne for opting out of room service is GENIUS 
229140,R Kipling by Happyculture, The gentleman who checked us in was initially friendly but didn t seem happy when we requested a room on a different higher floor After initially stating that they were full and unable to accommodate us we were eventually moved to a more suitable room after pressing the point Our room was very small especially for a deluxe the floor was dusty didn t seem cleaned there was a half eaten packet of biscuits in the bedside table drawer the bathroom was very small and the bath didn t have a shower curtain so everything ended up soaking wet after a shower , Great location 
229141,R Kipling by Happyculture, Noticing the loose light fitting and lack of refreshment facilities in our room before we did , The bed was very comfy and the issue we had inner first room was resolved very quickly Breakfast was brilliant plenty to choose from and quickly replenished The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble 
229142,R Kipling by Happyculture, The electrics were a little unpredictable something put to charge didn t charge change to another socket and success Use the same working socket later on and it wouldn t work but a different socket would Odd , The friendliness of the staff the inclusion of wine tasting and snacks in the evening brought guests together The room was spacious stylish and well equipped with rooftop views Would enjoy staying here again 
229143,R Kipling by Happyculture, I booked a premium room or something like that one up from the standard Nice large bed but so large that the was hardly space to stand in the otherwise somewhat small room Oh and the Shower curtain was missing which made showering a bit of a mess , Lovely style and comfort Super nice hotel staff Very much enjoyed the complimentary wine tasting and afternoon tea My 4th stay here and I will return again 
229144,R Kipling by Happyculture, not sure room was a superior room which was booked as it was very small and no shower screen so bathroom got soaked, free wine in evenings and afternoon tea
229145,R Kipling by Happyculture, Rooms were very small and dark but this is typical of hotels in Paris , Great location very friendly staff especially the girl helping during breakfast A beautiful boutique hotel where we were made feel at home all the time We really enjoyed the complimentary wine tasting every evening and the individual decor of this special hotel 
229146,R Kipling by Happyculture, If you got to the wine tasting after 6 45 there was only rose wine left and no food The first night was great salami and cheese nibbles but the second and third there was no food and only one bottle of rose neither of us like rose Another guest asked for a red or a white and the receptionist said all they had was rose , Spent four nights over the Christmas period and loved our stay Staff friendly and helpful Room was small but we weren t in it for long as we were out sightseeing Bed comfy and bathroom a good size Didn t try breakfast Only five minutes walk from Blanche tube station and Moulin Rouge Wine tasting in the evening was nice and we met a lot of different people from around the globe 
229147,R Kipling by Happyculture, Could have had a kettle in the room for making tea coffee, The hotel staff were always polite helpful it was close to the moulin rouge on a good bus route with the nearest metro a couple minute walk away 
229148,R Kipling by Happyculture, Room was a bit small Nice but small , The staff is very friendly and helpful Sonya speaks Spanish which was an added bonus The afternoon tastings were nice Breakfast which was included in our rate was excellent Lobby area is cozy and interesting Located near but Blanche Moulin Rouge but not right on the main drag Close to Metro and several bus lines pocket wifi was amazing 
229149,R Kipling by Happyculture, Wifi was fairly dismal , Tastefully decorated boutique style hotel Super friendly staff Appreciated the complimentary wine tasting happy hour And the welcome back to a regular guest 
229150,R Kipling by Happyculture, Wi fi didn t work However staff including night staff had a back up plan in place Breakfast wasn t so inspiring Some more healthy option such as Avocado smoothies etc , Room was v small but comfortable clean and stylish Staff were friendly efficient young females Af rican and Asian background rare to see and a pleasant surprise Added extras incl daily wine tasting and tea 
229151,R Kipling by Happyculture,No Negative, A great team who really made our experience extra special They went over and above the call of duty to take care of us to make us feel welcome My friend had an awful cough the team discreetly brought over some honey in case she d like some warm tea for her throat it really helped What a lovely thing to think of made such a difference Nothing was a problem and Jessica really stood out to us during our stay Thank you for everything 
229152,R Kipling by Happyculture, It can get a bit warm in summer The room would benefit from a fan although there was aircon , My room was nicely decorated small but comfortable The lication is great just down the road from the Moulin Rouge Good for a weekend break when you ll be out exploring and using the room as a base
229153,R Kipling by Happyculture, The hallways and our room smelt really badly of cigarette smoke Huge turn off for non smokers, The bed and pillows were amazing Staff very friendly and helpful 
229154,R Kipling by Happyculture, The double bed was two beds pushed together More fruit available at breakfast, Great staff big room on the 6th floor Free wine and nibbles in the evening
229155,R Kipling by Happyculture,No Negative, On arrival our air con was not working so they upgraded us to a larger room immediately at no cost The bed was very comfortable and what room is not made better with a free Nespresso machine 
229156,R Kipling by Happyculture, our particular room was not very quiet it faced towards a main road , The staff were very friendly and helpful I particularly liked that all the hotels in the same chain happy culture offer a happy hour deal between 6pm and 8pm the R Kipling offers wine tasting but we were allowed to benefit from any of the other hotel s happy hour specials during our stay at the R Kipling This was a nice treat and the lounge areas in the hotels we did manage to visit during this time were very comfortable and well decorated 
229157,R Kipling by Happyculture, The fire alarm went off on our first night in the early of the morning It rang and rang but there was no information from any hotel staff about its cause or if it was a false alarm Eventually the alarm stopped and we guests returned to our beds without any instruction to do so by any night staff there was no such person in evidence good The bedroom floor was very dusty and had not been properly vacuumed , Very friendly helpful staff 
229158,R Kipling by Happyculture, We got taxi from Gare du Nord to the hotel and it cost 9 euros so told receptionist to book taxi to station It cost 25 euros and the driver told us that the receptionist should have told us which she didn t Felt conned and spoilt what was a lovely 4 day break in Paris, Location
229159,R Kipling by Happyculture, The rooms are so very very small I don t expect just 2 small pillows for on a double bed at over 100 euros per night I asked for extra and received none Shower water goes everywhere in room 502 You cannot open the bathroom door fully either due to the room size , Location is good 3 stops from De Nord Cleanliness good They gave me extra hour on check out for free Overall not a bad hotel for Paris standards I d stay here again Remember you ll never get a big spacious clean room for 100eur per night in Paris but this is the next best thing 
229160,R Kipling by Happyculture, If you are claustrophobic do not stay in this hotel Room no 504 is JUST big enough for a queen sized bed Had to pay extra to upgrade to a suite and only then did I get a normal my elbows could touch the celing room for the price of a suite Terrible entrance lobby for a 4 star hotel Breakfast in a dungeon of a basement had to ask for stuff in a buffet Pay extra look for a better location I m not so pedantic normally but damn , From night staff to the manager probably the best team of staff I have ever come across
229161,R Kipling by Happyculture, Poor WIFI signal, Great hotel with plenty to offer nicely furnished many amenities buffet breakfast available free water bottles wine tasting in the evenings and even tickets for Seina river cruise 
229162,R Kipling by Happyculture, Breakfast was not so good rooms are very small and coffee maker in room didn t work or to complicated , The bed was fine and bathroom nice Perfectly located 
229163,R Kipling by Happyculture, I have never ever had such a small room for such a high price The cupboards could not even be opened because of the bed and the fridge wasn t working Also no one mentioned the red light district was around the corner that was an unpleasant surprise , Staf was great interior design is awesome 
229164,R Kipling by Happyculture, It s not worth to book a super double room and spend an extra money amount on a hope to have a bigger room ROOMS ARE SUPER SMALL , Staff was hjepful 
229165,R Kipling by Happyculture, the gentlemen on reception on the morning that I checked out was not very knowledgeable on where I could pick up breakfast on my way to the office but redeemed himself by offering me some mini pastries from reception , it was my first stay in a hotel in France and the young lady on reception on my first afternoon went above and beyond the call of duty when the wifi was down and also on recommending lunch places when my room was not ready when I arrived 
229166,R Kipling by Happyculture, Rooms are small but well designed Some street noise a trade off for the location No mini bar in room I use it as a fridge sometimes so slightly annoying it wasn t there Wifi very slow cannot use for video streams , Free wine tasting from 6 8pm Great location Well furnished Ample free water bottles available in reception 
229167,R Kipling by Happyculture, The room was small , The hotel design is done in good taste The location is nice and close to a metro station I really loved how everything was set up We arrived earlier than expected and we had no issue checking in

229172,R Kipling by Happyculture, The breakfast room was in the basement and as I am handicapped I could not get to it lots of steep stairs Towels were few and poor , Large balcony with three chairs and a table 
229173,R Kipling by Happyculture, More space in the bedroom No room to have two suitcases and MORE lighting it was so dark and depressing , Breakfast was good seating very tight Comfy bed and good showerthough we had to wait two days to get the light in the bathroom fixed 
229174,R Kipling by Happyculture, Some of the items in room in need of repair Curtain hooks fall off when pulled and bedside cupboard door also fell off Vanity light in bathroom not working and handle inside bathroom broken Minor issues overall as quality of the room generally very pleasant , Beautifully decorated Friendly helpful staff
229175,R Kipling by Happyculture, As soon as I walked in the room the first thing I did was check the bed There was a big stain on the sheets which I didn t understand because surely it would have been see by the cleaner so why lay the bed with those sheets Anyway I call reception and they changed it straightaway very efficient The room was disturbingly small and the lighting was slightly dingy very difficult to do your MakeUp in , The staff were polite and helpful felt very welcome 
229176,R Kipling by Happyculture, It was a little bit noisy during the night , The hotel more than lived up to my expectations The rooms were well appointed and very comfortable indeed The location was very handy for the metro an close to Monmartre
