182575,Claridge s, Room temperature is a bit too warm but still in acceptable range Tried to set the thermostat to the coolest but not getting better Informed the staff but it was not better May be it just happen to my room only , Service is impeccable very attentive and accommodating to all requests Room is very clean and lobby is extravagance 
182576,Claridge s, reception IT system slow or failing on the day of our stay Been like it for days apparently Not what you expe4ct from Claridges, High service delivery from all staff
182577,Claridge s,No Negative, Opulent luxury all round the bathroom extra opulent Most of all was the staff they were above and beyond we were made to feel like ROYALTY nothing was a problem even help for old tech no phobics like me
182578,Claridge s,No Negative, Amazing experience lovely staff the bars with a great atmosphere beautiful flowers fab room with wonderful bathroom Breakfast in our room was a great treat 
182579,Claridge s, We were given a price for hotel car hire and it was shown on the bill as substantially higher The issue was resolved before we left the hotel , The hotel decor is fabulous the service was fantastic the beds very comfortable and the shower was the best I ve ever been in Extra touches like complimentary drinks while we waited for the room and celebratory cake we won a major business award during our stay made it very special 
182580,Claridge s, This hotel sets the standard by which all other hotels should be measured , Some hotels are just nice places where you sleep This is like staying in the incredible residence palace of your dearest friends who simply want you to have everything your heart desires 
182581,Claridge s, Too many people in the lobby that are not hotel guests resulting in limited lounging areas for those staying in the hotel When you cannot find where to lounge in the lobby you are then restricted to your room or must leave to another venue near by Breakfast could go up a notch give the specific venue The hotel could use touch ups in halls and rooms given its age Even though is Claridges, The dining experience especially for dinner was great 
182582,Claridge s, Quality of accommodation was poor in view of how expensive the hotel is the room was worn down a lot we had problems with the toilet during the entire stay despite asking hotel staff to fix it the cheap alarm clock in the room was still set on winter time light switch in room lobby was broken so the light kept switching on automatically during the night Also staff at breakfast seemed to pay more attention to either larger groups or regular guests and made mistakes as a result eg not bringing one of us the meal we orderered or bringing totally burnt bread , Great location friendly staff signature champagne bar 
182583,Claridge s,No Negative, This is one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in its expensive but worth the cost The staff is unbelievably good and the rooms are wonderful 
182584,Claridge s, nothing really its just an very expensive hotel , The staff take extra time to get to know their guests for example I m a Muslim so they are aware that I don t eat pork When ordering from room service the lady informed me that the dish i wanted to order had traces of pork in it Also there is a stand at the reception area for theater tickets 
182585,Claridge s, Difficult water adjustment system in the shower, I love the overall atmosphere at the hotel The elevators are special which makes every trip up to the room special My room was quite specious cozy decorated with false fireplace and the bed was indulging And of corse the location is unbeatable I would say the best one can get 
182586,Claridge s, lighting the room could do with some LED bulbs as these are brighter and as a bonus are also more energy efficient , the reception was very friendly and put me at ease straight away 
182587,Claridge s,No Negative, Pristine classical English eligence the attention to detail wth the old world charm was a delight if you don t appreciate old world gentility and chivalry please don t stay here and ruin it for the rest of us Special place 
182588,Claridge s,No Negative, There is always something to complain about at any hotel or service establishment but why would you If you are staying at Claridges you are a lucky guy Or gal Enjoy 
182589,Claridge s, No booking found when we arrived Hotel said you never sent across Wait half and hour for kettle to be delivered Hotel put card through door saying sorry happy Birthday enjoy cake and champagne but they never arrived for over an hour, Wife was happy with birthday
182590,Claridge s,No Negative, The heating system failed the first day we arrived and when we complained they upgraded us to a bigger room Mayfair Suit and didnt charge us the difference I thought that was very very KIND 
182591,Claridge s, The cost of Beluga Vodka , staff were so helpful efficient room was very nice all round a great stay at a atmospheric hotel can t wait to go back
182592,Claridge s, We usually stay this time of year and there s a wow factor to the decorations disappointed this time , Attention to detail Excellent staff at all levels 
182593,Claridge s, Small item lack of tea coffee in room , The Staff from the moment we got out of our car bar food and service Deco room One felt as if you were with old friends or was a bit actor in a very special movie 
182594,Claridge s, Having to leave , The most incredible wedding anniversary treat This is the most incredible hotel my wife and I have ever stayed at and probably will ever stay at The staff are beyond fantastic the comfort is out of this world the service is impeccable The decor is absolutely stunning The restaurant Fera is absolutely fantastic Couldn t have asked for any more truly lives up to its superb name We really hope we will have the opportunity to visit again 
182595,Claridge s, The bars were small it was a hassle getting a table the music was very loud and the service slow , The room was beautiful bed very comfortable the Art Deco detail was lovely as we re all the flowers through the public areas 
182596,Claridge s, My wife was a little disappointed with her English Breakfast and felt it wasn t properly cooked, Apart from everything else what made it special for us was the wonderful service efficient paying attention to every detail but friendly and creating a welcoming atmosphere The bonus was a complementary bottle of champagne because it was our Ruby Wedding Anniversary 
182597,Claridge s,No Negative, They got us into our room at 6 30 AM This was a wonderful and unexpected bit of courtesy check in time is officially 3PM especially considering that we had just landed after an overnight flight from South Africa 
182598,Claridge s, The drab dark and unattractive bedroom was too small for two small suitcases lacked electrical points and lighting and had an awkward and equally pokey bathroom to match the room no charm at all Never again , Excellent breakfast Friendly and helpful reception and concierge Attractive reception areas 
182599,Claridge s, There was nothing we could improve it was all excellent and every member of staff was a credit to the establishment , The whole experience was excellent We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and everybody at Claridges made it a very special occasion I cannot thank the staff enough for making our stay very special we were given an upgrade to the Mayfair suite and they never forgot our names or the occasion Thank you so much Claridges We have been all over the world in some fantastic places but the best hotel in the world was on our doorstep all the time 
182600,Claridge s, For the price of the room you might have thought the beds would be at least queen size but it was a normal double , The staff and the service were great It is a beautiful hotel and it really feels like a luxury break to stay there even if only for one night It was also very quiet We enjoyed drinks in the fumoir bar 
182601,Claridge s, Bathrooms are run down Leaks from showers etc Service attendance in lobby should be improved No one today has to wait 30 mn to receive breakfast order Need real improvment Bathrooms need revamping Too many leaks Confort is damaged rooms lighting is terrible Not enough light from existing lamps and very old sysstemto put them on I had room 226 Have to go to each lamp to put it on No accessible outlets for Devices used today, I like coming back to a familiar place and familiar ambiance You keep well the traditional look Helpful concierge and good receptiin people is much appreciated
182602,Claridge s, Despite their high prices they could not afford to put tableclothes on the restaurant table Seriously how can they claim to be traditional when you have to eat off polished wooden tables I know they are American owned but surely we don t have to behave like American savages do we One of the greatest British lunch experiences is an immaculate white starched tablecloth properly set with really good food one compliments the other ,No Positive
182603,Claridge s, Room service and concierge are horrible Concierge desk has poor communications with clients once i had no restaurant to go on the weekend because of their carelessness ,No Positive
182604,Claridge s,No Negative, The whole hotel was exceptionally clean the staff incredibly friendly and the bars and restaurant superb Breakfast in the foyer was a real treat Finally the shower in the en suite was the most powerful rainfall shower that I ve experienced just the thing to wake you up properly in the morning 
182605,Claridge s, Nothing the fact we had to leave , We do like tea coffee facilities which we didn t find in the room It did not cloud what was an amazing experience We may not have looked properly though 
182606,Claridge s,No Negative, This is a quality hotel offering superior quality services and facilities The staff were tremendous and nothing we asked was to much trouble We will definitely stay again in the not to distant future 
182607,Claridge s, having to check out as wanted to stay , A sense of pride to stay in such a fabulous Hotel the d cor was great the staff even better made us feel like we had been long time guest even though it was are first time staying here All I can say is Fantastic 
182608,Claridge s,No Negative, We absolutely enjoyed our stay The staff facilities and location were are of the highest quality and we were made to feel extremely welcome and special Truly we will remember this very special occasion for some time to come We extend our heartfelt thanks to the Manager and his staff and hope that you all have a very profitable year 
182609,Claridge s, There were few porters in front of the hotel but when we arrived no one asked us about helping I m pregnant and was using a crutch so it could be very nice if one of them ask us to help because it was very hard to hold my 1 year old daughter with one large suitcase and push chair with a crutch When we went to inside the hotel finally one of porter asked us for bringing our luggage and push chair to our room So we were not happy with the first service from Claridge s Also my daughter can walk so she could fall off from the baby cot and I feel the hotel isn t baby friendly enough I shouldn t compare with other hotel but Hotel Bristol five stared hotel in Paris had amazing service and was very family friendly so I expected similar service from Claridge s , Staffs were friendly and we enjoyed food very much dinner at Fera and breakfast in our room Also amanitas were very nice as organic british items Also there are some organic breakfast as well 
182610,Claridge s, Our superior queen room was nothing more than a basic double Wasn t impressed with having 5 service added to the bill surely basic service should be included in the room cost or tips you leave , The main areas such as reception bar restaurant was the height of luxury All the staff from the doorman to the waiters were almost over the top with their friendliness 
182611,Claridge s, A minor criticism no Guinness but the champagne more than made up for it , This was a trip for my 50th birthday and every aspect of it was sensational from start to finish the staff are sublime in their service levels and a credit to the hotel the pride they take in their work is tangible The hotel is beautifully maintained and smells divine Well done this establishment sets the highest standard 
182612,Claridge s, Only one sentence I hate this sort of review and only because we had a lovely time I answered your questions but let it be the last time , the comfortable way the day passes I did not have to sign any bill just mention our room number 
182613,Claridge s, The rooms and some facilities are worn down and for the price its not worth it compeard to other hotels in the area , Very nice service and staff nice overall atmosphere 
182614,Claridge s, Very disappointed with the overall room Being older I normally book by phone but in this instance booked onlne Whenever I stay in london I always get an upgrade I wasn t offered this facility Comparing to other hotels I don t think the room was good enough and felt very disappointed as said previously There was a strange smell of onions which wafted into the room around 7 am which woke us up Not pleasant Absolutely no view , Loved the location Staff are brilliant Lovely reception rooms bars communal areas
182615,Claridge s, Nothing , The staff were excellent as usual We were upgraded without requesting to be and the hotel seems to have reached new highs in customer service All guests and visitors are treated as they are the most important guests in the hotel 
182616,Claridge s, The service for breakfast was very slow After I sat down in the next 10 minutes nobody came to ask me something , Cleaning and food was excellent 
182617,Claridge s, Breakfast and bar drinks were over priced for what we wanted I e egg and soldiers, Fantastic service from first min to last staff excellent through out
182618,Claridge s, Due to the flooding of my bathroom from the floor above I felt that a free tray of tea sandwiches biscuits and a glass of champagne were not enough recompense for this incident though they did offer to move me to another room when I paid the account I noted that they had waived a 5 discretionary service charge which amounted to 30 I have written to them to say that as the staff were all courteous and helpful I felt that the staff discretionary service charge should be reimbursed and that Claridges should have recompensed me in another way Vivienne Plummer Mrs ,No Positive
182619,Claridge s, Didn t like it when our case s were not collected from our room and our driver was turned away by a traffic warden because our case s went down to late One of your managers happened to be passing along the corridor and was kind enough to help us We were late for our next destination , we liked everything
182620,Claridge s, Not much space or surface for guests toiletries in the bathroom Bathroom is small Many things in the room can be refreshed without harming the historic feel On Saturday morning at breakfast guests were a patchy crowd some wearing sports suits some dressed up it s not hotel s fault just an observation , Excellent location attentive friendly staff breakfast setting and food was nice Claridge s carries a lot of charm and character I liked that there is one more door between entrance and bedroom it makes room very quiet Comfortable bed 
182621,Claridge s, The room wasn t ready at till 16 15 even though the reservation was from 15 00 , Style and finish of the room as well as the friendly and helpful staff 
182622,Claridge s, The actual room was quite basic and small the bathroom was dated However it was very clean , The staff are lovely as is the main reception area The service is good nothing is too much trouble Location is perfect 
182623,Claridge s, I have never found the concierge helpful at all , I love Claridges it is a really sincere 5 experience unlike other hotels who are just ticking the boxes If you do nothing else treat yourself to their breakfast amazing The term The customer is king seems second nature in Claridges they are just short of calling you your majesty and they are only too happy to treat you like a queen Not an insincere smile in the place really love it 
182624,Claridge s, 1 we stayed for five nights and had to change room twice At the beginning we were arranged to a room facing the courtyard with this very noisy ventilation machine So we didn t sleep well for the first night After I complained the next day we were then arrange to a room facing the street and on the top floor BUT the cold water system didn t work properly and we couldn t really use the hot water since that would be boiling the next day without using any water for one night they got it fixed BUT on that night there was this weird noise coming from the roof it was so loud that we could feel the vibration So we didn t have a good night sleep for the third night And finally since i complained at the beginning they didn t take it seriously they upgraded us to a suite we finally had two good nights sleep But the whole experience was so tiring and unsettled I can understand that such an old and famous hotel is hard to maintain but thought they had an expensive renovation not long ago 2 The women in the first floor restroom was so ridiculously rude i have never experienced anything like that definitely didn t expect that would happen in Claridge s , the location 
182625,Claridge s, The service was better than ever the only thing is Claridge s is not cheap even for the least inexpensive room to stay at , Ideal central location in the heart of central London You can walk to Oxford St shopping Bond St shopping fine dinning walk to Regent St shopping dinning as well as Piccadilly area 
182626,Claridge s,No Negative, A truly excellent experience We were upgraded on arrival which was a lovely surprise Every member of staff was friendly courteous and helpful The room was fabulous Fera is a great restaurant
182627,Claridge s, I like her the staff, It was my 50th birthday and although the staff were charming and gave me a bite sized cake I have never seen such poor rooms We moved twice and I may as well have been in St Mary s hospital Paddington Really really poor decor in need of a desperate overall for 600 a night it s unacceptable
182628,Claridge s, 1 The bathtub and sink drain did not function Both were clogged The first engineer fixed the sink but not the tub The second and third engineer still did not repair the drain in tub Very unhealthy unpleasant showering and bathing experience Never had any experience this bad 2 My husband requested two apples in the evening before retiring on two occasions We had drinks in the hotel bar and ate dinner at the hotel restaurant every night and were surprised at the approx 30 British Pounds charged to us for the apples No cart just apples and a knife it was billed as room service of sliced apples Outrageous when you consider the price of rooms and dining , Location friendliness and courtesy of staff We were a couple not a group of friends 
182629,Claridge s, Nothing, The hotel was first class The staff were exceptional Nothing was too much trouble for any member of staff The facilities were a joy to behold All the staff I came into contact with are a credit to your organisation I have stayed in numerous hotels But none as good as clarifdges Our stay was to celebrate my wife s 65th birthday It couldn t have been done in more pleasant surroundings She wants to go paging and hopefully we will be there in February to celebrate my birthday Congratulations to all at clarifdges
182630,Claridge s, Absolutely nothing to fault with one exception a room breakfast menu completed for a previous occupant left within one of the drawers which I threw away As this was the only fault a small one at that I couldn t mark the place down from Excellent , The location of Claridge s is perfect for shoppers and high end seclusion alike From the friendly and professional staff who front the operation Concierge and Reception to those who served every whim I could imagine all were faultless in their one aim which was to ensure your stay was memorable for all of the right reasons Our recently redecorated room was beautiful and airy having Art Deco themes running throughout a classy affair The welcome plate of handmade chocolate treats for our Wedding Anniversary was a welcome addition the attention to detail that keeps establishments like Claridge s at the top of their game We chose to eat breakfast in the Restaurant the following morning and were not disappointed all of the staff made it seamless with delivery of quality food drink All in all Magic 
182631,Claridge s, Whenever we travel the first place I look at is Booking com and we nearly always book through this site Because of that I feel it only poignant to say a few home truths re this hotel Our room was very average with a hotchpotch of old furniture We were right above the bar and entrance so incredibly noisy There was blood on the sheets where the maid had had a cut finger we assume But all complaint taken very seriously and dealt with well We will go back again as long as we are not put in room 57 , Magnificent Hotel the most beautiful d cor and facilities Staff and service second to none Our comments when checking out were taken very seriously and we received an email from the manager the following day with apologies for the room being so disappointing Breakfast was delicious and service in the bar the night before impeccable 
182632,Claridge s,No Negative, Can t fault it we never stay anywhere else when we re in London they ve got the mix of respectful and yet friendly just right we feel relaxed as soon as we arrive Love it 
182633,Claridge s, Some of the fittings are quite old and did not work properly in the room, Great location and staff is very pleasant The customer services was very good but not at the level I have experienced at hotels in the same class 
182634,Claridge s, Nothing Or just the water tap is not practical If it can be changed it would be great for next time , Everything is just perfect Staff is amazing restaurant is fantastic the overall atmosphere is unbeatable Just the best hotel you can imagine
