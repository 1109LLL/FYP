279658,Sansi Pedralbes, Breakfast price was too high for what was being offered elsewhere nearby , Extremely clean and the staff were the most helpful group I have ever come across 
279659,Sansi Pedralbes, The location is a little far but after settling in for a couple of days and knowing the public transport routes It s very quick and easy to get around takes around 15 mins by bus to get to city centre and the stop is right outside the hotel, Nice spacious room and lovely bathroom facilities Maintained well Hotel gardens are also very pretty The staff are super helpful even at 1am when we wanted to order a takeaway she went out of her way to help us find somewhere open and that could deliver to the hotel 
279660,Sansi Pedralbes, It is not a big issue but If I have to find negative feedback in my memory I would notice there was no lactose free milk however we asked it via e mail before our arrival, At our arrival three beautiful girl waited for us We walked a lot so they asked us whether we are thirsty or not and they gave us to drink immediately This is normal at this hotel Nice design friendly staff clean room good boss Perfect colleague during night at the reception 
279661,Sansi Pedralbes, I enjoy hotel breakfasts and for 15 the breakfast that was offered seemed to be a bit of a poor option So that s the only real criticism so we just went out for breakfast , Met by fantastic staff as walking in very friendly and a credit to the establishment Spoke great English which was vital for a non Spanish speaker Room was great value for money and felt entirely comfortable and catered to 
279662,Sansi Pedralbes, Location is really bad While parking around was possible 20 EUR per night of parking feels excessive for a Hotel that almost requires to have a car Room was quite unpleasant as it was facing right in front of a catwalk for 100 EUR a night I would expect a little privacy without having to pull the blinds There is absolutely nothing around the hotel no shops bars or restaurants Be ready to walk 15 minutes to find some commerce shops or supermarket , Bed was very comfortable and everything was very clean Staff was helpful and smiling all the time WiFi was nice and fast 
279663,Sansi Pedralbes, The location its very far away from The main streets and city center also there isnt any super markets or gas station near the hotel, The staff were very welcoming and friendly and the hotel was very clean and silent
279664,Sansi Pedralbes, The copies of the passports and the creditcard are reused as printpeper Confidential information is accesseble for evrybody We got the copy of the passports and creditcard of a Fanch couple when we asked the resptionist to print the rout from the hotel to the citycentre for us , clean and comfortable rooms
279665,Sansi Pedralbes, There was nothing not to like everything was good , Staff were very co operative and very efficient Nothing was overlooked I would like to comment that Esther was extremely efficient and handled all my requests immediately
279666,Sansi Pedralbes, Breakfast we arrived within the last 30 minutes of the breakfast time but there wasn t much on offer We asked for the room to be cleaned while out but when we returned 4 hours later it still had not been cleaned , The location of the place is perfect The staff very professional Despite the things that we did not like we would recommend this hotel and would go back

279669,Sansi Pedralbes, Had issue with door stopper outside the bath in rm 303 Also a large bed was only able to use as single due to d way d bed was made separately The initial 2day Suite was not up to expected spec Though 114 was much proved but lacked any view In the location and for the price I we were disappointed , The staff were faultless 
279670,Sansi Pedralbes, Breakfast was a bit overpriced the shower was hard to operate , Proximity to the IESE university and close to the Diagonal business area Rooms are comfortable and reasonably priced 
279671,Sansi Pedralbes, No room service at dinner night especially with the hotel being a little bit far from restaurants but its understandable since it was August in Spain , Incredibly nice people managing the property fast wifi not common as it should be in Spain hotels 
279672,Sansi Pedralbes, The location of this hotel is far from the city centre of Barcelona and nothing around the hotel such as restaurants, Perfect extra spa of private session
279673,Sansi Pedralbes, We don t have anything bad to say about this hotel everything is good , Me and my family like the location because is only 5 minutes away from the barcelona stadium if you like soccer this is the best hotel in town 
279674,Sansi Pedralbes, Room was not ready at check in time and staff asked me to wait to 1 5hr After refusing they changed me double in a single 9m2 room so I could check in Forget my iPad later and had some misunderstandings retrieving it as staff insisted it was not found Even after using Apple device locator and threatening with an official police report it was found Don t think it was on purpose but staff could have been a bit more thorough in investigating the issue Wifi works very slow not what you expect in this type of hotel, Nice location in a spa resort Free parking on the road in front of the hotel
