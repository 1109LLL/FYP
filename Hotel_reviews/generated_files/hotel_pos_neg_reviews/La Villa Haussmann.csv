46975,La Villa Haussmann, Just a couple of things to note with our stay They mentioned that breakfast was served at 7am however much of the hot food wasn t out until gone 8am and we had to leave very early This isn t a bad thing but we felt that we missed out on more of the included breakfast I requested a bottle of wine to be left on our bedside during our stay but on our arrival it wasn t there again not a major thing but I think they just forgot , The pool is AMAZING The room and bed and balcony were all amazing The decor of the hotel is beautiful The facilities are excellent including the gym which we didn t unfortunately get time to use but lots of choice of things to do on the stay The staff were nice helpful and friendly throughout our stay Good location for venturing out to restaurants and of course the metro to see the rest of Paris
46976,La Villa Haussmann,No Negative, Really beautiful luxurious decor loved it Very quiet Nice air conditioning Breakfast was really nice everything high quality Staff very professional and friendly Definitely one of our nicest stays in Europe 
46977,La Villa Haussmann, I would have liked a more expansive menu but know that this is a relatively new young hotel Can appreciate that they want to focus on quality definitely doing that rather than quantity at this time , That there was no request too big or too small for the staff to tackle and with a smile From helping to arrange airport transportation to securing tickets to providing directions to service in the restaurant and caf this international team excelled in all areas Thank you Team La Villa Haussmann 
46978,La Villa Haussmann, They clean the room on very late afternoon, Great small hotel They have BOSE speaker so you can stream your own music Breakfest is great Poil is nice and hammam Lits of nice things you can find there
46979,La Villa Haussmann, The room meant for a couple was small and there was no space to open two suitcases , Nice location in one of the main Parisian shopping districts and 10 minutes walk from the champs Elysees and facilities gym and pool and the rooms are clean and nicely designed 
46980,La Villa Haussmann, Very tiny room toilet door is very noisy room 206 toilet is very close to the bed overrated it is very good hotel but doesn worth the money it charges Staff are at best just Ok , Clean renovated Design
46981,La Villa Haussmann, the room it s self was very small not enough room to even change I choose the room based on size I thought it was suppose to be a special weekend and our room was way smaller then it appeared in the photos I also wanted a bath tub and the way the bathtub was set up if was hard for me and my partner to get in I paid a lot of money for this room and we couldn t really move the pool was nice but the curtain hanging in there were very dirty and had a radish Brown stain on about half of them we really didn t want to touch the sides , The bed was amazing the spa was nice 
46982,La Villa Haussmann, We have booked a superior room extra 25eur per day to get a desk as we were had to work during our stay and we got only a small table and very few space to work The Management of the hotel recognized it and has refund us but the description of the room on the website as to be changed to avoid same issues for other people ,No Positive
46983,La Villa Haussmann, The hotel checked us into the wrong category room which was disappointing Davide did an outstanding job the next day to rectify Standard room has very small bathroom Deluxe is good Some of the other staff appeared to have egos that weren t backed up by their performance Pool is beautiful but in reality tiny , Very stylish hotel good area metro nearby walkable to Champs Elysee etc Warm welcome Davide is exceptionally capable chap very helpful and professional Pool area is luxurious endless pool is a great idea 
46984,La Villa Haussmann, Nothing really , Wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Paris short walk from Champ Elysees Beautifully appointed rooms that are chic and comfortable Excellent bar restaurant on site Wonderful friendly staff who are always there to help 
46985,La Villa Haussmann, The hotel wants to give an impression of luxury And while this might be a quite good hotel they try to overdo and fail at some basic things It took me almost 15 minutes to check out as there was only one person preparing the invoces There were actually only two people before me The invoice I got was wrong and I had to get it corrected via email Upon arrival they took a copy of my personal ID which AFAIK is illegal in most European countries The personnel tries to be nice but to me they seem to be disturbingly artificial in how they do it I came back at 18 30 and the room was not yet cleaned For half the price it might make sense but given how much they charged me I will definitely avoid this hotel next time I m in Paris , Modern and clean hotel 
46986,La Villa Haussmann,No Negative, very near from Miromesnil subway station reasonable price restaurants Most of all this hotel s employees are all kind nice Villa Haussmann was opened just 4months ago so all rooms facilities are very new I strongly recommend to all planning to travel Paris 
46987,La Villa Haussmann, While staff were friendly they got a few requirements incorrect Ex requested a large taxi as we had a lot of luggage and were given a small taxi that refused to take us to the airport Staff weren t willing to fix this issue until we pushed Ended up finding our own cab , Location was decent
46988,La Villa Haussmann, Basin in the bathroom is too small Not enough space to put your toiletries on , Beautifully decorated hotel with a lot of character Staff was really friendly and helpful 
46989,La Villa Haussmann, Nothing to mention here , Even it is on a noisy boulevard the windows are just perfect you do not hear anything from outside The small spa is very nice the rooms are big enough for a Paris hotel 
46990,La Villa Haussmann, Perhaps it would be better a large shower instead of a bathtub, The room was very quiet and comfortable the Spa was simply amazing Good breakfast and friendly staff A special thanks to Nicolas for his help and kindness 
46991,La Villa Haussmann, The breakfast could do with being topped up a little more frequently but the food was beautiful and a huge selection definitely something for everyone , Really couldn t have been a better stay the staff were so helpful the hotel being brand spanking new is spotlessly clean the pool was a huge treat and slept like a baby in the very comfortable beds The location was perfect and allowed us to walk everywhere all weekend taking only 10 minutes to be on the Champs Elysee or 25 to the Eiffel Tower or Louvre 
46992,La Villa Haussmann,No Negative, Very clean good location spa and pool very relaxing great decor throughout and the staff were amazing Very helpful and gave great recommendations of restaurants and places to go Had a lovely weekend at this hotel 
46993,La Villa Haussmann,No Negative, Lovely property great staff Especially William at the front desk I be staying here again for sure Unfortunately I only stayed a day but will be back again for sure 
46994,La Villa Haussmann, Perhaps add an air conditioning system to the gym It is very hot there next to the spa Perhaps add air refreshioners while the hotel still has that new smell of paint Perhaps more help for the clients on the fifth or sixth floor as long as your elevator doesn t work Like help with the luggage , Swimming pool sauna and gym
