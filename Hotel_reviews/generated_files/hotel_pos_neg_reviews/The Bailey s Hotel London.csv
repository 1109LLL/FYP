49577,The Bailey s Hotel London, Disappointed with booking com the room was 20 cheaper on another site Also despite stating that no money would be taken from my account to pay the hotel directly which I did on arrival However money was blocked as pending transaction held for one week which was very inconvenient as I was traveling overseas and in effect had paid twice as funds were not released for a week Hotel staff my bank tried to assist without success , Staff comfort cleanliness of room Great location 
49578,The Bailey s Hotel London, Fridge needed to chill food drinks there was a note that they don t work I thought this was strange The shower was very noisy not sure why , Loved the room very cozy clean
49579,The Bailey s Hotel London, Housekeeping did not do a good job Few times we had to ask them to refill our coffee and sugar a drawer keep falling off we told the reception about this already they fixed it but fell off again We stayed in a junior suite The room was smaller then our expectation but interior was nice My mom stayed in a regular deluxe room and it was very small but well sufficient , Hotel interior was nice location is near everything many place to eat and also near supermarkets Small rooms 
49580,The Bailey s Hotel London, The rooms are tiny and overstuffed with furniture There was only around 60cm of space on each side of the bed yet the room had a chest of drawers big bedside tables a desk chair etc in it The hotel has smoking rooms still and our non smoking room was on the same floor and across the hall from these Needless to say the smell was terrible , The location of this hotel is superb you are practically inside Gloucester Road tube station so ideal for dipping in out when doing meetings 
49581,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, The location is perfect for getting around The staff are all extremely nice and the restaurant attached serves beautiful food if you don t want to go out 
49582,The Bailey s Hotel London, When faced with a stressful and potentially dangerous situation the staff failed to offer appropriate support to their guests , Beautiful property in a wonderful location 
49583,The Bailey s Hotel London, Overpowering smell of cooking from kitchen directly below so unable to leave befroom window open Bed very hard , Beautiful building great location vrry clean 
49584,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, location for the hotel was amazing right outside Gloucester Road tube station walking distance to the high street and lots of great restaurants around 
49585,The Bailey s Hotel London, Breakfast was not very good friends eggs undercooked still like jelly bacon slices all stuck together in a lump and very unappetising Understaffed in the restaurant that and the standard of breakfast makes me hesitant about going back, Bed really comfortable
49586,The Bailey s Hotel London, The restaurant downstairs is a more than a little disorganized My first day there I was seated and no one ever came to wait on me After 10 minutes I had to ask for help Then no one really gave me a run down of how breakfast works The 2nd day I was there I got seated and again it took a long time to get someone to pay attention to me And then it was oh you can go up to the buffet any time you want But I also wanted to order from the menu I also watched the same thing happen to several other families couples that were seated My tip here to the managers train your staff to give a little introductory about how the breakfast setup works That s what they do at every other hotel I ve stayed at in Europe that serves breakfast , The quaint historic nature of the hotel makes it worth staying here It s also next door to the underground station so it s super convenient to hop on the rail and get wherever you re going Every corner near this hotel has a restaurant or retail location so there is a lot to do in the neighborhood And I felt very safe and comfortable I booked a single room which was very clean and nicely laid out but it was the size of a very small bedroom Smaller than 8x10 I believe I am a big guy so it was a little hard to get around with the bed and desk and chair and table on the wall I booked online so I didn t realize how small the room was Had I known how small I would have upgraded to a bigger room But after a day of travelling and arriving in my room with all my luggage I was just too tired to bother There was a doorman there with a red bowler hat that was a bit of a character and very helpful Someone greeted me at the door and took my bags to my room so I didn t have to worry about that 
49587,The Bailey s Hotel London, The wifi was not effective The bathroom was extremely small difficult to move around , The muffins served at breakfast were freshly baked good 
49588,The Bailey s Hotel London, only one of the three lifts were working at the time of my stay, Modern bathroom combined with traditional room directly across from the underground station pubs restaurants and an excellent supermarket 
49589,The Bailey s Hotel London, First night we realised that the coffee and tea making equipment was missing and the shampoos etc hadn t been topped up Bit frustrating but not a car smash and didn t spoil our break , It s a favourite hotel of ours If we come to London we always try to get in at the Baileys The location is great beautiful building and lovely staff 
49590,The Bailey s Hotel London, View from the room and the small bed up against the wall on one side , Friendly and helpful staff good facilities including a gym and nice restaurant attached to the hotel 
49591,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, Location is excellent Gloucester Road station is right across the street and because the tube station is small there is very little walking between the train and the hotel entrance The room size is better than we expected Forget the hotel breakfast which costs 20 pounds for there are quite a few cafe restaurants nearby to choose from 
49592,The Bailey s Hotel London, It was a warm few days when we visited but the air conditioning was either poor or off The television was hard to operate , The room was comfortable and very clean but was on the small side The bathroom was almost as big as the room and was very smart The building itself was very fine and with the tube right opposite it was vey well positioned
49593,The Bailey s Hotel London, Expensive breakfasts which we did not have as there are many alternatives close by , Very comfortable room if a little small But very clean and well furnished Lovely flowers everywhere

49595,The Bailey s Hotel London, Room 532 Upgrade was OK considering I spend several times a month there Room was extremely warm even though i had asked for Engineering assistance of which no response , Staff and Bar Area very nice and friendly 
49596,The Bailey s Hotel London, There was major confusion at check in Using the booking reference there was another name and address registered Reception staff seemed non plussed and we almost thought we didn t have a room We were allocated a room after a considerable delay but it was unclear whether this was the room we had booked Cooked breakfast food from buffet was good but not hot enough Coffee mediocre ,No Positive
49597,The Bailey s Hotel London, I have zero complaints it was all fabulous , Beautifully refurbished hotel Very friendly happy and helpful staff Quiet location but with some bars and restaurants nearby and the tube station across the road from the hotel Food excellent 
49598,The Bailey s Hotel London, Very hot but did try to find room where open window, Managed to open window on 5th floor V important Cockney Doorman excellent service vital when all other staff not English Restaurant food good but very noisy probably due to Chelsea flower show 
49599,The Bailey s Hotel London, The aircon s don t work and so the rooms are hot and stuffy I was in 2 separate rooms and neither aircon worked The doorman is running a racket with the black cabs and so coerces guests into using cabs It is a nice hotel but I don t think it is worth the price tag , Rooms were very clean and posh 
49600,The Bailey s Hotel London, Nothing, The Hotel was lovely great rooms and in a good location The staff were the best though everyone was engaging friendly and courteous and really lovely
49601,The Bailey s Hotel London, There was a little problem with the heat which wasn t completely solved but didn t pose a huge problem for me at the time because my stay was very short , Centrally located which I liked While the rooms were small they were very comfortable and clean The staff are also very friendly and responsive to the need of the customer 
49602,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, Location Right across from Gloucester Rd Tube Station Spacious hotel room and great bathroom outlay Very clean Friendly and helpful staff Waitrose Supermarket and Boots Pharmacist just beyond the Tube Station which can be a great convenience

49604,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, The hotel is right across from the train station which was super convenient Lovely boutique type hotel with comfortable nicely appointed rooms Staff was courteous and helpful Great neighborhood and close to much of what we wanted to see Great restaurants and shops just steps away 
49605,The Bailey s Hotel London, I found the pillows rather terrible and it would have been better to have a room where the double bed could be properly accessed from both sides , The Baileys Hotel is very well located literally outside the exit of Gloucester Rd tube station The room was of good quality but a little small with the double bed pushed up against a wall The breakfast buffet was excellent with great options and plenty of variety The hotel has a lovely ambience and definitely has some old world charm 
49606,The Bailey s Hotel London, Limited variety of breakfast food buffet , The location of the hotel was amazing center of the city next to underground station and opposite a range of famous restaurants and cafe s 
49607,The Bailey s Hotel London, Not value for money funny odours in the room corridors not free WiFi in the room 12 per hour charge for late checkout empty mini bar , Old charm Location staff
49608,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, The rooms are beautiful and the location is perfect The tube station is literally across the street and there are restaurants a 24 7 Tesco grocery a pharmacy Boots and Waitrose all within a 2 5 minute walking distance from the hotel The staff is also excellent Everyone from the doorman to the receptionist to the concierge goes out of their way to ensure that you are not only taken care of but also have a most enjoyable stay I will definitely be staying at The Bailey s Hotel when I come back to London 
49609,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, Staff were brilliant even made my partner a birthday cake and left it in our room Breakfast was out of this world bar was fantastic We were totally looked after from the moment we arrived until we sadly left 
49610,The Bailey s Hotel London, We checked in quite late at night and if I m being honest I was expecting a warmer welcome The staff seemed to be more concerned about payment rather than giving us details about the hotel or location When we got to our room we could hear the extractor fan was still running and as two quite tired people we were hoping to get a decent sleep for a few hours Unfortunately the noise continued and it was only after midnight that the noise stopped On my booking I specifically asked for a quiet room and was a bit surprised to have been given this We were on the fifth floor at the back of the hotel with views looking onto inner buildings Just before midnight I called reception to enquire if the extractor noise would continue throughout the night and despite trying three times to call nobody answered Luckily the noise soon stopped but it still made quite a restless night to begin with which was most unfortunate We had been travelling after a late journey and needed to be up the next morning so having a good sleep was a priority In terms of the room I was a little disappointed at there being an empty mini bar I expected there to be at least a few soft drinks available Also I struggled with getting light switches to work properly it was more of a process of elimination to get the main lights switched off and the bedside lights to work I found the bathroom and bath shower especially to be a bit small This didn t bother me much however my boyfriend who is over 6ft struggled to shower comfortably Finally I think there is a lack of communication from the hotel via Booking com I sent over a couple of queries and didn t receive a clear response to any which was a bit of a shame Overall I would say the hotel s strengths are the location helpful staff and classic charm The negatives lie with the old style building which I know can t be helped but I was disappointed after requesting a quiet room to end up in a rather noisy , The location was superb a 10 15 minute walk from the national history museum and amongst some handy shops and nice restaurants The staff in the morning as we handed back our key were really friendly and helpful especially the doorman We were able to leave our luggage as we weren t catching a train until later in the day which was great Room wise I imagine it was bigger than most classic double rooms in the area so having a little extra space even for one night was great The room and details were also lovely there was a nice selection of toiletries fluffy towels bottles of water biscuits and a good size TV 
49611,The Bailey s Hotel London, There is a noise coming from the kitchen from 7 am till 11pm and you can hear it from the rooms that have their windows inside the property Even though they ve put two ranges of double windows you silll hear it Tghe hotel was not fully booked so we could get another room with an overview on the street Much better However whatever the room you can t open the windows and hence not get any fresh air inside which is a pity ,No Positive
49612,The Bailey s Hotel London, Nothing it was perfect for us, So well situated in South Kensington across from Glouscester Station Very beautiful not touristy interesting part of town to stay I highly recommend 
49613,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, The hotel is beautiful and the location is excellent the Underground is just across the hotel doors and three different train lines run through it But what truly makes The Bailey s Hotel special is the unparalleled service of its friendly accommodating and professional staff They truly made my stay comfortable and special Would definitely stay here every time I m in London 
49614,The Bailey s Hotel London, Nothing , You will be hard pushed to find a better location in London The Baileys Hotel lives upon to its 4 rating and you are made to feel welcome from the moment you arrive The Classic room we had was a little smaller than we expected and had no armchair but was spotlessly clean and the facilities particularly a great shower were first class Breakfast was the best we have experienced in London with quality food well cooked and hot ALL of the staff were extremely helpful efficient and friendly 
49615,The Bailey s Hotel London, Shower head too close to wall Tub narrow, Location was just a few tube stops from the center of the city but in a quiet and quaint area which was exactly what I wanted

49620,The Bailey s Hotel London, hotel staff did not speak any english at check in asian speaking women no hotel staff to assist opening doors or with luggage We missed out on our prepaid breakfast 7 days worth because no certificate was giving out at check in so we didn t know about it until we checked out not instructions at check in at all Hotel would not credit back the cost for the breakfasts that we prepaid for , clean and comfortable property close to underground across the street Olives the restaurant was quite good 
49621,The Bailey s Hotel London, room 242 felt slightly dated bathroom up to date and perfect but carpet etc not as crisp and clean Housekeeping a little inconsistent Restocked shampoo but not conditioner I had 1 glass that I returned on room service tray and it didn t get replaced Biscuits a few days but not others All forgivable but noticed, The LOCATION can t be beat Kensington neighborhood was quiet yet close to everything The Gloucester tube stop was across the street from hotel with 3 tube lines that can take you anywhere in the city Also 2 stops from VICTORIA station that can take you to Gatwick airport express Paddington station for Heathrow express just another few stops away in the other direction Walking distance to Kensington gardens and natural history museum and Victoria And Albert museum plus the street had great restaurants 
49622,The Bailey s Hotel London, Front office manager The Chinese Lady is so rude and she is not respecting the guests She locked the door of my room and she didn t let me get in the room because she thought my credit card is not working But after a big argument she realised the problem was the hotel system not my card Respected hotels never locked doors She didn t apologised either Shame on you , Location

49624,The Bailey s Hotel London, The front desk staff was not friendly at ALL Booked a double room the room was too small even to fit a double bed The bed was pushed to the wall No lamp table nothing to place your alarm of any kind or socket to charge your mobile Basically was pushed to the cold wall and had to jump off the bed from the other side not convenient at all The airconditioning was terrible and noisy when I complained to the frontdesk he basically told me this is a machine and it is like that I had to call house keeping three times to service the room as when I returned to the room mid day it was untouched Although the sign was already on the door , The location
49625,The Bailey s Hotel London, Room was not as pictured on website Neither bedside had a cabinet Wardrobe space difficult for one let alone two We were staying 5 nights and must have been given the smallest room , Location is excellent Staff very attentive Very clean quite room
49626,The Bailey s Hotel London, Because the hotel was of such a high standard it was a little disappointing to find the rooms did not have baths or traditional radiators, This hotel is a very high standard The quality of room breakfast and general service is excellent and the location is perfectly located with a tube station opposite providing quick and easy access to central London and major attractions

49632,The Bailey s Hotel London, We stayed for three nights no could honestly say we found nothing that we didn t like about the hotel , The hotel is located right next to Gloucester Road tube station and situated in a really great area for bars restaurants shops coffee shops and only minutes walk away from South Kensington High Street and the museums The staff were all extremely friendly efficient and nothing seemed too much trouble The concierge doorman was very elegant in his tweeds and red bowler hat very chatty and knowledgeable about the area and London in general The hotel had complimentary newspapers water tea and coffee everyday in our room and they also stored our bags free of charge when we checked out as our flight wasn t until later in the day All in all the hotel was excellent value for money located in an absolutely great place and I would certainly stay again and recommend anyone planning on staying in London to give this hotel a try

49639,The Bailey s Hotel London, The only criticism was that the chair was too high to fit under the table for my wife to do her make up Which was a shame because the light and mirror where arranged absolutely perfect the the job , The most amazing shower in the world

49660,The Bailey s Hotel London, The TV reception was awful and when we complained we were told they are all like that Worse was that they made no offering or consideration to appease the problem We stayed 4 nights on full rate and so a little customer service to apologise for the problem and showing some form of refund or compensation would have gone a long way Instead we had to have an argument with them at check out For the sake of their lack of customer service on this issue we will boycott this hotel in the future , The bar was good Nice atmosphere in the day and lively at night The bar staff were also very friendly

49701,The Bailey s Hotel London, Hotel has only 2 highchairs for small children During the breakfast I had to hold my 1 year old baby on my lap as 2 chairs were both occupied There are a couple of dozens of tables and I believe 2 chairs for small children are just not enough size of family room at same price varies and it seems only some family rooms have bath tub , Location very convenient Next to Gloucester tube station supermarkets and restaurants just a minute away walking distance to royal albert hall and some museums Hotel bar and restaurant food good quality and staffs generally very kind Parking is available 40 pounds a day in the Gloucester hotel parking which is next door 
49702,The Bailey s Hotel London, Upon check in we were told our room wasn t ready but we could upgrade for 50 to an available room When we said we were happy to wait the room it turned out was ready seemed like a ploy to fill a more expensive room Also a memeber of staff I assume a cleaner walked into our room whilst me and my girlfriend were sat on our bed eating breakfast Clearly wasn t aware the room was occupied and was a little awkward , The hotel itself and location were faultless 
49703,The Bailey s Hotel London, Hard to fault this hotel We did find it strange that the bar closes at midnight The bar was absolutely packed when we were there but they still closed the it at 12 Didn t seem to make any sense both from the hotel s perspective financially or from the guest s perspective but apparently this is standard Not really a fault but that was about the only slight criticism we could think of , Stayed in a deluxe double The room and bathroom on the 5th floor was much bigger than we were expecting It was absolutely spotless and very tastefully decorated Mni bar was turned on but not stocked exactly how we like it Extremely quiet room All the staff were outstanding Room service was superb value Had both breakfast and lunch in the restaurant which were excellent The bar prices are incredibly reasonable Gloucester Road tube is seconds from the lobby Tesco s across the road

49779,The Bailey s Hotel London, The hotel claimed they had no record of our booking even though I had email confirmation very disappointing having just traveled for 24 hours from Sydney A change in shift saw a new duty manager and a room materialized Breakfast vouchers were also included to soften the initial blow Good recovery , Access to many of London s sight seeing highlights and the tube is literally across the road After we got over the initial disappointments we thoroughly enjoyed our stay Great atmosphere and generally very friendly staff 
49780,The Bailey s Hotel London, Our first room was very small full sized bed shoved up against the wall could only get out on one side not good for two people but fortunately it also had a broken room safe and room phone They were able to fix the room safe after about 15 minutes but the phone was going to require more work and checking the lines at that point I asked if we could switch rooms and we were put into a room that was slightly bigger allowing us each to have room to get in and out of the bed from either side All staff friendly and professional in resolving the issues Beware though Both my rooms were the same price level but were very different in terms of comfort , Really nice hotel in an EXCELLENT location in Kennsington Right across the street from a tube stop on the Piccadilly line direct from Heathrow to hotel no changing trains Across the street from a traditional pub and two blocks from a fantastic gastro pub serving wonderful homemade food Tons of restaurants and shops nearby Bar and restaurant in hotel too Staff at the hotel were accommodating and friendly especially the doormen 
49781,The Bailey s Hotel London, The Bailey s Lounge was not quite what we were expecting for an executive lounge It was clean and comfortable and there was a nice variety of snacks and drinks available but we had imagined it was more like the kind of executive lounge you might find at a Fairmont or Intercontinental hotel where it is staffed and you can have evening drinks and canap s but that was not our experience here , Sonny the Concierge went out of his way to assist us when we were waiting for our airport transfer which was running late His friendly and efficient manner was a credit to him as well as to the hotel The buffet breakfast is served in a beautiful restaurant and there is a good selection of foods Our room luxury double was very spacious clean and comfortable All of our interactions with hotel staff were very positive they went out of their way to be of assistance We would definitely consider staying at this hotel again in the future

49814,The Bailey s Hotel London, The originally provided Deluxe room was of a very low standard for the price Our stay was confortable but only at the expense of a significant upgrade Service was average staff were overworked and even with the upgrade the room was not cleaned properly bathroom products and tea coffee not fully replenished and sheets were not changed every day uncomfortable pillows , Location was the best thing 
49815,The Bailey s Hotel London, Everything was top notch except one and only one We didn t complain at the time because everything else was so good Why don t the staff know how to make English tea The tea was so weak I thought it was hot water Next time we come and we will definitely come again we hope you all know how to make proper English tea That is our only complaint everything else was great Thank you very much for making our one night in London a pleasant one in spite of the rain , The food was excellent and the service couldn t be faulted always with a smile and a willingness to listen Beds were comfortable too A very friendly hotel with a great location We will certainly book again

49823,The Bailey s Hotel London, First impressions weren t good we had to struggle up the stairs and open the front doors with all our suitcases no doorman After checking in we then had to go through many fire doors and back down stairs with the same cases The room was musty and warm as if it hadn t been used in a while It was quite noisy from traffic The AC vent was facing a wall so not very effective We booked a luxury double room to get a large bed which was king size width but not king size length my husbands feet still hung over the edge Only 1 could fit in the bathroom at any one time The bed was very firm but OK The couch for two of us to sit on was 1 metre wide Room service lost our order The breakfast was ample but seemed to be very dated and not very appealing The staff were unable to tell us what the juices were , Good location opposite Gloucester Station
49824,The Bailey s Hotel London, 1 person in the bar took order then served other people before getting ours As drinks didn t arrive after 20 mins we left Bathroom way too small had to straddle sink when sat on toilet and I m only 5ft 6 so very uncomfortable for my 6ft husband , The bed was really comfy and the room size excluding the bathroom was big enough Very good style and quality furnishings

49826,The Bailey s Hotel London, Concierge on duty completely blanked me as he watched me struggle through the door with a huge bag etc but he had enough time to shake the hands of other guests friends An air of snootiness perhaps I didnt much lik, Amazing location and very clean and comfortable room with little quirks so not like your usual sterile hotel room 
49827,The Bailey s Hotel London, Unfortunately the very helpful porter was not representative of the rest of the front of house hotel staff We found most of the staff to be from eastern Europe and they had little idea of how to provide service with a smile They often had limited english language skills and no idea of pleasant efficient service This was particularly clear in the breakfast room where tables were left messy and dirty long after patrons had finished Cutlery and crockery were often not readily available and staff were curt At the front desk you could be lucky and meet someone helpful and pleasant but equally you could meet someone very abrupt and rude The hotel also has a ridiculous policy of charging by the hour for wifi use Nobody does that any more , The location across the street from Gloster Road tube station was excellent The rooms were very comfortable if a little too warm and we couldn t adjust the room temperature There is a lovely staircase running through the building so you don t have to wait for the lifts in order to go up or down The porter on duty when we arrived was extremely helpful to us helping to get our bags out of our car and up the steps and into the lobby 
49828,The Bailey s Hotel London, The reception staff do not do their best to help you and for the 3 times I stayed there the staff did not speak nicely not professional at all The rooms are not all the same as the building is very old so do not expect all rooms and beds have the same size in the category you booked They gave me a bad view it was just facing a wall Breakfast is not special , Location The hotel has been renewed Rooms are new as well J Suite was nice

49833,The Bailey s Hotel London, no real problem although staff varied in how attentive they were, right opposite tube station and walk straight down to harrod s etc luxurious feeling
49834,The Bailey s Hotel London, A short guide to the facilities avaliable in the hotel a map of local restaurants etc might be useful to visitors Although we weren t personally charged for internet service there is normally a 10 per day room charge free in the lobby area and we did overheard several people complaining about it most hotels now include this as standard We didn t have breakfast in the hotel having just tea and a few slices of toast apparently wasn t possible although listed on the sample menu provided in the Room Service leaflet told in the restaurant by the waiter that we d have to take toast and jam from the buffet and would then be charged as though we d had the full English breakfast 2x 20 possibly a misunderstanding because of a slight language barrier but annoying , The room was surprisingly quiet for central London after an initial complaint about rattling air conditioning we were moved to another room on a higher floor the bed comfortable and the en suite was well laid out and of a decent size The staff were very polite and helpful and the manager kindly offered us glasses of champagne after discovering it was our wedding anniversary that weekend Would definitely consider staying here again when next in town

49910,The Bailey s Hotel London, Just about everything was a little off Very lumpy uncomfortable bed and lots of other little irritations that added up to a less than good stay particularly as I was there for ten days on business Had I not pre paid I probably would have moved Not enough hangers 7 and no extra to be had Very cheap iron with no steam feature so I couldn t get the wrinkles out of clothes Cheap hairdryer that kept overheating after just a minute Cleaners forgot to come one day despite my calling On the days they came they often forgot something so I took to leaving them notes not replacing towels or coffee etc Room service constantly got the order wrong and food was mediocre The lifts are old and tiny and just one was working the entire ten days I was there There are a lot of rooms so that was inconvenient Worst of all was the air con which emitted musty stale air , Location is great right by tube and plenty of shops around Rooms have been rehabbed and look nice The room was quiet Reception desk staff very nice

49916,The Bailey s Hotel London, Avoid this hotel if you want to enjoy London without being scammed and burgled Housekeeping is an utter rudeness entering our room without a knock on the door on our first afternoon and cleaning up our room the following day when we have clearly put a DO NOT DISTURB sign Booked online through the hotel s own booking site for our extended stay because we were offered a lowest price or otherwise 25 discount guarantee When we finally found out that booking com price was cheaper they refused to give us their guarantee Talked about this issue to the manager in charge but seemed there were near nothing they can do Unacceptable for an establishment of this calibre , Location is unbeatable The hotel is a stone throw away from Gloucester Road tube station with direct access to Heathrow to the west and Piccadilly to the east Harrods at Knightsbridge Hyde Park and Kensington are all within walking distance

49927,The Bailey s Hotel London, The rooms were extremely small 2 people and 2 suitcases are enough in order to stop moving inside The cleanness was terrible I had a mouth bleeding problem and they left the pillowcases 3 times in blood because their policy is to change them every 2 days Wifi free No way And all those amazing services for only 300 per night, Only the location

49930,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, We booked this very last minute on the afternoon of arrival so we got a great deal online with Booking com engineering works on the trains that weekend would have made our journey home impossible so we treated ourselves to an overnight stay in London after a party The room was nicely decorated recently so I believe and the bathroom was well equipped Nice to have a full sized bath with shower over Lovely big comfy bed The rate didn t include breakfast and I m sure it would have been delicious but it was bit expensive for us so we found a lovely little cafe around the corner in the morning instead Excellent location with the Tube cafes and restaurants all within a minute s walk We d definitely like to stay again

49935,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, Having lived in South Kensington in the 90s I was aware of the excellent location It is literally across the round from Gloucester Rd tube station and thus on the Piccadilly line direct from Heathrow alternative is the quicker but rather more expensive Heathrow Express to Paddington then underground on the District and Circle line The hotel has an impressive foyer Reception is friendly and efficient The hotel is decorated with period photos and decorations My bedroom looked out onto reasonably busy Gloucester Rd yet thanks to double glazing there was little street noise The room was was a nice size with attractive furnishing very clean functional with a good sized desk and two comfortable chairs The bathroom was excellent The room was serviced to a very high standard Laundry though expensive is quick and reliable I was given free wifi which worked well I was not disturbed by internal noise I ate breakfast at local cafes and once in the hotel which was a standard cooked buffet with sufficient choices There are plenty of places to eat locally cafes restaurants and two pubs with a larger and better choice 10 minutes walk away on Old Brompton Road Getting into central London is easy via the Underground I also recommend walking around the area 30 minutes to Chelsea High St Kensington and to Knightsbridge London hotels can be pricey for not much however Baileys is very good value for all the above reasons I can certainly see myself staying there again

49945,The Bailey s Hotel London, Service at breakfast was poor and attitude of one person was dreadful However the rest of the staff were excellent and so I am hopeful that it was a one off Needs organisation for both waiting staff and food for breakfast We had to wait 5 minutes for eggs having been told one 1 or 2 minutes so the rest of breakfast got cold Other than that the food was fine and choice was good , location suited our needs perfectly and very convenient for public transport Good rooms Restaurant served good food at reasonable prices for London and service was good 
49946,The Bailey s Hotel London, I didn t like that fact that 100 deposit was taken from my bank account on arrival in case of any damage This was not explained properly and the money was not refunded for five days after our stay Very few of the lifts were working and the ones that were weren t properly marked Leftover room service food had been left on trays outside of the lifts which was a disappointing sight on arrival , The restaurant and bar are fantastic Amazing food attentive staff and all in beautiful surroundings Our room was nicely furnished but slightly on the small side

49949,The Bailey s Hotel London, underlying noise of vents throughout the building and in the rooms we had booked a classic room and the first one they gave us was the size of a shoebox but we eventually were moved to a larger one in the same category but to keep in mind that some rooms are very small most of the staff was polite but the onsite supervisor when we checked in was rather cheeky with us They asked us to pay the entire amount on check in which was mentioned nowhere in the reservation , excellent location in a beautiful neighbourhood good beds nice building and decor

49969,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, It was a great experience during my stay for 7 nights Perfect location right opposite tube station and walking distance to V A Sience Museums If you are a fun of theatre or shopping this place is right for you only a few stops to Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square I only wish if they could provide free internet connection in the room rather than just in the lobby I would visit the hotel again next time

49977,The Bailey s Hotel London, I don t understand why there is no free wifi in the rooms when most budget accomodations will have wifi but a luxury hotel like this does not , Right outside the entrance to underground excellent food helpful staff and beautifully renovated rooms 
49978,The Bailey s Hotel London, Too noisy The wall between room is not sound proof I could hear everything the young dynamic couple next door were doing , The hotel has luxury standard it s clean and in the center

49981,The Bailey s Hotel London, The breakfast was awful so bad that we left it on the table wasted 40 and went to a local cafe Rubbery eggs soggy tastless bacon dry burned hash browns Ordered coffee but the cream tasted very odd Not pleasant at all and I can t believe we were charged 20 each for such a disappointing meal Overall very clean room but there was some kind of sticky residue on the carpet by the bedside table and it stained my fabric bag The bathroom floor was also sticky to walk on it was odd Woken by housekeeping early ringing the room bell after a late night would be helpful if they read the door sign we hung to not be disturbed but mistakes happen and did apologise , Bed was gorgeously comfortable sheets smelled and felt lovely had a very good night sleep Room was pleasant large TV and wardrobe Bathroom was fantastic Doormen were very polite reception and bar staff could have been more attentive friendly but overall okay

49983,The Bailey s Hotel London, I loved the fact that the receptionist personally took us to our room and showed us around the only thing I didn t like about it is she closed the door behind her while in our room I felt a bit uncomfortable It would be more polite if she could tell us about the room with the door open , I liked that we were offered to be upgraded as part of the promotion for a very small amount of money Also the receptionist advised us about the free wifi that would come with the upgrade 
49984,The Bailey s Hotel London, Didn t take breakfast at 15 person as feel that is expensive went to nearby coffee shop, Decoration looked new Spacious room Great value at 99 for a Saturday night Easy access to Tube

49986,The Bailey s Hotel London, I requested in advance for a room with a window to open room stuffy a window restrictor would have been good to allow fresh air reception advised me for safety reasons why all windows are sealed NOT so sure how safe windows being sealed are in case of fire The hand towel was extremely worn out and did not feel very nice to use almost a grey colour , Staff are very friendly and professional 
49987,The Bailey s Hotel London, Weren t many amenities in the hotel such a pool etc but there is plenty in the local area to keep you entertained so isn t a problem , This was in an excellent location and was brilliant for the money relative to London prices Directly opposite the tube station so great access to the rest of London too About 5 minute walk from the museum and on the same street as lots of eateries 
49988,The Bailey s Hotel London, Wifi was an extra at 10 per day when I booked with booking com I had got a deal but it wasn t that cheap I don t think this is acceptable in a modern hotel which isn t of the budget variety Especially when it s free in the lobby but not free to paying guests , Location was excellent 
49989,The Bailey s Hotel London, Restaurant breakfast stained cups and crockery very hard to get attention of waiters They didn t understand some orders, Helpful house keeping and reception
49990,The Bailey s Hotel London, Couple of minor points the shower was not particularly powerful the bed was far too soft for my husband personal preference I know and the bathroom had a small bit of dirt in the corner of the bath All very minor points and did not really impede our stay , The location of the hotel was perfect for what we needed and the staff couldn t have been more helpful The hotel was right next to the tube station and just down the road from The Natural History Museum and the V and A We did only stay for one night but the room was adequately comfortable

49994,The Bailey s Hotel London, There was disco music till about 1am Need extra cost for Internet access , Millennium is always a good choice in terms of value for money around the globe that I have stayed Millennium Bailey s in London features spacious room and bathroom in an expensive location updated facilities and modern interior design 
49995,The Bailey s Hotel London, We left to soon , Amazing staff especially Sonny Amazing room Close to everything the Tube is across the street Blocks away are the museums and if you like to walk or take the Red bus to Harrods 3 min I did not hand the breakfast however we went to a sandwich place a block away it was great 
49996,The Bailey s Hotel London, It s where you are but room was noisy by traffic and there was loud beat of music playing until late we think from a guest room Carpet was dirty You needed to be slim to use the bathroom , Location was great right next to glouster road tube We walked to Royal Albert hall There was lots of choices for food and drinks venue s Refurbishment of the hotel is lovely there are still some bits to finish off
49997,The Bailey s Hotel London, Seems problem between booking comand the hotel itself When I arrived at the hotel they have yet received my booking from the website I have to personally email hotel about this Although I made the booking at the same day I was told I was not the only customer had the problem , Excellent well decorated hotel with spacious rooms and home feel Definite four stars especially in central London 
49998,The Bailey s Hotel London, One member of the bar staff was ignorant bordering on rude All other staff were exemplary , Right next to Gloucester Rd tube Comfortable and clean Good value for the offer price paid 
49999,The Bailey s Hotel London, Fairly unpleasant staff upon crack in and check out Problems with finding my booking then with taking confirming the payment Computer issue on the last day made it impossible to check out Paid wifi in the hotel is to be too much like 1990 s, Beautiful design renovated rooms

50002,The Bailey s Hotel London,No Negative, After being let down by Citadines South Kensington they were relocating my husband and I to another side of London without prior notice we took a chance on a nearby hotel Millennium Bailey s and we re glad we did I don t know why Citadines label their branch as posh as they don t even have a porter and well lit lounge unlike Bailey s The staff were very welcoming and courteous The room we were assigned in was a good size for a London location Even though the hotel is next to a Tube station and a busy road we didn t hear much of the noise from outside There are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby Moreover the Natural History Museum and the Royal Albert Hall are just walking distance All in all my husband and I had a pleasant stay Many thanks

50012,The Bailey s Hotel London, The lifts could be improved And more selection on the food menu Deserts were all too liquid Needed chocolate cake or something more heavy , Quick check in and looking after gold members very well Extra touches such as chocolates in the room and robes

50019,The Bailey s Hotel London, I stayed for three nights and the bar was closed for renovations on two of those nights No mention of this little nugget when I booked by the way Luckily there was a decent pub over the road Also no free WiFi in the rooms is a no no Just because the building is a couple if centuries old doesn t mean the facilities have to be , The building was full of character and the room was well appointed Superb location close to the tube and museums 
50020,The Bailey s Hotel London, Left a betting slip with 150 win in the room we remembered about it when we left We rang the hotel a member of staff hung up so we rang again and someone said they d call us back Still waiting for this call days later not even a courtesy call Also our room faced onto a staircase and a wall , The bed and the bathroom were both lovely we stayed in room 526 The staff on the desk and front door were amazing

50023,The Bailey s Hotel London, I normally give this hotel an excellent score I have been staying here for ca 20 years each time I visit London However this time was a disaster renovations ongoing While I understand that such things have to happen a 4 star hotel should have warned their guests before arrival into the reception area which was effectively a building site I could deal with that i can understand they cannot close but being given a room in an area where shelves were still being put up noisely with painting going on in the corridors and the last straw being woken at 07 30 on a weekday morning by painters sanding down the door in the room next to mine Opening a floor before the work is completed Bad move Baileys Very unprofessional and little understanding from the staff , Location is very useful for getting around London Good breakfasts 
50024,The Bailey s Hotel London, One staff Male Europen not English for sure at reception desk was not helpful during the check in He asked me to get the passport which in the Car away from the Hotel was insisting he could have done the formalities until later since the reservation was for 4nites so can t go wrong This guy should not be at the reception desk will spoil the image of the Hotel This message for Hotel Management Breakfast was not a big deal every day the same no creativity like in the Far East, Location of the Hotel
50025,The Bailey s Hotel London, Room service was pretty useless virtually nothing but sandwiches offered after 10 30 p m I had to tell reception to send in the cleaners every time I went out otherwise I would return hours later to find the room exactly as I d left it in the morning The heating wasn t working but I was eventually provided with a portable heater , Excellent reception staff porters Excellent location Beautiful hotel and the room was very nice and looked like it had been recently refurbished
