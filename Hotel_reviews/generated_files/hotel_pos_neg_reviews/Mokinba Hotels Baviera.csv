485021,Mokinba Hotels Baviera,No Negative, helpful and always smiling staff especially the middle aged man who welcome us at the reception desk good location very clean and comfortable room
485022,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The wifi sometimes did not connect Asked the hotel a couple times via booking com if they could pick us up at the airport but no reply , Excellent room housekeeping Breakfast was really nice with wide selections of cheese and pastries Good connectivity very close to metro Repubblica and Centrale railway station there were always taxis waiting around the corner Supermarket restaurants nearby 
485023,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Too small room dirty wool cover for the bed too small bathroom no home shoes to walk inside the room all other 4 stars hotels I went have floor not enough clean to walk on without home shoes Too expensive comparing the offered service, Strategic location for my business
485024,Mokinba Hotels Baviera,No Negative, Great hotel with the kind staff beautiful clean room products of excellent quality in the bathroom very good breakfast 50 reduction on spa as one of two jacuzzis was not working properly We really loved to spend a weekend there 
485025,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The two older receptionist woman and man were not welcoming It seems that they just do the job for checking in and nothing else and then they go home and watch tv and drink their wine Nothing like Hello How are you it was only Pay this room number and wifi password Customer friendliness ZERO I hope they are not like this because their English is limited because its a shame as they are in people service business The room was gothic the shower was falling as the holder was broken so you have to shower with your hands It was a spooky room compared to the one in the picture they have in the advert Maybe that room exist but only one , The price was alright but as a traveller I know I could have found a better offer for this price The young lady receptionist was welcoming 
485026,Mokinba Hotels Baviera,No Negative, This hotel was in a great location near the train station The room was beautiful quiet and very comfortable The shower was shear luxury with colored lights and a rain shower head nozzle I didn t want to get out The price was very reasonable and the was a great Indian restaurant in the neighborhood that I really enjoyed The breakfast was delicious and plentiful at the hotel in the morning and it was included with the price of the room I would definitely stay here again 
485027,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Internet was not reliable No BBC or CCN available and it is a 4 star hotel Laundry expensive and they misplaced items eventually returned , Staff friendly
485028,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, I wrote email to the hotel before went to Milan about the route how to get to the hotel from airport as it s my first time to go to Italy After a couple of days I didn t get any response I called the hotel from Australia but the staff answered phone could only speak limited English I mentioned the email I sent she said she would ask her colleague to answer my query through email However I didn t receive any response after I sent the second email After a long journey to get to the hotel I asked for the Wifi password the staff was very rude yelling to me that it s on the wall of the room ,No Positive
485029,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The air conditioner was lousy and the room was pretty hot we were asking the receptionists about it several times and they tried to fix it but it still didn t work quite well , Comfortable beds good looking hotel clean rooms and toilets 
485030,Mokinba Hotels Baviera,No Negative, We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and we can say the hotel is not very far from the city Center In the room there is a flat TV minibar and also a safe The room is clean but the furniture is old and there is a smell in the room I think from the bathroom In the bathroom there is a bidet and hairdryer All in all if you visit Milan for sightseeing and you don t spend the whole trip in the room this hotel could be taken into account since it has a good price ratio 
485031,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Coffee at breakfast could be improved on Room was very small , Price was one of the most reasonable at the weekend Location was central and parking was close by 
485032,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The shower was too small and no free parking easy to find and the once close to the hotel is prototype expensive maybe an agreement for the clients could be appreciated, Position cleanness beautiful rooms and building style
485033,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The room showed in booking com does not match the type of room we thought we would get We had to get an upgrade to be in the nice rooms The Service was absolutely terrible Except for 1 or 2 women in the reception at the time of check out all other employees in reception were absolutely ZERO help and one even was making comments about my nationality It seems they did not study hospitality at all The Restaurant does not have a Restaurant to serve room Service The breakfast was poorly made Sandwiches were not appropriate for a so called 4 stars Hotel I can continue this list forever but I will stop here , The room we had was very nice as it was one of the modern ones Basically the only Thing I like from the Hotel was the room 
485034,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The rooms were small but adequate for one person , The staff were very friendly and accommodating The breakfast was excellent The location was great 
485035,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, In the bathroom you could smell cigarettes I decided to tell this thing at the reception but they didn t really care Another thing was broken hose in the shower They gave us one towel I had to go for another one ,No Positive
485036,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Breakfast not included bathroom is very small staff looked grumpy , Good choice for a short stay Close to restaurants shops and metro Clean room free wifi nice little balcony Good value for the price 
485037,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The staff was very unpleasant the shuttle service expensive The price was absolutely not worth the value , The bathroom was pretty good and well equipped 
485038,Mokinba Hotels Baviera,No Negative, The staff was super friendly l got an upgrade unexpectedly for the newly renovated rooms They were clean comfortable and had a beautiful look as well the bedroom as the bathroom Would gladly come back 
485039,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, 1 room has a very bad smell that comes from every corner like the cutains under the bed the carpet bathroom etc that caused us insomnia 2 no ventilation in the bathrooom 3 shower is extremely small 4 it was very hot in the room in the middle of winter although that we switched the heater off all the time the answer from the staff was it s so just keep the windows opened 5 complained also to booking com without an answer , Almost nothing 
485040,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Thin walls you can hear every sound from other rooms tv toilet splash etc Hair drier is so old that not dry but hardly breathing No separate shampoo balsam shower gel 3 in 1 container , Location cheese selection on breakfast nice personal 
485041,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Small shower Am tall with a slim build and still had a hard time moving around in the shower , Close to the train station and to the center Helpful and friendly staff 
485042,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Staff not that friendly called us 15 minutes after the check out to remember that we have to leave I wouldn t give it 4 stars as it doesn t have a lot of facilities in the Bathroom i e only shower gel no shampoo no dental kit or shaving kit , Very good location easy to reach from the central train station Clean hotel
485043,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Room is smaller than expected not modern as it shows in photos, Location out of touristic jam but still central Reachable by yellow metro station Republica exit viale Tunisia that takes you to Duomo or Centrale without change Walking there is also possible Good breakfast and really friendly and helpful staff 
485044,Mokinba Hotels Baviera,No Negative, We had booked 2 hours before arrival and it was no problem arrivaltime 20 30 We even get an upgrade So it was even better than we expected Also the location was perfect for a short citytrip We could do everything by foot We had a great stay for a good price Tip take a walk through the park to the city very nice 
485045,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The room is tiny and the receptionist is bad And the location is not very close to central station about 10 mins by walk if you carry lots of luggages don t choose this one ,No Positive
485046,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, 1 Evening reception staff was uncooperative provocative addition to failing to offer any assistance service such as a parking place as he was handling me as if offering me free housing 2 the breakfast was with less selection of food such no scrambled eggs and omelet, The mornning staff are so kind and helpfull with a big smile
485047,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The room had a very old and dusty carpet Our phone screen was full of dust only after a few minutes we came inside the room I advised the hotel I was allergic to dust and she said that the room I paid for all of them have carpets inside If I haven t paid in advance with no refund I would have changed straight away Also the hotel was classified as a 4 stars hotel but when I called reception at 11 pm to request a blanket I was informed It was not possible to get one as the receptionist was completely alone in the hotel and he could t get the blanket I offered to get it at reception but the blanket was in a storage room he couldn t access I was cold and with allergy all night couldn t sleep and when I reported the experience to the receptionist she didn t know about the incident and didn t even apologize Very poor service and room conditions It is definitely not a 4 stars hotel ,No Positive
485048,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Maybe the location is not great if you want to stay in the center , Great place to stay Our room was very nice and clean Staff was very nice and helpful They had bikes we could borrow for free Close to the train station 
485049,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, One of the night staff was really rude we were also charged 150 when we left for tourist tax and a mini bar bill we barely used Will not be using this hotel again BE CAREFUL OF HIDDEN CHARGES,No Positive
485050,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The breakfast only ran 7 30 9 30 and was 9 you can buy a pastry from near by bakeries for much less and also means you don t have to get up extra early to have breakfast, The staff were a great help arriving at the hotel 3 hours before check in they allowed us to check in early to drop off our luggage and explore he city early We were also given a room on the 5th floor which had recently been renovated The room was fitted with a large screen TV fully stacked mini bar modern bathroom and bedroom If anyone is looking to book a room in the hotel try and get a room on the 5th floor The hotel is also near to two metro tubes one being a metro line which takes you directly to the centre square where the catherdiral is the other being a line wh oh takes you in walking distance to the San Siro stadium or to the connecting line which takes you to the San Siro The hotel is also a 10 15 minute streight walk to the central station in Milan
485051,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The only thing that was disappointing was that they charged 5 Euro per person per day to secure bicycles We have never come across this before anywhere, The accommodation was great Breakfast excellent and location very central
485052,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Older rooms are dank and dingy had to change when I saw what we were given Breakfast was limited and the quality of the food was not up to standard When asked for wine bottle opener to be brought to my room the barman waited for me to open the bottle so I could return the one and only opener in the hotel not good , Refurbished rooms were nice and welcoming 
485053,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, It could include breakfast in that price No parking in the hotel so parking is extra charge by a 3rd party just a minute walk from the hotel , Restaurant and a little supermarket are just near by Including an electronic shop were we bought a sim card Room design was nice bed were comfy The staff were very nice 
485054,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The people who work there don t make nothing for the clients When i was there raining really bad I called the hotel for send me one taxi and they said to call alone I m not from Italy so I don t have numbers i called again they don t care I most to walk in the rain with my girlfriend untill hotel 3 km because i don t had one taxi We arrived there really wet and for reception was funny the people don t have respect for clients ,No Positive
485055,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, I made a booking for a double room two adults for on night and on check out they charge me again for the second person i would like to have an explanation why , Good location
485056,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Horrible Reception service No one could suggest me an available laundry for an emergency and this happened during Fashion week so I ended up asking for laundry at Westin nearby A receptionist couldn t give us ANY suggestion about a place for dinner and finally gave an indication for a place after googling that turned out to be closed I was preparing for an important evening and I had my friend passing by to help me My room was booked for two but she wasn t the second guest The hotel didn t allow her to come upstairs even for an hour in a very rude manner She didn t visit the room didn t see it as they wanted and definitely will never stay at this hotel Neither will I , Good breakfast great equipped bathroom wifi Central location 
485057,Mokinba Hotels Baviera,No Negative, The hotel is located quite close to the CENTRAL STATION There is a big supermarket at the corner and the m st REPUBBLICA is in walking distance The hotel is clean quiet and the reception is very kind The hotel provided all services that we needed Thanks a lot 
485058,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The air conditioning is turned off at night in the whole hotel and it can get hot as hell in the room That made sleeping quite uncomfortable , Location is not bad near metro easy access to center Rooms are nice and clean 
485059,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, One of the receptionists was a bit ironic and rude kept referring to me as blondie because of the colour of my hair Thought this was unprofessional and inappropriate, Comfortable bed clean and quiet room Good and very convenient location 
485060,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, staff staff staff very rude unpolite aggressive the lady named ROSY with very poor customer service skills very rude and quit aggressive old dirty smelly rooms old out dated furniture in the room just lobby is recently renovated and makes a wrong impression if hotel is that clean and modern paper thin walls you can hear each and every word from neighboring room and from the corridor small and very uncomfortable bathroom that small that it was impossible to take shower even for slim person you need to come out of cabin to shampoo yourself and get in for shower then shower head was broken falling down every time injured my face poor bath amenity set not properly clean linen i had to sleep with jacket and trousers on me poor breakfast very little selection and it is on extra fee wifi very slow the price for that night seemed good and i was caught on this offer even the cheapest price is not worth of this hotel don t make this mistake better pay 10 euro more and stay safe and clean in any nearest hotel there are plenty around with better link to cosro buenos aires and central station luckily i had only 1 night paid so from the next morning i quickly moved to another hotel overall hotel is 2 level rather than published 4 will never ever stay in this dirty hotel , nothing 
485061,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, On booking com it was advertised that breakfast was included but the hotel charged us 9 euros each for the meal Very disappointing , The room was perfect It was clean and had everything we needed for the night we were staying Also the hotel was able to hold our luggage while we explored the city even after we had checked out The 24 hour reception desk was an added plus 
485062,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The twin beds were pushed together and could have been a double bed We had requested 2 single beds for a reason The breakfast bar lacked in quality the melon had no taste and the yogurt was watery For a hotel in Milan to serve bad coffee from a carafe is inexcusable , The room was clean and well equipped The shower was spacious and offered different jet options as well as colorful lighting options 
485063,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Poor breakfast at best good for a 2 star hotel Paperthin walls if you are looking even for a decentish sleep forget about this place Rude personnel at the reception do not expect a friendly attitude let alone any help, Good location
485064,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Old in a room smell of cigarettes breakfast extra cost unfriendly staff , 15min walk from train bus station 15min walk to Duomo and Brera Few places to eat next to a hotel Clean good wifi comfy bed 
485065,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Welcoming really unwelcoming worst one I have had in years Noises between the construction work during daytime and the night club at night Breakfast under expectations, Rooms are nicely decorates 
485066,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Wifi was terrible I own a business and if I were on a business trip I would not have been able to get work done There wasn t very many staff onsite over the Christmas period and getting our room cleaned because we slept in a bit took all day to find someone There was also no where to get a drink in the bar as no one wanted to serve us , Good rate for a central Milan hotel 
485067,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Workers were rude room was not clean I would like to say that this hotel should not be in booking com it is absolutely bad I suggest everybody to find somewhere ese,No Positive
485068,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Breakfast could have been better Probably it has to do with the Italian culture they seem to save their great food for later in the day , Great location close to Metro and shopping easy to find I will definitely stay here again 
485069,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Room is extremely small shower smallest I ve had so far and they might as well not offer internet it is dead slow , Location is perfect 10min walk from train station
485070,Mokinba Hotels Baviera,No Negative, republikka is the best place to stay in my opinion it has the best of the transport links the central area being only 5 mins away by metro and the main train line is under the same station as the metro meaning the suburbs are easily accessible The room was spacious and light and micro managed to achieve the best from the space good shower comfortable bed
485071,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, We booked 6 superior rooms and only got 2 of it because the staff let other people stay longer in our room To be honest if not because the superior room I wouldn t choose to stay at this hotel because the standard rooms are very old The most unpleasant about this stay is the front desk staffs not only they didn t give the rooms we booked and didn t apologies nor give us compensation Staying here make me feel like I own them something With their fake smile and poor attitude I wouldn t recommend anyone to stay here Not only my group that has problem while I was trying to work things out at the front desk there was also other guest complaining with the similar problem We stayed for 2 nights and right on the first day I ask to talk to the manager They said he she will come tomorrow for 3 days that I have been told the same old lie that he is coming tomorrow and he has never show up Worst experience of hotel in Italy for me I am doing an Itaian luxury gourmet tour for 4 years and this hotel is the worst I have ever stay in Italy , The location is ok very near metro station 
485072,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, WiFi didn t work at all The bathroom was ridiculously small almost wouldnt fit one person to take shoe and the w is so tight I could even use well the toilet They are doing construction also it s messy This hotel only gives 1 copy of the key ridiculous This is a 2 or MAX 3 stars hotel I honestly don t recommend it , Only thing fine is the location
485073,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The room was a lot smaller than what it was advertised Wi fi was slow and connection kept crashing , Location is good They are improving the hotel but works are in progress 
485074,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, My one bed room was veeeeery very little, Clean room good position comfortable bed Check in is since 12 00 or 13 but I arrive early in the morning and they give me room since 09 00 Thanks a lot for this 
485075,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, The porter confused our room with another one when showing guests to their room and basically walked in while we were relaxing in bed Luckily enough we were decent at the time , Clean and comfortable room and bathroom Located close to main train station Milano Centrale 10 min walk max Also a short walk to Metro stops Republica and Porta Venezia so easy to get around the city 
485076,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Air conditioning could have been better asked someone to come up and show me if i was using it right however no one cane and i decided not to bother just worked it out on my own but the room never seemed to get cold, Great shower in room nice bed
485077,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Bad w lan connection , The bathroom been pretty awesome the room at all been very comfortable Very nice hotel very friendly personal very gayfriendly 
485078,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, We had a room on the 5th floor A C did not work We were told it was because we were on the top floor the unit was blowing warm air and it should cool off in 30 minutes It never cooled off we had to finally open the windows in order to get some cooler air , Good location nice staff Nicely remodeled room Loved the shower very modern 
485079,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Cutting a long story short a guy at the reception charged 20 euro more than we owed the staff s behavior overall was despicable only apparently professional and understanding as a matter of facts we were cheated , The location between Brera and the Central Station 
485080,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Hotel is not 4 stars as you mentioned It is hardly 3 star Service is bad because I have to wait 2 days for blanket and to remind reception 4 5 times Room is not clean enough ,No Positive
485081,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, This is really a 3 star hotel 4 star is an over statement The room is tiny Don t be mislead by the nicely done photos The bathroom is really bad with very old facilities It is close to the train station and the area is not nice The location of this hotel doesn t really add much benefit at all as there is nothing to see in its neiboughood at all ,No Positive
485082,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, Would never stay in this hotel again the receptionist was rude they wifi was broken they re was no bar 9 for cereal some bread , Absolutely nothing 
485083,Mokinba Hotels Baviera, I travel once a month and it s the first time I have such a bad experience I never saw such a small room if I sit on the toilet my legs are in the shower The window was giving on a wall and there was a lot of noice when it was opened The wifi was not working and the people at the reception were not even sorry about that They were not friendly at all and not happy when I wanted to pay the tax by card Never again , Situation is ok not far from the city centre This is the only good point for this hotel
