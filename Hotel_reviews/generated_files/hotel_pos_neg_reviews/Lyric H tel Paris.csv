89773,Lyric H tel Paris, A little pricey but isn t everywhere in Paris , All staff were extremely polite and helpful Location was excellent since it was close to a few restaurants the metro and about a 10 minute walk to the airport shuttle drop off point It was also nice and quiet 
89774,Lyric H tel Paris, Poor Lighting in bathroom not an unusual problem in hotels , Bed very comfortable amenities nice exceptionally clean short walk to bistros bakeries and restaurants and metro and a great view of Eiffel Tower from our room on 6th floor 
89775,Lyric H tel Paris, Due to the high ceiling and the wooden floor you can ear the noise especially in the morning during the cleaning of the room not the best alarm clock The pillow is too soft , A large room with high ceiling Very clean and with all commodities you will receive a form to mark all your requests before your stay Location is perfect close to many restaurants in the Japanese area of Paris but in the quiet part The fitness room is equipped with a swimming pool a sauna and a hammam 
89776,Lyric H tel Paris,No Negative, The staff at Lyric Hotel were extremely polite and personalised the room ro our needs The room was interesting clean and very modern We appreciated the mobile phone to help with finding a place to eat and navigate our way Genius I would highly recommend this hotel 
89777,Lyric H tel Paris,No Negative, Excellent location We walked to every attraction we wanted Eiffel Tower Arc De Triomphe Pantheon Notre Dame Crypts Louvre and enjoyed the shopping along the way Easy metro access we just chose not to use it in favor of exploring above ground The facilities met expectations stayed in the junior suite Room had a nice view along the street with little noise Bathroom was large and modern Staff was friendly and helpful worth buying tickets from the front desk for a couple extra Euro than standing in lines at attractions Smart phone was provided for the stay which was super useful for looking up restaurants and just navigating via google maps 
89778,Lyric H tel Paris,No Negative, I liked the fact that the buffet breakfast was included with the room Coffee croissants eggs bacon and sausage was an excellent way to start the days Room was just the right size for a couple touring the city 
89779,Lyric H tel Paris, Nothing, Location staff and breakfast were really great The room was a bit small buy very cosy and pleasant the view over Paris roofs compensated the size
89780,Lyric H tel Paris, The Paris tax was not included in our stay The breakfast was expensive Also the gym was teeny tiny as well as the pool , I loved the location I walked to the museums and other well known attractions Chipotle was very close Also there are many great restaurants near by The help desk was very polite and helped us when we ordered food The best part was that the hotel gave us a phone to use while we were there which we used to navigate everywhere 
89781,Lyric H tel Paris, Wifi ia quite slow so dont depend on it , The room was nice and clean with a really comfortable bed The small gym indoors pool and sauna is a perfect way to start the day nobody seems to use it so we could enjoy the whole area ourselves The location is great most things are 15 25 min walking distance if you are up for a walk also plenty of nuce bars in the area 
89782,Lyric H tel Paris, I asked for the sauna to be turned on and the receptionist told me that it was already on when we went to the spa the sauna had only 30 degrees we waited for an hour but it didnt heat up at all Secondly the room was a bit chilly we complained on the reception and were imformed that they will put it up the temperature in the room however didnt change , the hotel had exelent central location was nicely decoreted and very high standard of cleanliness Breakfeast was nice as well 
89783,Lyric H tel Paris, The rooms are a little small but your in Paris get out and explore , The position of this hotel is fantastic so many bars and restaurants within walking distance and if flying into CDG airport the bus takes you to within a short walk of the hotel

89786,Lyric H tel Paris, Rooms a little small but stylish The fitness area was a bit of a disappointment one bike one treadmillbut it didn t detract from the overall experience , Staff were impeccable friendly helpful and sincere Location was ideal in a really beautiful part of town with views over the rooftops from your juliette balcony Sauna was a bonus

89794,Lyric H tel Paris, First impressions are everything staff were very abrupt on arrival but once I got to know them and vice versa they were fabulous maybe that s just a French thing , Great location facilities and staff ended up being fantastic
89795,Lyric H tel Paris, rooms being placed just by the reception is a no go very poor insolation as can hear people coming in and out till very late plus the sound at the reception people checking in and out plus the room being in a corner just on a fairly busy street so the noise from both inside and outside give a very poor quality sleep , fairly nice decoration clean rooms central location 
89796,Lyric H tel Paris, The WiFi was slow but usable , Great breakfast Excellent helpful staff The location is very convenient for the Louvre bus tours etc just walking distance Rooms are compact but very modern clean and quiet Overall a highly recommended hotel for Paris

89808,Lyric H tel Paris, Except for the fact that there was a lot of bickering among the staff As a French speaking guest I was disturbed I feel they were catering to non francophones and assumed that they could speak their minds without their guests comprehending , Everything about the hotel was wonderful 
89809,Lyric H tel Paris, maybe adding some movie channels english language at least can be a plus as there are almost only french channels , Location is excellent 5 minutes walking from oper Garnier e 10 minutes from Louvre there are a lot or restaurants around and the rates are not that expensive Room is very nice parisian size wide shower super widescreen TV comfortable bed we didn t use spa pool etc so we cannot judge also breackfast is very nice for the price we paid
