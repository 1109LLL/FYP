354474,Hotel Schani Wien, Could do with more storage for luggage when busy , Very easy access from train station and to all parts of Vienna by subway or tram Quiet despite closeness to main rail lines Very friendly and helpful staff 
354475,Hotel Schani Wien, We lived in the room of Maisonette type Spacious room but the stairs leading to the top floor is very narrow and steep It is simply unsafe for an elderly guest as I, We liked the breakfast and coffee from the coffee machine And of course the hotel is so close to the Hauptbahnhof which is very convenient for those travelling by train
354476,Hotel Schani Wien, The room was ugly Was very cold during the night even we open the windows and have no possibility to stop the air conditioned , The coffe was very good the small garden was very nice 
354477,Hotel Schani Wien, Ditch the Nespresso coffee machine It s too slow and the coffee lukewarm Austria has good coffee but there was nothing good about the very nasty tasteless coffee capsules pretending to be Italian yuk , The location was perfect Tram to town centre on the doorstep and mainline station 5 minute walk or take the tram one stop at the front of the hotel or a 15 minute walk to nearby restaurants etc down the side of the hotel Breakfast food selection was excellent 
354478,Hotel Schani Wien, Our room was nice but the air conditioning in was not working properly Although they offered to change our rooms because we are a party of 3 there wasn t any room available to change to but the staff did offer other solutions to which we agreed to still it would have been better with a working air conditioning , Staff was helpful and friendly Great location the hotel was just across the station I like the friendly fun and hip theme that the hotel presents Breakfast was great The rooms where clean and interiors were interactive like the wall showed a map of vienna and it s attractions Props to the designers of the hotel 
354479,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, Very unusual hotel the consept and design Great location just near the train station and Belvider palace It s possible to rent electric scooters there that s what I did to explore the city Berakfast was great I was using the juicer to prepare fresh myself that s the great idea for a healthy breakfast 
354480,Hotel Schani Wien, Room was a little hot A C doesn t adequately cool the room , Cool Design Nice staff Train to old Town area is right outside the hotel Also close to main train station 
354481,Hotel Schani Wien, The AC cannot be turned off the air was cold and dry Also it s noisy and if you are a light sleeper you might not like it The sink is in the room not in the bathroom For us wasn t a problem but the room and the shower are separated only by a transparent glass door so if you are looking for privacy you should consider this , Location is close to the metro station Underground parking with elevator up to the room Interesting design Clean
354482,Hotel Schani Wien, The location is fairly near the public transport train station and the metro but as the area is still developing and the complexity of the public transport in Vienna you may need to walk a distance if you get lost around the area and the station , The lighting is so sufficient and the theme of the hotel is decorated interestingly It is not a traditional hotel but fairly focusing on the young travelers and business co workers with adequate working spaces and facilities 
354483,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, Great location right out side the train station Make sure use the east exit of train station where you will find the hotel just across street Great interior design and excellent facilities conveniently accessible Especially the storage facility in basement all self service storage locks like the ones you could find in train stations but free of charge ideal for travellers who coming in and traveling out Vienna by train 
354484,Hotel Schani Wien, Staff weren t helpful staff member walked into room when do not disturb sign was on the door Room facilities were lacking air con wasn t cold no phone in room no fridge or kitchenette facilities, The location
354485,Hotel Schani Wien, Rooms were fine but a bit stuffy and the only way to get air circulation was to open the window which caused the air conditioning to turn itself off automatically Also while generally good breakfast was quite expensive , Lovely front desk staff always pleasant genuinely friendly and helpful Great quirky vibe overall Location near main train station AND directly on tram line cannot be beat 
354486,Hotel Schani Wien, I was traveling with a work colleage and we asked for a twin room that wasn t available We had to rent other room , Breakfast was 12 euros and it had all good things that I long for in a hotel breakfast Excelent

354488,Hotel Schani Wien, Hotel opted in the self service technologies such as by checking in this decreases the personal contact between the hotel staff and the customers and this might be a bit less interesting for the traditional customers It doesn t bother us though we like that the process was done very quickly without queuing Keep up your good work , Perfect location with a walking distance from the train central station The property is very fresh bright and spotless clean with the modern facilities We will definitely come back for our next visit 
354489,Hotel Schani Wien, Air conditioning in room not operating sweltered overnight and very poor sleep, Friendliness and helpfulness of staff Cup of tea in morning beautifully quaint pot and cup combination just 2 50 Tram to city right outside door and one stop to main train station 300 yards away City Centre only 10 minutes by tram 
354490,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, The hotel is located very close to train and metro stations It is very convenient for us to go to different attractions and transit to other cities Staff members of the hotel are friendly and there is an Italian restaurant next to the hotel pasta was nice

354495,Hotel Schani Wien, Room was a bit warm and we would have liked our own tea making facilities, Room was good very clean The bar area was also good Liked the locker system for luggage
354496,Hotel Schani Wien, The room was ready only at 3 pm therefore I had to wait 2 hours hanging around The arrangement of the hotel in general and of the room in particular furniture not practical at all It looked like the room of a teenager more than a room for a business traveler In one week they never changed the bed linens A wish to have a small refrigerator to keep my water and drinks cool It pretends to be an hostel style hotel but with a 3 stars hotel price , The location very close to main train station and U bahn 
354497,Hotel Schani Wien, The hotel guide stated that staff at reception would order food in should you wish to stay in The weather was terrible and it was dark and as a solo traveler I did not want to leave the hotel to find something to eat When I went to reception about 7 30pm the woman at reception was extremely rude and unwilling to help I had to explain that in the hotel guide it clearly states that they will be happy to order food in I explained that I would need help translating the menus she eventually provided which she rolled her eyes at She sighed and huffed throughout the process of ordering my food making me seem like an inconvenience There were no other guests waiting to be served and barely anyone in the restaurant area It was a shame because I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel apart from the attitude of this one young woman , The interior design is fabulous Loved my room 
354498,Hotel Schani Wien, I would appreciate to have possibility to order an package where the breakfast is inclusive To buy it separately is rather inconvenient in case you are on business trip , I like the hotel in general I have already stayed there several times The location and style of the hotel is very convenient 
354499,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, The hotel is very good value The room was not big but it felt alright because of open concept and quite convenient design It s close to central train station and public transport network yet it s on a quiet street so you can get a good sleep no problem It s new modern and clean 
354500,Hotel Schani Wien, The room was too hot and you couldn t open the window as the traffic noise was deafening They did move us when I complained to a garden room which meant we could open the window didn t quite understand why there was a thermostat in the room if it did nothing to the room temp tho , The decor was quirky and fun we liked it a lot The tram right outside the door went into town regularly getting around was so easy and it was 5 mins walk from main train station which had regular trains to the airport for less than 4 bargain 
354501,Hotel Schani Wien, Perhaps a little more explanation of the technology for oldies like us , We only stayed one night between the train to Vienna and the plane out The hotel is very close to the main railway station It is very modern in appearance with lots of the latest technology The room was very comfortable and the reception staff pleasant and helpful 
354502,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, Breakfast was amazing Price was reasonable The interieur of the hotel was very unique and stunning how much effort went into details Staff was young and super friendly The location was absolutely fine Yes not in the city center but with a tram right in front of the door which you could use to get there We enjoyed every bit of our stay
354503,Hotel Schani Wien, There wasnt really something wrong There could have been slippers provided or some more bath products but its OK, The Location is next to the train station and 3 min walk from Underground Comfortable bed Modern design Quiet Helpful Stuff Everything was perfect
354504,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, Everything There is a tram right in front of the hotel and the main station is reachable by foot It made our access to other parts of Vienna very easily The room s architecture is captivating never had we stayed in a hotel so innovative and modern before 
354505,Hotel Schani Wien, dirty cussions with yellow patches caused allergic reactions misleading information about breakfast wasn t able to book it here which was not marked and I even asked the hotel about breakfast via e mail and they didn t communicate this information hotel then refused to serve us breakfast content of the bin was found on top of toilet after the cleaning far too expensive for what we received on NYE nothing extra was offered except for two small drinks ,No Positive
354506,Hotel Schani Wien, No safety deposit box in the room No tea maker and coffee machine in the room , Location Close to Wien Hbf and right next to tram station Modern hotel with interesting interior design Clean and comfortable 
354507,Hotel Schani Wien, Wi Fi was sometimes sooooo slow Hotel maids knocking on the door at 9 Breakfast selection is great but it is the same every day If you stay at hotel for more than 3 days it s kind of boring still delicious though , The breakfast although 12 eur was delicious The rooms are super nice quet and with lots of outlets for all the tech you have 
354508,Hotel Schani Wien, , Hipster s hotel with new wave with not trimmed concrete walls inside the room Very close to Wien main train station Wien Hbf with own garage and hospitality staff Big common area in lobby is also very suitable Hotel is really good for short or transit staying in Wien with reasonable price 
354509,Hotel Schani Wien, The location its not very central even though it is near the main station good 45 min walk to the main sites, The hotel and its facilities were great the room was very nice and comfy
354510,Hotel Schani Wien, The wifi is good but could be improved, Very convenient hotel you can do a pre checking online open the door with your mobile phone and the check out is automatic so basically no time lost if you re on a short trip But at the same time the staff is very helpful and nice the comfort and design of the room very pleasant The location is very convenient next the the station but in a nice street and not far from the centre I already recommended it to several friends colleagues
354511,Hotel Schani Wien, Price was too high for such modest conditions Interior and bathroom conception is more suitable for young people Breakfast was for extra pay , Very good location Tram stop is in front of the hotel hauptbahnhof 200m away New interior Very comfortable bed hudge pillows Nice and clean Good coffe fresh juice Quiet 
354512,Hotel Schani Wien, Some restrictions on wifi caused that it did not work for business purpose VPN connection was refused which works on standard wifi s in hotels , Interesting design in the room Good location close to the main railway station Breakfast o k although quite expensive
354513,Hotel Schani Wien, Breakfast was very expensive although the quality of the food was excellent , Modern comfortable with a hostel like feel but quiet and private like a hotel Staff was friendly and the location was great 
354514,Hotel Schani Wien, For friends rather than lovers having translucent or opaque shower walls rather than clear would have been nice since the shower and sink are in the bedroom , We enjoyed the industrial cute atmosphere and the convenience of being right next to the main train station and local transportation 
354515,Hotel Schani Wien, The rooms are budget looking even though the design is fun and cheerful The sealing need repainting Looks really old and dirty No phones in the rooms no room service you can t get information if you need one unless you go down to the reception Which is not so practical if you just went out from the shower No iron and ironing board which can be very bad if you are travelling for business I did business and extended few days for sightseeing Luckily I didn t have to iron anything Cloths storage is completely open which is kind of nice design but you need at least one compartment closed Tooth paste was sold not provided for 3 e The same one costs 1 e in the shops Not about the price but about overall impression No slippers Only shower gel not shampoos are provided For a 4 star hotel I would be expecting all of the above provided , I loved the lobby Sitting in the big chairs in the glass windows while it s snowing outside pure magic The lobby is offering books to read and souvenirs to buy The breakfast is served there which was delicious and various And it s a kind of smart bar in the evening Location is good The train station is there lot of tramb stations around Belvedere Museum is at the walking distance Super friendly and helpful staff Smart TV guidance and a lot of implemented useful information Very very clean 
354516,Hotel Schani Wien, The location was not the best location appeared to be a little industrial for holiday purposes but suited my purposes 100 , The hotel concept was very interesting breakfast was very good and the staff very friendly You could also borrow a skateboard or scooter for free or an electro scooter for a small fee All in all an enjoyable stay and would recommend it to all 
354517,Hotel Schani Wien, Site should let you know to exit main railroad station on EAST end which leads to just a one block walk with luggage , Liked everything Quirky hotel typically German cleanliness The tram at the door to central Vienna was ultra convenient My wife adores this place 
354518,Hotel Schani Wien, No restaurant in the hotel which was inconvenient They did serve a breakfast but it was very expensive at 12 euros per person A bottle of orange juice from the lobby fridge was 2 50 euro A functional hotel without a lot of amenities , The hotel is conveniently located near the train station The room was clean and comfortable 
354519,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, The location of the hotel right alongside Wien Hauptbahnhof was ideal for first time visitors to Vienna With it being a 5minute walk to the underground metro service to take you into the heart of Vienna The staff were very helpful and friendly which added to our experience Would definitely consider using the property again should the need arise 
354520,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, Fantastic quirky styling everywhere from the lobby to the rooms all coupled with the latest internet enabled features including a room and night entrance key sent to the Hotel Schani app on your phone Brilliant Location perfect for anyone arriving by train with any easy 5 minute walk from the station 
354521,Hotel Schani Wien, the mattrass was to soft and the place would also deserve better bedclothes even if 100 polyester it d be better quality , the breakfast was excellent and I enjoyed the fresh design and the whole design concept
354522,Hotel Schani Wien, Before we arrived I had been looking forward to using the hotel app which allows you to unlock your room door using your phone The app downloaded but didn t work at all inspite of multiple attempts to validate my mobile The air conditioning did not work even though the window was closed as per the instructions and the room was stiflingly hot We politely reported the problem after the first night No apology was offered and although the reception staff said the maintenance staff would take a look at it the problem persisted for our entire four night stay The only way to get relief from the heat was to open the window yet the noise from the street traffic kept us awake most of the night While there were some nice interactions with some staff members in general we found the customer service to be very impersonal For example we weren t thanked for our custom or asked whether we had enjoyed our stay during the check out , The Hotel Schani Wien is in an excellent location just a five minute walk from the Central Train Station with a tram to the city centre right outside the front door The interior is modern and funky with an eclectic selection of seating options in the foyer a library and computing facilities A major plus was being able to leave our luggage securely in the basement lockers prior to check in and after we checked out freeing us up to really make use of all our time in the city The bed was extremely comfortable and the room brilliantly designed with ample storage for clothes suitcases etc Personally we really liked the shower in the room concept you can always pull the curtain across for privacy if needed We had no issue with the lack of tea and coffee making facilities as you can buy them in the cafe downstairs and bring them up to your room Likewise the lack of safe was not a problem as we knew about this in advance and had bought a padlock for our suitcase It was especially appreciated that we had clean towels every day and the overall cleanliness was superb The free wi fi was also a major plus helping us to keep our roaming data usage to a minimum 
354523,Hotel Schani Wien, 1 Amenities They dont have a phone to speak to the reception So to speak to the reception you have to physically go to the reception desk 2 Air conditioner Interlocked and does not works properly You have to keep the window open and unfortunately the window cannot be opened completely 3 Area Away from the city centre but nonetheless has a good connectivity , Pros 1 Location 10 minutes walk form Wein Hbf station Also in front of the hotel the bus number 69A stops which takes you directly to the Wein Hbf station and which in turn is connected to the Wein Metro 2 Rooms They are of contemporary style and was very neat and clean 3 Staff Reception was helpful and courteous 
354524,Hotel Schani Wien, We missed having a telephone in the room I find it difficult to find something that we did not like , The beds were extremely comfortable The staff exceptionally friendly and very helpful at all times It is a perfect package deal 
354525,Hotel Schani Wien, There are no tv channels or subtitles in English except for the news channel , The location it was right by a tram stop so easy access into town and other attractions
354526,Hotel Schani Wien, My room faced the courtyard which can be noisy but closing window helps Construction weekdays starts at 7 30am so be prepared to be woken up by scraping on concrete mid Sept 2016 Only 4 hangers which wasn t enough for me No safe fridge or luggage rack which would have been nice Didn t like no dedicated reception bartenders servers also run reception Walked into mirror at far wall of smallish elevator more than once Hallways are dark spooky dark paint on walls ceiling no windows in hallway creates atmosphere of get to your room quick lock the door feeling Liquid soap for shower but no facecloths or such to wash , As mentioned by other reviewers room design nice for one person or couple but not for friends sharing open shower area does have curtain for privacy while in shower but that blocks access to the toilet Tram stop D outside door which is extremely handy for getting to the sites in town Very close to main train station Hauptbanhof and the shops therein Didn t try the breakfast as it was 12 Euros which seemed pricey to me 
354527,Hotel Schani Wien, None, The first day we had an air conditioned problem The manager was contacted and he was very grateful to meet with us explained the cause and assigned another room We are glad that this problem happened in this hotel because the management was very responsive and concerned about the problem I appreciate this gesture by the manager Reason I strongly recommend this hotel The location is excellent since it is located near the train station And the tram starts the run in front of the hotel In ten minutes you can be in the historic part of town that is about 8 miles from the hotel The same tram will take you to wine gardens which are at the end of the tram run The rooms are very efficient comfortable and well designed A bonus is the breakfast after a month in Europe we found this hotel has one of the best breakfasts 
354528,Hotel Schani Wien, Restaurant choice at night, Unusual pop art style hotel Was funky and fun Also within close proximity to train station and old town bus stops right outside which is convenient 
354529,Hotel Schani Wien, Not automatic to enter the parcking and you can not add things to your room count you have to pay everything extra in reception Plus at checkin even if you ave a person in front of you you are asked to make it yourself in a tablet but it didnt work and they have to do it traditional way,No Positive

354535,Hotel Schani Wien, Breakfast was extra staff was almost non existent very automated check in which works but does not feel anything like old Vienna i e no personality , Clean next to main train station very modern with some fun design features 
354536,Hotel Schani Wien, The AC didn t work It would have been better to have a phone in the room in case one wants to ask the reception about anything however it was great dealing with them in person and they helped with all the questions we asked about certain places around the city and sight seeing tours , The staff are super nice and helpful Excellent location 
354537,Hotel Schani Wien, Facility for hot drink in your room only thing I can think of , We asked for a quiet room and it was superb It s a lovely modern hotel close to metro with tram outside that takes 7 minutes to get into the centre Breakfast is fabulous fresh juice fresh fruit juicer excellent coffee bread really good variety and quality wide choice of cheeses and cold meats All you can ask for and very friendly helpful staff 
354538,Hotel Schani Wien, Drinks quite expensive Public toilet on the basement level which is quite unusual No phone in the room , Hotel is only a 5 minute walk from Vienna central station There is a tram and bus stop outside the hotel with great links to the city centre 10 mins 
354539,Hotel Schani Wien, AC was a problem on the warm nights we had it didn t work properly and you have no control over it in the room Breakfast ok plenty of choice of items but the quality wasn t what you d expect , Cool hotel lobby and room intelligently decorated and organised Reasonably priced and great location near to train station

354545,Hotel Schani Wien, No fridge in the room Strangely decorated didn t feel cosy or very welcoming but served a purpose , Good location right next to the D tram line that goes through the centre of town Also near the station where there was also a spar 
354546,Hotel Schani Wien, Nothing to fault , Loved sitting on our balcony looking at the view along the river to the old town Room was a great size with a nice bathroom Bed was comfy Breakfast had a good selection 
354547,Hotel Schani Wien, Why the rank of this hotel is 4 star 1 The room does not have a safe telephone minibar and coffee tea maker These are the four main things that distinguish a high rank hotel from a low rank hotel The room does not have anything that a room in 3 or 4 star hotel should have 2 The Hotel does not have a gym I m still wondering why is it a 4 star hotel 3 The breakfast is for 12 euros and very basic The nearest cafe to the hotel is opposite to the main train station and you can find the same breakfast for only 7 9 Euros 4 Most important thing is the closet isn t practical The closet is a collection of open boxes put together the part for hanging clothes is very narrow 5 There is no chair in the room The chair like thing is implanted in the sofa which made neither the sofa nor the chair is comfortable or practical to use 6 I didn t like the colors of the furniture The colors of the bed bathroom are light brown dark gray and white which is nice combination and neat but then you look around and you will see blue yellow and pink boxes in the closet side which made everything ugly and disturbing Overall the room does not have a good taste except for the bath toilet sections 7 The value is too little for the money , 1 The check in out is very easy 2 The storage area is very convenient 3 The stuff are all helpful 4 They have scooters you can rent for free 5 The area is quiet 6 The hotel is 6 minutes away from the main train station which is convenient if you are coming by train However if you are coming from the airport then you are going to change two trains to reach the hotel 
354548,Hotel Schani Wien, Nothing really, I liked some of the quirky touches but these were not at the expense of comfort which was excellent design was well thought through and everything worked Breakfast was excellent and staff very helpful Location five minutes from Hauptbahnhof afforded ready access to just about anywhere

354555,Hotel Schani Wien, Nothing at all , Absolutely everything Gorgeous hotel Very professional and helpfull staff delicious breakfast large shower cabin location etc 
354556,Hotel Schani Wien, The cleaning staff seems to be a bit overzealous We stayed for two nights only and left some of our laundry on the floor and the cleaning staff decided to consider it as trash and so we came back to find our dirty underwear gone D I don t want to be a nit picker but it might be a good idea to add an additional question in the booking form to ask guests if they actually want to have their rooms cleaned daily or not , The design and the range of convenient solutions available to guests were superb the breakfast served was great and the customer service was really nice and always super helpful Plus the modern in room technological solutions offered were also fun to use 
354557,Hotel Schani Wien, Housekeeping did not knock just barged in at 7am then walked out giggling Night receptionist was a bit rude but day staff were nice , Comfortable bed clean rooms and lovely design

354560,Hotel Schani Wien, Parking facilities bigger selection of breakfast which is not included in a price and there was no possibility to choose the option while booking , Good starting point to explore the city station just a few meters away I love the mix of modern and classic breakfast ok for a short stay Self booking 
354561,Hotel Schani Wien, should add a curtain door for the bathroom currently it s transparent and see through, very near to central station artistic hotel and we had a special room with the double bed on the top staff very friendly modern hotel design
354562,Hotel Schani Wien, Check in app was problematic to see up before arrival so was more bother than simply checking in at the hotel itself , Decor was interesting in a good way Out of the centre but close to main station and metro so getting around was easy 
354563,Hotel Schani Wien, Although they had free wifi they must have some restrictions for no WIFI calling although they claimed not My phone wifi calling has worked everywhere else , The room was very clean with plenty of plugs and USB ports They have air conditioning and it worked Very close to the metro station 
354564,Hotel Schani Wien, I did not like the bedding There is only one comforter and no sheet So It got very hot at night and woke me up twice drenched in sweat , I liked the decor It is modern and eclectic 
354565,Hotel Schani Wien, They didnt have enough space for luggage and the staff initially wanted to charge us extra for an early check in and backed down after we fought , The room was nicely designed and it was close to a major railway station The staff made attempts to help us out on occasion
354566,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, Wonderful hotel Perfectly clean very friendly staff at reception Nice breakfast which is optional so you can choose either to sleep longer or to have a breakfast Very good location very close to a tram station and 5 min to go to Main Railway station also metro Next time I will certainly stay in Schani again Thank you guys 
354567,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and always ready to answer any queries We had the maisonette room which was ideal for one adult and two children The breakfast was well worth the money and kept us going for most of the morning 
354568,Hotel Schani Wien, Staff could be much more polite In the room for 3 the double bed is accessible through rack stairs which can be cumbersome , The location suits those who want to be near the main railway station

354571,Hotel Schani Wien, Area needs more restaurant options Looks marred by construction but that will change , Location near train station and right next to end of tram line Good breakfast 
354572,Hotel Schani Wien, 1 Rooms were uncomfortable and not ideally designed for all ages Stairs etc 2 Staff was unfriendly and felt like they were doing a favour to us for the most part Though one of the guys was good 3 Quite expensive considering it s so far away from the centre , Nice design to the rooms and nice lobby area to chill out in 
354573,Hotel Schani Wien, The location was not good for us although it was easy to get around by public transport I would like to have had tea and coffee making facilities with in the room Not sure I like the shower and sink being part of the main room , The bed was really comfortable and it was easy to control the temperature in the room 
354574,Hotel Schani Wien, A bit too expensive comparing to the facilities and service There is no telephone in the room to contact reception They did not provide standard toiletries such as toothpaste we had to go down to the reception and waited a long time just to be told that no toothpaste can be given for free The price of the room should be lower or at least add free breakfast into the room rate , Location 
354575,Hotel Schani Wien, Room style like trendy student hostel but quite functional , Excellent value breakfast Nice outdoor area and inside or area Although not central and hence less expensive convenient public transport access tr outside door metro 7 minutes walk main train station 5 minutes walk 
354576,Hotel Schani Wien, Room not quite finished ceiling not painted , Very close to the Hauptbahnhof with all its facilities in addition to trains Tram just outside for direct access to the central area Very comfortable bed Small room but OK for a couple of nights 
354577,Hotel Schani Wien, Did not care to climb a ladder to reach the queen bed in a loft no privacy shower and non complimentary buffet breakfast provided for 9 Euros , Comfortable bed clean modern hotel close to train station and public transportation quiet working lift to reach upper floors 
354578,Hotel Schani Wien, The breakfast is too expensive there is no phone in the room , Beautifully designed hotel very close to the main train station Very well informed and friendly staff

354581,Hotel Schani Wien, They did not provide lotion Breakfast is a bit pricey at 10Euro but they have a lot of options , Liked the bed and the shower They provided shower gel Nice lobby They can book your airport transfer The train station is in the area w a bakery cafe the tram is close too 
354582,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, Modern and stylish but yet atmospheric hotel with imaginatively decorated rooms and common area The hotel is located next to the main railway station You can easily reach the city centre by tram D which has its terminus right outside the hotel The rooms are clean well equipped and comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful Luggage room with lockers Don t miss the buffet breakfast that is great value for money Definitely a good place to stay in Vienna 
354583,Hotel Schani Wien, Though right across from train station the hotel situated behind other larger ones could easily be missed without its sign being prominently displayed or shown The neighbourhood is presently a bit messy with lots of construction going on , The proximity of the hotel to train station and streetcar terminus was just right Staff was friendly and pleasant 
354584,Hotel Schani Wien, breakfast costs extra not much to do around the hotel in the evening if that s something you want, tram right outside the door takes you to city center in 10 minutes for 2 20eur new building in a modern business area which is very quiet since doesn t seem to be fully complete great after a busy day in the city feels very safe since there is just no one there in the evening most modern hotel I ve been to self checkin self checkout open door with your phone smart TV with YouTube etc stylish probably one of the best picks for that money considering the crazy Vienna pricelevel
354585,Hotel Schani Wien, They don t have a lot of food on their lobby bar menu but staff helped us order in a pizza and we ate it at the lobby bar , This property was clean and efficiently designed tram was right outside Perfect for a 2 night stay in Vienna I appreciated the details in design and like hotel rooms which are not carpeted It is good value 20 30 minute drive from the airport and a quick 5 10 min tram ride into the beautiful Vienna city centre I would stay here again 
354586,Hotel Schani Wien, Bit far out of the centre , Hip stylish and modern hotel about a mile south of the good stuff Staff were amazing they gave us a bottle of prosecco to celebrate our anniversary Breakfast was excellent loved the juicer Some good restaurants nearby check tripadvisor 
354587,Hotel Schani Wien, open style bathroom Hotel insisting to take the full charge 1 day prior to arrival as this is how the computer system is set up I happened to re read the terms a day before and had to call the hotel as soon as possible as I wanted to pay with a different card and not the one used when booking the hotel I was just in time , Location not too far from Vienna HBF helpful staff who spoke good english Allowed slightly early check in as the room was ready 
354588,Hotel Schani Wien, At the far end to the train station near construction sites There are at least 3 hotels closer to the main train station However you can still enter by the far end of the station leading you directly to the platforms but not the ticket counter shops and restaurants , Newly built and with modern design hotel not for the old fashioned tourists Room is considered huge given the price Room key is placed on the wall adjacent to the handle Shower area is divided by glass only beware if not very close friends sharing the room Staff is helpful but not very enthusiastic Check in is done by yourself through an iPad Breakfast is excellent provided the price 
354589,Hotel Schani Wien, The hotel is situated in a new steel and glass urban development that is still not finished The streets are empty and it doesn t feel like Vienna at all The only advantage of the location is its proximity to the rail station It is close to a tram station which gets you to downtown Vienna in 10 15 minutes However you can t really walk outside your door and feel like you re in Vienna , A comfortable room and the buffet breakfast was great So was the lounge area bar in the lobby 
354590,Hotel Schani Wien, Poor ventilation The room we stayed in no 422 has no false ceiling and we could see the grazed ceiling No channels in English except few news channels , The bed was quite comfortable Very close to Vienna central station which is 18 mins direct train away from Vienna airport Has a tram station right outside the hotel 
354591,Hotel Schani Wien, None, The hotel design answered the question of how to achieve most comfort with least space and material The room isn t too big yet so feels so convenient and spaceful The bed and linen are so sweet and comfortable The staff are very helpful Public space is chic and comfy I didn t want to leave Location is good with tram D directly at your door step I m a fan 
354592,Hotel Schani Wien, The area is under construction with few restaurants around , Very modern and fun Good breakfast including a smoothie machine Great design Tram stop right outside 
354593,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, Great location if you need to be near the main train station Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and great idea to pre check in via your phone Excellent choice 
354594,Hotel Schani Wien, Just one not so happy point of customer service but this was due to the lady being busy with another customer , I loved that the atmosphere of the hotel is open and welcoming It is inviting and one can easily talk to others on their travels The room is very well designed the bed is so comfortable Breakfast is very varied and so are the meals available at the bar Also the main reason I stayed at this hotel was due to the close proximity to the train station 
354595,Hotel Schani Wien, Location Menu is limited could and must do better Hotel can offer tourist tours Broken glass found , Self service Hotel style is something new Staff explained ways to get to destination Bags can be kept at the basement self service Friendy staff
354596,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, A very modern hotel The D tram stop is in front of the hotel so it s so convenient to go to the city center Near the central station too The staff are all accommodating to our needs 
354597,Hotel Schani Wien, There were no slippers in the room, Location is great for its closeness to public transportation I like the breakfast clenliness design of the hotel 
354598,Hotel Schani Wien, No water kettle no fridge would have been nice No curtain in front of bathroom shower cabin , Peaceful location modern and clean out of ordinary d cor Quality of breakfast very good nice staff Garden will be nice in 2 3 years time Tram and metro close by Cozy feeling 
354599,Hotel Schani Wien, I could have used a kettle in the room instead of having to go down for hot water The wi fi kept on cutting off and when i booked it was really unclear that breakfast was not included , very nicely designed and the automation of check in makes things very fast and easy it is quite close to the main train station so getting to and from the city center is quite easy
354600,Hotel Schani Wien, Toilet is just toilet It would be nice to have a shelf or something I almost drop by iPhone into it , A couple of surprises than typical hotel As I walking in I thought this is not the hotel lobby but a cafe almost going out of the door in searching the right lobby but was greeted by someone confirming this is the lobby Another surprise when I walked in the room the interior of my room was different from most other typical hotel with its unique decor of many special designs A bucket as waste basket too clean to be a trash can a wood box for luggage stool too strong for any travel luggage but at right size a long wood seat or couch next to window with a coffee table too good for an afternoon escape with coffee and a book in hand not to mention two metal stands act as bedside table ps still didn t comprehend how it should be worked Morning breakfast is another comfortable fresh apple carrot banana etc ready for self made morning veggie drink Other typical breakfast item are there scramble egg ham not too many selections but quite plenty Most importantly it is at a very convenient location near Vienna Train station and U Bahn 
354601,Hotel Schani Wien, They asked me an extra charge 30 euros for entering in advance in the room the first morning This never happened to me usually the hotels allow the entrance as soon as the room has been cleaned The breakfast is really good but too expensive When I went to the check out they told me that my credit card had already been charged I did not allowed them to use my credit card I gave the card number to Booking only in case of no show but never allow them to any other payment I was ready to pay with cash I think they should ask at the check in which payment method the guest prefers , Great and clean room modern forniture Staff was really kind and helpful also if I disagree with the hotel payment rules 
354602,Hotel Schani Wien, EVEN THOUGH THE CHECKOUT TIME IS AT NOON THE MAID WOKE ME UP AT NINE And after this she tried three times if my room is empy and tally Do not disturb is probably too much conventional for this hotel there was nothing similar Horrible parody to architecture and design Table without space for 15 inch notebook and bottle of Coke and too far from the waal outlet The hotel is designed only for appearance about functionality architects knows nothingt Two hours with the notebook was painful experience Noisy air conditioning could not be turned off ,No Positive
354603,Hotel Schani Wien, Although the tram is it front it s a bit far from everything So to go anywhere you have to take the 2 30 euro tram ride unless you want to walk 35 mins which is totally doable just not every day twice a day , The hotel was very moden and room was spacious Tram D which takes you into the city is also located right out front so it s convenient to get into the inner old city 
354604,Hotel Schani Wien, Stupid concept looks to have been designed by a 12 year old child Aircondition and coffee maker did not work Would never consider staying there again you should look for some place else, Leaving
354605,Hotel Schani Wien, No shelves in the room to put your things in One shelf occupied by a tablet with fixed charger that shows only hotel webpages i didnt get what was the use of it I would much prefer to place my t shirts there The extra bed in the 3bed room is far less comfy than the main one which is superb The AC seemed to do nothing the room was way too hot even in was set to so we had our window open all the time , Amazing breakfast very funny elevator nice design excelent bed Located just few meters from Hauprbahnhof 4min walk tram terminus to citi just in front of entrance very nice employees 
354606,Hotel Schani Wien, The rooms are furnished in a very stylish way which includes too many colors The ceiling is pure concrete If you like such a style you will love it Personally I felt it s too much There was not much fresh vegetables at the breakfast except cucumber and tomatoes The location is nice but with constructions around and a poor view on train tracks the price is much too high , The hotel is very new and modern and the rooms are very stylish Breakfast includes a huge variety of food and fresh drinks Location is 5min from the Vienna central station and there is a tram station in front of the hotel You can get to Karlsplatz and the inner town in 10min 
354607,Hotel Schani Wien, Nothing at all, Everything about this hotel was great I checked in via an app on my phone so was able to go straight to my room when I arrived no need for any checkin with staff Some reviews say this hotel is a little out of the centre of the city I disagree The location is fantastic The tram literally collects you at the front door and takes you right into the heart of things in no time and they run pretty much all day and night meaning you have a peaceful nights sleep with no noise from late night bars and restaurants etc I had tickets for the opera and one of the tram stops is right outside the opera house which itself is in the heart of Vienna All in all I couldn t fault this place one bit 
354608,Hotel Schani Wien, Maybe too far from the old city However the tram station lies right in front of the hotel , The hotel is almost brand new Although the room is small everything needed is in the room Location is good if you travel from Wien HBF 
354609,Hotel Schani Wien, I booked this hotel with regards to the information about hotel parking had to leave the car and the lagguage for one day while taking a trip to Vienna Unfortunately the hotel did not have the parking and I had to use the public one On top of that the personel told me the price was 17 EUR while it was 39 EUR in fact Not nice , Modern design comfortable standard room good breakfast 
354610,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, Modern quirky decor Super friendly staff Comfy beds huge walk in shower Great buffet breakfast variety Excellently located outside main train station and tram into city centre

354613,Hotel Schani Wien, Nothing , Room was spotless and beautifully designed with fun and lightness Breakfast was best ever range and quality Staff were friendly and helpful 
354614,Hotel Schani Wien, Nothing, As we were travelling with our teenage son we thought a maisonette type room at Hotel Schani would be ideal for us We liked the look of the hotels quirky features on the web site and were not let down on arrival We arrived early so our room was not ready but the left luggage facility allowed us to store our bags and head straight into town The transport options are great bus and trams from the hotel entrance and Hauptbahnhof station and Sudtiroler underground a 5 minute walk away There is a lot of construction taking place in the area but even with that and with trains trams and buses running past the hotel we had no problems with noise which is great for light sleepers like me The rooms are well equipped and include an nespresso coffee machine One word of warning about the maisonette room we thought the upper half would house the single bed for our son but it is the double that is up there so mum and I had to brave the steps every night and morning while the boy enjoyed the main living space but I must say I have never slept so well We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Schani and would stay there again 
354615,Hotel Schani Wien,No Negative, we really liked Schani s proximity to Haupbahnhof Regarding architecture i m a fan of the industrial design features and Schani Hotel is such a great acomodation not only because of this We really recommend this hotel for travellers Thank you Schani Hotel 
354616,Hotel Schani Wien, The hotel is located in the area close to the new Vienna Central station The area is currently heavily under construction and therefore may feel a bit impersonal and unfinished no bars caf s nice restaurants or shops nearby Nevertheless we had no issues related to noise from the construction sites I guess that once the neighbouring building are completed it will be a nice altough modern an not typically Viennese area , Brand new hotel with comfortable rooms Good choice for breakfast at extra price Overall very good money for value Located close to the new Vienna Central Station with very good transport connection to the city center Quick check in and out and possibility to safely store luggage also after checking out

354626,Hotel Schani Wien, The wifi was a bit slow , Really great place clean modern friendly even has USB chargers in the wall You don t even need a keycard since you can unlock you room with their mobile app The bed was great I m a very tall guy and they had very comfortable 220cm long beds a big plus The caf in the lobby is a great place for relaxation after a day of sight seeing Location is very good right next to Hauptbanhof There was a construction next door but the sound isolation is great we couldn t hear a thing but they offered that they can give us another room is the noise is too much The had a really nice map on one of the walls drawn in the hotels style It helped us to plan our tour

354629,Hotel Schani Wien, The whole area is a building site But the D tram stops right outside the door and goes directly into the centre However No one told me so I walked every day past the homeless refugee feeding point and got the U ban from the station At night the walk is not nice Someone should ha e told about the tram , Very clean and new interesting design 
354630,Hotel Schani Wien, self checkin is a clumpsy gimmick when there is a person required to help out and there is a person managing the counter always anyways Just takes a bit off the experience , Unique style and interior modern stylish yet playful bright Breakfast
354631,Hotel Schani Wien, The internet was sometimes a bit on a slower side , The interior design is great We loved the layout of the room every detail was obvously very well thought of the shower curtain electricity sockets etc Not to even mention the bed the most comfortable hotel bed I ve ever had True breakfast costs 9 per person but it s totally worth it you have everything there everything And D Tram stopping almost at the entrance dream

354633,Hotel Schani Wien, Self check in didn t work at almost every step the staff had to intervene resulting in a painfully lengthy procedure Construction works around the hotel made navigation even for pedestrians somewhat difficult , Brand new hotel at a good location clean and calm rooms with super trendy design tasty breakfast and helpful staff Super value for money 
354634,Hotel Schani Wien, The area near central train station is definitely not the best in the city , The hotel is quite nice and modern with quite cozy design Close to central station

354636,Hotel Schani Wien, You have no refrigerator to keep cold drink and fruits with no phones in the room without dinners , you have a good breakfast with well staff and fair clean towels and room
354637,Hotel Schani Wien, The bathroom was not a seperate room you only had a curtain for privacy The hotel was also not close to the city centre You had to take a tram to get there This was not problem for us because the tram stop was about 20 meters away but something other travellers should be aware of , great breakfast close to tram close to main train station clean rooms comfortable beds easy check in and checkout
354638,Hotel Schani Wien, Nothing maybe I could suggest breakfast to be included in the hotel fare however 10 is very worth the price , The hotel is located next to the tram stop and the main train station it s very easy to reach the city center I love the hotel concept very modern style and minimalist Breakfast is amazing room is comfortable and staff is helpful when needed 
354639,Hotel Schani Wien, The hotel is in the middle of a building site as the whole area is new and under development The area is very desolate and no cabs knew it or could find it Trying to find the right exit from the UBahn was really confusing , The breakfast was great the rooms were lovely and spacious and the staff was very very nice 
354640,Hotel Schani Wien, Do not be surprised many new buildings are being built in the area but we could not hear any noise in our room , Great interior green and modern good location next to the main station but no noise from the trains at all You will enjoy your stay there

354647,Hotel Schani Wien, It could have some AC in the room it had some ventilation system that did not lower the temperature well, Good value good location 10 minutes away from downtown by tram 
354648,Hotel Schani Wien, In the middle of a building area with the building works starting at 6 30 am Don t pay extra for the courtyard view as its not finished yet and you end up looking over the building sites, Great hotel located next to Vienna s main railway station so easy access for travellers Bit quirky on the decor but because its well done it feels comfortable Fab breakfasts
354649,Hotel Schani Wien, Our room was too hot the air con didn t seem to work so we informed a member of staff The first member of staff advised us to open a window obviously we d already done that but this really didn t make a difference as it was warm outside and the window barely opened as it was Eventually we complained again and were moved rooms but I m not sure that the air con really worked in there as well Second member of staff was really great and overall our experience was very good but can t imagine what it would have been like in the middle of summer as it was only between 20 and 25 degrees when we were there and I m usually always freezing , Good location by the train station tram and U Bahn Really modern and well designed hotel Friendly staff members bar seems to be open 24 7 Easily located big sign on the side of the hotel Internet TV and the map on the wall of Vienna were really helpful Would recommend 
354650,Hotel Schani Wien, N A everything was great, very modern and young hotel lobby and breakfast area feel like a nice coffee shop instead of sterile hotel amazing breakfast nespresso coffee machine around the hotel are few building sites but didnt hear a thing although I am easily woken up definitely will stay there again on next business trip

354656,Hotel Schani Wien, Cold behaving of the reception s staff by totally relaying to the automated check in system and invoice sending via email Moreover I was unhappy with very unusual practice of charging of my Master card immediately during the check in but the invoice I received via email 2 days later and 5 hours after I left the hotel The invoice was confusing with several unclear items but unfortunately I couldn t complain since I was already 5 hours away from the hotel In addition they charged my Master card with correct amount but 4 times in smaller chunks where 3 time in Euro currency and 1 time in HRK currency This was very confusing to me once i got Master card listing from my bank , Very creative design of the hotel in the industrial style It is impressive and beautiful Clean room very good breakfast WiFi worked with no issues
