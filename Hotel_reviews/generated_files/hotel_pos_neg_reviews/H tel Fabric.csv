147203,H tel Fabric, I couldn t stay longer , What a truly wonderful hotel The staff are so helpful and friendly the decor of the rooms and lobby area so inviting The lobby felt more like a large living room where guests could relax rather than just come and go The honest bar is such a lovely touch There are several fantastic restaurants very close to the hotel 2 that I visited were on the same street Highly recommend 
147204,H tel Fabric, The room we booked wasn t available for the 2 nights so we were allocated a higher grade room for the first night and then changed to the one we booked Slightly inconvenient , Liked the style of the hotel which was based on the history of the building Very quiet 
147205,H tel Fabric, I wish there had been a few more tables at breakfast time after 2 weeks away and self catering most breakfasts we were going to have a splurge and eat at the hotel unfortunately there were no tables free so we had to go to a bad cafe first world problems I know , loved this hotel we only had one night but I would definitely go back The room was the duplex with the queen bed upstairs and 2 singles downstairs I think it would have been hard with 4 of us in the room for any longer as it was compact Bathroom was great fabulous water pressure comfy beds excellent staff really friendly and who doesn t love an honesty bar free tea and coffee and snacks etc always available in the lobby 
147206,H tel Fabric,No Negative, Excellent hotel facilities Well designed and clean The staff is super friendly and efficient The hotel is in 11ap so a metro communication required to get to main attractions but the metro is near by There is a great restaurants in the neighborhood

147211,H tel Fabric, the pillows I ve should asked at the reception for another kind adapted to my necessities , It has been a pleasure to stay in this Hotel We have chosen this hotel for the situation close to les Marais by walking distance and the restaurants lacavedel insolite auxdeuxamis LeBistroM ricourt chambelland and nice bars in the Oberkampf area La Mercerie Caf Charbon The staff is really friendly the free coffee 24h in the cafeteria is a must and the spa facilities are very convenient clean and professional We will definitely come back to this boutique hotel for another weekend in Paris as there were many other things to do and enjoy 
147212,H tel Fabric,No Negative, Amazing service really lovely touches including the welcome gift of L Occitane products the free coffee and cakes 24 7 really comfortable bed and great breakfast
147213,H tel Fabric, There was absolutely nothing I didn t like , The hotel is beautiful the staff made all guests feel they were deserving of the best possible service and the neighborhood is real Paris I stayed there 4 nights while visiting Paris solo From the minute they opened the door for me until they all said good bye I felt I was in a special place with the highest quality standards 
147214,H tel Fabric, The only suggestion we would have is to add a Parisian breakfast croissant juice coffee and a yogurt to the breakfast option We found the current option pricey for our liking We might suggest to add the lower cost option and handle it on an honor system as you do for the bar, The staff were fantastic very friendly and helpful in planning our itinerary for the days we were there We really appreciated the free upgrade We loved the reception area with its honour bar and the comfortable chairs It was a great spot to have a drink before or after dinner 
147215,H tel Fabric, Low ceiling in the junior suite Stairs access to the junior suite The design of the breakfast dining room could have been nicer But still it s a nice place, We were at the Junior suite Nice room large bed although the ceiling is a little low The access to the room is It very comfortable as you must go from the eleventh through some stairs Breakfast is good They have a nice fitness room Overall a nice place

147220,H tel Fabric, Nothing the hotel was great and I can see why reviews were so for this hotel , The free coffee and tea the overall friendliness of the staff the location in terms of accessibility to all the main sights the room itself was the perfect size and the breakfast again was well worth it 
147221,H tel Fabric, The area wasn t good for us as we were constantly in cabs getting to where we wanted to be We always seem to have a multitude of hand towels and never enough towels in the bathroom, It s a very cool little boutique hotel The staff were outstanding

147224,H tel Fabric, There was only one slight slip up with the steam room where we had reserved it in the morning and we went down to find it hadn t been turned on But the staff quickly apologized and turned it on for us and it was ready to use within 30 minutes , The staff really stood out at Hotel Fabric They gave us excellent recommendations and were incredibly friendly and willing to help a service that we sometimes struggle to find in Paris The room was absolutely lovely as was the steam room The coffee is complimentary all day long and the lobby is a very nice space to have your morning coffee Finally the location is absolutely perfect for anyone who wants to be out of the touristic center but still close to the action Le Marais Republique and the Canal Saint Martin are very close by for the most trendy and hipster spots 
147225,H tel Fabric, We needed a meeting room to interview a candidate but we had to do so in the loby which worked out fine because it was a quiet period but would of been nice to have some privacy , The atmosphere is very calm and homely The breakfast is very well assorted and it is lovely to be able to help yourself to a the drink at any time as if you were at home

147229,H tel Fabric, Very hot in the hotel so perhaps heating needs to be adjusted, The staff st the hotel were so nice and friendly and nothing was to much for them I would definately recommend this hotel as it is near to the metro as well so you can get all over Paris Look for the hidden gems of the bistros near the hotel as so much better than the known restaurants
147230,H tel Fabric, I would have enjoyed to have a small coffee tea corner inside the room although this is more of a personal preference than an actual need All was great , The quality of the space and the bath body care products Also I loved the sauna

147235,H tel Fabric, The man at the reception asked me several times whether I was alone or with a person I was alone in the room however there was a friend with me at the reception whom I was going to go to dinner with Having booked a double room I cannot understand the irritating insistence When I came back at 11 pm the hotel door was closed A sign read Will be back in 5 minutes In a four star hotel this is not acceptable This design hotel chose to replace closets with wooden crates fine but why using the hookless coat hangers the antitheft ones Plastic glasses in the bathroom are a cheap option The desk is too small to work on No free bottled water , Good area unfortunately adjacent to where the November attacks took place I was kindly upgraded to a better quiet room Nice shower The lobby is very pleasant Good free Wi Fi 
147236,H tel Fabric,No Negative, Gr8 service We had a special anniversary request upon arrival which Fabric fixed fabulously close to everything gr8 help to be able to buy tickets to museums through them to cut down on the lines every evening after a day out on the town to be able to book the steam relax room loved the Honesty bar so clean comfy room breakfast We shall return
