157551,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, The building is difficult to recognize from the street Once found its not friendly going in through the gate and for some rooms like mine you need to go out again The elevator did not work , The room was clean
157552,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Lack of refreshments in rooms One bottle of water and two teabags Biscuits only on day one, Beds very comfortable Good room arrangement Lovely rainforest shower
157553,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, The lift was tiny , We felt very safe here the property was secure and close to many attractions Staff were extremely helpful We would recommend Timhotel to others and definitely stay here again 
157554,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, You could hear people in the hall coming in and out of the rooms , Great secure hotel tucked away right near the Moulin Rouge English speaking staff and the breakfast was good too
157555,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine,No Negative, The place was perfect probably the nicest hotel I have stayed at in Paris so close to transport and a reasonable walking distance to most things The rooms were a very decent size as were the bathrooms They were always pristinely cleaned and lovely and warm Couldn t recommend this place enough thanks for having me
157556,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Soundproofing in the room was pretty much non existent You could hear heels on the marble steps on the entrance and the person peeing next door unless you closed the door between your room and the bathroom exit door This was not a big deal but worth mentioning , The room was huge and super clean The location was great It was very noisy on the Saturday evening but you re in the middle of Paris and bohemians clearly live next door Bring your ear plugs But the place suited us down to the ground Close to the metro close to the shops Monoprix on the doorstep so we didn t include Breakfast and it wasn t an issue Coffee machine in the room was great We bought more milk and coffee pods to keep well stocked 
157557,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, They told me by mail that I will have a big room with bed 200 200 and then we come and they gave us a small room with bed 140 200 and we had to pay 50 extra for a baby 1 year who sleeps with us Wasnt comfortable at all DISSAPOINTTED , Stuff was friendly
157558,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Could have done with more hangers more milks for tea biscuits being replaced minor things though On check out day the cleaning staff opened our room door 4 times to try and get in to clean before 12pm which was a little annoying , Really comfortable bed thick duvet perfect temperature in the room Large bathroom amazing shower a heated towel rail Great blackout curtains too Reception staff were all lovely helpful Excellent value for money 
157559,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, The WiFi DOES NOT WORK Our devices couldn t even find a network at first and after we complained one device out of 4 connected but the signal was barely there This was a bit annoying in 2016 The TV was not working we had to struggle and dig around behind it to plug it in No big deal but not pleasant either The area is central and well connected but it s not the best neighborhood It s fine we didn t feel unsafe but if you re not used to big cities it can be disconcerting , The staff was very friendly and helpful the room was warm comfortable and very very clean The hotel is very well situated 
157560,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Nil , Very good quality 4 star hotel Room very clean and comfortable Very close to moulin rouge and metro Paid Parking under hotel but need to book Staff very helpful and spoke good english We had a nephew dancing at moulin rouge so stayed here It is the good and very safe end of the red light district Nice restaurants nearby and small supermarket down road towards MR 
157561,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Some staff members greeted us with a very friendly and courteous manner on our first stay October 21 to 23 On our second stay October 25 to 27 the person at the desk was politely unpleasant and the night person on the 26 was just great There was no heat in our room , Rooms were very comfortable 
157562,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, We had a slight issue in relation to an upgrade from standard to superior room miscommunication from hotel in relation to the upgrade cost Staff at reception were not helpful and quite rude when we tried to sort it out lady at check out actually insulted us and said we didn t think logically I wouldn t recommend upgrading to superior room very small mini bar with about 3 drinks and a bag of crisps and we only received one robe slippers between us Other than that the hotel was clean and nicely decorated , Bed was very comfortable and location was great only 2 minutes from nearest Metro station Maybe not a great location for families with young kids as lots of sex shops shows around Moulin Rouge area 
157563,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Nothing it was fantastic , This hotel was clean vibrant and had large rooms i e nothing what you usually expect in Paris While it is located on a main street which is slightly seedy given the area it has large gates and is set back off the main street by about a block You could not hear anything from the street Great bus underground connections Extremely clean bedrooms 
157564,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Our room was right above the restaurant so quote noisy , Even though hotel was based in a very busy area the set back location with private access was very quiet 
157565,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, The hotel is somewhat hidden , The staffs are very helpful and polite The rooms are spacious and clean The bathroom is comfortable and spacious Facilities in the room are good Just a stone throw away from the Moulin Rouge theatre near the Blanche underground train station 
157566,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, The lift was a little on the small side , Great location Room had a balcony with a great view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance The free wi fi was great The fridge and air con was very useful as it was so warm when I visited Short walk to the airport bus and the Metro 
157567,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine,No Negative, Location is good easy supermarket access good tube access It is by Moulin Rouge with a bit of a soho feel to it but the hotel is slightly away from this Don t be put off by other reviews for the area it s great for monmartre and a nice hotel from someone who stays away every week all over europe 
157568,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Even though it s very good I find breakfast at 15 50 euros per person a bit too expensive The wifi in the room was very weak and needed to sign in again everytime it turned off , The hotel is a quiet hotel in a very nice and busy area The room was very confortable and the breakfast excelent 
157569,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, They didn t have free or reduced rate parking, The staff was very welcoming friendly and helpful the hotel was clean the breakfast was good with a lot of options for anyone s diet and the location was very convenient 
157570,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Air conditioner did not work too well but fortunately we could open the window and get some really fresh Parisian air , Exceptionally clean room and bathroom Spacious bedroom and bathroom Due to travel down to southern France prior to our stay the hotel was very kind in allowing us to leave excess luggage until we returned a few days later Wonderful reception staff 
157571,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, I have nothing negative to say about the hotel breakfast was decent so no complaints , I was impressed with my room and felt it was a perfect size for me as I was travelling solo Reception staff were kind and very helpful especially Andrea she was lovely They were always willing to give a helping hand 
157572,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Wi Fi connection was bad Not enough parking area , The room was cozy and bathroom is related to the room size very big Bars and restaurants are very close to reach by foot 
157573,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, There were not much life in this hotel no bar no restaurant no place to chat to other guests My room was in a separate building away from the reception I was travelling alone and so would have liked the opportunity to meet other guests sadly this didn t happen on this trip , Staff were lovely and very helpful Livation was amazing especially for visiting moulin rouge and taking a nice walk up to Montmarte 
157574,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine,No Negative, This hotel is like home in Paris The staff is very nice and helpful the location is excellent the rooms are spacious and nicely decorated and the beds are super comfortable 
157575,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Some clients leaving the TV loud all night easily heard from our bedroom Luckily the staff at the reception was efficient enough to ask the noisy client to stop the TV , Nice and quiet excellent location Very efficient staff 
157576,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, On booking com they say you can not reserve parking but when we arrived we were told that we should have reserved and there is not enoughe room for our car One of the main reasons for booking this hotel was the parking The reception blames booking com and say they can not change it We also booked brunch on new years day but we walked out before we had anything to eat The restaurant cafetaria is below standard for a 4 hotel the food looked like it came straight out of a bag And we did not get what we orderd , The location is good just around the corner from the Subway the Moulin Rouge and the Sacre Coeur Room was clean bed was good but in room 1028 on the grond floor you can hear the Subway 
157577,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, On arrival with our baggages for 4 adult include 1 elderly no one from hotel help us at entrance drive in main gate Managing on our own and climbing up stairs to reach building entrance whilst receptionist relaxed sitting for our approach first impression is disappointment though the rest acceptable , Balcony view of Eiffel Tower top of one third tower 
157578,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, some stairs at the entrance so you need to carry luggages rather difficult to find the entrance is through a garage door, the room was huge for Paris availability of parking great location in Montmartre a few steps to Moulin Rouge
157579,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, you may experience great difficulty if you are traveling with luggage as you have to carry your luggage through stairs your self No lift in one section of the building No ramp for carrying the heavy luggage , staff is very good Location excellent
157580,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Be aware at checkout hotel had 30 euro added for use of phone in bedroom which we didn t use after some discussion they agreed to deduct it but since returning home it has still not been credited to my card Shower could have been better , Location onsite parking clean and safe
157581,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Everthing in this hotel was nice but I can recommend that It would be great if a staff could be sent to the gate to assist the passengers with their luggage as there are several stairs and a long distance from the gate entrance in the yard to the reception building , The location is amazing it is just 2 minutes walk from Moulin Rouge Also it is close to numerous restaurants and cafes The personnel are really helpful and friendly specially the lady chef at front desk The room was big and very comfortable The breakfast was ok buy it could improve by adding more veriety of food and beverages But I really enjoyed my stay over there 
157582,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine,No Negative, Perfect location for a night at Moulin Rouge which was just at the top of the road Could see Eiffel tower from hotel window which was lovely Clean safe welcoming hotel Would stay here again 
157583,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, It was a bit hard to find initially and google maps also has the location slightly off , As it was our honeymoon they provided a nice quiet room on the top floor and champagne to welcome us This was a nice touch 
157584,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine,No Negative, This hotel was in a fabulous position in the area of Monmatre Staff extremely helpful Very clean would recommend and if returning to Paris would stay again 
157585,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Wifi slow and sometimes hard to connect , Fantastic staff who helped in all ways Brilliant location Wonderful shower which is always a must and just around the corner from a French icon the moulin rouge Also the most wonderful bakery down the street 
157586,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, The area isn t family friendly at night While there is plenty of hustle and bustle there are many beggars and stripper massage sex shops in the vicinity around the hotel This is probably due to its location very close to the Moulin Rouge If you are visiting Paris for the first time the Blue line metro that this hotel is closest to is quite inconvenient I d say you d want to be closer to the orange or purple line for most of the main tourist attractions That said we are talking 10 15 minutes of metro travel inconvenience not hours Free Wifi is not very good , Room was very clean and comfy Staff were very helpful and set up a lot of taxis and transfers on our behalf and were spot on with price estimates Located within a minutes walk away from Blanche Metro and perfect if you want to visit the Moulin rouge less than 5min walk away Sacre Coeur is 1 metro stop away 
157587,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Ground floor roof overlooking patio where people chattered and smoked We asked for a room upstairs which was provided but it was much smaller and did not have slippers and dressing gowns as the first room But at least we could open the window for fresh air Breakfast was expensive and no reduction for children My son and family were also in the hotel so we all ate out , The helpful staff and cleanliness
157588,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine,No Negative, Never been to paris before so booked this hotel because it was near to a jimmy buffett concert Locaction was brilliant and plenty to see in the area 
157589,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Stairs to reception that I had to carry my luggage up and then down again because my room was in a separate building Same story next day when checking out The separate building had and elevator with announcements so until 11P and from 5A onwards I heard the doors closing first floor and what have you announcements Very annoying just switch off the sound The noise coming in from the streets are bad enough in Paris , Room size is spacious for Paris I could walk around my bet had a desk and chair and a cupboard Good size bathroom too Everything new and clean 
157590,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine,No Negative, Location was superb close to the action and also to the metro Accommodation was very safe and secure Staff were fantastic friendly and helpful Rooms were clean roomy and comfortable Breakfast was good 
157591,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Breakfasts were not great , We had the two interconnecting rooms which were amazing There was a fridge in both rooms our room had an en suite and there was a second larger bathroom There was a balcony in our room where we had a view of the Eiffel Tower The hotel is near the metro and Moulin Rouge When we arrived it was starting to get dark and I was not sure about the area lots of massage sex shops and we had a young child but the hotel was less than a minute away from the metro and is gated Once you are inside you could be anywhere it really is very clean and lovely It didn t bother us that we were not in a more child friendly area as we only saw the outside for about two minutes everyday For us the access to the rest of Paris and cleanliness were more important It was a very quiet room and we would not hesitate to recommend The only slight negative was the breakfasts were not great but we only ate there once as Paris is full of lovely places to eat 
157592,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Very small rooms Almost claustrophobic Very noisy you can hear those in the room next door as if they were in your room Not a 4 star hotel , Clean room great location
157593,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Internet connection in the room weak slow In the reception area ok The odd boys bars in the area But this does added to the charm I guess, Location Friendly staff Clean Nice sized rooms

157598,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, Nothing in particular, My friend and Iappreciate both the hearty welcome of the staff and were available for any information avoiding us to take taxis which was not necessary even we had to get up early to catch the train for Lisieux The hotel took precautions to make a photocopy of our passport It was kind on their part If I have to make a trip to Paris again I would like to stay at Tim Hotel I regret not to have booked it for 4 5 days 
157599,Timhotel Op ra Blanche Fontaine, More of a 3 star hotel not really 4 star Prices for nightly stay is quite expensive for what it is The hotel itself is quite simple , The location of the hotel was roughly 500m from the Moulin Rouge with a large variety and choices to restaurants and bars
