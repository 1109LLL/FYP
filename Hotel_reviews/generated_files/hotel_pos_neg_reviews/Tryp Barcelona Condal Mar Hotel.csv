305398,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The room had poor air conditioning until the last two days where the air conditioning started working properly There were mosquitoes in the bedroom which wasn t a good thing Also the mini bar refrigerator had poor quality as the drinks were not cold , The property had good size double bed and the facilities such as the bathroom was big The hotel was only a 10 15 min walk from the shopping centre and a 20 min walk to the beach 
305399,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Difficult to get to from airport Gym was very poor Not enough sun beds, The breakfast was very extensive Staff were super helpful Rooms were clean bathroom was nice beds were comfy good air conditioning Close to goodshopping centre Wi Fi excellent
305400,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, We wanted to have a late dinner at around 10pm it should be opened till 12pm Waited for a bar tender for around 15 minutes no one turned up i popped down to reception to ask if its closed or what They called some one and a bar tender turned up i told him that i want to order some food he said that i should wait seated at the table while hes come so we did for another 20 waiting and he never showed up ,No Positive
305401,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, I had requested kettle in the room but the hotel had no communication from booking Com and they flately declined it which I thought was very bad despite sending mail well in advance, Clean property except one odd incidence staff was excellent
305402,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Air con was terrible the rooms were so warm Guy who worked at the pool bar was very unfriendly and the one lunch we had there terrible Staff at breakfast looked miserable, Breakfast buffet was good Reception staff friendly
305403,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The location hotel looks completely different from pictures and pool area is very poor not clean not nice, Room service and stuff were very friendly Food was good drinks also
305404,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, I didn t like that it wasn t directly near any restaurants or the metro although they were only a 5minute walk away and that we didn t have a non smoking room allocated to us when we arrived They offered us their last three rooms one of which would ve cost an extra 80 euros We ended up staying in a smoking room although you never would ve noticed , The breakfast was excellent the staff very friendly the pool was never very busy even though we stayed in July and the room was nice spacious and clean Pay for the breakfast when you get there as its only 10 14 euros per day not 20 euros as advertised online 
305405,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, it is a 3 not four star hotel pool area not very appealing and under utilised small rooms in a poor location surrounded by industrial property and some apartment blocks and derelict buildings noshops no cafes no restaurants until you get to convention centre and even then very limited and average to bad offerings, very helpful friendly staff reasonably close to convention centre comfortable bed nice breakfast
305406,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Upon check in we were offered an upgrade to a room with certain facilities which we were made to believe that our room would already have for example bath robes kettle comfy bed However our room did not have these , The hotel was not too far from the airport we took a taxi as we did not want to get lost The taxi from the airport only cost 25 which we thought was quite good The hotel was as you saw in the pictures The room was clean and quite and a reasonable size The bathroom was also clean and a good size The room had a cleaning policy so if you wanted your sheets towels changed everyday they would as you to leave your towels on the bed however if you did not then you would leave them hanging The bed was very big and comfy As it was quite warm when we went we would leave the AC on in the room which meant leaving a key in the room to leave the electricity on The hotel was in a good area which was close to the beech and to a shopping centre However this Hotel was not close to central and despite not taking long to get into the centre if you don t like public transport or spending your money on taxis I would recommend staying closer We did not have an issue with using both taxis and public transport to get in and out of our hotel to the centre The ticket for the train was cheap and it was nice to explore the outskirts The staff were helpful 
305407,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Hotel located in old industrial area far from everything The nearist metro tram station is more than 750m After dark very unpleasant area for be outside , Staff profesional and kind Sandra was of great help for us 
305408,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The breakfast was a bit disappointing for us as we eat healthily and the breakfast for clearly for people who do not loads of bad calories bacon sausages eggs and many many biscuits cakes etc There was fresh fruit which was excellent but no greens e g cucumbers peppers lettuce etc just tomatoes which we liked We were however very happy about the soya milk serves hot too for breakfast with coffee Thank you Generally 9 10 so not bad at all , We liked the location as it was close to the office we worked and it a quiet residential area not far from shops bars and also the coast great for running The sauna and gym were good too so was the rooftop pool excellent Some of the staff were amazing others could learn to smile more but then this is typical for Barcelona 
305409,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Reception was illogical Our Situation We got held up in the British Air fiasco at Heathrow airport in London We had to stay a couple extra nights in London until we were able to get a flight out We had made a non refundable non cancellable reservation at the hotel and called from London to inform the hotel that we were held up in London because of the British Air fiasco but that we were still coming and to hold our rooms The response was OK When we arrived the reception at the hotel stated they had cancelled our room but acknowledged our phone call They stated that even though our room was paid in full was non refundable and that we even called in advance to hold the rooms since we are still coming they stated that they still can and did cancel our rooms because we did not show up on the first date of the reservation After some arguing they agreed to honour our agreement but we had to pay extra for another room , Brunch was excellent
305410,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Older property with pallet like beds very hard to sleep on Four blocks from the shopping mall and 6 blocks to the beach No restaurant to speak of basically just coffee shop with 2 or 3 tables Would not recommend it,No Positive
305411,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, We booked a week stay and on our first night they put us in the premium room since the regular ones were overbooked so we had to move the next day Directions we received from reception to get to the hotel by public transport from the airport were not very accurate and it took us forever to get to the hotel On the way back we opted for a taxi instead Some of the staff s English communication skills were not so good so we had hard time to get what we needed through sometimes , Great breakfast selection stylish hotel 10 minutes walk from the beach quiet neighborhood direct metro line to the city center L4 stop Selva de Mar rooftop pool and great view of the city Good value for the money 
305412,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel,No Negative, The buffet breakfast was faultless Rooftop pool was beautiful too bad about the rain at the time of our stay Metro was a ten min walk and the Diagonal Mal Shooping centre was just across the road with plenty of shops restaurants and bars 
305413,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, very bad that no one told us the swimming pool didn t work we booked this hotel so we could use the pool And it didn t say anything on the website we booked that the pool didn t work If we knew it we might have chosen another hotel that did have a functional pool , Great place great staff great room service
305414,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The bathrooms are very interesting to say the least The door to the shower toilet part of the bathroom was transparent so if your not comfortable with your partner this could be a bit awkward for you , The breakfast buffet was good and value for money For 10 each we had a filling breakfast every morning before leaving the hotel The staff were good and very helpful in explaining the best locations in Barcelona and different ways to experience it 
305415,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Few staff Very kind but very few ones They need to add more staff at the breakfast service the poor girl was so stressed serving all the tables alone Also few staff at the reception for such a big hotel Appart from that they were very kind and helpful and everything was good , Bed extra conformity Excellent sleep 
305416,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Nothing I didn t like room was modern and fresh it was cleaned extremely well and the area on the roof next to the pool was amazing with those views , Friendly and polite staff Whilst checking in we were given a map of the city information on local attractions sites as well as a list of restaurants to eat in which I really liked The breakfast was extremely good with a wide variety of foods to choose from staff were constantly ensuring that food was available and that there wasn t times when certain things were not available GREAT HOTEL I did look at hotels that were closer to the city or ones that had a metro stop opposite but the walk to this hotel was worth it with the shops and mall near by also the beach is with in a walking distance WOULD RECOMMEND DEFINITELY STAY HERE AGAIN 
305417,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel,No Negative, Staff can be rude and you couldn t put things on the room They also made us switch rooms during our stay Location isn t great but the hotel itself is nice 
305418,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Location There are no restaurants and bars near to hotel Quite a walk to nearest metro Surrounding area not very nice and wouldn t want to walk about alone at night , It was reasonably priced as it was Easter weekend Room was clean and air conditioning not too noisy 
305419,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, A litte bit expensive, The breakfast was really Amazing Pretty room and clean Modern hotel well decorated Staff really Kind Good location near the metro
305420,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Although the receptionist was helpful she overcharged me for the hotel which was fine everybody makes mistakes but the hotel charged me for my own refund of using charge against me for using a debit card which i find awful , The Receptionist was very helpful and changed our rooms as they needed to fit another bed for 3 people Also let us check in before 2pm as we arrived early It was about 10 minutes walk away from the closest metro Facilities were very good Beds comfy 
305421,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Bad location Very far to the nearest metro 25 min and see 30 min The swiming pool all time is closed We made oder two separatly beds but get one big We asked separatly blanket but don t get it ,No Positive
305422,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, First time we were in a room on the 2nd floor with disabled bathroom what ruined the mood a little After they re located us there were still not so great views outside the windows but i guess that s what you get for being away from the city centre , It was super close to the beach and a big hopping maul for sun cream and umbrellas However at the very end of the beach strip so like a 40 mins walk to be more central 
305423,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The hotel is quiet far from the centre Closest subway stop is about 10min by foot Pool was rather small No electricity outlets near the bed charging phone on the other side of the room is a pity AC turns off automatically when room key is not inserted Coming back to a hot room is not too pleasant , Great hotel clean friendly staff huge buffet breakfast rooftop terras was nice and breezy 
305424,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The air conditioning was a bit temperamental but still worked, The staff were very helpful and gave us some very good restaurant recommendations thankyou 
305425,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The staff on the reception is not always speaking good English , This is a very good place to stay Eventhough the hotel is not in the city center it is accessible The rooms were very clean and tidy Variety of selections for breakfast Really recomended 
305426,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, To take the Metro or taxi to city centre is necessary, Nice and modern room 10 15 minutes walk to the beach and there is a big shopping mall on the way 
305427,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The location of the hotel is an absolut disaster It s about 800m to the nearest subway and the area around the hotel is really dreadful A woman in the hotel even got robbed by a man who entered the hotel just to steal her bag He then ran off and jumped into a car that was already waiting for him Not a good first day to witness something like that The food at the pool bar is absolutely disgusting Everything you order there is frozen and is defrosted by some sort of toaster I ordered a hamburger there and I managed to eat only a few bites and had a stomach ache the rest of the day The mojitos are made with the cheapest ingredients not even real sugar is used i would have expected much more from a 4 Star hotel We needed a taxi twice and each time we had to wait for over 30 min even though the second time a told them in advance when the taxi should be here We almost missed our flight because of this And for the size of the hotel there are only about 10 12 pool chairs outside A lot of people had to lie on the floor , The staff was really friendly and helpful Rooms were clean 
305428,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The unpleasant scent in Bathroom was unbearable I mentioned it to the staff at front desk but it didn t change Pool way too small , Good location Staff was ok 
305429,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Drink prices from the hotel roof top bar were relatively expensive and the hotel location is very remote compared to the La Rambla region of Barcelona Takes a 10 15 minute walk to the beach from the hotel the very northern tip of the coast another good 45 minutes walk on top of that along the beach to get to La Rambla and the taxi to El Prat airport cost me just over 40 Euros one way which is a considerable amount for younger travelers Location is the only major let down of this hotel that aside it is well worth the value for money once you get to the hotel , The staff were extremely friendly at any time of the day or night They knew very good English The facilities were really clean beat my expectations for a 4 star hotel The hotel has a small gym downstairs and a sauna steam room but I didn t use those Nice pool on the top of the hotel and has some great 360 degree views of Barcelona where you can also enjoy a drink from the bar Good value for money 
305430,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The immediate surrounding of the hotel initially make it seem a little isolated , The staff were extremely accommodating The breakfast was brilliant and very well priced Our room was exactly the same as what the website had to offer which hasn t exactly been the case in the past with other hotels The metro station was only a walk away very close to a shopping mall and a dozen restaurants within the mall I would definitely recommend this hotel 
305431,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The area is really rough I felt unsafe walking at night There was no shops or cafes or restaurants anywhere near the hotel , Good breakfast and good service from the front desk 
305432,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The hotel needed just a little tlc in some places , Breakfast was great cheap convinient and lots of choice Beds were also very big and incredibly comfy 
305433,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel,No Negative, We have visited the Tryp ConDalMar 3 times now and enjoyed everything about it each time we have visited The hotel is clean the staff are excellent and the food is great The facilities are superb and the hotel rooftop pool and bar are ideal for relaxing after a day out The proximity to the beach is good and also to a local Commercial centre where there are great shops and restaurants We will be back very soon 
305434,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff clean overall good value for money The location isn t central but has good amenities we stayed to access local attractions 
305435,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Only what they can improve is cleaning Dirty bathroom And moud around the bath , All was good Personal was amazing Food was really good Great location 10 minuts beach 5 minuts tube 
305436,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel,No Negative, Staff were amazing very helpful Did manage to have a full conversation with one of your lovely worker One think I didn t like was the driver that took me to airoport booked via reception got charged 40 euros instead of 28 30 euros Apart from that outstanding Really enjoyed it 
305437,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The food was not good One evening my partner was served a chicken noodle dish where the chicken was stone cold Not many healthy options for breakfast other than fruit too much processed meat The bedroom didn t have a mirror the only one was in the bathroom but nowhere to plug in hair straighteners I went downstairs to the sauna area to do my hair instead , Free wifi modern fresh feel to the decor friendly staff Lovely roof terrace with pool just a shame the weather wasn t good enough to use it 
305438,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, in our last morning room service woke us up at 9 am by knocking on the door to check if they can already clean the room I would expect them to do it after we check out and don t disturb us like that , Breakfast was great and the staff are friendly and kind
305439,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The wet room had the toilet in a corner beyond the shower so if you needed to use the toilet shortly after a shower you had to walk over the flooded floor , The staff were all very welcoming and the room very clean and comfortable
305440,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Doors between rooms not locked no real 24 hours food service noisy hall bar where guests are allowed to disturb other guests who try to sleep etc ,No Positive
305441,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The glass door to the toilet and shower was a bit weird but in the end it was still not a problem , This hotel is really perfect I was specially looking for not so expensive place with good rating The fact that it s not in the center of Barcelona is actually it s advantage it s really quite the supermarket with not for tourist prices is reachable in 5 mins subway in 10 There is a lot of space to park a car around the hotel for free The view from rooftop is simply breathtaking especially in the evening Rooms very perfectly clean personnel was really helpful and friendly And it was really quiet Usually in Spain a lot of hotels are made in a way you hear every room on your floor even in the night but here it was so quiet and comfortable we just loved it We will definitely choose Tryp by Wyndham again 
305442,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Some staff unbelievably awful some staff outstanding clearly it s the poor staff who remain in the memory , Clean and functional Good view from the roof but no facilities open due to time of year OK for the pool but opening the bar would have made it much more pleasant to enjoy a sun downer with the great view 
305443,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, In my opinion the hotel s cost was a bit expensive in regard to its distance from the city center Breakfasts were tasty but there were not enough fresh vegetables , The hotel is near the mall where we bought food at a non touristy price The hotel staff was wonderful and welcoming Close to the train a pleasant area to walk The room was excellent and the cleaning service was good 
305444,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Location is close to good areas but not close enough a few blocks away from the water and nicer areas , Nice building and staff Good rooms and bathrooms are really good 
305445,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Surroindings are boring and not picturesque at all small pool often overcrowded, 10 min walk to the beach which seemed to be empty comparing to one in Barceloneta amazing breakfast Jura coffee machine reasonable prices for hot dishes for dinner in the lobby good cocktails but a bit expensive comfortable rooms
305446,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The location are a bit far from the city always smell sluice in the area time to time, Good buffet breakfast staff are very friendly the room are clean and very comfortable the beach and shopping centre are in walking distance bus sight seeing stop nearby metro not too far from hotel
305447,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Really need to get ice machines I had to buy ice at stores having drink in room with the problem of ordering ice is poor planning, Swimming pool Help at front desk
305448,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, The location is not fantastic a bit in the middle of nowhere but then the price and the hotel quality makes up for it so I would stay again at the right price Most days it was not a big problem there was a taxi outside which costs around 10 euros to get to the centre but on Saturday night there was not one in the vicinity apparently there are less taxis working on weekends Ended up walking to the tube which took about 15 through dark and slightly shabby roads Taxi took around 15 25 mins depending on traffic The bar closes early at 11 30 pm and there is nowhere else nearby , Great hotel for the price overall very clean spacious rooms fantastic buffet hot and cold breakfast for only 10 euros a head very friendly reception staff nice firm beds
305449,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, Only downside was the location but we prefered a hotel outside the central area and get better a hotel for our money , Everything was amazing staff breakfast bed cleanliness bar food everything amazing except the location was just ok 
305450,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel, It was not her fault but it took ages to order at the pool bar because the girl behind the bar had to go everywhere to get one order ready and was busy with just one order for over 15 minutes A coffee and two burgers by then there where more people waiting so it might be handy to have someone on staff that can help when needed from somewhere else in the hotel The pool was very cold Almost freezing The tv channels where all disturbed making it impossible to watch tv Don t eat the scrambled eggs they are the powered kind , The interior of the hotel was very pretty
305451,Tryp Barcelona Condal Mar Hotel,No Negative, nice place although its in a industrial area the service is very good and the room is nice and flooded with light
