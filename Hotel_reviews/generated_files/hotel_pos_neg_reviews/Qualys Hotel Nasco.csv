304956,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Out dated hotel we got also bitten evry where looks like there was something in our bed cause the kid was clean no bite marks at all Rooms felt dirty, Huge room breakfast was great friendly personnel Nearby tram station takes 10 minutes to center
304957,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Would have been good to be told about buying tickets for trams or using public transportation, Bed was comfortable Staff were amazingly helpful and accommodating Hotel was in a great location and easy access to the centre and attractions Great transport links
304958,Qualys Hotel Nasco,No Negative, They upgraded our room to junior suite free of charge and made our day since our flight was delayed Junior suite was top quality with amazing view from the 6th floor The room was really spacious and it was very relaxing spending time there The breakfast was definitely the highlight of the Hotel since it was truly delicious with a wide variety of tasty options 
304959,Qualys Hotel Nasco,No Negative, I was in the hotel with my mum for two nights and we enjoyed the place a lot Breakfasts were delicious and there were plenty of food to choose from yoghurts pastry vegetables eggs cheese ham etc The staff was very helpful and kind The neighborhood was nice as well and it was easy to get to the city center by tram or metro Our room was clean all the appliances were working there was really nothing to complain about 
304960,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Rooms facing the street will have massive sound issues from both the window and other rooms hallway If you re a light sleeper then demand upper floor with a courtyard facing window or skip this hotel altogether That s literally the only con in this place otherwise I highly recommend it , Convenient location with good access to public transportation and key areas of the city even by walking Nice staff with good yet limited services like in house restaurant and bar Both the hotel overall and rooms were in good condition despite clearly being a bit older 
304961,Qualys Hotel Nasco, too loud We were staying in room 104 with windows on the street and we heard every car and tram and police and people talking couldnt sleep at all we heard our neighbours room too well so walls are the same thin as windows cleaning lady mived our cloth and cosmetics too much as a result my partner lenses has lost the water she moved the case in a wrong position , Hotel is easily reached from the airport 7 min from the metro and aprox 25 min it takes to Duomo very nice and friendly receptionists very good and rich breakfast
304962,Qualys Hotel Nasco,No Negative, Excellent location with a tram stop right outside the hotel and a leisurely journey into the centre of Milan The staff were friendly and helpful the breakfast was lovely too 
304963,Qualys Hotel Nasco, You could hear noise from the street , The breakfast was delicious Plenty of variety on offer Was close to public transport Managed to find our way around Milan quite easily Staff were very helpful 
304964,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Personal preference not to have shower curtains Air con can be stronger ie colder , Shower water strong helpful and enthusiastic staff plenty of food options around 
304965,Qualys Hotel Nasco, There was a somewhat annoying sound coming most likely from ventilation but we got used to it after a while The breakfast would benefit from fresh pastries and bread we do visit italy after all we did not mind but to anyone who does the hotel is situated 20 25 min walk from duomo and you probably have to take some public transport , The room was big with a nice bed and in relative good shape although we did not like the carpet on the floor We particularly liked the big bathroom that was freshly renovated Although the room was facing the road on the first floor the tram or the traffic did not annoy us Room was spoteless something we appreciated The breakfast had a good variety of choices although nothing impressive but they do prepare fresh espresso capuccino if you like Staff was good and helpful 
304966,Qualys Hotel Nasco, City tax costs 5 for a day which is really expensive The hairdryer in the hotel room dries your hair in 15 20 minutes It barely works , Everything was excellent After our accomodation with a similar price in a tiny room in Paris this hotel was like a palace for us Room was so big and comfortable with a wide bathroom Its wide windows were helpful for me because I have asthma Even if they accidentally doublecharged before our trip they immediately got in touch with us to get our required informations so they could refund And they refunded that day as said Stuff replied our questions in less than half an hour each time Breakfast was included and we loved everything they served Except tomato olives cucumber they had everytthing There is a tram stop in front of the hotel so you can go to the center around Duomo cathedral by one vehicle There is a very big market 3 min away from the hotel you can find anything you want there There is also the best icecream shop in Milan next to the supermarket Because of the socket I couldn t plug my hairdryer and had to use the one in the bathroom which took a lot of time Then I asked for an extra plug so I could plug mine and the problem was solved They were helpful about everything Everything was great with this hotel We really enjoyed our stay there 
304967,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The hotel room was in a bad shape The furniture was old and showed damage The room smelled of smoke Location was fine but not great Breakfast was ok , Very friendly staff 
304968,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Anything for tourism is near you need to walk a lot or take the metro Additionally one day at the dinner they refuse to sell wine to all customers If you want to taste pasta you need a good wine , It was very clean Metro station is near only 4 blocks
304969,Qualys Hotel Nasco, They don t provide soap , Close to restaurants tram line Metro station and ATM Walking distance to the centre of the city about 20 minutes Staff very helpful and the included breakfast comprehensive Value for money was outstanding 
304970,Qualys Hotel Nasco, There was really nothing that wasn t satisfactory for our stay of three nights , At first the proximity of the hotel to the train lines looked like it might be noisy but proved to be a bonus Double glazing helped with the noise factor and transport around the city was made much easier The hotel was very comfortable with good sized bedroom a usable balcony and clean bathroom with good quality toiletries Breakfast was a fabulous smorgasbord with a large variety of foods for differing tastes The hotel restaurant had good food and excellent service Staff were helpful with directions and advice for tourist opportunities The local area had a supermarket nearby and good cafes bars and restaurants 
304971,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Exterior gone scruffy Hard to get parking outside to unload bags Tram outside door, Easy access to hotel from motorway Room was grand Nice wet room bath room Staff friendly and helpful
304972,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The main problem is transport in Milan There is tram stop near the hotel but you can t just pay for trip to driver You have to find ticket seller somewhere So I had to walk 10 min to subway and then make a detour to reach main sightseeings And no food anywhere in the city from 2 7 pm So pay more attention to breakfast , Staff Room Breakfast The hotel is pretty old but carefully maintained by staff I had no issues with soundproofing breakfast staff or smth 
304973,Qualys Hotel Nasco, We were shoved into attic room on 9th floor lift finished on 8 dark staircase to upper floor room dingy bears no resemblance to hotel photos you display Asked for quiet room instead room they gave us noisy water pipes overhead we were next to lift shaft and very hot as roof was metal ,No Positive
304974,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The keys are bulky and havibg to hand them in each time on leaving the hotel can be a little cumbersome But this is only thing to pick at , The location was pretty good Easy to get trams Hotel nice and old fashioned Really good attentive staff 
304975,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Some renevation needed Parking was 20 but managed to get it nearby for free , The staff was extremely helpful and positive Large and comfortable rooms Very good breakfast Perfect value for money 
304976,Qualys Hotel Nasco, I would give some info for the new guests that if you arrive to Milano with train bus from the airport how would you easy reach to the hotel if you dont want to take taxi for 15 20 The daily ticket around the City for any transportation cost only 4 5 which allowed you to use any of them for 24 hrs after validiation If you arrive to the train Central F S you should just jump on the tram No 10 which will take you straight to the hotel nothing else This tram stops very near to the Central Station If there are a balcony and you have smoker guests should have ashtray to give after request We didnt want to smoke in the room of course thats why we asked for balcony But there were not available any ashtray said by the room maid We used the plastic cup from the minibar as ashtray which were ok for us anyway I understand that the summer is on but to put only one double linen to the bed for 2 persons and the full bed cover which is very heavy is a little silly and above of it the linen were put under the mattrace tightly which we had to strongly torn out from under to use it I would suggest to put blanket or duvet on the bed and if the guest dont like them then change it But to start only with linen is not really enough The mattrace is not really comfy as we felt our waste bad on the next day however the mattrace wasnt hard The pillows very hard and there were no small one to change Not every guests likes puffy hard pillows as your neck got pain on the next morning Small pillow would help There were a young man at the breakfast with eye glass on whom seemed that he just pretend to do something but the main job been done by the fellow collegues all by ladies they took the empty dishes re filled the stations running checking around for the empty plates glasses to clear the tables off etc , The cleanless in the room We stayed at room 506 with balkony for 3 nights We asked through Booking com at the reservation time and early check in as we are smokers with my husband We got them both to give us more comfortable stay We had daily cleaning the lady were fantastic to us there was no complaints about it at all The breakfast was absolutely more than enough to start with the big walking around in the City for a long day The temperature were ok we could manage to use easily the air con The reception staff were very helpful specialy the lady with dark hair around mid age were a Pro There was no big and silly question what she couldn t aswer to us We felt like she read our mind and that s what we felt like secure We got all info about the trains dawn to Como Lake the shopping opening times etc We asked for blankets and iron board and there were in the room in no time The scene of the liquid soap in the room were nice the bathroom amenities avarage however as we used them on the daliy basis for the shower there were always replaced with the new bottle at the cleaning time which were an advantage as we didnt take any shower gel with us thinking that we should have them in the bathroom The blind on the window were very helpful as the sun came in early but it wasnt a case as we could sleep in the dark All above we would deffiniatelly come back when we return to Milano for short stay 
304977,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Mold in the shower no conditioner no wine in the fridge in the room no food available from 2 7pm, Location only 20min walk to the Duomo good breakfast bar
304978,Qualys Hotel Nasco,No Negative, We had a nice view with a balcony Very close to tram and short walk to metro station Staff were very friendly Breakfast was adequate and staff were obliging 
304979,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Horrible staff hospitality is no where in this hotel Paid almost 100 a night and nobody wanted to take a look at the airconditioning which wasn t working After 4 warm nights and several complains the front desk employee told me that it was my own fault and I should ve asked for another room Horrible Can not recommend it ,No Positive
304980,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Restaurant very ordinary food Location good once you worked out the underground railway, Breakfast excellent and in particular the waitress Eleanor was terrific Our first night room 508 was so noisy from traffic that we asked to be moved and the Hotel was most obliging
304981,Qualys Hotel Nasco, None, Breakfast Nice buffet Place Bed was so comfortable and bathtab was spacious accessible to tram stop There are nice restaurant around the hotel also Staff Kind hospitable and charming 
304982,Qualys Hotel Nasco, All the receptionist were very nice and friendly except one which was quite rude and not vey helpful We were really surprised that receptionist in 4 hotel can effort that kind of behaviour She had a short black curly hair to be specific and to not insult the rest the personal because as I said they were the opposite of this woman , Breakfast very good and personal who was helping with serving food was very friendly and helpful 
304983,Qualys Hotel Nasco, There was an unpleasant misunderstanding about leaving the car in carpark During checkin I informed staff I would like to keep the car 5 hrs later then checkout without any complaint On the next day I was told it would cost me another day of parking which was a bit surprising 20 Eur is not a fortune easily paid but word should be a word , The room was really cozy and spacious 
304984,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The air conditioning seemed to not work The shower was spraying everywhere The room was facing the street and the trams were waking us early in the morning , Itwas very clean and the room was made up every day top to bottom Breakfast was superb People were very nice 
304985,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The location was a little way from some of the attractions I was visiting , The staff was courteous and friendly The breakfast was very good but the biggest surprise was the food served in their restaurant Excellent meal with a server who was sot on 
304986,Qualys Hotel Nasco, If you re interested in the tourist sights this hotel is a bit of a hike or ride on the very slow trams away Tram access from here is very good and they ll give you a transit pass but you re not in the heart of things so just be aware The neighbourhood is a bit on the dingy side but seemed fine , The place is very nice got a good rate Room small but clean and tidy everything good 
304987,Qualys Hotel Nasco, An english movie channel would have been great, Great location Amazing big rooms Clean and very comfortable Excellent coffee and delicious breakfast buffet
304988,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Still a bit of traffic noise , Good view Great breakfast Helpful staff Great shower Good restaurant Transport right out the front Wonderful artisan gelato up the road rightfully extremely proud of their product and could explain its provenance 
304989,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The initial room was a nightmare Don t get a room facing the tram as it is very noisy No free bottled water at turndown service , The superior room was shockingly tiny We upgraded to a suite for an extra 50 euro per night as we had already gotten a fantastic price through booking com We really enjoyed the rest of our stay after that 
304990,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Very small room No facilities like kettle etc , Walking distance from Milan main attractions and centre Nice view at top floor Comfortable bed Bathroom had a shower bath and quite comfortable TV had many channels and quite a few in English Liked the balcony 
304991,Qualys Hotel Nasco, There was no information about the breakfast in the room no time no place no standard guide hotel in the room Reception didn t give any info about the breakfast during the check in, Location
304992,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Dirty room terrible breakfast the walls had cracks on them see photos extremely bad and dirty hotel one of the worst places I ve been , Close to the metropolitan so you can go as far as you can from this hotel
304993,Qualys Hotel Nasco,No Negative, The Hotel is OK but when I visited during a busy period the prices were increased to about 350 night for a hotel that should be no more that 120 Its ok for a cheap hotel but not at luxury hotel prices 
304994,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The pillow was awfully hard , I liked the room which had a balcony with a view and the breakfast There was quite a decent selection of food to choose from Also the location is good with the tram stopping a few minutes walk from the hotel 
304995,Qualys Hotel Nasco,No Negative, Very nice and helpfull staff The breakfast was good and overall it was a very clean place Close to everything we took our bikes and rode around all of milano it took 10 15 minutes to the Duomo at a normal speed 
304996,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Key was old fashioned had a 0 5 KG dongle attached to it The hallways are old fashioned and due for an update The WiFi router was just hanging from the ceiling The rooms facing the main street are very busy because the window and balcony doors are old and don t seal properly any longer , Breakfast was good 
304997,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Distance from center It took more than the described 15 minutes more like 30 min by tram Was hard to arrive after evening flight, Very nice staff Comfortable rooms
304998,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Some of the stuff were unfriendly not all of them were speaking Enlish We were charged for a parking space but we didn t get our own and had to share one with another car The second night there was no parking space at all and we had to park infront of the garage The breakfast consisted of very poor choice of meals and some of the food was not fresh Most of the windows in the room were permanently locked only one really small window could be opened infront of which we found cigarete butts I don t recommend this hotel , The room was clean 
304999,Qualys Hotel Nasco,No Negative, We paid for a large double bed suite which had two single beds joined together instead The shower was small and we only got a sample of body wash and that s it 16 tv Low quality of food considering that you are accommodating in a 4 star hotel Quite bad experience in general 
305000,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Our room was at the front of the property which overlooked a busy road The street noise from cars trams was unbearable all evening going on until around 1 30 2am and starting again around 5 30am we struggled to sleep which really affected our trip The bathroom was very worn and in need of updated so it didnt feel very clean The bed was very uncomfortable and general bedroom area was also very worn I would not say that this hotel is 4 it is in desperate need of updating There are a couple of restaurants in the area but I wouldn t recommend the location to travellers I raised this with the hotel on our return home who offered us a free night not very useful for us as we won t be returning to Milan having visited already , The hotel staff were brilliant very helpful and recommended a couple of brilliant restaurants nearby Drinks in the bar were quite expensive but the bartender was very polite 
305001,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Noicy street so we couldn t sleep The staff moved us to a room in the back but it was still to noicy They should have three glass windows The breakfast was barely Ok Fortunately the lady in the reception in the morning let us amend the reservation so we could change hotel ,No Positive
305002,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The overall experience is very poor to me The room were clean but the furniture were too old and overused both bathroom and room Switches very old transmitted a sense of low end environment The lack of power sockets available from bed is nowadays NOT ACCEPTABLE The linens were clean but the bed cover it s or looks too old and is co responsible for the poor customer experience Moquette on the ground is nowadays considered one of the most dirty things one might think on a hotel room People might easily suffer for allergic reactions caused by dust You should speed up the process to move toward an easy to clean parquet Start tomorrow morning Same can be said for bathroom Shower is usable but too old toilet is overused Towels were good enough Hairdryer is outstandinlgy outdated and very poor with effectiveness Bath handles are almost consumed and giving negative poor user experience The breakfast is likely one of the poorest experiences I had in the hotel and in general during my business trips Quality of croissants important in italy were extremely low Fried eggs were offered floating into oil nothing really nice to see Everything were looking as it actually was Low quality food given to non recurring customers Breackfast personnel was kind Last but not least the room keys You are still using the outstanding old heavy DIRTY keys from the 60s But you know what The 60s are gone 50 years ago A 4S hotel MUST use a plastic proximity card as room key Not only to increase the customer experience but also for a better hygene and most important becasue you need to know in every second when a room has people inside and when it s empty for safety reasons Aren t you tired of wasting money for electricity when guests are not in the room Elevators are really too old They work slow and often the customer has to press the call botton several time to get the doors opened Price for parking is ridiculous , Room and linens were clean
305003,Qualys Hotel Nasco, I spent five night at this hotel and didnt have even 1 night good sleep the bed to hard and air condition so noise and beware even you ask for tap water they will charge 3 euro without notice and dont eat sneak in you room taste bad and they charged too and breakfast no good as well and hotel will charge for expensive currency exchange rates and transation fee I want cancel and give more than 2 weeks early notice they said if cancel no refund this hotel why 4 stars I think it deserve 2 stars, nothing good at all
305004,Qualys Hotel Nasco, No bar so it lacked a little atmosphere This is not a criticism merely an observation It would not deter me from returning or indeed recommending it to anyone , Value for money clean comfortable friendly staff location serviced by tram line Excellent breakfast menu 
305005,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The food in restaurant is good but after a few days with the same food you need a change The waiters are very kind and very helpful, The hotel is excellent the personal is very good everything was ok
305006,Qualys Hotel Nasco, the breakfast room was downstairs in a enclosed room It would have been nice to have a view to wake up to their nice coffee and a view of Milan , everyone was friendly and helpful and accomodating 
305007,Qualys Hotel Nasco, I personally did not like the coffee at breakfast but it is not a big deal at all , Very nice hotel and staff good location clean and comfortable room Good value for money 
305008,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The heat was broken they came up twice and nothing I had to beg for a blanket The internet was crap And the staff was rude and unsympathetic to me having to sleep fully clothed with a jacket and beanie cap on or the fact that I was getting a cold , I liked that I got out of there as quickly as I did 
305009,Qualys Hotel Nasco, the room was very small the air conditioning had a permanent noise during the night all furniture and room endowments bathroom are pretty old and very used poor facilities of the hotel, personnel was polite and nice breakfast diversified the location close to center but on a very quiet boulevard it has a big supermarket nearby
305010,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Noisy street room sound isolation could be better Big bed was made with two single Only one non smoking room left at the arrival , Good location direct tramway to the center close to metro station shuttle from Malpensa airport stops in 1km from the hotel Very friendly and handsome staff late departure was accepted city transport tickets at the reception very clean place 
305011,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Room needed more maintenance Conditioning system was noisy and bad looking Couch was old and not in good shape I ordered room service from bar and alcohol service is 80 s style not professionally crafted as obvious in modern hotels in business cities like milan ,No Positive
305012,Qualys Hotel Nasco, For maniac people cleaning can be better we found an empty pack of cigarettes in our room and butts on the terrace Otherwise nothing , The breakfast was great but downstairs Room was quiet courtyard side Our stay at Nasco hotel was great
305013,Qualys Hotel Nasco, If I would be very picky I would say that the room where breakfast was served could have been bigger and the bed was a bit too short for my 2 m height But then again lot s of beds are Oh and be aware that there will be city tax added to you reservation price 5 per night per person , Good location only about 20 min with tram no 1 to Nord Cadorna Some shops supermarkets and restaurants near by Nice clean rooms with big bed and balcony Good breakfast 
305014,Qualys Hotel Nasco, nothing particularly only the general impression that this hotel is closer to 3 than 4 , close to metro station big room big bathroom confortable bed ok breakfast

305017,Qualys Hotel Nasco, no tea coffee facility in our room no iron in the room no bar menu downstairs and no drinks on show so unsure as to what we could have and price but those are all small things , location value modern room on a high floor with a balcony facing the back of the hotel not front staff breakfast choice 
305018,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The service in the restaurant was a bit slow due to that the same guy was in service both in the restaurant and the bar and he had to run wiht he orders between the dinner room and the restaurant Otherwise the menu in restaurant was good and the price reasonable not more expensive than in the city , Good location clear nice staff delecious and rich breakfast Staff was helpful with the problems of light and the night noise and manage them quickly 
305019,Qualys Hotel Nasco, The rooms need some improvements the furniture is quite old , The breakfast was delicious There was plenty of food for all tastes The room was large and clean

305022,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Putting the sign that water and peanuts are not included in the cost of the room signposting can save one quite a bit of money , Wonderful and very helpful staff stand by the interests of the visitors rooms with a beautiful design in tender pastel colors and whites pleasant to be there and my room had a nice terrace calm location but quite central

305025,Qualys Hotel Nasco, Nothing, Our stay at Nasco Hotel was perfect Although the hotel is a little bit outside the city center there is a metro station and train station called Milano Nord Domodossola just a few hundred meters from the hotel right behind the Coop Supermarket and this made it very easily for us to move around the city and to Como Lake There is also a tram station in front of the hotel and you can take tram no 1 to get to the center Tickets can be bought at the reception The staff was also amazing and they made our stay really enjoyable We could benefit from our early check in as they had a room ready for us as we requested They also gave us a room on a higher floor with a balcony so we could rest after our long walks in the city Breakfast is great with lots of selections from fruits to pastries eggs meat etc But the thing that made our stay perfect was the cleanliness of the rooms They were literally sparkling We would come back any time to this hotel
