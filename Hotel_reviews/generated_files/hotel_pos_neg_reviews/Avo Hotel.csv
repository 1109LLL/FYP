254146,Avo Hotel, The main toilets downstairs were not nice bed was not as big as expected but was nice, I would like to say that the guy called lee was so helpful really nice person made me and my boyfriend feel so comfortable staying there
254147,Avo Hotel,No Negative, Friendly staff offered a free drink on arrival and as we were there too early to check in they put our bags in our room for us as we had to head straight out Breakfast was nice and again friendly staff in the morning 
254148,Avo Hotel, The constant police cars and ambulances every 10 minutes with their sirens on ruined our night away We had all the windows shut and the air con on and it still woke us up continually throughout the night and we were on the top floor Need better windows The toilet in the restaurant was disgusting Looked like it hadn t been cleaned in a long while Breakfast was cheap but not cheerful sadly The milk was off and they only had whole milk Most of the cereals were empty or nearly empty , The bed was comfortable and the air con was amazing in 30 heat Room had all the essentials and more 
254149,Avo Hotel, There was an excellent booklet in the room explaining everything One improvement with this would be a page explaining about breakfast and what was available , I would recommend the Avo Hotel to anyone wishing to stay in this part of Hackney the staff were very friendly and the hotel was spotless Although a very old building inside all fixtures and fittings are new and on trend The rooms are small because of the building s age but this didn t take away from our enjoyment We would certainly stay there again 
254150,Avo Hotel, I would have preferred more details with regards to parking not just discovering on arrival that there was no parking onsite but that we had to pay around 8 to purchase and drive down a particular street to find parking We did not mind doing all this but some forewarning would have saved us the worry when we arrived to find no parking After reading in the handbook that an early breakfast before 8am was sometimes available we booked breakfast only to discover this was not available and the receptionist did not want to refund us despite advising by 6pm night before We waited until a new member of staff came on duty and our money was refunded without question Our room was lovely but very very tiny as was the shower , Staff very helpful on arrival and they arranged purchase of our parking coupon The facilities were modern and clean with everything we needed plus a nice view from the window A cosy feel Although we did not eat there the aroma of the small restaurant was lovely 
254151,Avo Hotel, I would skip the breakfast and nip round the corner to Healthy Stuff , I used to live in the area so appreciate the mix of cultures and the vibrancy of the area Incredibly comfortable bed pillows Slept well woke refreshed Really nicely decorated room bathroom stylish felt luxurious Wonderful shower Lovely shower products Quiet at back of the building Very easy to travel to Very relaxed the whole process of booking in access into the building Felt well looked after Lovely lovely staff Will stay here again 
254152,Avo Hotel, I didn t go to Dalston for a pretty view but if that s what you re after you won t get it here , The hotel staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly The room was great location good for the purposes of my trip ie doing things in east London It s a family run operation and you could feel it 
254153,Avo Hotel, This was our second stay this month A smaller room meant for cramped accommodation compared with first stay , Helpful owners and staff Very willing to be of assistsnce Good location re transport 
254154,Avo Hotel, Our first of two stays Top floor adequate No lift so not for persons with disabilities 2nd stay much smaller room and all facilities felt cramped , Central ocation Our first of two stays we had adequate space on top floor on first stay Owner and staff very helpful 
254155,Avo Hotel, A bit noisy thin walls a few ants saying hello , It is a boutique hotel out of the way Ratio money comfort perfect considering that London s prices are out of control Not for everyone tight corners but Spartans will feel luxuriously treated Great WiFi great hosts fantastic bed in room 001 
254156,Avo Hotel, Room tight on space but all amenities present Bit of late night noise but generally quiet Maybe avoid work on flat roof right outside guest rooms until after breakfast service , Very comfy bed well equipped room friendly and helpful service at late check in and breakfast 
254157,Avo Hotel, The rooms could have been a bit larger the soundproofing could have been a bit better However I have paid more than double their rate and a friend was quoted SIX times their rate for a noisier similar sized room in a hotel 3 7 miles away , Location friendly staff
254158,Avo Hotel, One of the rooms was near some kind of depot that had sirens going off throughout the night and into the morning Soundproofing needed , Staff were really welcoming and rooms were comfortable and clean 
254159,Avo Hotel, Picked this because reviews said it was clean but it was dirty and not just surface but old dirt at that The shower was horrid with dirty sealant Also paid more for superior room and it was very small and looking out over the backs of houses, Location suited us
254160,Avo Hotel,No Negative, Avo hotel must be the best place to stay in the area if you re travelling Though it s a small hotel with 6 rooms run by a lovely family and staff you find everything in the room that usually 4 star hotel has neat clean comfortable and quiet The ceral breakfast is tasty too Highly recommended 
254161,Avo Hotel, Directions to get to park somewhere around the hotel should be on website as very awkward junction in front of hotel and easy to miss it , Lovely stay and looked after me brilliantly Very comfy 
254162,Avo Hotel, The fact it was above a restaurant and the rest of teh building was dingy State of the art decor didn t actually work properly tap mixer and digital clock on mirror , Bedroom decor location
254163,Avo Hotel, Its more pricey then sone hotels for a normal size double room We paid 109 for the room and we book with avo regularly, Its very confortable I like how we have robes and extra towels in the rooms 
254164,Avo Hotel, There was no breakfast although brochure in room said there was Radiator stayed top heat although we turned it off A king room but slightly cramped, The welcome The d cor was OK Suited our purpose very well
254165,Avo Hotel, The rooms are small as other reviewers have noted That takes some getting used to but ultimately was not a problem , The friendly staff the excellent Indian food in the Avo Spice cafe 
254166,Avo Hotel, The room was tiny and dark and we had to take it in turns to move around the bed There was nowhere to put things so they had to stay in the suitcase or on the floor It was stuffy despite it being in the middle of winter It was very expensive for what it was in comparison to other places we have stayed in , good location for us It was quiet for the middle of London
254167,Avo Hotel, Room smaller than what they look like on the pictures No tables in the room so had dinner in bed Not that dramatic, Vert good bed Nice Indian type restaurant on the ground floor 
254168,Avo Hotel, When leaving room to the exit the lights don t come on till your by the exit door and the corridor has no natural light so very dark , The lay out of the suite The bed was very comfortable There was ice in the freezing compartment of fridge 
254169,Avo Hotel,No Negative, There were lots of little touches which you d get in a more expensive hotel e g Elemis dressing gown and slippers There were lots of mirrors The staff were available 24 hours 
254170,Avo Hotel, It doesn t say on the website that in order to get to your room you have to ring a door bell of an indian restrurant take away that never seems to be open and the door was always locked If you worry about safety and fire risks this is not the place for you You then go through the restaurant past the counter and go up the locked stairs at the back which were very narrow There were security camara s at every narrow corridor at eye level The room wasn t big enough to open my suitcase The shower was so small I had to open the shower doors not to get my hair wet , This was a pretty good location for overground and East London There was complimentary hot chocolate tea coffee and biscuits and there was free wifi The room itself looks pretty much like it does in the photo s very boutique looking and has a big size TV If you are looking just for a place to crash and don t mind the way you need to get to the room and the price then you will enjoy this adventure 
254171,Avo Hotel, When I arrived the room was very dusty like it hadn t been cleaned for a while The counters table etc weren t wiped down There was a weird residue When I reported it the front desk person was lovely they came in a wiped things down But then I opened the fridge and that was dirty The next day when I arrived to my room it had been cleaned but the cleaning person left in the middle of the job and left behind their cleaning supplies and towel Keep in mind I arrived at 9pm , The staff were great They responded very quickly 
254172,Avo Hotel,No Negative, It was like being at home chilling in your room No noise or disturbence Bed was the best Perfectly situated everything you need on your door step Guy that greated us was kind and welcoming Id definetly stay there again 
254173,Avo Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff nothing too much trouble lots of little extras like slippers dressing gown toiletries etc Beds very comfortable room and bathroom extremely clean Room was small but knew to expect that and the space was utilised well 
254174,Avo Hotel, Although overall the room was clean there were a couple of areas that were obviously being missed regularly There were lots of mirrors in the room but a full length mirror would have been appreciated Steep stairs and no lift would not recommend for anyone with mobility problems or young children , Very comfortable bed nicely furnished Staff were friendly and helpful Budget double room on second floor fine for one person but would have been a squeeze for two Good shower Lots of little extras like a decent hairdryer nice toiletries filtered water etc Reasonable value for money in London with easy access to transport 
254175,Avo Hotel, Entrance through cafe through several doors at back lead to two flights of narrow stairs with only one exit in case of fire , Comfortable bed modern decor clean bathroom Very friendly staff 
254176,Avo Hotel, It was very odd the hotel being also an Indian take away and my room had a multi coloured disco light in it that you couldn t turn off without turning all the lights off , Clean and good value
254177,Avo Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and when we got back late we ordered an indian takeaway from them and they delivered this to our room with plates and cutlery and it was excellent The location was perfect as we were watching bands in The Victoria Pub 
254178,Avo Hotel, The king room was only slightly larger than the bed itself Very small if you are a couple with baggage , Bathroom was very nice The bed linen was fresh and clean 
254179,Avo Hotel, Room was very small Bed creaky The bathroom wasn t cleaned that well as I saw the previous guests hair on the toilet seat , Toiletries provided were good good tea and coffee facilities
254180,Avo Hotel, A lot of slamming heavy doors quite early in the morning , Bed was unbelievably comfortable Best sleep I have had in a long time Very close various types of transport therefore getting around London was easy Would recommend for a short city break 
254181,Avo Hotel, BEWARE the King Room It s so small there s no room to move particularly if you have suitcases Claustrophobic 4 square metres The shower is TINY Don t risk brain damage by colliding with the wire soap dish as I did you certainly can t fall too far in this glass enclosure We had booked 6 nights but had to move out the next day as my partner was sensitive to the cooking smells from the kitchen At 8 30 pm the Restaurant didn t want to serve us food because they were so busy with takeaway orders but finally relented when pressed , Hackney is a diverse and interesting locality 
254182,Avo Hotel, Space at a premium both in hall access areas and inside room where it was hard to pass bed without catching shoulder on wall mounted TV but that s London I guess Bigger rooms very pricey , Very clean no nonsense reasonably well equipped room
254183,Avo Hotel, No complaints about the room staff service or location There was a strong smell of curry in the reception area doubles as restaurant when I arrived but it never permeated into the hotel proper and security separating the two was good The smell was not there when I went out later or in the morning , The hotel was clean comfortable and the room was just as it appeared in the photos Yes the room was compact but I had done my homework so no surprise The shower room was perfectly adequate for a normal sized person All the usual stuff was provided clean towels toiletries tea coffee hairdryer etc It was a couple of minutes walk from Dalston Junction station and easy to find Very quiet no noise from traffic or other guests 
254184,Avo Hotel, nothing bad to say, bed very comfortable shower great and very clean staff very helpful also eat downstairs the curry was great would recommend to anyone staying to try it 
254185,Avo Hotel, It s definitely not a 4 like claimed The king size room I booked was more like a small double Was expecting a lot more for the price The different colour lighting they have that can be controlled you can t turn off the main lights and keep that one on so what is the point of it , The bed was comfortable Staff where friendly and helpful Had dressing gowns 
254186,Avo Hotel, I had the best room in the house I think I was on the ground floor and the room was very spacious I see some people complaining about the size of their rooms I did not see the smaller rooms , I was made to feel very welcome and comfortable This is important to me as a solo business traveller They kindly ordered a taxi for me the next morning It is really easy to get to by public transport too 
254187,Avo Hotel, Nothing, We received a very welcome from the owners and were shown to our room They very kindly accommodated an early check in as we had a wedding to go to that afternoon We had booked the King suite on the top floor It was perfect for our stay and very comfortable and private The bed and pillows both memory foam provided a wonderful sleep and the shower was excellent A brief but very enjoyable stay and I would definitely stay again Very clean room with everything you need provided for 
254188,Avo Hotel, This is not a hotel it s a takeaway with rooms above it The clientel were quite intimidating for a solo female returning late at night The stairs are so narrow that I would be concerned how to get out in case of fire The room was tiny and mostly taken up with a double bed the whole place has a slightly strange atmosphere ,No Positive
254189,Avo Hotel,No Negative, Very smart room a bit small but for the location that is what you would expect I did not have breakfast but kettle in the room for tea Extremely helpful manager who lent me a cable and was very friendly and welcoming 
254190,Avo Hotel, Hardly any parking and very expensive I rang to ask where I could park as I didn t know the area and the guy at reception wasn t helpful at all My room was right at the front on the main road and was ALOT smaller than I thought it would be from the pictures There are also lots of stairs , The bed was comfy and the bathroom was really nice Big TV in the room Black out blind was helpful 
254191,Avo Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is nice and well located near Dalston Junction The staff was very friendly Our room was small but bed very comfortable providing good nights sleep sounds of the traffic didn t disturbe us Would stay there again if needed a good accomodation in eastern London

254196,Avo Hotel,No Negative, The room was dirty floor especially air vent I cleaned it myself using a white towel Filthy 1 thin blanket on bed very unhygienic Thin see through drapes opened then no curtains and opposite could see in Terrible 
254197,Avo Hotel, Window isolation could make this hotel better than it already is so you won t hear the traffic from Dalston lane , A lot of thought and attention has gone into the decoration of the rooms which had everything one could need robe slippers alarm clock tea making facilities The room matched the photo s bathroom was quite stylish Staff were friendly and helpful no problem to help carry my suitcase to the 2nd floor 
254198,Avo Hotel, Rooms quite small so not much room for hanging up clothes etc Ideal for our one night stay but would prove difficult for more than one night , Good location clean and comfortable Friendly staff

254202,Avo Hotel, Entry through a takeaway restaurant was a little weird though I note this was expected from the listing information , Wonderful value for money for high quality guest room in easy range of the City and Canary Wharf Transport easy via Overground Bus Uber 
254203,Avo Hotel, It was noisy with the traffic and ambulance station nearby but that s no fault of the owners , Staff and facilities are excellent The flat was so well equipped and neat 
254204,Avo Hotel, Sound proof windows to stop traffic noise were not effective , Friendly staff Convenient location for buses into London great coffee house opposite and Street Feast within walking distance 
254205,Avo Hotel, Small room even for the biggest one Smell of curry when we arrive and in the stair case Fire alarm waking you up at 8 25 which was just a drill but kept ringing for 10 minutes ,No Positive
254206,Avo Hotel, Dust everywhere looked like the bathroom hadn t been cleaned kitchen tap not attached It was noisy in the room from people outside probably coming through the letter box which we found strange in a hotel room Not a fire escape as the door and window was caged off To get to the room you walk through the Indian restaurant where the toilets are Not near any of the London attractions ,No Positive
254207,Avo Hotel, It was quite noisy due to being so close to a very busy street but that is London, What you see in the pictures was what you got I had the top floor room which was very spacious and beautiful The staff was excellent friendly helpful knowledgable and the food was lovely 
254208,Avo Hotel, Nothing room was slightly warm and small but it s definitely a good size for staying just to sleep , The location was great for Hackney where we were going to a show easy to use the overground and tube to get to central London The service was wonderful and the staff were helpful There were also nice touches in the room like a make up light mirror etc
254209,Avo Hotel,No Negative, Thoughtful and helpful information from staff and from printed book Cosy room with well organized space clean and compact en suite tea kettle filtered water etc was a nice touch 
254210,Avo Hotel, the small bedroom for two, very convenient place for buses and taxi Friendly staff and the young man was most helpful getting me directions it was no bother to him
254211,Avo Hotel,No Negative, The staff were excellent and very helpful The room was immaculate and thoroughly modern the bed was very comfortable and all conceivable facilities were available and working Should make more of the fact that it is above an Indian Restaurant the food looked lovely but due to going into hospital for an operation the next morning i could not sample much
