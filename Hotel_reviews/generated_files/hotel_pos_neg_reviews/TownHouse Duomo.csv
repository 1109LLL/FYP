490286,TownHouse Duomo, It was very expensive so for the price there should be option of gym pool but the other facilities exceptional service made up for that , Excellent location extremely stylish with top class service
490287,TownHouse Duomo,No Negative, The star is super nice so helpful I wanted a pizza but the kitchen room service was closed cuz it was too late one of the staff went out and got me a pizza location is perfect in center of duomo happy and will stay there again for sure 
490288,TownHouse Duomo, The elevator take a long time to get if on a busy night due to the cocktail bar below , This is possibly the best hotel in Milan with a View over looking the Duomo The rooms are huge and very modern They give you a bottle of Prosecco as a welcome to the room The staff are World Class and are very helpful The restaurant on the rooftop is a Michelin Star restaurant and well worth the visit The breakfast restaurant is delightfully set among hundreds of wine bottles and gives off a warm comfortable feeling 
490289,TownHouse Duomo, Housekeeping was really bad didnt empty trash nor refill the toiletries and was late in going in The taxi we ordered to the airport never showed up Elevators are too slow and cater for everything so it took at least a few minutes everytime to go down and there are no stairs, Location was excellent Staff was beyond nice and helpful
490290,TownHouse Duomo, For a 5 concept too little attention to the small things No light at the bed no chair on the balcony to enjoy the perfect location at the Duomo , location balcony to Duomo
490291,TownHouse Duomo, booked a suite safe not working had replaced room not clean chocolate on the floor Batch room lights burnt bathroom floor needs replacement from water damage All facts Not worth the name or money ,No Positive
490292,TownHouse Duomo, Hotel a little hard to find as not signed all too well but the location is unbeatable , Large well appointed rooms Great big bathrooms and beautiful toiletries Comfy bed and helpful staff 
490293,TownHouse Duomo, The elevator is quite old and can be annoying The restaurant was closed due to holiday restaurant of this caliber should be to stay open during festive season, Apart from location the room was really nice and comfortable The view is amazing
490294,TownHouse Duomo, The entrance is so bad it seems like you re entering an apartment not a 5 star hotel via a left its so crowded with ppl so you wait too long And i had an infant The left location is very scary in the street it seems like someone will kidnap you the staff weren t that friendly Never go back to this hotel Not recommended at all , Location only i can find a better one in the same area 
490295,TownHouse Duomo, Not a fan of the access security system your room number access code are hand written on a hotel card so if you drop or misplace it anyone could get in the building your room Pictures on website were deceiving standard rooms are much smaller than photoes Room door in more than one of our rooms opened right into the bathroom which had no door Bathroom in more than one of our rooms was very tight 2 people cannot use the space at the same time No hooks or shelves in bathroom Curtains in one of our rooms was falling down, Good Location Friendly efficient staff Spectacular view of the Duomo the Piazza Nice terrace bar on first floor
490296,TownHouse Duomo, Overall state of maintenance is appalling The bar serves drinks at five star plus level prices with an ambiance of a three star product The breakfast service was so slow that even though I was the only person in the place after 15min I had only had one espresso The rest of the order had not shown up I just left for my meeting and got no apologies afterwards when showing back up at the reception which sits right next to the restaurant ,No Positive
490297,TownHouse Duomo, Far from 5 hotel feels like room sharing appartament very noisy you hear every guest passing by your room Breakfast is extremely poor no vegetables boiled egg salmon Very limited choice of cereals fruit pineaple and melon only no water two choices of juice I had better breakfast at 2 hotel Hot dishes were beyond any comment In the rooms some furniture really needs cleaning Also there was a terrible smell from the bathroom we complained about it but it was not fixed , Location is perfect but everything else is not up to 5 standard 
490298,TownHouse Duomo,No Negative, Our room had a travel guide device that you could take with you to explore the city and it had internet access so we used as a satnav to get around the town The view was absolutely amazing Receptionist was very professional and very thourough Our room had a modern spa bath and the bed was so soft Next time I am in Milan this will be my only choice for hotel 
490299,TownHouse Duomo, i had to look for the hotel its in a hidden corner even the taxi driver was lost i had to walk to find it , Excellent location beside all attractions restaurants and shopping area great room design and cleanlniess 
490300,TownHouse Duomo,No Negative, Bed was amazing slept like a baby Location outstanding down the elevator and 30 steps later in the middle of the Duomo sq very nice hotel Highly recommend Will stay again
490301,TownHouse Duomo, Our initial room had minor flaws We were offered to move after the first night which we accepted The new room was better except it didn t have a bathtub Furthermore the house keeping hadn t stocked a supply of essentials such as toilet paper washing cloths etc The breakfast wasn t that great The bread is generally a bit boring in Italy and so it was here But the fruit and yoghurt was delicious , Probably the perfect location for Milano first timers that wish to stay central The look from the small balcony to the plaza Duomo is truly stunning Exactly like in the pictures The top terrasse is a perfect spot for relaxing with a drink or a cup of coffee The 2 times we sat there we were the only ones The old Galleria is a really nice place with lots of great restaurants and shops All top tourist spots like La Scala and a lot of interesting museums are with a 5 minutes walking distance Metro station is 20 meters away it takes approximately 40 minutes to stroll to the central station if you don t have too much luggage with you 
490302,TownHouse Duomo,No Negative, Me and my hasband stay 4 days in milano in the class and luxury hotel Thetown house hotel excellent staff excellent location with very beutefull view Surly when i back to milano i will back to my hotel house town and i will advise all my family and friends about that 
490303,TownHouse Duomo,No Negative, We liked the overall feel of the hotel it is very modern and they have really covered every detail The staff are extremely helpful and courteous with excellent training The location is absolutely amazing We enjoyed wine on the balcony overlooking the Duamo and 12 14 rooms have a view of the cathedral too 
490304,TownHouse Duomo, The mini bar needed restocking and the bed wasn t very comfortable , The view of the Duomo was superb and the central location excellent The staff were friendly and helpful 
490305,TownHouse Duomo, The entrance to the hotel is a little awkward to find the first time The bath mats and carpets are very slippery on the beautiful wood floors , the staff were very knowledgeable friendly and helpful with booking guides and restaurants Fabulous views of the Duomo and the square 
490306,TownHouse Duomo, The breakfast is rather poor for a 5 star hotel and for the overall price , Amazing view of the Duomo the best location in Milan Very high tech room minimalist design I loved it The toiletries were amazing high quality and with a beautiful amber fragrance and organic zero paraben etc 
490307,TownHouse Duomo, For the star rating of this property the cleanliness and housekeeping was very disappointing Our shower filled up and flooded the bathroom and on removing the shower drain cap I cannot begin to describe what we found Gross it had never been cleaned The water never got hot and the bath took ages to fill The bath wasn t cleaned while we there the facecloths weren t replaced the floor was dirty the sugar wasnt replaced on the coffee tray and when we requested a porter for our luggage he never materialized When we asked again they said they weren t asked by reception to collect the bags The Pavarotti in house restaurant was disappointing Service slack endive salad had no endives when i asked why it was an endive salad the waiter said he would check with the kitchen Rest of the food was nice but ruined by slow inattentive service Most of our choices were unavailable When we checked out we asked to speak with the manager she was out of town but the owner was available We requested to speak to her as we were so disappointed with the whole experience it was an anniversary treat and were then told she was in a meeting and too busy to talk to us The front house duty man told us so many times that it was a historical location and everything we complained about was blamed on that , The location of this hotel is amazing On the first night of our stay there was a performance of the 500 strong Italian choir on the steps of the Duomo which we were able to listen to and see from our balcony The staff were friendly and helpful Very near the Galleria and main historic sites and monuments Red bus tour and taxi stop also on the square The breakfast was great but only one waitress that was run off her feet although lovely to deal with 
490308,TownHouse Duomo, The bed was not comfort at all instead of a blanket cover uses two sheets Also something biting us in the bed The breakfast was average quality , The lacstion is wonderfull The view is great
