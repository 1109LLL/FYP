401849,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, A design of the reception can be renovated , Hotel is situated at the heart of Vienna close to City Palace Liechtenstein the family s opulent and outstending seat and an amazing garden The hotel rooftop view 8th floor is lovely Some flowerpots and decorations would be a good idea to underline the atmosphere I enjoyed a quiet and comfortable room 
401850,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Room very noisy inside problem with bathroom with ventilation system Problem with parking very unconfortable the open park, Building excellent Breakfast excellent Personnel good Room clean and big
401851,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, This is a nice hotel in Vien It is in a residential area and the underground is 15 min walking There is bus nearer in the main street The price is good and the accomodations are very nice The breakfast is also very good but is not included in the basic price We will sure return there 
401852,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The city is very busy and the roads are very narrow The down town a bit far feom the hotel ans the pictures of the property ilwas not the same in real My expectation was more than what i saw , 
401853,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Optional breakfast expensive prices of drinks e g bottled water in room excessive reducing value for money for my deal to fair given the good quality of the accommodation rather than good , Location is good not ideal for business trip but very pleasant with back garden great for a quiet smoke Staff welcoming and efficient Large comfortable well appointed room and bathroom Quiet Good natural light in the room on or from the 5th floor Good restaurants in the neighborhood if not direct vicinity 
401854,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Installation for heating cooling even when turned off was generating a constant noise which could be a little disturbing over night at least this was the situation for room 507 ,No Positive
401855,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The room was too hot Even after I had turned the heating off and opened the windows it was still too hot to be able to sleep comfortably Even after 2 days Also I had not booked breakfast at the time I booked so the staff tried to increase the price of breakfast from 13 to 16 Euros each per night As a result we ate breakfast elsewhere every morning for about 8 Euros each , It was good to have fresh clean towels every morning It was convenient to be able to catch a bus to the U Bahn from very near the hotel It was convenient to be able to leave our cases in the hotel until we set off for the airport on the afternoon of our departure 
401856,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, If Garage is full the parking area is a bit complicate to find and description was not as clear as it should have been , Good Business Hotel Facilities are clean Various Restaurants are in Walking distance It was not my first stay and surely was not the last 
401857,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, My card was debited in spite of the fact that I had a cancellable tariff When I complained the staff told me they had right to do it This has not happened to me in my life Cleaning staff entered my room in spite of the dont disturb hanger on the door knob There was also damaged broken equipment in the room bathroom mirror the wash basin was quite old used stained yellow ,No Positive
401858,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, I would welcome a bottle of water without charge after all it is not that much to expect nowadays and a tea coffee facility Also I found very inconvenient being charged long before arrival date for all the rooms I reserved for myself and my bussiness partners it took quite a while sorting this matter out Lucky we were not in a hurry , A very comfortable stay near the city center very good breakfast with a wide choice parking place big rooms comfortable bed and pillow for those who like it on a softer side great wifi We really enjoyed our stay
401859,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Not much, The room was a very good size comfortable and airy The location is a short walk from the city centre no real need to get transport into town Breakfast was very good Staff were always happy to help 
401860,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Booked a room without breakfast The booking confirmation said breakfast costs 13 per person per night The staff member at check in said the same The staff member at check out insisted I pay 16 for the breakfast explaining that 13 would have been the price if I had booked the breakfast on the internet and that her colleague at check in must have got it wrong Call it what you may this kind of behaviour is reason enough for me never to return whatever the other merits of this hotel are ,No Positive
401861,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Bit older furniture in room, Suit was great clean and quiet Personal eas very nice Breakfast very good selection Internet working well Location as well 15 min to Rathauseplatz
401862,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The bar is only open till 2300 and food in bistro is not really worth the word bistro it is just some heated up sandwiches However there are several restaurants not to far away , Relatively quiet part of town not far from the centre very good breakfast spacious rooms that were in very good condition very friendly porter 
401863,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, Wasn t really at the hotel for very long The staff at the front desk are great helped get the bags sorted Was able to check in late without a problem The facilities are comparable to some of the hotels that cost 100 more per night 
401864,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The personal was unhelpful in some occasions when I needed some help Little information were given about hotel facilities The bed was small and uncomfortable in the single room I expected more facilities and comfort from a 4 star rated hotel , The location near to city center and to main transport ways and it s easy to find 
401865,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Fridge was too small and the safe was on the floor in wardrobe do you needed to lie down to be able to access it, The breakfast was amazing Such s variety of choices and staff in breakfast were very good
401866,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Hotel s Breakfast is rather simple coffee is average unfortunately is not of very good quality Definitely breakfast is not worth 16 Euro You can find in lower price much better breakfasts in coffees or restaurants near the hotel I do recommend this solution , Nice quiet hotel near the City Center with excellent localisation if you want to visit Old Tow Hotel is clean and staff is heplful 
401867,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, Nice spacious room and helpful and friendly staff Looking forward to returning and traveling more with Tram D which we did not discover until our departure Awesome bike paths 
401868,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, Could walk to the centre of town from the hotel Staff were all very friendly and ready to help when needed Breakfast was very satisfactory Many eating places in the vicinity My room overlooked the park and palais so was relatively quiet although the whole hotel was in a quiet street 
401869,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The only negative thing is scrambled eggs served at breakfast They were sweet and distasteful , Good equipment tidy room great breakfast nice personnel I am giving 95 
401870,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Metro line is around 15 minute near Danube canal and the central area starts after 15 20 min of walking The hotel is too far from Hofburg Konzerthaus Wien Museum Belvedere area Stephan dome, Breakfast was excellent The room was clean and the view to the garden was a nice surprise Surroundings are very quite a residential green area 
401871,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The blanket was short for me and i m averge height only , Very nice hotel in vienna the nearest metro station is 10 minutes walking The staff is very helpfull Quiet area the rooms are big the breakfast is amazing 
401872,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, It would have been nice to have a tea and coffee facility in the room , The breakfast was excellent and I particularly liked the smoked salmon and dill mayonnaise The staff were friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for me I like the fact that I can open the windows in my room Access from the airport is easy and the D tram to the centre is great I like the Liechtenstein palace next door 
401873,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, Quiet The room had everything one needed and felt comfortable rather than functional The staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing Excellent breakfast choices and very very spacious seating Great neighborhood Walking distance to university 
401874,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, Strudlhof Hotel is a very good solution for a weekend or more in Vienna A Hotel without cheap impressions but professionalism is what you will get Clean rooms every day rich breakfast likable lobby Not exactly at the city center but close to it stands in a very quite place the most quiet I have ever stayed on my travels Distances form St Stepehn s Cathedral or Hofburg Palace and Musems Quorter is about 25 30 light walking Friendly personel completes the whole picture Distance for those who do not like walking is the only disadvantage It will be my first choice for a future journey in Vienna 
401875,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Pictures of the hotel are rather a fake since they show the conference center connected to the hotel But the hotel is anyway nice The reception is hard to find ,No Positive
401876,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Ventilation in bathroom does not work creates after 2 showers a sauna feeling Hotel is a bit off from main publich traffic routs subway , Nice and quiet location friendly staff good breakfast Rooms OK Roof terrace with great view 
401877,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, restaurant only serves breakfast Beds could be a bit more comfortable but were ok , Breakfast was incredible Very good to reach with public transportation 5 minutes to the Tram D Huge rooms Nice bar downstairs 
401878,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, room behavior average location not really close to the underground but close to the tram , breakfast excellent very good overall quality compared with the room price
401879,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, soft pillows not my type thin walls but not bothering us because we were kinda alone in the whole floor no proper ventilation in the toilet unfriendly and unprofessional staff at the check in time it will definitely not giving a good impression to guests for the first contact with hotel staff , very clean excellent breakfast super friendly staff at check out time
401880,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Nothing to complain about , Good location in a side street not far from city center so no traffic noise Friendly and helpful staff Good breakfast buffet as expected in a 4 star hotel Tram and bus within a minute from hotel door Large room Beds OK Wifi works fine and is free as expected We stayed a full week 
401881,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Nothing , The hotel room is very clean and comfortable Breakfast is tasty and service is good as well I have got all my needed such as hot water heater 
401882,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The cleaning lady knocked on the door at 9 o clock on Sunday morning despite the fact we had to checkout at 11 The bed was a little uncomfortable but this is very individual preference , It s nice and cozy hotel the perfect choice for our stay The room was really great and actually bigger than expected The location is good We had everything we needed there We ll definitely choose again this hotel for our next visits in Vienna 
401883,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Wi Fi signal is poor the first night we could not get an ip address at all and we had to call the reception their solution had been to restart the router thus cutting the connection for other guests The room is big but there is no attention to details e g the curtain in our room had multiple little cuts the plug of the main lamp was broken and not safe in my opinion the poorly written hotel directory did not even contain all services available at the hotel as you read them on the website not a 4 star level room , This hotel is in a good position if you are in Vienna to visit the city centre the room was big and the area is not noisy Free parking can be easily found in the surrounding neighbourhood during the weekend 
401884,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The location isn t perfect a solid 15min walk to city center they could also improve the pillows too soft , Modern clean good size room We ll get a very friendly welcome by the front desk receptionist Atila who gave us great sightseeing and local restaurant suggestions Breakfast was very good as well All that for 40 night 
401885,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, The staff was very responsive we wanted another room and they did everything they could for us to have it The area is amazing I could honestly live there This is our favorite hotel when we go in Vienna
401886,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, The room was ok the hotel is in a quiet area the breakfast buffet offers an interesting variety of food It s very disappointing though that although other users have already pointed out that the hotel sells double bed rooms they are not and the hotel doesn t care Personnel at reception cold 
401887,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Heat in room had to be adjusted after first night it blew only cold air Staffer I reached when I arrived told me it was warm enough LOL Luckily it was not too cold in the room that first night Also no towels in room when I arrived I had to go get some myself Finally steam room didn t work bummer , Really neat place with great staff especially Attila at the front desk and decent location with an 8 to 12 minute walk to the subway station street car is much closer Decent supermarket and other shops nearby 
401888,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, It was rather cold and not obvious how to turn the heating on until the last day as the thermostat was a bit hidden , The location was good a fair old walk to the metro that s what I didn t give it 5 stars as such however pretty central and really close to the Freud Museum and the Opera The price was good for the quality of the room and facilities Yes it s not latest specs hotel but the room was big has everything needed bed was comfortable and minibar well stocked and affordable 
401889,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, , Everything OK Strudlhof Palais is a good hotel almost in the center of Vienna Rooms are clean and spacious with separate WC and big bathroom You can also enjoy panoramic view of the city from the roof terrace It s little bit expensive but fully worth of this price 
401890,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Noise from next door rooms thin walls and from the floor above our room was on 2nd floor and the restaurant was above us 3rd floor Bathroom door did not close , Very good daily cleaning service Nice breakfast 
401891,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Not a single bad experience to be honest , Every thing was good Breakfast was not various types and same in every day but with fresh ingredients and smiling and welcoming staff 
401892,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, There is no sound proofing be aware that noisy neighbours can wake you up , The hotel was great both clean and tidy nice big room and delicious breakfast with friendly staff 
401893,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The hotel could save a little money by turning down the heating a degree or two Our room wasn t cleaned one day even though we were out from 9 am and the cleaning staff were doing the next room when we went Ten minutes after we got back at 14 30 they offered to do it Too late , We liked our large room with decent bathroom and separate wc It was quiet and well appointed The breakfast buffet was very good indeed The price we paid via Booking com made it excellent value 
401894,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, Reception staffs are very nice and helpful The breakfast and lunch are also quite good with a lot of choices It would be better if more vegetable salad Facility for business meeting is close to the hotel Very convenient 
401895,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, hotel is very nice everything was as expected rooms very big and clean nice furniture breakfast great hotel is very close to the strassenbahn station and good connected with the town and also on foot to the rathaus is less then 30mins as well as to the stefansplatz definitely recomend and would come again

401899,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, There is everywhere ample space in the room as well as at breakfast The hotel is conveniently located close to the city centre but it is still in a quiet place 
401900,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Walls very thin Could here everything the guy next store was doing, Good location close to all the tourist sights in the 1st district but you don t have to pay the high room fees
401901,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, For 3 mornings 2 of 3 coffee machines in the dining room were broken On the 4th day the 3rd broke down too and were all out of action Desk staff had trouble agreeing on who would assist me with a tea from the bar which was meant to be available at a price leading to one being irritated in serving me As a guest I don t need to be told by one staffer that his colleague is a lazy a hole , Great rooms well designed and spacious Quiet location but still a short tram ride from the city centre 
401902,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The noise of the clinging flag posts in the front as soon as there is a little bit of wind They know this since more than a decade and did not manage to control the noise Especially at night it is like constant church bells ringing There is no service on the terrace although it is on the same level as the breakfast buffet and the kitchen The web info is not quite clear as to where the actual hotel entrance is I had to carry my luggage down a hill with a long staircase there is a slightly easier way through the back garden but you will not discover this when you arrive late , The location the breakfast buffet and the terrace Nice large room even for single travellors Great atmospheric bar on the ground floor 
401903,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Air conditioner goes off around midnight So when it is very hot as it was last summer the rooms are hot , Even in a busy city this was a quiet place next to the REAL palace You can easily rent a bike near by for 1 euro an hour and ride in to the tourist parts of town Nice helpful staff and great breakfast
401904,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Breakfast seemed a bit more expensive if compare to other hotels Was forced to decline , Very clean new rooms contemporary design Very spacious bathroom Fully matches its 4 star rating The price was good and fair and it was the most seductive reason for me But without breakfast 
401905,Hotel Palais Strudlhof,No Negative, Everything excellent only one small thing with the air conditioning not cooling very well in the very hot weather Otherwise perfect Highly Recommended and would definitely book again 
401906,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, It s a good weather hotel If it is too hot the air conditioning is not optimal Moreover it is switched off in the night Check the ambient temperature before booking the hotel , Good and a quiet location Rooms are spacious and clean Breakfast is good 
401907,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, Air conditioning unable to cope with Vienna s summer temperatures which reached 40C during our stay Breakfast room was very hot and uncomfortable and staff made no effort to prepare more tables for eating in the cool garden Reception staff less friendly then when visited two years ago , The location 
401908,Hotel Palais Strudlhof, The staff was polite but besides one of the front desk guys who was very nice and friendly the staff at the front desk was a little bit dry but always polite Maybe you want to improve in being a little bit more welcoming But overall it was a great experience , I like that the hotel was clean and the breakfast buffet The room was lovely
