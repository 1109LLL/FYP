300548,Grange City Hotel, Rooms maybe a little dated but that would be knit picking , Front desk staff were excellent Henry in particular My circumstances changed during my stay meaning I had to reduce my stay by 1 night The front desk didn t have to but they did allow me to amend booking free of charge I am a regular traveller to London and will definitely be back 
300549,Grange City Hotel, The sinks were clogged with water not draining at all I changed my room twice with same problem Also it was very noisy in the lower floors From the sounds good f hotel itself not the surroundings, Location because of proximity to my meeting
300550,Grange City Hotel, Staff at reception were disinterested , Room was excellent very comfortable bed Very light and you could turn off air con and open a window for fresh aur 
300551,Grange City Hotel, View was of the Railway line and other tall buildings , Comfy Bed Great to be able to have a bath Good to be able to turn air con on and off when needed 
300552,Grange City Hotel, My only complaint was that our door did not have a peep hole so we could not see who was on the other side of the door I didn t realize how much I appreciated peep holes until someone knocked on the door and I couldn t see who was there This is a tiny thing though and not a huge concern at all , The location was fantastic between Fenchurch Street station and Tower Hill station and within easy walking distance of the Tower of London The hotel has a nice atmosphere and the staff was friendly The room was clean and had an amazing view of the Tower of London There is a pool and fitness center as well as a restaurant and bar We would stay here again 
300553,Grange City Hotel, I did not get any help with my luggages from the front desk to my room , I love the spa The hotel is very close to the train station and walking distance to some tourists attractions 
300554,Grange City Hotel,No Negative, Beds and room very comfortable For two friends travelling the large beds were a bonus Had a problem with the washbasin which was fixed immediately Would choose to stay again 
300555,Grange City Hotel, Double booked my room whilst I was in it Unruly behaviour in hotel so didn t feel terribly safe Laissez faire attitude if manager and reception Lack lustre 4 not 5 , Location
300556,Grange City Hotel, The view from our window was the tube station but didn t really bother me , Staff were very helpful and always willing to help Rooms were clean and tidy and location was perfect Would highly recommend 
300557,Grange City Hotel, No ice machines on any hallways A C unit started to drip on carpet behind door but we told staff in the a m and they had it fixed by that evening when we returned , Hotel very convenient close to Tower tube stop and DLR Several good pubs restaurants within short walking distance Room was large with larger than usual bathroom Unfortunately our view was of air conditioning units electrical boxes on the other floors of the building We paid 1 267 for a room with 2 doubles for 4 nights Wed Thurs Good Friday Sat nights checked out Easter Sunday a m Room was as pictured 
300558,Grange City Hotel, No parking facilities and perhaps bathrooms need updated , Beautiful room with fantastic view of the tower bridge Beds were so comfortable the spa was amazing Would definitely stay again Great location Tower Hill station just a minute away 
300559,Grange City Hotel, Restaurant Chair was broken staff unhelpful hot plates with no warning Waitress dropped a fork on my foot Over priced for the service we received sadly Apart from that the rest of hotel is amazing , Super comfy bed Lovely complimentary cheesecake left in our room for a birthday guest Beautiful Spa Well dressed and friendly staff Love this hotel Perfect location
300560,Grange City Hotel, my mum was not able to have a shower as the bath was so high she was frightened she would slip either getting in or out , it was my mum s birthday present 86 from me and she lost her husband my dad after being married for 65 years last year we were given a room with a view of the tower and the bridge which she loved the staff were friendly helpful and very personable 
300561,Grange City Hotel, Room was tiny almost too small for a couple sharing Would ve been fine for 1 night but there was nowhere to put your toiletries etc Plus the water wasn t very hot in the mornings for showers , Comfy bed and pillows Really close to the tube station and Tower of London
300562,Grange City Hotel, The temperature of the jacoozi was off on both days It was too hot on the first day and too cold on the second day , The staff were great They were very respectful and very helpful with providing directions 
300563,Grange City Hotel, Bed was a pull down bed I believe it was comfortable enough for one night but I wouldn t want to have slept on it for many more nights than that , Ease of checking in and out no big queues like you often get at hotel receptions
300564,Grange City Hotel,No Negative, We asked for a view we got a view to the Tower bridge We asked for 2 rooms close to each other we got that Pool and saunas just amazing So close to the metro Staff proffessional in every detail Thank you 
300565,Grange City Hotel, The noise of the Lifts as our room was right next to them View was of the Train tracks too which felt a bit exposing , The bed was very comfortable and room was well stocked with tea coffee and mini bar Very clean 
300566,Grange City Hotel, Room service food arrived Luke warm The jacuzzi was out of use The room cost 225 00 and didn t include breakfast , location good room request forefilled Staff helpful and polite Bed comfortable 
300567,Grange City Hotel, Breakfast included in the price, Amazing location overlooking the Tower of London Upgraded room and very comfortable beds especially as the 3rd bed was a sofa bed
300568,Grange City Hotel,No Negative, Perfect room great view and perfect service at the front desk Henry Also the assistance of the congierge was excellent 20 Meters from Tower Hill subway and very near Tower Bridge Great location 
300569,Grange City Hotel, The only thing I think let the visit down was breakfast Being shipped into the side restaurant The seating in the main breakfast area could be improved as they chairs are the most uncomfortable , The room facilities were great and the bed was extra comfy I have a bad back so this is important to me The use of the SPA was amazing and the weekend was great thanks to everyone 
300570,Grange City Hotel, Only downside was cost of breakfast after spending 200 plus on room for a night , Staff very friendly and helpful Location far enough away from hustle and bustle of the city but near enough to attractions and theatre 
300571,Grange City Hotel, The tiles in the bathroom looked like they hadnt been cleaned in weeks The heater was blowing cold air regardless the setting it was on The shower head was dirty, The room was comfy the elevator was rapid Spa facilities were second to none Reception was straight forward no hassle Presentation was lovely 
300572,Grange City Hotel, A bit noisy from the road side room But the opposite side room was fine , Close to the Gare de nord It took around 10 mins Had a good bacury near the hotel Room condition was good with very hot water Hope to have splippers 
300573,Grange City Hotel, For this price this hotel totally lacks comfort and Everytime it feels like 2 for a price of 4 5 Everything is tired and old If you are staying not one the top floors you will have a very small windows overlooking a wall You will be followed by strange technical sounds everytime you visit bathroom You will experience problems with your key cards 2 times in 4 days which will led you to reception and no excuses or explanations followed The bar and restaurant here are extemely uncomfortable and uninvinting Breakfast costs 22 pounds for a very simple 2 staff and a long queue for omlet station with one lazy person here Juice is very chemical and totally awful I suggest going anywhere around you will get a fresh breakfast for 10 12 pounds Tried a laundry here but they never helped with the stuff on my trousers solved that with only one laundry at home The funny thing on top of all of this is a broken cheap hairdryer from 70 s Would recommend to find another hotel as there is much to choose from in that area , The only positive thing is a convenient location near Tower Hall metro station Circular Line 
300574,Grange City Hotel,No Negative, Friendly welcome excellent feel to the Hotel an excellent very large room and comfortable aircon Great location for the Tower of London and the Southbank by Hays Galleria Very good price 
300575,Grange City Hotel, Bedroom view overlooking Fenchurch train station Had to keep blinds down all the time and windows were locked shut Not good in the summer Although air conditioning was not very effective in January , Comfy beds good service Close to St Katherine s Dock 
300576,Grange City Hotel, The room was small and hot I didn t sleep at all that night I was disappointed with the cocktails we paid 11 and it came in a small cocktail glass wasn t worth the money The offer on booking com was reasonable but should have come with continental breakfast , The location facilities was great room clean and cosy The restaurant Forum was excellent couldn t fault it 
300577,Grange City Hotel, Very minor details The water in the Jacuzzi was very highly chlorinated and irritating to breathe after a while , The SPA area is truly satisfying nd was my favourite part of the hotel stay It offers a decent size illuminated swimming pool 1 2mt deep throughout a sauna chromotherapy shower truly minty steam room an aromatherapy room with very heated tiled seating and no steam but not as hot as the sauna fairy lights and a very spacious seating area and last but not least a powerful jet Jacuzzi All very clean and well decorated and maintained I left feeling truly relaxed and my shoulders have never felt looser Must visit There are reasonably priced treatments on offer in the beauty parlour situated next to the Spa to be booked in advance offering from massages and facials to waxing Lockers are available The restaurants are accessible through an exit that fronts a very beautiful historical part of London an authentic portion of Roman wall which can be seen at the back of the parking bay next to the reception The hotel offers to store your luggage on the check out day so that you can spend one last day visiting the local area without carrying bags everywhere Just ask the Concierge The room was clean and the bathroom marble tiled and spotless Room service is not too expensive and the vegetables were cooked to perfection 
300578,Grange City Hotel, The little details just weren t up to scratch Had we been staying more than one night I would have complained 1 towels had threads running so they looked and felt old and tatty 2 we had to request robes for the room which were listed as being included 3 only one sheet of note paper was left on the pad next to the phone and no pen here either despite the indentation in the stand 4 staining that looked like coffee drops on the bedding edges of the blinds were very tatty as they are old and worn 5 some channels on the TV had no sound 6 the hairdryer was left in the drawer with the back broken we managed to replace the back ourselves to ensure safe usage 7 3 of the 4 plug sockets in the room were unusable None of these things on their own is a significant issue but the collection of small things definitely ended up having a negative impact on our experience We were waiting for things to go awry or be less than perfect NB This was all in a room we were moved to after having initially been placed next to the lift shaft with the constant racket of the motor kicking in ,No Positive
300579,Grange City Hotel, In the room hot water not really working very small water pressure Told staff but nothing was improved , Comfortable room Good location mext to tower hill station 
300580,Grange City Hotel, Restaurant needs updating refreshing Cost of the breakfast was too expensive and children should be free , The location was right next to Towrr Bridge tube station and within a few minutes walk of tower bridge the Tower of London and the river Piccadilly was about 12 in a cab away for New Year s Day parade but we were quite happy to stay local The first day we were ice skating in front of the Tower of London then went for a burger very close by are Zizzi and Gourmet Burger company What we also discovered was across the road at Keepers you can buy full breakfast including cooked breakfast for 16 per adult and children free whereas a continental breakfast at the hotel was 23 an adult and half that price for a child We didn t try the hotel breakfast however did have room service which was reasonably priced and tasty We didn t eat in any of the restaurants as I do t like sushi and the other restaurant looked so empty and dreary ISIS bar was friendly and nice to sit with a glass of wine The hotel itself was lively Spa and pool really nice Our room was huge which was a twin double and also a cot was provided Nothing was too much trouble and even when my pushchair inner tube had a hole in it the hotel leant me a pushchair for the duration of my stay 4 days 3 nights Apart from the cost of the breakfast and the restaurant looking so uninviting the hotel was brilliant Great location for three Tower of London Thames cruises and tower bridge Definitely reccomeneded Keepers across the road for breakfast and and evening meal and drink Room very clean and comfortable and we had a lovely stay for new year If you want the west end Piccadilly etc it s all accessible by the tube but we cabbed it everywhere as it was easier with 2 small children and also visited Hyde park winter wonderland which cost around 14 I also had a facial in the spa which was very nice and the pool was lovely Towels are provided for free but no robes if only swimming Changing area clean and tidy I would definitely stay again 
300581,Grange City Hotel, The bath clearly had not been cleaned from previous guest as there was a ring of dirt and hair around the bath The bed was large and comfortable but the sheets did not fit properly and became uncomfortable during the night I also informed the hotel I required non feather pillows but only 3 of the 4 pillows on the bed had been replaced The bar lounge shut relatively early and there was a lack of suitable space for guests arriving from America at midnight to relax and get together to plan the next day Breakfast was good but very overpriced , Rooms are very well appointed and large for a London hotel The staff were friendly and helpful and breakfast was good quality I would stay here again 
300582,Grange City Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and upgraded us to a bigger roomy for no extra charge The hotel is in a good position and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves 
300583,Grange City Hotel, Single beds with different quilts had asked for a double room View of the station platform meant we couldn t open the blinds in the morning without being in full view of the passengers, Room decor
300584,Grange City Hotel,No Negative, Very central clean and staff where all very very friendly we got upgraded and or rooms wher great great view and loads of room all attractions and tube station where so close tower bridge Tower of London ice skating river bank lovely pubs and restaurants we will be back
300585,Grange City Hotel, A little disappointed with the shower given that it is a five star hotel Bath shower combo only and water pressure wasn t great Small issue but would add a nice final touch to the rooms , Lovely hotel with friendly and helpful staff Great location and spa is great for a little relaxation The resident bar is great for a nightcap too 
300586,Grange City Hotel, Apart from the reception staff every other member of staff we encountered from the wine bar to dining room to breakfast chef was rude miserable and acted as though your question or enquiry was a complete waste of their time and an inconvenience The week before Christmas and not one festive or happy interaction with any of them and we were there four days At a cost of 1300 pounds you would expect better customer service for certain , Beautiful property with good sized rooms and a great location so close to Tower of London Taxi rank and train stations right outside Great base to visit attractions 
300587,Grange City Hotel, Check in was not great Staff were confusing and unclear Left waiting at Concierge s desk with no one attending and four on check in just looking on After 10 minutes I had to approach them Maid came to clean while we were still getting ready to leave and an hour before check out time Did not knock , Lots of space in the room in fact too much 
300588,Grange City Hotel, Staff could of assisted with bags and pushchair as no access Bathroom looked tired and carpet needed a hoover Changing rooms needed doing up, Nice size room comfy bed all amenities Spa facilities good
300589,Grange City Hotel, Nothing could not find fault, Lovely location beautiful facilities and also bonus upgraded room like suite massive balcony overl looking the Thames and tower bridge highly recommend hotel 
300590,Grange City Hotel, Quite limited choice of evening meals Very poor meal in ISIS bar although the bar itself is a nice place to unwind with a drink after a busy day We had to ask for the heating to be repaired in our room quite cold during our first night but it was repaired promptly and worked efficiently if a bit noisily , Comfortable room nice to have small balcony Very pleasant staff Nicely decorated for Christmas without being OTT Close to underground station and access to Thames river boats easy to get about Very close to restaurants in St Kathrine s Dock Not far to walk over Tower Bridge to the Shard or the south bank restaurants 
300591,Grange City Hotel, Temperature in room way too high So had to use aircon in November in London , Very nice spacious room free upgrade from room booked Plus very good spa pool
300592,Grange City Hotel, Breakfast wasn t included so we visited Borough Market for breakfast a tasty alternative , We received a free upgrade upon check it which was so lovely The view from the room was amazing Tower Bridge and Tower Hill have stayed here once before and it is a quiet part of town but an easy walk to the Thames Borough Market and Southwalk 
300593,Grange City Hotel, The prices of the minibar was a joke , My request was a room with a nice view and the room chosen was lovely Perfect stay and can t wait to return 
300594,Grange City Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful room on 11th floor amazing view from room of the Tower of London Service impecabale Spa great and excellent way to relax after hectic week 
300595,Grange City Hotel, Sadly my shower didn t work properly I ended with the knob in my hand It was either scalding hot or ice cold no use in having the luxuries if you don t have the basics , Perfect location Beautiful rooms Very spacious 
300596,Grange City Hotel, price quality room rate incl breakfast would have been better, Overall nice and comfortable hotel nice rooms swimming and wellness good central location
300597,Grange City Hotel, Breakfast prices far too high , Beautiful hotel perfect location Luxurious comfortable Spotlessly clean Nice leisure facilities Professional accommodating service Room service good A real treat 
300598,Grange City Hotel, Constant noise We were on the 8th floor Lovely room but very noisy when I asked reception what on earth the noise was because we hardly got any sleep and she said it must have been the trains , Location was excellent 
300599,Grange City Hotel, The hotel is on a downslide The room was worn down and the feeling was that the hotel is put on hold in terms of develompment The staff is helpful but not super alert the breakfast is the old english style and not updated in freshnes and health , Close to subway quiet room and training facilities
300600,Grange City Hotel, We stayed in a room with two double beds family of 4 children aged 14 and 11 Beds were far too soft ended rolling together and aching back Too many large scatter cushions with no where to put them except the floor making an obstacle course Bathroom far too small for four people and no where to hang towels Looked like someone had tried to open the glazing to open a window in order to smoke as the glazing was loose and cigarette ash between glazing and window sill Good breakfast but thought the set up of large dinning room felt like a residential home for the elderly , The staff were extremely polite Swimming pool very nice good choice at breakfast Easy location 
300601,Grange City Hotel, Didn t have breakfast 23 a head , Very good value Friday night deal Two double beds large room with a partial view of the Tower of London and Tower Bridge 
300602,Grange City Hotel, Although the barman was really excellent I didn t appreciate there was a 2 30 service charge on top I m not used to this I do hope the barman gets this charge instead of the hotel I also had to book an extra night and the room rate had increased by 40 , I loved the decor of this place the inlaid wood throughout is really nice well appointed hotel It was really convenient for the tube and the meeting I was attending nearby Parking is in a multistorey 5 minutes walk away 
300603,Grange City Hotel, Not much breakfast should have been included , Great hotel with a very good location Facilities including gym and pool were top notch Staff very friendly and helpful 
300604,Grange City Hotel, the cleaner got rid of my personal items and we found the breakfast was far too expensive and was only luck warm and bacon was hard, the room and the view was excellent facilities overall were good reception staff were great
300605,Grange City Hotel, The suite we got was a very good room the bed was very good the sheets were very nice The down side was the noise from the lift all night it felt like were in the lift shaft The Hotel is very good and I am sure not all the rooms would have this noise just a shame we did Our room was 801 Its a big shame about the sounds from the lift as this did spoil a very good room I am sure it could be sorted as never had that much noise even from much cheaper hotels , The staff on check in were very helpful The room I had booked on the web site was a much bigger room and we were not given this to start with When I went and checked they did move us to a much bigger room The pool area is very good and was a real plus to use on Sunday morning 
300606,Grange City Hotel, view of the room on a train platform Lack of privacy Purely functional no attention such welcome message free bottle water no Gideon Bible no pen no paper , location
300607,Grange City Hotel, We were a group in two rooms but it rooms were initially in separate wings which was not good Also no loungers in pool area, Great location close to river St Katherine dock and also very grand
300608,Grange City Hotel, ADVERTISING over looking tower London it would if side not have booking in way blocking view Other than that lovely, My children love the pool and the room was very nice
300609,Grange City Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful and reasonably well located It was really good value for money The staff were very friendly and really helpful We even got a free upgrade which was great as it was my partners 30th birthday The room was clean well decorated and incredibly comfortable Overall the hotel completely exceeded my expectations 
300610,Grange City Hotel, Coffe at breakfast not great Bed a little hard and crack in bathroom sink But overall liked our accommodation and stay in the hotel, Big clean room and helpful staff
300611,Grange City Hotel, When we arrived we was kept waiting to book in we was given an awful room which overlooked fenchurch st station platforms This was after I had emailed the hotel upon booking asking for a view I did manage to change the room with a very nice and helpful lady staff member which was perfect In the room we had one cup it took three staff members at different times to manage to get us a cup Probably because they didn t speak much English We had two occasions where our key didn t work so had to come down from the 11th floor to reception to get it re programmed Not that impressed for the money however the room was exceptional with the view , The location was excellent which is why we booked it Our eventual room was excellent and the leisure facilities were good too other than the pool which was far too cold 
300612,Grange City Hotel, The housekeeping was a bit eratic we stayed in a group and some of us had the luxury of having our beds turned down and chocolates on the pillow whereas others didn t and we had all paid the same price Some items weren t clean on arrival but we were pushing for early check in so allowances have to be mad , All the staff were very friendly and helpful the pool is huge and the views towards the Tower of London made you feel that you were really in the heart of the City Easy access via the Thames to Millenium wheel and easy access to remainder of London attractions via Tower Bridge underground situated really close to the Hotel 
300613,Grange City Hotel, The room was hot It does have air conditioning but it was freakishly hot in the hotel Kept me awake at night turning the air con on and off The hotel is nice but is a mixture of classic and modern probably should be one or the other preferably modern Room a Service food was just average , Location by London Bridge lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance 
300614,Grange City Hotel, The air conditioner was pretty useless and the bed really firm which I guess suits some but I prefer a pillow top, Great location Loved the room balcony which actually had a good view room 604 and the pool was fantastic 
300615,Grange City Hotel, Cannot think of any negatives , Our room had a good view of London s skyline It was quiet and the bed very comfortable Location was excellent to the venue we were attending for a wine tasting evening We had room service and the food was very good 
300616,Grange City Hotel, A shame on this occasion our room was rather small and located immediately opposite the Fenchurch Station we were overlooked directly from the station platform We ve stayed at this Hotel before and had a far superior room for the same price It would not put me off staying here again , Bed very comfy the best nights sleep in a long time I love this Hotel especially it s location The staff are always very friendly and helpful 
300617,Grange City Hotel, The room was way too hot and the ac was too loud Also when we were there the fire alarms went off at 5 15am and there was no one able to switch it off until 6 30am We weren t offered any discounts as a result , The pool and spa was great 
300618,Grange City Hotel, The beds were horrendous and the pool was far too cold to use , The staff and location were fantastic the bar staff were faultless and everyone had been extremely welcoming x
300619,Grange City Hotel, Bottled water in the rooms would have been good also more towels when there are 4 of you in one room 2 towels don t go far , Hotel was really nice and a great location 
300620,Grange City Hotel, For a 5 hotel we expected dressing gowns and slippers as standard Body lotion and the little extras in the bathroom Up to date information in the Information Booklet ice machines are NOT located on all floors as stated Beds were only doubles as standard We were not informed of where the restaurant and facilities were within the hotel I d rate it as 3 4 only , Leisure facilities and location were great Room was clean and upgraded free to a bigger room 
300621,Grange City Hotel, The air conditioning in our room was exceedingly noisy so much that we decided to switch it off and sleep with an open window Not a huge discomfort but not adequate for a hotel of this level had we stayed longer or in a hotter period I would definitely have complained to the staff , We were in London for a city break and the hotel s position was perfect 200 metres from Tower Hill 50 from the underground station Room furniture cleanliness and services are what you should expect from a five star structure The swimming pool is a big plus if you are staying for more days Price adequate to the level and position of the hotel 
300622,Grange City Hotel, Breakfasts need to be sensibly priced How much does a bowl of Bran flakes and an egg cost , Bathroom excellent two showers Beds Good but a little hard for my back Breakfast Hideously expensive We went out and got a good breakfast two minutes down the road at a sensible price Food was good otherwise and at a price comparable with outside
300623,Grange City Hotel, The hotel was lovely but the bathroom in our room was a bit tired and could be updated other than that we loved our stay would definitely book again , Loved the helpful staff pool facilities and fantastic location 
300624,Grange City Hotel, Our friends weren t impressed with looking directly at a train station We all had trouble with the showers the head leaking above the joint so went over the screen onto the floor Our guests friends had similar issues but with the adjustment coming off in their hands , Friendly helpful staff we had reasonably good view The location was excellent The room was clean 
300625,Grange City Hotel, We arrived early to the hotel before check in we were told our room wasn t ready however we could check in pay and leave our bags We came back an hour later to get our room key which I thought was going to be pretty straight forward The lady at reception said that our room had been taken and she was looking for another room Slightly disappointed the fact I had already paid for my room to be told it had been taken and put in a different room ,No Positive
300626,Grange City Hotel, The ice machine wasn t working but they brought me up an ice bucket full of ice The menu doesn t have a lot of deserts and isn t varied enough for night owls like me The air conditioning wasn t cool and the room got a bit stuffy so not great for humid summer months , The rooms are really a good size if you stay in a double ask for a double with a sofa The staff are helpful I felt right at home The pool and health facilities are great to refresh yourself The location is great for walks around the historic area 
300627,Grange City Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful the staff were very friendly and well mannered When we arrived we got a complimentary upgrade from a superior room to a penthouse suite It was an incredible experience Really lovely
300628,Grange City Hotel, Nothing , Great location friendly staff clean and also nice room size Free access to swimming pool that s cool Why swim in the Thames when you can relax here 
300629,Grange City Hotel, One small thing We couldn t open our windows so had to have air con running as it was a warm day air con was noisy I prefer fresh air , This hotel and our stay there only one night was just great we had everything we needed The room was very comfortable the staff were friendly and helpful Homemade scones delicious We made use of the pool which was good and not too busy 
300630,Grange City Hotel, We were above a courtyard which started playing music just after 9pm then again at 11pm so my child did not get to sleep until 2am Woken at 3am by loud guests staying in the room next door Could here the toilets above being flushed , Close to everything we needed 
300631,Grange City Hotel, The gym was not manned so no one to give advice on how to use equipment Staff at reception poorly trained they asked for my credit card 4 times during my one night stay even though I had given this to Booking com Generally poor value esp 17 for a continental breakfast which should have been included , Central location and good conference facilities 
300632,Grange City Hotel, None, clean well staffed the front of house team smiling and helpful Spa team helpful and smiling too Bar staff were spot on and were more than happy to help with a night cap 5 star hotel that delivered 5 star treatment well done and thank you Robb Kate Seber
300633,Grange City Hotel, The fact that they took 100 off my card when I checked in which left me with 25 for a days stay and to get food I advised I was there to run the London Marathon and wouldn t be using any extras The 2 different members didn t seem to understand or care When I asked why wasnt I advised instead of them just taking the money the reply was I dont know That 100 was to but food etc before I ran It took 3 days before that money was paid back in my account Robbery , The rooms 
300634,Grange City Hotel, Beds were uncomfortable and they had big square sofa cushions instead of pillows Staff dont give you much information They took the money upfront plus a 150 deposit which they didnt tell us they were planning on doing before we got there , The room service was fantastic Also left newspapers outside the door for us to read which was a nice gesture Sauna and spa are great
300635,Grange City Hotel, The air conditioning in out room didn t seem to work properly It was too hot for my liking no issues from my partner though , The staff were so accommodating we got upgraded as it was my partners birthday that was a really nice touch 
300636,Grange City Hotel, My only negative is how warm hot the rooms get how noisy the air con is , Excellent location Close to Tower Hill tube station Huge room overlooking Tower of London 8th floor twin to 2 double beds I suspect floors on lower levels have a very restricted view Friendly helpful staff Quiet rooms Excellent 
300637,Grange City Hotel, There were too many cushions on the bed There were no sockets near the bed The shower took some figuring out as the hot cold etc had worn off AC was too noisy Room window was overlooked by Fenchurch Station Platform so the blind was permanantly down , The bed was very comfortable Location was very good
300638,Grange City Hotel, Arrived at our room and the temperature was really warm It was a hot day so that was understandable except when we turned the air con to the lowest setting it was blowing out warm air, Location was excellent Right next to tube station and 5 mins to tower of London
300639,Grange City Hotel, No lounge bar area well there was a pub type thing with football on large TV s not really what you d expect for a 5 star hotel I expect a relaxing lounge not a pub with TV Disappointed that despite us informing of a special occasion and selecting the higher spec room was not a great view and there was no acknowledgement of the occasion For me I have stayed in 4 star which felt more luxurious and special than this hotel PS Dreadful hairdryer have had better at Travelodge and that s saying something , Bed comfy room facilities good but nothing really special Bathroom pretty small but robe and towels good quality 
300640,Grange City Hotel, Hotel breakfast would have 23 each can recommend instead C te Brasserie St Katharine Docks less than 10 mins away by the Tower Bridge , Location is great for the Tower of London Tower Bridge Borough Market Shard etc 
300641,Grange City Hotel, Our room although very lovely was right next to the elevator shaft and it whooshed all night , It was right next to the tube and handy for the Tower and Tower Bridge The hotel was clean and very comfy the staff were helpful and friendly and the leisure centre was excellent 
300642,Grange City Hotel, We returned at 5 15pm after running to find that our room hadn t been cleaned at all when all we wanted to do was to relax and recharge Despite the fact that I reported this immediately I still had to explain again on check out The duty manager was very dismissive and claimed the most he could do was to apologise and waive the cost of breakfast He also promised to e mail with details to enable discount for a future stay I m still waiting for this e mail 3 days later In addition breakfast is extortionate given the quality and the level of service I d definitely advise to give this hotel a miss , We stayed here as we were running the London marathon and the location was great

300650,Grange City Hotel, 2 empty cans of beer left on the side in the room and a note from the previous guest complaining about the room cleanliness Disappointing that they didn t clean the room prior to arrival 140 for one night You would expect to not sleep in a dirty room ,No Positive

300654,Grange City Hotel, Stayed in room 201 and the bed was a pull out bed which I find appalling as I paid for an executive room It was not comfortable and had a thin mattress The carpet was coming up at the join in the middle of the room and the hairdryer connection at the back of the draw when I pulled the draw out to get the hairdryer to work was aweful The cleanliness of the bathroom could have been better too as there was dirt in some places , Booked an executive suite and the room Was massive Really happy with the size and the staff were brilliant The spa was also amazing and loved the time we spent there 
300655,Grange City Hotel, A little disappointed my Mother in Law e mailed the hotel telling them I was staying there as part of a 40 treat she requested for us to get a Tower room which we didn t no acknowledgement of this even,No Positive
300656,Grange City Hotel, We were promised a few things in the advert on booking com that we did not receive on arrival to the hotel Had I have known this I wouldn t have paid a higher rate for an executive room It didn t look like the Executive room in the picture just looked like a superior Considering we did pay nearly 75 more to receive the nicer room with the Facilities mentioned , The staff were lovely The bed was very comfortable and the view from the 11th floor was phenomenal 
300657,Grange City Hotel, The spa was average Jacuzzi wasn t working spa staff unhelpful and seemed like they were always confused Needs updating and no sun loungers to relax on , Great location Spacious room with comfy beds Staff were helpful in the reception 
300658,Grange City Hotel, The cost of the breakfast when you can go 200 yards and get the same breakfast for fraction on the price No complimentary water in room, Location was excellent
300659,Grange City Hotel, Breakfast is outrageously expensive 17 50 for Continental breakfast I couldn t eat enough food to make it worth that Full English was an eye watering 23 00 Yes really 23 00 I d expect a whole pig for that The range of breakfast foods on Saturday was nowhere near as wide as Friday That made the value at 17 50 for Continental even worse on Saturday The croissants were rather poor Seemed like the cheap ones from the supermarket I ll stay at the Doubletree almost next door next time , Great location near Tower Bridge close to the Underground and Fenchurch Street station America Square and The City which suited my business and travel needs perfectly Nice hotel very helpful staff 
300660,Grange City Hotel, Location a little far from the centre No car park major downside My room service wine was corked and the second night I was only delivered one glass instead of a bottle I was charged for a bottle but it was very quickly taken off the bill at the end , Staff were incredibly helpful After I had checked out I found I had left my keys in the safe They arranged a taxi to collect them from the hotel and then deliver them to me waiting in the car park at Olympia Facilities were very good Hotel was clean and well maintained Room service was good

300663,Grange City Hotel, Breakfast was too much money, Great location for Tower of London and London Bridge Plenty of Taxis outside and close to tube Parking 5minutes away but cheap for London
300664,Grange City Hotel, Bar and food prices are expensive especially breakfast when there is a Wetherspoons across the road , Rooms were well presented comfortable and clean 
300665,Grange City Hotel, Bar staff not very friendly and service definitely not that of a 5 star hotel In the dining room at breakfast chairs uncomfortable sink into seat base and frame digs in to leg need replacing, Great location fantastic swimming pool cleanliness of bedroom and bathroom
300666,Grange City Hotel, The mess at Tower Hill Station was annoyihg but can t be helped and the people constantly approaching you for money , The service staff were fantastic and the position was great The rooms a re quite sound proof and so the train could not be heard during the night 
300667,Grange City Hotel, Everything was fab The shower could have been a tad modern but everything was great overall, Bed was extra comfy Complimentary upgrade Lovely nights stay 
300668,Grange City Hotel, Hours of the pool as I have older children this was frustrating as they can swim frequently use saunas jacuzzis etc know how to behave etc but could only use pool at inconvenient children s times , Very friendly helpful staff 
300669,Grange City Hotel, I couldn t get to sleep all night as our heating did not work, Had a few issues with room ect no heating didn t sleep tap was very sharp and a cut my finger on it food was undercooked bad night sleep to tv kept turning of
300670,Grange City Hotel, staff did a poor job of looking after us while the whole ordeal was going on with our lock The rooms need to be insulated more could hear everything from the adjacent room and the hallway, The Manager on the night Vishant stepped up and made up for failings in the hotel when a we were locked out of our room for almost an hour while in wed gear hair b staff did a poor job of looking after us while the whole ordeal was going on Kudos to the Manager for hooking us up with a better room and complimentary breakfast
300671,Grange City Hotel, Poor view from the room overlooking the Fenchurch Street Railway line in fact people on the train could see into the room if the curtains were open, Location for the underground station into central West End Close to attractions including Tower Bridge Very comfortable room
300672,Grange City Hotel, The spa facilities need reviewing The steam room omitted far too much eucalyptus it made everyone s eyes smart and the warm room was sooo uncomfortably hot to sit even on a towel I couldn t stay for more than couple minutes At breakfast we req soft boiled eggs mine arrived 10 mins before my husbands his arrived with no cup holder they d run out Tea was served by thermos no pots so it has to be as it comes really not 5 star in my opinion Room was so small right on train tracks virtually and right next to lift so noisy Don t stay in room 221 As repeat customers thought they might have given a better room No atmosphere in the wine lounge which is a sushi bar too And no complimentary water or robes , Location was good for this trip Liked the fact it had a spa but wasn t 5 star Near tower underground 
300673,Grange City Hotel, Our room was at the back of the hotel and on Saturday night all we could hear was the sound of a night club I like music but loud drum and base wasn t great we did get moved though but not good when you have to move at 2 in the morning and check out is at 11,No Positive
300674,Grange City Hotel, The room was upgraded for free but no breakfast was included The breakfast prices are way to much the upside is that there is a pub at a few paces from the hotel that serves breakfast for a very good price around 3 for a full English breakfast , A hotel on Tower Hill is perfect for a long or short stay in one of the most facinating cities of the world Tube station nearby quiet at night a variety of good restaurants in the direct aproximity near the Tower tower bridge and the very nice harbour area 
300675,Grange City Hotel, Mostly everything rude staff useless management less than average furniture quality no much cleanness dirty bedding cold water and heater You name it Too much expensive for no reason Absolutely not a 4star hotel , Location 
300676,Grange City Hotel, I think when you pay almost 400 for two night breakfast should have been included but it wasn t I know it s London City and prices are steep but that could have been nice , The swimmingpool and the gym was great Furthermore the room was quite spacy which comfortable 
300677,Grange City Hotel, Two new hotels being constructed in front of the hotel so views are obscured Workmen not so far away and can see directly in the window , Spotless Comfortable rooms and bed Location is great Room service full english and contiental breakfast was beautiful
300678,Grange City Hotel, Concierge very unfriendly Hallway outside room had a used breakfast tray from previous guest sitting there upon arrival It remained there for 24 hours Also interior design was bizarre , Excellent price
300679,Grange City Hotel, All exec rooms were described to have a guaranteed view of tower bridge or the city as written in the guest information guide mine had a view of the rear courtyard Moved to a higher floor view still overlooking same area but better but room not as nice as original makes me wonder if it was an exec room i was moved to Apart from that would recommend,No Positive
300680,Grange City Hotel, The jacuzzi wasn t working properly and was the main thing we looked forward to after our spa treatment, The comfortable bed hot drinks biscuits and newest magazines in our hotel room The massages we both had and general experience

300699,Grange City Hotel, Only 2 things I could think to improve would be tea and coffee making facilities in the room compared to everything else they looked cheap and the bose sound system Also 1 woman looked drunk and asleep in the lobby but I d rather she was safe than on the street so good on them , Staff were polite and didn t object to our drunken 3am wander to go see the Roman wall Can t comment on facilities as we didn t use any Room was huge really clean bath and separate shower in the toilet
