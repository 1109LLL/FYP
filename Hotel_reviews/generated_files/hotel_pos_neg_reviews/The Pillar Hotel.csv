81158,The Pillar Hotel, Nothing, Ideally placed for buses tube into central London Ample free car parking on site and only 5 mins from the M1 Quirky hotel with excellent service from all the staff Much better than big named hotels Highly recommended 
81159,The Pillar Hotel, So disappointed Not a 4 star hotel at all More like a fancy bed and breakfast I stayed at Hendon Hall which is 3 mins away a few days before and that was more like a four star hotel no room service no decent view no restaurant except breakfast in the morning if you ask for something to be bought up to the room expect hesitation like they don t want to do it They ll bring it up in the end but it s like they re doing you a favor, Nice modern room Really nice bathroom with rain shower Close to where i needed to be
81160,The Pillar Hotel, The hotel is great location is little far from the city breakfast is very good and it s kosher The room we got was good but was outside from the hotel himself little disappointing but overall was good place to stay Price are little too high,No Positive
81161,The Pillar Hotel, Some basic elements in the room were not there but when we asked for them the staff was happy to bring them and did it rapidly and with a smile, The place itself is a charming old style hotel with very comfortable rooms The neighborhood is quite and nice and the hotel is less than 10 minutes away from the subway downtown 
81162,The Pillar Hotel, I really can t say there was anything that I didn t like it s a beautiful hotel and although a little pricey you couldn t ask for friendlier service, The staff where all very friendly and the service was excellent The room was really clean beautiful bathroom and very quiet area Outstanding
81163,The Pillar Hotel, It was expensive for what it was and I would hope that on a night when Wembley was not full it would be a lot cheaper, The room was a good size and clean The breakfast was lovely and night staff were VERY helpful 
81164,The Pillar Hotel, The bathroom was very very small I emailed after my stay with a concern regarding the stay and did not get a reply As I had already paid for the room etc A few small issues with the room i e Lamp not working items left over from previous guests Breakfast an expensive extra not included,No Positive
81165,The Pillar Hotel, The staff weren t very friendly The room we were allocated was in a separate building right on the main road and it was very noisy The pillows were hard There is no bar or restaurant which is strange , Excellent location for Wembley Stadium The bus stop is just outside the hotel and it s just a 20 min journey Ample safe parking The rooms were really clean The hotel provided complimentary tea and cakes all day and they were lovely 
81166,The Pillar Hotel,No Negative, Very pleasant outer London hotel Staff were friendly and helpful lots of parking breakfast was very nice not cooked but a nice range And air conditioned which was good because I happened to pick a heatwave weekend 
81167,The Pillar Hotel, Bathroom has a slightly damp smell but was otherwise very clean , Friendly staff free parking nice room with a comfortable bed It was very easy to drive to and there were no congestion charges Lovely part of London with a nice park nearby 
81168,The Pillar Hotel, For the price they charge breakfast should have been included but they do have cakes and coffee tea and juices all day long at no extra charge , The hotel is very quaint excellent location and near kosher restaurants bakeries and super markets
81169,The Pillar Hotel,No Negative, I stayed for one night The hotel was exceptional Clean rooms friendly staff and a great breakfast Really good hotel I will visit again for sure when I am back in London 
81170,The Pillar Hotel,No Negative, Very nice hotel friendly staff great location for us room was very clean and bed very comfortable love the fact there was jar of milk instead of little cartons and large bottle water would defiantly stay again if in area and recommend 
81171,The Pillar Hotel, The receptionist seemed a little surprised that two men wanted to share a bed She even reminded us that we could have two singles for the same price , The accomodation was immaculate It looked great and the quality of the accommodation and facilties were excellant The room came complete with a free safe too The hotel is close to ammenties and public transport links 
81172,The Pillar Hotel, We checked in we were given a room in the gatehouse section of the hotel Now I know the hotel was not busy it was boxing day and only one other guests car in the car park Yet we were dumped in the cold damp section of the hotel probably best only used for the busy summer tourist season The wallpaper was splitting at the seams and peeling from the wall there were cracks all over the ceiling the bathroom although recently refitted was obviously done by cheap unskilled labour I could press the large tiles under the mirror and they would bow and flex into the void behind them Though I did not do this too much as I feared the large mirror would come crashing down The grouting was terrible too or even completely missing The small wooden threshold bordering the bedroom carpet to the bathroom tiles was bowed so every time I stood on it it would flatten down leaving the nail head to stick up very nice for when you walk into the bathroom barefooted But most of all it was cold and damp We stayed in the room an hour and a half but we could not get heat into the room and were not only not satisfied I was annoyed at being mugged off I complained and one of the ladies on the desk seemed a little snobby to start with though she did show us two rooms inside the main building and eventually gave us a free upgrade to a superior room Which was warm and comfortable and well decorated But why do hotel do this I thought it was just me but the more people I talk to this seems common practice to give out the crappy rooms first The second lady on reception even admitted she did not like the gatehouse room when she helped us with our luggage yet she was the one who had initially booked us in and chose the room I have a rule now If I have to complain about the room I never use the hotel again The other thing though minor compared to the room is they have no hot breakfast just a continental breakfast , The stay at this hotel would have been nice if they had simply given us a decent room in the first place But they didn t so I am struggling to find something about this hotel that I really did like 
81173,The Pillar Hotel, Far too expensive for what we got The room was rather small for the price I felt a bit inconfortable to switch the TV on in the main living area since it was shabbat religious practice and there was few families around , Free tea cake and fruits during the day Friendly and helpful staff Very Clean and quiet environment
81174,The Pillar Hotel, Loved staying here and the rooms were beautiful Lovely place to stay and easy to commute into London, The staff were extremely friendly and the hotel was immaculate
81175,The Pillar Hotel, There was no bar and no restaurant I assumed bars restaurants were kind of standard in hotels so we were surprised that this had not been made obvious on the website We had to go and find somewhere to eat which was not that easy in this area , The hotel was very pretty built around a courtyard but we were in rooms over the gatehouse on the main road 
81176,The Pillar Hotel, Very rude night staff Poor service as was not able to sleep because my room was next to a party and had twin beds put together instead of what the page specified as a double bed Couldn t sleep and ended up with backache and neck ache worst experience ever Never again , Gorgeous hotel facilities and design 
81177,The Pillar Hotel, Nothing everything was perfect , One of the cleanest hotels iv ever stayed in I have OCD so was very satisfied Staff was lovely Nothing bad about this hotel what so ever 
81178,The Pillar Hotel, t wasn t until I got home that I realised that I had booked a Queen Room and it was quite clear that the room was a standard double in fact compared to the photos advertised it felt like we d been given the smallest room available The walls are very thin and people walking the corridors at night and early morning could be easily heard Overall I have been left rather disappointed by the experience , We visited this hotel whilst visiting London for a birthday We arrived in plenty of time and were able to check in early approx 11am as the room was ready The staff were pleasant enough and showed us the room The rooms are clean and the bathroom was good The next day they were kind enough to let me leave my car in the car park whilst we went into the city 
81179,The Pillar Hotel, Breakfast could have been cheaper , The size of the rooms were decent also the view from the room was lovely The staff members were very helpful and polite 
81180,The Pillar Hotel, Unfortunately no bar or restaurant Very good breakfast though , The stuff was friendly and helpful I had a very comfortable stay and slept extremely well If the location suits you not central of course but not too far from Hendon Central Station either it s really a nice place to stay 
81181,The Pillar Hotel, The male concierge working on reception when I checked out at 9am was very off hand and explained that he was about to leave when I arrived in reception as if I was an inconvenience It was raining outside and I had a heavy bag to carry up the steps to the car park there was no offer of any help he just watched me struggle Its a shame as it put a downer on what was otherwise a very pleasant stay , The hotel was very gothic in style and was full of character and history The room was very clean and airy and had a really comfy bed and plenty of wardrobe space The hotel although very accessible to the ever busy A406 was very quiet and had plenty of parking 
81182,The Pillar Hotel, Check in was quite poor I modified my booking via Bookings com at least 3 months prior to arrival however the hotel had no record of these changes This is the second time that I have stayed at the Pillar Hotel and the reception staff tried to indicate that the previous booking from 2014 was the same as the 2016 booking which wasn t even in the same name It took far too long for reception to sort out whatever needed to be sorted out at their end before providing the room key Also as with the previous booking we had to ask to change rooms after only a few days The rooms don t appear to be maintained as expected as the bathroom tiles were cracked and the floor moved thus creating a health problem as you could not step out of the shower with bare feet We were offered the room next door which had the same issue although to a lesser extent The room that we moved to did not have a working safe and maintenance was not available until the next day Every morning we had to call reception for amenities whether it be towels toilet paper tissues etc as housekeeping didn t replace these as expected Also every day the shower mat was placed inside the wet shower making it sopping wet and unusable There was no business centre with a computer and printing facility that could be used by guests and the staff were very inquisitive as to why such services were needed which frankly is none of their business They tried to assist in locating an internet cafe but where they sent me did not exist As one of the few decent hotels in the area it would be expected that a corner of the hotel should be converted into a business centre to allow guests to have access to necessary services that cannot be accessed via tablets , There was plenty of parking on site Location is easily accessible via road and public transport 
81183,The Pillar Hotel, Upgraded room had a pipe from upstairs so all night we heard upstairs room flushing toilets down the pipe Window was mid adjusted so we heard lots of road noise Maybe we d have been better without the upgrade to room 103 , Convenient for our required location
81184,The Pillar Hotel, Absence of a restaurant or cafeteria compensated by the provision of coffee cakes biscuits and fresh fruit in the lounge in the afternoon , The breakfast is excellent The boutique hotel has been finished to a very high standard The staff are all very friendly and helpful 
81185,The Pillar Hotel, Would have liked a gym in hotel and room to be more airy, Hotel of a high standard Room excellent though for such a class hotel felt it was a little small Very clean and well kept
81186,The Pillar Hotel, The hotel is Jewish owned and run as so This is fine of course it s a nice well run hotel but restricts the choice at breakfast and at 12 50 per head and a morning after a night out a full English was certainly missed Reading material provided is Jewish Perhaps be more open at point of booking that the hotel doesn t cater for non Jewish, Low key easy comfortable Friendly staff
81187,The Pillar Hotel, We had to depart early because my husband s mother passed away unexpectedly The hotel which had not been prepaid would not waive the cost of the final night They claimed it was because they had to pay a commission to Booking com I spoke to 3 people about this and offered to pay the commission but to no avail I was very disappointed with their lack of compassion I will also add to this my disappointment with Booking com for its inflexibility in these matters , The hotel is well located if you want to be in North London 
81188,The Pillar Hotel, No food or drinks available except breakfast I unplugged an air freshener as don t like them and soon discovered why it was plugged in the room smelt extremely musty and damp Only 1 bulb of 3 worked in the bathroom so shower area was barely lit Bed pretty hard which I don t like Hotel could use some TLC Felt photos on website a little misleading , Room well decorated Clean Basic Big car park 
81189,The Pillar Hotel, Put signs up to direct you to the room as I got lost and the absence of a resturant and bar holds this hotel back and for that I wouldn t stay again , The style of the room is lovely and cleanlyness
81190,The Pillar Hotel, When we arrived at hotel the bathroom was dirty it looked like there was excrement on the floor I didn t examine closely enough to be sure 100 When we complained to front desk instead of being apologetic they seemed to be insulted by our complaint and had the audacity to say that it couldn t have been there when we got the room and it must have been us Their attitude totally wound my wife and I up and it put a proper dampener on our weekend away ,No Positive
81191,The Pillar Hotel, Shower not up to standard as rest of fittings Standard room bit small , Excellent kosher Israeli style breakfast Boutique hotel on 2 floors beautifully reconstructed from a church Pillar of Fire Very high quality fittings and beautifully maintained Linen changed daily 
81192,The Pillar Hotel, If I was nick picking I would say the steel framework in the roof needs a clean but I m OCD I would have like a biscuit with my tea in the room , Spotless the finish on the room little things like a magnified mirror had even been thought of Lovel shower and extremely clean
