204454,The Arch London, Room was fine but not what was advertised on booking I think this was the problem with booking rather than the hotel As we were traveling with a teenage daughter we wanted a room that would cater for three I had understood that it would be two queen size beds however it was a king size and a foldaway bed which was fine but not quite what we expected , Friendly and very helpful staff Really nice ambience in the hotel Great facilities

204467,The Arch London, Room was too small even for Europe standards Previous visit I was solo and my room was bigger Even though I asked for a bigger room The desk lady was not ready to help me I guess I got unlucky with her and someone else Would have appreciated the value of a returning client, Location Cleanliness Quietness

204476,The Arch London, I did not like the size of the room A bit small but OK Overpriced in my opinion We came from the States and for the price our room would have been a suite , The greeting was a surprise Small property but quite very modern quite The restaurant was small but elegant Service good food good Front desk very helpful Easy access to the tube and a few places to eat and or shop Away for the city noise and madness
