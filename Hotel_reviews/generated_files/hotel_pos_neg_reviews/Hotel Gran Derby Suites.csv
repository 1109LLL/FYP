372735,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, Room door left open all day following cleaning could have been a disaster No tea or coffee in room outdoor pool doesn t look like image on website Hotel a little too far taxi a must although I couldn t get my bearings the whole stay , Very clean nice towels robes comfy bed
372736,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, Staff services efficiency late check out, A complete scam Overpriced with no facilities They nearly lost our passports We requested for a half an hour extension on the check out which we did not get Rude and inefficient staff Would advise against staying here 
372737,Hotel Gran Derby Suites,No Negative, i ve liked everything of this structure From the staff to the position The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel is in a perfect position close to everything but in a pacefull zone of the city 
372738,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, Phone had no number to reach front desk no instructions Room service food poor options quality Breakfast staff indifferent Didn t tell me about hot options or ask about coffee until after I selected other food Offer a to go cup, Great front desk staff Very helpful went out of their way Nice Unique room Nice shopping bag 
372739,Hotel Gran Derby Suites,No Negative, I stayed in 3 hotels during my trip in Spain and Derby is the best of it in regards of room and service Hotel room spacious and clean Staff very helpful Before arrival in Barcelona hotel sent email asking special needs requested I went with husband and 20 month daughter so I request a baby cod and a kettle also early check in since our flight was in early morning Really appreciated The hotel is not near the touristic sites so some travel needed 
372740,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, I left 250 euros in the room and informed then but they could not find it and staff did not help Im still waiting for a call Poor hotel poor hygeine The hotel smelled of bathroom Our comforter had old chewingum stuck to it,No Positive
372741,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, At moments one can here what is happening in room next door through the courtyard facing windows or in hall Sometimes annoyingly noisy Need better sound attenuation , It was nice to be off a main street but close to local shopping and restaurants bars 
372742,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, Staff could be friendlier but I guess it s what Barcelona is like Very poor cleaning in the rooms huge amount of dust in the room was coughing all night as I am allergic Bathroom was extremely dirty I had to clean it myself bought cleaning detergent in the local shop to have a bath Pubic hair was everywhere No toilet brush either It s a shame that this hotel partly ruined my weekend ,No Positive
372743,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, Isolation of rooms are not too god and you can hear your neighbour without any problem, very big room nice quality bed great bathroom very high class room for resonable price
372744,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, The breakfast was very good and plenty of choice but at 11 per person it was too expensive to eat there every day for a family However the coffee shop across the road is a cheaper option especially if you want a smaller breakfast , We had a fantastic stay at this hotel Rooms were very clean and comfortable beautifully decorated loved the shower and all the toiletries etc available in the rooms 
372745,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, There is no coffee machine or water boiler facilities in the room We can t make our own coffee or tea in the room We have to order and pay tea or coffee from the hotel The beds are hard ,No Positive
372746,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, Very disappointed with the hotel overall lack of decent restaurant bar breakfast no good hotel felt cramped excluding the room and the pool may as well have not existed The worst thing though was the location of the hotel at least 10mins from transport if not 15 Nothing in that part of the city and you could do far better elsewhere Poor facilities means it does not deserve a 4 star rating in my opinion Only 2 chairs around pool sun barely reached it due to height of surrounding buildings and it was so small there was no swimming at all , The room was good with exception of tv which was unduly small for a hotel these days The bathroom and shower were very good spacious and well laid out
372747,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, Everything was good and was as expected I thought it was good value for the money It was a short bus or taxi ride to most places we wanted to go , The staff were friendly and helpful They took a genuine interest in us 
372748,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, Ideally it would be slightly closer to the metro but by day 3 it didn t seem that far out as we had got our bearings , The staff and quality of customer service at this hotel really made it for us

372751,Hotel Gran Derby Suites,No Negative, Everything was perfect Super nice reception and really helpful staff The room really nice a bit dark but for the price you can not have everything Really clean almost every day a chocolate on the bed as a surprise from cleaning lady Comfortable bed nice furniture If you go to Barcelona this has to be your hotel 
372752,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, We have been downgraded to a Junior Suite for our first night there just because there weren t any Standard Deluxe Suite s available Even though we have been able to book one for the whole length of our stay This was disappointing however the staff has been helpful and changed our room the next day Moreover it was almost always noisy and there is almost no privacy if you keep the blinders open as someone else s room would be in front of yours It was a decent experience however it was not worth the money and did not match any of the review that you see on this website I would not book again , The staff was very helpful 
372753,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, I just wish the breakfast could have been included with a rate for the room Other than that I was extremely happy with the hotel experience , Room was spacious clean comfortable and turn down service even came with a piece of chocolate on the pillow Great location with numerous stores restaurants and parks close by Taxi stand and bus stop is located close to hotel The staff is outstanding and was very helpful in every way The Gran Derby make our stay in Beautiful Barcelona even more special and we would certainly stay there again if we ever came back to the city 
372754,Hotel Gran Derby Suites, This is not a 4 hotel poor service and bad location away from everything There was noise in the common areas every morning there were undergoing repairs or smth toiletries were not fully replenished daily there was not even a bottle of water in the room or some cutleries a maid slummed our door when there was actually do not disturb sign The worse of all was this broken glass partition in the bathroom when at some point glass particles got spread around the bathroom and we both cut our feet We asked staff to fix that but it was only done by maid next day so we literary could not use the bathroom that night Quite disappointing and overpaid , The design concept is the only think I liked rest is rather disappointing
