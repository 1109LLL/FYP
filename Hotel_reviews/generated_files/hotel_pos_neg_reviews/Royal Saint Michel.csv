134477,Royal Saint Michel, Lift is too small only for 2 people get in no room for luggage Because it is so small it is good for lovers , Room size is good with little balcony Bed is comfortable Have good sleep Open buffet breakfast with croissants and orange juice is fantastic
134478,Royal Saint Michel, It s our second stay at this hotel and we booked again because we liked the first time but we noted this time the facilities we re in need of maintenance broken closet doors in the room However price just went up in two years, Location was amazing
134479,Royal Saint Michel, Paris was unreasonably hot for the couple of days I was in town over 90 degrees Each room had a thermostat but the unit couldn t keep up with the heat , The location was fantastic just minutes to Notre Dame with lots of cafes and shops surrounding the hotel Shakespeare and company was down the street and I could see the Seine from my room Taxi s we readily available and the metro station was less than a block away but walking was the easiest way to get around I d stay here again in a heartbeat All the staff was extremely helpful and friendly 
134480,Royal Saint Michel, remember that The hotel building is quite old fashion one so if you are looking for a luxury and modern hotel this is not a good chose No proper big lobby Elevator is basically for ONE person so not that easy to take your luggage up to your room old furniture broken kettle at room, Location friendly staff
134481,Royal Saint Michel, The hotel was great the only thing we had a problem with when booking with booking com we thought breakfast was included however when we got to the hotel they said it was not ,No Positive
134482,Royal Saint Michel, Our room was the smallest on the 3rd floor in the awkward corner of the building I looked at the exit map behind the door Tiny cupboard space that was useless and not enough room on the floor to open your luggage Lucky the bed was comfortable , I loved the location 2 train stops from the main central station if arriving by train If you re a walker then you can stroll to Notre Dame Lourve and the Eiffel Tower easily Cosy little hotel with a tiny 2 person lift like all old buildings in Europe I was there at the end of June and area was alive but not boisterous safe but just tiny bit aware There is a tourist area just behind the hotel resturants cafes and souvenir shops all vying for your coin I had a bad dinner on the first night restuarant was empty and I felt sorry for the guy but had wonderful coffee and pastry on the 2nd morning 
134483,Royal Saint Michel, Didn t feel like a 4 star hotel Asked for 2 umbrellas during very heavy downpour and only given 1 Room was not ready so left our luggages to the reception while we grabbed a bite Returned to find our luggages were just left unattended unkept at the lobby lounge and there were other guests there The 2 guys at reception was quite cold but the lady was welcoming Room aircond not cold despite rainy weather Imagine if it was hot sunny day One of the smallest elevator I have encountered , Good location
134484,Royal Saint Michel, Better a c in some of the rooms Extremely small elevator but it worked to get luggage down one at a time , Our room air conditioner was very good Some that traveled with us did not have decent a c Room is comfortable but small but you re going to get that everywhere in Paris The location is OUTSTANDING very close to Notre Dame and Pont Neuf Staff was very responsive up until the last day where we had some issues no ice and they didn t book a taxi for us the night before our departure 
134485,Royal Saint Michel, WiFi didn t work for 2 3 day stay They finally rebooted the modem it worked but was slow , Location staff were amazing Breakfast was well worth the money
134486,Royal Saint Michel, the lift, really small lift dangerously placed near stairs very nice lady who carried the luggage over the saturday this past weekend the male receptionist was extremely impatient and impolite with some asian guests during the sunday 2nd july a different male receptionist was polite and kind to all guests while i waited in the waiting as it was storming with rain outside complementary coffee helped 
134487,Royal Saint Michel, Room and lift a bit small but it s Paris and that s what you get , The location was excellent walking distance to many attractions and restaurants and the Metro and RER very close Staff were helpful and friendly 
134488,Royal Saint Michel, I haven t yet figured out how to use European showers without flooding the floor If there is a trick I would like to know , The room was fine for one person would have been too small for two people The staff were great the breakfast was fine and the location was perfect for me in my favorite area of Paris 
134489,Royal Saint Michel, Could be noisy on Main Street didn t worry us but could worry others, Fantastic bedding very comfortable loved the free nesoresso Coffee in foyer 
134490,Royal Saint Michel, If the front desk staff had been friendlier it might have left a better impression Overall the hotel is a 1 2 star Although acceptably polite there is a resistance of the front desk staff to make you feel welcome or help navigate perhaps because nobody speaks very good English Tiny lobby small rooms elevator only large enough for your suitcase dirty and worn carpet up the stairs and not the value I expected from previous reviews , Location a block from the Seine and 2 blocks from Notre Dame If you like the Latin Quarter the location is great Breakfast was good 
134491,Royal Saint Michel, There might have been a little more TV channels in English we only had BBC World News , The bed It was really huge and comfortable We had the corner room overlooking Saint Michel Boulevard I could just stare at the street all day long It had the perfect location Also the staff was helpful and the room was always very clean 
134492,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, The location On the line from the airport also easy to find Make sure you go to the exit for place de michel when leaving the metro The staff was friendly as well And the breakfast amazing 
134493,Royal Saint Michel, The reception staff were brusque and impolite as were the breakfast staff exception of one individual I met Initially I gave the benefit of the doubt I will not return ,No Positive
134494,Royal Saint Michel, Breakfast was OK but the staff did not know how to cook the eggs longer eggs were bad undercooked rest was ok Oh and the worlds smallest elevator , Excellent location for safety and for getting around 1 4 block to trains and subway walking to Norte Dame and quaint bistros everywhere We highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Paris
134495,Royal Saint Michel, The lift is small It says it fits three people but it s cosy for two This is not unusual in Paris We chose to take the very pretty winding staircase instead Sometimes there was no space for us in the breakfast room so we had to wait until a table was free Timing was not an issue for us but it was a little uncomfortable standing in a room full of people waiting for them to eat up These minor points are down to the architecture of the building and would not prevent us from using this hotel again , Superb location just a minute from the metro and five minutes from the RER Direct line from the Gare du Nord if you are arriving in Paris by train which was a real blessing after a long journey Right next to the Seine river and pleasant St Michel square with its fountain for evening walks Comfortable walking distance to Notre Dame and hundreds of places to eat at varying prices from hole in the wall take outs to outstanding restaurants Suggest you check reviews and head West for the best dining we settled on the Brasserie St Andre as our local As two women travelling alone we felt very secure in the hotel and safe walking around until late evening in this area All staff were polite and friendly Two supermarkets nearby and some interesting shops Rooms are compact as is to be expected in Paris but everything is in good working condition and the d cor is pleasant Housekeeping excellent Superb sound insulation between rooms and from traffic Very solid floors The only sounds we heard were the door of the adjacent room and the occasional police siren which is impressive for a busy downtown location Very good beds and two pillows on each so we had all we needed Large towels Good air con Free safe Free bottled water on arrival Buffet breakfast very good with many options including hot scrambled eggs and sausages each morning good choice of cold meats and cheeses fruit salad cereals breads pastries premium jams fresh orange juice filter coffee freely available espresso and freshly made omelettes available on request Upon request the hotel will keep your bags for a few hours after checkout We really appreciated this as it allowed us to make full use of our last day Having stayed last time in the much quieter area of Odeon I would say this is a top location and a perfect blend of peace and quiet plenty to do in the immediate area I could easily have spent a week in this neighbourhood of Paris 
134496,Royal Saint Michel, Very very small breakfast room 16 seater repetative menu , Good location Close to Saint Michel metro and RER station Good restaurants all around Sound proof rooms 
134497,Royal Saint Michel, The breakfast could have been better The scrambled eggs were a bit fluffy and not baked long enough The variety of the breakfast was very limited The pains au chocolat and croissants looked like coming directly from the freezer Given the ratings and room costs I expected this to be better , The room was nicely decorated the quality of the mattress was very good Although the room was at the road side of the hotel I was on the fourth floor I didn t experience any noise the room was very well isolated The location of the hotel is excellent Very close to Notre Dame and Quartier Latin Parking facilities are across the street 
134498,Royal Saint Michel, View was facing street however was not there for the hotel view , Near metro station Really close to Notre Dame Cathedral the bed was super comfy one of the better beds I ve stayed in while being in Europe Very clean For being right next to a huge intersection you would have no idea very quiet Staff was very helpful 
134499,Royal Saint Michel, Very tiny and close room Very small breakfast room Cannot accommodate guests Sometimes have to wait for a table to free up , Location of this hotel is excellent Very close to Notte Dame and subway entrance just outside of the front door 
134500,Royal Saint Michel, the lift was a bit small , The location was perfect travelling by train with a 5 year old was made a lot easier by the metro being so close you can get direct train to The palace of versailles It was also only a few metro stops to catch the train to Disney land Paris The hotel was small and friendly The breakfasts were good and we filled up so did not really need lunch I was worried that the room would be to small but for Paris sizes it wasn t to bad The hotel is right next to some lovely streets for evening meals drinks or crepes Although it was very lively of an evening we were able to go out and eat with our daughter and have a family meal and a little walk around before heading back to the hotel once back in the room we were surprised how quiet it was All in all i would recommend for mini breaks in Paris 
134501,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, Breakfast great but needs larger room housekeeping staff excellent most front desk staff great one weekday afternoon guy gets 4 out of 5 all others perfect 5 location PERFECT all in all highly recommended a slightly larger breakfast room sometimes not enough tables this also puts stress on a truly lovely service staff because people get impatient if they are on a tight schedule perhaps half hour time slots could be preschedulled to avoid this TINY conflict Would definitely return and highly recommended 
134502,Royal Saint Michel, When we checked in the staff was not friendly and welcoming The reception definitely need updating which is still 70 80ish style Even requesting my credit card details for cross reference on a piece of paper Hello it is a security details Toothbrushetc you have to ask housekeeping , Only location and lots of restaurants and food ie kebabs The hotel only won on location and name formerly well known hotel To me it is not 4 star most probably 3 star But nowadays in Paris 3star hotel is higher quality than Royal St Michel 
134503,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, great room even though was road facing hardly any noise at night comfy bed great staff really friendly and helpful location was perfect for what we wanted to see and do within paris
134504,Royal Saint Michel, This property could not be used by anyone with accessibility issues Lots of stairs and a 2 person only elevator , Excellent location Clean Good bed 
134505,Royal Saint Michel, Space was a little cramped but for us it worked because we didn t spend a lot of time in the room My only change would be to book a room with a king or queen size bed opposed to 2 twin beds We were still very comfortable and slept very well The dining room for breakfast in the mornings was a little tight with space but it was manageable The scrambled eggs were not the best but just meant we ate more bread and croissants , Loved the location of this hotel The hotel staff were friendly and attentive Having a room on the second floor was ideal for us and we enjoyed having a view The room was very well insulated and did not hear noise from the streets Beds were comfortable and the room was kept clean We would definitely come back and stay Hotel Royal St Michel
134506,Royal Saint Michel, One of the reception staff was very rude to us and made us feel uncomfortable after we made the mistake of asking him to order us a taxi to the Charles du Gauld airport and needed the Gard Du Nord It was a 2 minute phone call and we realised whilst he was on the phone so he didn t have to phone back but he tutted and huffed and berated us to the taxi company Very rude , The location is fantastic Would stay there again just for that 
134507,Royal Saint Michel, We were there for two nights and the woman who checked us in was engaging and informative Sadly she doesn t work every day and we were an apparent burden to the rest of the help I felt a bit of snarkiness and don t know what to assign it to I have heard that they don t care for Americans but we were there just 18 months earlier and could not have been treated better your call , location location Seine restaurants shops Jardin Luxembourg
134508,Royal Saint Michel, We did not like lift Lift is too small barely carry two people We did not take breakfast in the hotel We have seen that the choice is small and it is shame that you eat in hotel in Paris , This hotel have a excellent location very close to the Notre Dame cathedral Near the hotel there are plenty of restaurants and cafes with autentic french cuisine Wifi worked perfectly The staff was friendly The room was ok for 3 nights This hotel is a great choice for a tour of Paris 
134509,Royal Saint Michel, Small lift was out of service when we arrived though back in service shortly after Would have been nice to have been offered some assistance to carry cases up 5 flights of stairs , On direct train route route B on map from Charles De Gaulle Airport and within easy walking route to Notre Dame Cathedral where the tour buses stop and some river tour boats dock Also on direct Metro route route C to Museum d Orsay and Eiffel Tower and within easy walking distance of The Louvre and town centre The local area also has some lovely and lively bars and restaurants if you like exploring Staff were very friendly 
134510,Royal Saint Michel, The bathrooms could be updated but clean and adequate Breakfast was overpriced , Location was fantastic and our room had a view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance so we were happy Not a 4 but very clean and staff lovely and helpful would definitely stay there again 
134511,Royal Saint Michel, The employees should improve their responsibility of the working standard so as to show it s a four star hotel No internal information transfer system in the hotel We pay for the deposit of the shuttle bus to the airport already no booking at all no sorry from the hotel Terrible ,No Positive
134512,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, an early check was very helpfully accommodated Great friendly staff Very good location easy walk to latin quarter night life and sights of Paris 
134513,Royal Saint Michel, Everything about the hotel was not nice from the staff to the room and tiny lift The bathroom was dirty and the rooms are too small as are the bathrooms Noisy hotel and very expensive Wifi unreliable , The location
134514,Royal Saint Michel, The room was tiny but it worked There was no restaurant or bar or communal area in the hotel other than a tiny lobby but that was not a problem as there are so many places to go nearby The shoe polisher ruined our shoes I would not rate this hotel as 4 star but it was nice anyway , Friendly and helpful staff Very clean room and comfortable bed Superb location Breakfast was wonderful Lots of choice of meats and cheeses breads and pastries fruits and cereals eggs and sausages Lots of nice cafes and restaurants nearby Very easy to go anywhere on the metro right outside Good shopping nearby A bustling area A lovely little hotel 
134515,Royal Saint Michel, 1 House keeping is not good they are changing the towels and the bed No water refill no tea refill 2 stairs is so difficult to climb 3 very narrow elevator capacity of two persons only 4 room key didt work with me so i needed to get down to the reception 3 times then it worked dont know why , Location Few steps away from saint micheal metro station
134516,Royal Saint Michel, Staff on reception kept you waiting whilst on the phone having a smoke doing other things You as a customer were definitely not important 15 minutes wait with no one else checking in is a bit of a joke especially for the rate per room and being a so called 4 hotel Room was very small and by the road so beware of the early morning dustcarts if placed in the front of the hotel Window didn t close properly so a bit noisy , Beds were comfortable and linen nice quality Location was great metro was 1 minutes walk away so very useful 
134517,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, Just got back home yesterday Location of the hotel was excellent The staff were terrific When we return to Paris it will be the only hotel we will stay at 
134518,Royal Saint Michel, Staff could have been a little more welcoming and cheerful They were a little distant and not overly friendly Maybe that s just the way the French are , Very comfortable beds and nice bedroom Good location a stones throw from the Notre Dame Cathedral and the local Metro Didn t get any breakfast or food of any kind in hotel so can t comment on that Got to store bags in hotel prior to booking in and before checking out which was very helpful Rooms cleaned everyday 
134519,Royal Saint Michel, Elevator is tooooooooo small which is can be another souvenir in Paris , Clean and comfort room with great view Location is just amazing and all staffs are kind 
134520,Royal Saint Michel, The lack of storage meant vacuum cleaners where on the stairs in front of the lift of each level however was not in the way the lift was very small and slow so sometimes its just better to take the stairs , The staff in this Hotel were all very professional polite and helpful The location is fantastic minutes walk from the metro bus stops and the alleys beside the hotel are full of great places to eat and explore 
134521,Royal Saint Michel, I would personally rate the hotel as a 3 star the rooms are very small and overall the hotel feel is not of a 4 star hotel But for a short stay it is comfortable and convenient , The location was excellent We were just a few minutes away from Notre Dam and perfect for tourist walks The staff was extremely kind and helpful as well
134522,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, Perfect location At 2 min from train station They helped me book a dinner at a cruise just one hour before the event Very friendly staff I will go back 
134523,Royal Saint Michel, Tiny lift rude welcome when the staff decided that he did not have a reservation under my name without checking noisy kitchen personnel leaving the door open during breakfast and talking out loud, Great location close to metro and RER stations comfy bed
134524,Royal Saint Michel, Not much to dislike as our nights were calm and we were outdoors most of the time We had two rooms standard double and one comes with a street view We definitely recommend asking specifically for such a room as for the same price the room and bed is larger It is strange that the price for these rooms is the same , Excellent location nearby public parking Notre Dame and many other sights Hotel room was clean calm We had breakfasts outside the hotel so we cannot give our opinion on that other than the fact that one can find great breakfasts for about 50 lower prices without much difficulty 
134525,Royal Saint Michel, Would be nice when the reception would be a little more understanding friendly when calling the guests to leave the room in time , The bet was very comfortable
134526,Royal Saint Michel, Noise from street quite loud but not a problem, Great location on RER Ideal for Paris Nord and CDG airport Cute room on top floor with view over Paris roofscape
134527,Royal Saint Michel, Couldn t fault it Met all our expectations , Clean well kept hotel Excellent location in St Michel near Notre Dame and numerous bars cafes and restaurants in the Latin Quarter Friendly helpful staff Have stayed here before and will be back again when next in Paris 
134528,Royal Saint Michel, Two problems 1 The rooms on the 6th floor are small crowded and of inferior quality than the rest of the rooms 2 The elevator is very very SMALL , A very good hotel in a great location Nice clean rooms and excellent service 
134529,Royal Saint Michel, Bad attitude from some of the staff on the reception First they give us a little room on the 6th floor with very small window and after intervention of booking com for which we are grateful we received a double room we paid previously Very small breakfast room , Perfect location a few steps from Notre Dame with many restaurants nice double room after intervention of booking com cleanness 
134530,Royal Saint Michel, One of the receptionists It s good that i don t speek french, Very quiet Very good location for traveling to from Charle de Gaulle airport visiting Notre dame Louvre
134531,Royal Saint Michel, The staff wasn t very nice didn t make us feel welcome when we arrived no smile hardly a word Not much better when we left Long wait when calling reception from the room until somebody finally answers I know it s what everybody has become used to expect in Paris but still it s disappointing not to be proven wrong from time to time , Very nice quiet and comfortable room clean bathroom although a bit small good breakfast served in the room upon request The hotel is in an excellent location close to many of Paris best attractions 
134532,Royal Saint Michel, The night shift front desk person is rude and even insulted me and said I asked stupid questions After checked in I asked him how far is the Eiffel tower from the hotel he said I do not know he asked me to take a map and look for myself I asked if I want to walk there how long it will take and he said no body walk there everybody take taxi and if you really want to walk it may be like 45mintues He said why didn t I asked him about the places around the hotel instead of asking something so far away Then I asked him which Museum house Mona Lisa portrait he was getting impatient and said very body knows which museum ie the Louvre where are you from I said I am from Singapore and in Asia the hotel front desk is very helpful will all questions He then said a lot of things which i can t recall but I vividly heard he said I asked such stupid questions Never felt so insulted before , The location is really close to the centre of Paris transportation is convenient and many tourist spot are within walking distance away 
134533,Royal Saint Michel, Needed friendlier concierge and restock bath products There was also some mold damage in the bathroom on the ceiling probably because the bathroom fans didn t really work well , The breakfast was delicious the beds were comfortable and the room extremely clean 
134534,Royal Saint Michel, A taxi driver who ripped us off 40 90 Euros from Opera Paris to the Hotel We went bac to the Oper Paris on the bus the following day an it cost 5 00 euros for both of us So beware We did ask him how much before we got in and he tapped the metre so we felt assure HUH, Loved The location close to all tourist attractions Spotlessly clean we did not eat here as there are many many restaurants and bars just a stone throw away to choose from Fantastic area we loved it
134535,Royal Saint Michel, Breakfast is too expensive if not included in room price Breakfast room is small and crowded but service was excellent , We were upgraded to a larger room normally reserved for three and it was perfect for a couple for a longer stay Warm comfortable quiet 
134536,Royal Saint Michel, Rooms are small but recently refurbished , The location is the key here I have used this hotel lots of times and you can t really do better The cab rank on the south bank of the Seine is 100m away a 24hour restaurant cafe next to that called le Depart Ile de la Cite 120metres away over the road with Notre Dame etc And it is right on top of RER Metro and the luxury Mozart playing Bvd St Michel underground car park
134537,Royal Saint Michel, The tiny tiny elevator , Location location location We arrived from Orly and surfaced just meters from the front door Close to all the major sights and surrounded by restaurants 
134538,Royal Saint Michel, The room and bathroom were a bit tiny , The cleanliness of the room was excellent and the front staff was very polite and curious They sent us some macaroons complimentary of the hotel for our Wedding Anniversary Very nice touch 
134539,Royal Saint Michel, We had to go home , We liked everything especially the staff This hotel is in a great location with easy access to transportation It s very clean When we return to Paris we ll stay here again I give them five out of five stars 
134540,Royal Saint Michel, The hotel supplies only breakfast and room service which we did not need The breakfast room is a little tight but adequate The lift is small but cosy for two Paris is wonderful but keep your hand on your wallet , We liked where the hotel was situated in a fantastic position for all sites in Paris right outside the front door Being in the Latin quarter was fabulous for dining and evening atmosphere with bars and restaurants of all nationalities 
134541,Royal Saint Michel, Air conditioner could have been a little cooler as the weather was quite hot late August , excellent location polite staff turn down of beds easy early check out no nasty surprises with the bill Sofa bed was comfortable triple room and a BATH SHOWER Metro just outside the door Value Dining at the door Surprisingly very quiet at night 
134542,Royal Saint Michel, The lift is tiny for one with little luggage The breakfast room is too small for the amount of guests It was difficult to manoeuvre between tables to get to the buffet On the morning I was leaving there was only one member of staff to serve coffee and lay tables I hardly had time to drink my coffee when it arrived even after allowing 30 mins for breakfast At 16 euros it was overpriced The croissants were not as you d expect in Paris more like the supermarket pre packed ones The breakfast staff were very nice just a shame that the food offerings and breakfast room were a big let down , Great location Comfortable bed and pleasant if not small room 
134543,Royal Saint Michel, A bit out dated Rooms small but normal for Paris, Excellent level of house keeping Room was attended twice a day Honest service I thought I had lost my charger and they found it for me I was also notified in advance that I had double booked by mistake a fact which I was not aware of This saved me a fortune on double booking expenses Top location Very good breakfast 
134544,Royal Saint Michel, This hotel was advertised at 250 Euro for two nights breakfast included BUT when we booked we discovered breakfast was NOT included If this happens again I will not use Booking com again , Location was excellent 
134545,Royal Saint Michel, They told me that they will not take a debit from my credit card but they did from the first night in spite of that I told them not to do that because I will pay cash They cancelled the debit but it needs several days to be released I really did not like that , The location is excellent 
134546,Royal Saint Michel, Sofa bed for third person was ancient and could feel the springs through the thin mattress My son managed to sleep on it but I would not have , Breakfast buffet including eggs sausages cheese ham as well as the usual bread cereal yoghurt and fruit Central location Bathroom fine Aircon 
134547,Royal Saint Michel, The elevator is a bit small and room keys kept having problems, The staff were very helpful throughout our stay The location is good for bus tours and most sights Plenty of cafe s bars and restaurants in area
134548,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, Hotel was in a fantastic location with easy access to the metro Staff were very welcoming on arrival and were very helpful when checking out and getting locked out of the room Rooms were cleaned every day along with fresh towels Breakfast was lovely and everything was fresh and there was a great choice from the continental buffet We were able to leave our luggage with them on the morning that we had to leave until we needed to set off on our journey home Thank you to all the staff at the Best Western for a lovely stay 
134549,Royal Saint Michel, We agreed on price 150euro but they requested additional 190 euro for our kid who is ten years old We payed 340 plus city tax Very terrible approach to the customers Never been again, Awful management very small room 
134550,Royal Saint Michel, Lift was too small to accomodate even 2 guests and luggage We stayed for 4 nights the breakfast was the same everyday Would have preferred more choices , Location was excellent 
134551,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, Marvelous location opposite Saint Michel Fountain close to the river and Notre Dame on the edge of the Latin Quarter pleasant staff breakfast very good The lift is small as previously commented but adequate for 2 normal sized people Luggage was taken to the room by staff the lift isn t big enough The room was perfect for us and relatively spacious for Paris hotels 
134552,Royal Saint Michel, The room was far too small for three people They say they have air conditioning but it doesn t actually work well enough to decently cool the room We were all very hot every night ,No Positive
134553,Royal Saint Michel, The lift was tiny but managable The croissant served at breakfast wasn t the best either but still okay Nothing stood out as bad , The room was very comfortable and nice The crepes at breakfast were delicious The wifi worked really well as well 
134554,Royal Saint Michel, It could maybe have a bar not the end of the world as behind the hotel is great for bars and cafes, the location is excellent only 100 meters away from main metro line and across the road from the riverboat hop on hop off cruise didn t need to book a taxi for anywhere
134555,Royal Saint Michel, The hotel is really bad total loss of money value AC not working elevator not working and restaurant is smaller than my kitchen and can t take more than 20 guests at the same time very old hotel and very bad, The hotel is really bad total loss of money value AC not working elevator not working and restaurant is smaller than my kitchen and can t take more than 20 guests at the same time very old hotel and very bad
134556,Royal Saint Michel, The room was tight for 3 people Comfortable bed but not a very big room Breakfast was over priced but sufficient , The location and area is great Really enjoyed being close to everything 
134557,Royal Saint Michel, The hotel recommend using their paid shuttle service 36 instead of a taxi We pre arranged our pickup time for 8am confirmed the time the evening before leaving The shuttle showed up on time once we were in the van and away from the hotel they informed us they had another pick up in the opposite direction of the airport We arrived 2 hours later at the airport on what should have only taken 30 min ,No Positive
134558,Royal Saint Michel, I would rate the hotel a three star hotel but never a four star We had to move three times before we had a room with working air condition that would cool the room The reception and elevator are very small I would say the staff is not friendly at all They just do their job , The location in the left bank is excellent and the metro station is very close 
134559,Royal Saint Michel, Room slightly snug unable to leave window open at night because of street noise so rather warm but both as typically expected for character building in central location A price worth paying for the convenience , Excellent location ideal for city centre metro etc Many good restaurants cafes nearby 
134560,Royal Saint Michel, we asked several times for AC repairs and never got them after the 3rd day we asked for a fan and got it but we never got AC working all week I will hopefully get a partial refund , the location was perfect the complementary Bkfst was wonderful 
134561,Royal Saint Michel, Room decor requires updating However when you are in Paris you don t spend much time in your room other than sleeping , Great location in the Latin quarter and next to the river Seine Comfortable room and good nights sleep 
134562,Royal Saint Michel, Room too small for a double Breakfast room too small Lift ridiculously small even for two average sized people , Good bathroom Staff pleasant and helpful 
134563,Royal Saint Michel, There was no ventilation or air conditioning working in our room So too hot to sleep at night Explanation was that the air conditioning does not work very well on the lower floors Our room was on the second floor Also they did not seem to vacuum under the beds , Close to main attractions and metro RER lines 
134564,Royal Saint Michel, Lift is super small never seen anything like it before barely takes 2 people B fast very disappointing very little choice , Cleanliness and location
134565,Royal Saint Michel, Paid for 3 people my husband I and our adult daughter We had 2 twin beds and a pull out chair twin , Location to Blue Bike Tours check in point is perfect 
134566,Royal Saint Michel, The entry foyer and lift are cramped , Great location with easy access from CDG airport close proximity to many of the attractions of Paris and a nice outlook over Bvd St Michel Comfortable rooms of adequate size and generally well maintained 
134567,Royal Saint Michel, Staff at front desk could be friendlier smile please , Great location reasonable size room reasonable price for Paris close to restaurants close to metro
134568,Royal Saint Michel, The stuff worked at night shift is cold and would not want to help when my flight got cancelled , Claire the smiling face in the front desk made our stay special I cannot thank her enough for e everything she did for us including checking early giving directions and packing breakfast THANK YOU Claire 
134569,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location in the heart of the Latin Quarter and surprisingly quiet room The hotel staff are warm and friendly and the room although a bit cramped on space was very clean and the bed was very comfortable with British type pillows I d use it again
134570,Royal Saint Michel, Man on reception was rude The rooms are tiny cluttered and poorly decorated , It is right next metro Saint Michel and a two minute walk to Notre Dame 
134571,Royal Saint Michel, Everything needed improvement The air conditioning was inoperative Had to sleep with open windows for air and cooling resulting in very much street noise Many items were unsatisfactory and the staff noted the items but cared less on repair Not up to Best Western quality for a four star hotel Since when is it proper to charge guests a fee vig when arranging transport from the hotel to airport , Nothing
134572,Royal Saint Michel, It s true that the lift is tiny but it works and is quite comical But it s no reason to not stay here This a great hotel in a perfect location for tourists There really aren t any appreciable negatives with this property , Clean comfortable great location good breakfast
134573,Royal Saint Michel, The staff was very friendly and helpful But I asked a hotel to book a taxi to the hotel near Disneyland The first day they said the price is 100 euro second day they said price will be 130 euro We were 2 adults and 4 children but anyway I think price is too high The van came 20 minutes late there was no taxi sign no taximeter no navigation The driver didn t know the location and I believe he knew only Chinese When I asked why the price is so high he said that for him for City and for the hotel Is it a common practice in Paris , Great Location Nice rooms 1st day air conditioning was weak but the staff provided the fans 
134574,Royal Saint Michel,No Negative, Great location just around the corner from Notre Dame and lots of good local restaurant choices Rooms very clean and comfortable Nice breakfast room nowhere near as small as I feared from other reviews There was a good breakfast selection available Staff were friendly and welcoming Would recommend to friends

134578,Royal Saint Michel, IF I COULD HAVE STAYED LONGER The Latin district is quite entertaining and on the weekends last into the wee hours Closing the window sufficed , I have little utility in french the staff top to bottom enhanced my stay with their compensation The location was perfect a block from the River Seine Accommodations always clean well stocked Service at breakfast food and selection local and attentive Next to the Latin district we could engage and be home in seconds Central to everything Metro 2o yards from the front door bus on the corner taxi never more than 5 minutes wait Food of any type in all directions Entertainment or people watching literally outside the door of the hotel 
134579,Royal Saint Michel, Parisian s are friendly They know what they know and expect the little nuances to be understood by you Confusing at times paying attention to the order information is given and the minutia of the messages is important With that said and the apps on your phone you can navigate all parts of Paris with reasonable ease without knowing French A word to those that are driven in all aspect of your life Parisians are NOT Adjust to the environ they provide linger as they do and your experience will blossom , The staff to the room service members and facility are wonderful The location was selected for the sights of Paris close to everything cab to the Eiffel Tower But what was an additive was the group of people helping at every turn earnestly endeavored to provide Taxi cabs direction on the front door subway to walking distances all well intentioned and accurate The latin district is a good place to be depicting the life of Paris its vitality 7th is across the street and it represents the older generation of Parisian s up scale and polished to a brighter patina galleries shops and service Food is the same wonderfully adorned with flavor and Paris service Come back absolutely Stay at St Michel without question 
134580,Royal Saint Michel, Room extremely hot Very small room Bathroom dirty Hairs in the bathtub Small elevator and dangerous stairs Breakfast room too small for all guests Hotel too expensive for what you get typically french,No Positive
134581,Royal Saint Michel, Breakfast was basic but tasty enough albeit a little expensive at 16 euros per person for what was effectively a continental breakfast Room was a little small but this wasn t a problem as we spent very little time in the hotel , Great location Staff courteous Clean and tidy room 
134582,Royal Saint Michel, We wanted a clean hotel in a good area which we could use as a base We were not looking for a fine Hotel to spend our days or evenings in and this was perfect So if we had any dislike it is that this is not a hotel you would want to sit around in for a couple of weeks, Great location Nice clean rooms Friendly and helpful staff This was very good for us as we only spoke basic high school French The free wifi and breakfast were also a reason we chose this hotel

134588,Royal Saint Michel, The place is over priced and should not be a 4 star breakfast was sub par with very minimal selections I would pass in the future on purchasing the breakfast at this hotel There is no temperature controls in the room so the heat is on high all the time this requires keeping the window open even in winter as it is too hot to sleep , location was perfect close to metro and many sites with restaurants and bars within walking distance right around the corner
134589,Royal Saint Michel, Honestly I don t have any dislikes , The location was absolutely perfect for us all major attractions were within walking distance for us as a family it was just perfect Friendly and obliging staff super clean and great service Loved my stay here X
134590,Royal Saint Michel, Just that the lift is really tiny and can fit 2 person at a time Thus the front desk would need to deliver your bags after you check into your room Rooms are small and not very spacious , Location is excellent and bus stop is jus in front if the hotel which takes you directly to shopping district Gallery Lafayatte Lots of restaurants cafe and shops around Behind the hotel is a lovely centuries old Catholic church is a must to visit Breakfast was excellent Will recommend family friends Definitely will return

134594,Royal Saint Michel, Rude unpleasant and unhelpful front desk clerk went out of his way to be rude Night desk clerk wouldnt even answer a question elevator is tiny Room had a terrible musty smell bellmen acted like he had no ide what I was talking about but went right to the source carpet by window and sprayed febreze, location hotel manager was extremely nice and very helpful went out of her way to assist me Breakfast area is very tiny but staff was excellent and food was good Housekeeping staff were pleasant and helpful
134595,Royal Saint Michel, Really small hotel with small breakfast room causing waiting Sound isolation from the street is poor and traffic present nearby, Location is good near metro and good choice of restaurants

134608,Royal Saint Michel, The room and bathroom was extremely small but the most oppressive thing was the elevator which barely fit 2 adults with no luggage and you could not fit if you breathed normally just ridiculous There is no concierge so you have to rely on the front desk folks to help you and while they tried to help they were not very helpful with things like dinner reservations which were an absolute nightmare , The location was just at the edge of the Latin Quarter so it was quite lively at night
