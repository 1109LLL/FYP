241075,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, The housekeeping service was the worst we ve experienced in any Marriott world wide The to management wasn t very responsive either Best avoidable to stay here ,No Positive
241076,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, I didn t like the smell in the rooms and the stuff are not doing there work very well a lot of mistakes , I like the location of the hotel 
241077,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, Balconies could be improved our king room did not have a city view as stated however we were upgraded on the second third nights at no extra cost to us also as we were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary we were greeted in our room with a lovely bottle of champagne 2 boxes of macaroons this was a lovely touch on the hotel s behalf , Staff food were both excellent all our needs well attended to especially the concierge service 
241078,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, I was caught off guard by having to pay 100 euros per night as a cover charge for any potential damages we would have caused to the room I was not aware of this charge If for some reason I couldn t pay we wouldn t have been able to stay , Great location polite staff and the hotel always smelt lovely The Eggs Benedict was amazing 
241079,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, Bad smell in the corridor coming from the public bathroom as you are going to the elevators , The location is amazing the staff are so helpful and the room and bathroom are amazing 
241080,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, first the check in took us 30min more over they didnt give us rooms next to other some of the room didnt have nespresso machines rooms has been cleaned with some liquid i coludent breath because of it so i changed my room the concierge didnt provid car as we requested so they say take two taxi and we were late ,No Positive
241081,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel,No Negative, The hotel staff services were very welcoming as always I always stay at the Marriott Champs Elysees The staff caters always to special requests This weekend we made a special request for a take away breakfast because I was checking out to catch my train at 6 am But the hotel only starts breakfast at 6 30 am onwards The hotel staff were so kind prepared takeaway box breakfast for me and my friend to take with us It was the best Thanks to the staff for making this special request 
241082,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, housekeeping and room service are very poor Late room service delivery Bathroom towels and bathrobe are rarely changed water and minibar rarely followed up,No Positive
241083,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, The check in was really bad we booked 2 rooms view on champs elysees and the check in is suppose to be maximum at 3pm but they left us waiting till 8pm with nothing just waiting and waiting for our rooms and the only thing they keep sayin is that the housekeeping is still cleaning the room it was really frustrating we were tired and coming from a long flight, Location and the view
241084,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, Room cleaning is very bad and un hygienic to the extend they do not clean certain items in the room Room rate is very expensive for such old facilites Breakfast is another disaster i went two times to have breakfast and both times Restaurant was out of plates and glasses and i have to wait for few minutes to have one Service was poor i just want to assure you i shall never stay or visit this hotel , Location is good and staff generally friendly 
241085,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, The room I chose was too tight I had to upgrade to the next room size A lot of bugs inside the rooms and I had too many bug bites The carpet inside and outside the room we re worn out and little bit dirty , super friendly staff and nice location also the breakfast and restaurants are perfect 
241086,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, The staff are not friendly specially the Indian lady in the reception for check in She did not hear us and didn t care The concierge always acted like they don t know what they re doing and one of them was being sarcastic a lot which mad me feel uncomfortable Also the hallway is too old I think the carpet needs to be replaced , The location obviously and the smell of the place The room tv and speakers and the view is good 
241087,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, The check in takes too long meaning you have to wait A LOT for your room to be ready , The location is great On champs elysees Perfect to watch the 14th of July parade 
241088,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, The pub in the ground floor plays a loud music and make a lot of noise and stays until late night and it s facing the rooms Windows So we couldn t sleep well, Best location and the room size is good
241089,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, Shower floor tiles need good blast with an industrial strength power washer Need as many cups on hospitality tray as there are guests in room and milk needs replenishing each day No fresh air due to room overlooking atrium, Bed very comfy nice big bathroom public areas lovely very calm and chilled out despite hotel being full excellent service Very convenient location 
241090,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, We booked and paid extra to for the larger room 503 facing the Champs Elysees avenue but are left feeling very disappointed What is supposedly a better room but toilet fittings and amenities is definitely not up to the standard Basic amenities such as sanitary bags are not automatically provided and even after our special request from the front desk it was not given A retractable clothes line is not available in the spacious bathroom with a bathtub which is a shame it would be a great convenience considering we had 5 nights stay and needed to wash and recycle some of our garments And the worst is the toilet not able to flush properly we had to flush few times to have a clean flush We have made the complaint but it remained that way throughout our stay The major letdown for us is the breakfast as we always look forward to the nice breakfast during our nice hotel stays anywhere in the world It s to us a 5 star hotel with a 3 star breakfast For the 5 nights that we stayed every morning we were served the same type of food with very limited variety and so we had no varieties to at least let us have different things every morning Bacons are hard and over fried Asian noodles are dried up and tasted oddly very sweet Omelette prepared on request came out overdone and rubbery Not a single type of berries strawberries blueberries raspberries etc are served in the fruits section It s the hotel too cheap to provide us that Overall we are very disappointed with the quality of accommodation and food provided by the hotel even though it carries the Marriot brand it feels like a 3 star hotel with a nice location as the main selling point The hotel staff are warm professional and always helpful but from the overall experience it will be our first and last time staying at this hotel ,No Positive
241091,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, Some of the towels were not clean Small room Small bed Normal room design, Great location Security at the front door of the hotel Nice lobby Staffs who speak Arabic

241096,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, Not a single bad experience ALL WAS POSITIVE IN EVERY WAY , Everything was PERFECT celebrating my 75th Birthday the New Year with my family of 7 at this magnificent hotel with the best rooms overlooking the excitement of the Champs Elysees The Concierge and Reception staff were extraordinary in their attention and care for all our reservation arrangements and every detail to assure our comfort safety and enjoyment The hotel and staff made Paris even more exceptional than thought possible and made this a lifetime memory highlight

241099,Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel, Would not call it bad experience but rooms decor somewhat old Some Bathroom floor Tiles in larger room 214 discoloured Male washroom in lobby to be refreshed in more timely manner , Location staffers warm chic professional atmosphere
