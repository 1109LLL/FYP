116738,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre,No Negative, Rapha l and the other front desk employees were awesome We had to return our rental car to the airport extremely early in the morning Rapha l helped find a 24 hour gas station near the hotel 
116739,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre,No Negative, Great location for exploring Paris Nice to come back to at the end of the day lots of lovely small restaurants nearby Reception staff were really helpful knowledgeable and friendly particularly Katia who was exceptional 
116740,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, We stayed in a hotel for 7 days left our room to be cleaned twice The first time we left dirty towels on the bathroom floors before heading to the city and expected to find clean ones when we come back in the evening That did not happen Cleaning lady just folded dirty towels back together and put them on the shelf like they were new I realized that after seing my mascara trail on the dirty towel We called receptionist and he gave us new ones immediately Still not a good thing you want to happen to you in a 4stars hotel Beddings were not changed Second time we left our room to be cleaned our bedding were stil not changed and we got clean towels this time but one had big brown spot on it Hotel was ok but it is more like 3 star hotel I ve been in other Holiday inn s my favorite hotel during traveling and I ve seen better , Big comfortable bed quiet room It s a big thing if you have airconditionig and safe in hotel in Paris and we had it Location is great 
116741,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre,No Negative, The hotel was in a nice and quiet part of town There were plenty of food and drink options available within walking distance The hotel was close to a number to metro stations which made it easy to get around Paris Staff were always happy to help The mobile provided was very handy as we didn t need to buy a SIM card for our short stay 
116742,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, Missed the sports facilities although they offer access to a fitness club nearby for 10 entry breakfast is rather basic rather a good 3 stars hotel , Fair room renovated and large bathroom with modern shower Wi fi working very well friendly and welcoming staff at the reception great parking nearby
116743,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, We booked a room for 3 people When we got there we found it consisted of 2 single beds a fold out bed which was fine However the quality of the fold out bed was horrendous The mattress was wafer thin you could feel every spring in it barely slept a wink due to it being so uncomfortable I left the hotel the next day exhausted disapponted which was so unfortunate as up until that it had been a lovely stay , Location was great Just a 10 minute walk from bus train station 5 minute stroll from Moulin Rouge Hotel was small but kept immaculately clean staff were very helpful 
116744,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, Being a non smoker and asthmatic didn t like the fact that there we a couple of rooms on our floor booked by guests who smoke We had a constant smell of smoke which irritated a bit Would be great if hotel had smoking and non smoking floors, Comfy bed interesting location great staff and good value We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend
116745,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, Heating only blew out cold air noisy heating and or plumbing Breakfast was poor room was small Staff couldn t resolve our problems , Car park although off site was secure 
116746,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, We couldn t figure out the AC in our room so it was a little warm at night Sometimes the wifi didn t work but it wasn t a deal breaker, Excellent experience from the time we walked in until checkout The family rooms are spacious have convenient amenities The staff was very helpful friendly The breakfast was very good has lots to choose from They even held our luggage after checkout so that we could go look at more sites without our luggage They even give you a cell phone to walk around Paris with to have Google Maps search the internet without using your own data Great job 
116747,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, I would consider the parking rates to be rather high granted parking is considered a premium in Paris Also the bar prices within the hotel are not the cheapest around but the excellent service from the staff can justify the difference in price , Fantastic location with very friendly and helpful staff Rooms are modern and very comfortable Also the new travel companion phones provided in the bedrooms are very beneficial 
116748,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre,No Negative, We loved the super comfortable beds that were so lush and plush The breakfast was delicious Paris was even better with the helpful staff who guided us through local transportation around the city

116751,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, Nothing , The beds the food and much more than anything else the staff at the reception They are simply the best Ms Margy at the reception was very helpful My wife and I still wonder how the management keeps the staff motivated 
116752,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, No body lotion provided and not much tourist info available with the staff at reception , location nice cafes around and near to Gare du Nord which served our purpose 
116753,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, Hard to think of any improvements Room s aren t massive so may be not ideal for a long stay , Use of smartphone with free calls and internet for entire stay 24 hour bar room service Free use of lobby computer and printer UK TV channels Very comfortable beds and a bath Great staff 5 minute walk to centre of Montmarte up hill or Place de Clichy Didn t have breakfast but I imagine it s great

116758,Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre, Breakfast selection was not very good sweaty plastic cheese is disgusting The bread was ok but the pastries were of the cheap variety I would expect much better from a 4 star property but I think it s really a 3 star, The room was lovely very modern beds were very comfy Perfect location for access to monmartre and abbesses
