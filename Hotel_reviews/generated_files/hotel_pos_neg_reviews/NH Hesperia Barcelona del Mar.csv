319530,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, The internal acoustic insulation from the central corridor and other rooms should be improved And in conclusion I just think hotel accommodation during summer is a bit high , Very well located hotel 5min walking from Probenou Metro Station yellow line and the Barcelona s Convention Center BCC is 10min within walking distance In front of the BCC there is a Beira Mar Mall where one can find out a huge supermarket with nice prices The beach is also a great point that is suitable for swimming Other activities nearby are bike three blocks away a rent bike agency charges 15 24h e bike restaurants drugstore open top tourist bus and so on The Hotel has a great breakfast that costs 18 90 though at the next corner there is a cafe croissant coffee 2 2 The Hotel per se has a well cleaned and modern room Gracias a todos los catalanes por su generosidad y la rica acogida 
319531,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, The room location the smell in the rooms compare to other hotel which I was in barcelona not good for money, Just the location if you want neat beach
319532,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, A little cold welcome after travelling 20 hrs before checking in but overall friendly staff No pool fitness Jacuzzi rooms are OK but bit boring Definitely need more plugs in the wall to charge devices , Location is great walking disctance to Poblenou and the beach is across the street and the hotel is quiet 
319533,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, Awful My worst experience in NH ever i travel to 40 countries and always prefer NH as very cost effective good quality Expensive for nothing 180 for plain basic room expect nothing even old phone shows how old this facility is Small and poor Bathtube have 30 years Power plugs are far away from bed dont expect to be able to connect phone no coffee machine no iron floor is swollen only one plug for laptop in desk no other for mobile weak wifi quite old in general Noise is terrible is you are close to elevator lot of water pumps noise over the night Entrance have stairs be aware you need to carry your luggage downstairs Room door do not have double lock They don t even put water on room but charge 3 5 for one bottle as Barcelona have such a nasty water but drinkable they should put one or two complimentary as most of NH hotels do I have no idea how they can call this NH my worst experience ever in NH as they have good facilities always this is the appositive Definitely a 70 80 hotel that charge 180 per night dont get trap as i fall into believing in NH Will never return to this place , beach is 400 meters
319534,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, Will those 4 hotels invest one day in a decent collection of irons I m travelling for business and need to iron my shirts not to trash them up with a dirty old iron that leaks dirt The price I pay for 1 night at your property will cover the expenses for 5 or 6 units so come on have a little spend once in a while this will not ruin your business and make customers happy , Very nice location beach front and near city centre but not too much Very quiet at night Breakfast is good although bit pricy for Spain you ve got cheaper food options right in front 
319535,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, We paid 570 euros for 3 nights and the room we got was small and it smelt of urine We then said we wanted another room as this doesn t make sense in terms of the payment made the hotel considers this as a standard room They then gave us the same room on a different floor but that was old and tired as the paint was coming off everywhere and the bathroom was not cleaned properly At the end we asked for a junior suite and got a good deal led by Jose the receptionist thanks but again it was nothing special This hotel is not a global 4 star hotel as advertised I have been to 3 star hotels which were better The hotel is actually called Hesperial hotel and only inside you find out that it is part of the NH group Would I come here again for the same money No Would I come again if it was based on value for money Yes , Jose the receptionist was very nice and helped us out when we were not happy The location is great 3mins walk and you are at the beach 
319536,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, No NH sign on exterior We were robbed whilst trying to find the entrance to your parking Very dangerous location Thieves were obviously waiting for people like us who had trouble identifying the hotel You cannot enter the parking until after you have parked on the street and queued at reception ,No Positive
319537,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, Two flights of stairs to enter and exit the hotel with a lift that was not working A struggle with heavy bags The reception staff just watched me struggle with the bags too Very small room This hotel is joined to a residential block of apartments I had to put up with a dog barking for most of the first night Would never stay here again , Close to the beach and stop for hop on hop off tour bus 
319538,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, Hotel needs overall update Food ordered wasnt good Heater didnt work and it was cold outside When asked they said we turn the heat on only in the colder months At least a 15 min walk to the nearest metro station Faucet within 10 cm s of the sink hard to move Shower has a half door footwear gets wet No one time use footwear was available Only stairs at the entrance had to carry the luggage at hand Extra fast wi fi 10 Euros per day wasnt necessary didnt work on my laptop worked on my cell All could be OK but not at that price My previous visit had the same rates similar vicinity and it had the complete opposite performance at all mentioned , Very close to the beach Next room left a window open with a open close sound late night They called and had them close Good shower head Quiet room Good wi fi 
319539,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, Breakfast is very overpriced Not enough selection for lunch and dinner good job restaurants are close by with good food and good prices, cleanliness of hotel throughout friendly staff who speak good English
319540,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, Buffet breakfast was expensive at nearly 19 euros each and somewhat limited for the price We had a room facing onto the side street which was sometimes noisy at night with locals walking past and traffic although this wasnt a major problem , Great Location across the road from the beach and bus stops for local and tourist buses close by We had an evening meal in the restaurant which was nothing sparkling but served our purpose and was quiet with no children present 
319541,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, The walls are paper thin so you can hear conversations from the other rooms Fortunately for us we had no neighbors talking later than 11 30 Moreover the room is a tad small and worn out e g cracks in the paint Realistically this hotel should have 3 stars rather than 4 stars Not really worth a good value price , Very close to the beach It s located within a 10 minutes walk to the nearest metro station 
319542,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, The balcony whilst overlooking the sea great was noisy as it was directly facing a dual carriageway As a 4 you had no coffee making facilities so if you travel to this hotel I would recommend you take your own travel kettle and a couple of mugs The price of the breakfasts we had booked without breakfast included seemed steep so we went out for coffee and croissants around the corner If you don t like heights then consider asking for a room on a lower floor as the balcony has a glass surround , The room was not overly large but the bed was comfortable and we had a small balcony Its location was good as it was away from the city centre quiet at night but relatively easy to get to the beach if you wanted to mix the beach with a city visit There were three or four reasonably good restaurants just a few yards away

319566,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, The room was small and cramped and didn t look like the pictures Since on this trip I just needed the room for a short night after being away all day it didn t disturb me that much The problem is that the price paid for the room was really high given what was delivered , The person present at check in gave me hint to park my car The place was clean and fairly close to the beach

319581,NH Hesperia Barcelona del Mar, Our gripe was that the room we got was not half a nice as the pictures on the website I m an early riser and picked this hotel partly because there was a nice looking armchair in the room for me to sit and read on There was no chair in the room at all meat I had to sit on bed which disturbs my wife who likes to sleep in on holiday There was no view of beach or balcony either as in pictures , Location was excellent Barcelona just a fantastic place to spend a long weekend There are some lovely caf restaurants just outside the hotel Short walk to fabulous beach
