256170,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy,No Negative, The helpfulness of staff with any questions We did not have many but witnessed many English travellers with language difficulties and the staff were very helpful to them
256171,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Not sure why the hotel had leaflet that mentioned being environmentally friendly with regard to the use of towels as our towels were either replaced everyday or folded up and returned to their original place under the sink If indeed refolded didn t like that at all I ensured we kept our separate towels hung up so we could reuse them each day Can we have normal coffee sachets in room instead of the chocolate coffee flavour , Staff were very helpful and kind Really liked the communal area especially the kids play corner The bar and terrace area were roomy and pleasant 
256172,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The water for the shower was consistently changing from warm to extra hot to warm to cold to hot by itself Other than that it was an ok stay , Good location Disappointing that the train station was closed for renovations Would have been perfect as it was right in front of the hotel 
256173,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Outside the hotel there was some construction work going on however I didn t hear anything throughout my stay , Bed was very comfy Staff were lovely Overall had an amazing stay The Metro is literally a 2 second walk from the hotel where you can go anywhere from the Eiffel Tower to Disneyland in under an hour 
256174,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, main issue was size of room for three adults it was small , Ideal location to visit Paris Metro station two minutes walk Bery village very nice lots of restaurants to choose from 
256175,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The neighborhood was not the greatest We did not spend a lot of time walking around Definitely not a tourist type area locals in this part were not friendly , Staff was very friendly helpful The property was immaculate 
256176,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, There were no wash clothes in the bathroom It seemed strange as there were a bath towel AND a hand towel per person but not a single wash clothes The sheer curtains in the restaurant had food splatter stains , The staff was wonderful The location to the train station and metro was perfect The room was a little tight once the pull out beds were open I would have found it challenging had we stayed more than one night Breakfast was wonderful The brightness of the restaurant area was delightful 
256177,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Bit of building work going on around it but that can t be helped, Loved the kids entertainment at breakfast and my kids loved the lollipops at reception Family friendly hotel close to Bercy metro station 
256178,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The room design is a bit odd there are construction going during my stay i e noises, Good location near the Metro station Spacious and comfortable room Nice and friendly staff Great wifi 
256179,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Room was awful No coffee machine as advertised seperate bathroom and toilet is a bad idea and there was no wash basin on toilet Coffee making facilities were poor as there was no milk and the cups were paper not even proper cups The strange bird noises that are used to scare pigeons away is very annoying and disturbing and prevents an afternoon nap For the price of the room I would have expected better I couldn t even open the window more than an inch to get some fresh air onto the cramped and stuffy room Not good , Location was excellent and staff were very friendly and helpful breakfast was nice
256180,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy,No Negative, The great location for attending a concert at Accor hotels arena Nice big rooms for Paris Friendly staff Good to have a separate shower and bath in the hotel room Very clean and comfy room Has everything you need for a short weekend in Paris Very quiet inside the hotel great sound proof rooms 
256181,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The queue for the bar on Saturday night was epic Stood in excess of 25 minutes to get served Drink prices also quite expensive The balconies aren t for the faint hearted We were on the 6th floor and it was terrifying There was a gap between the wall and the start of the balcony and the balcony was made up of just some wooden decking boards Stuff of nightmares if you are afraid of heights , Beautiful room well equipped with everything we needed Great location for the Metro 2 minute walk Good location for the AccorHotel Arena 
256182,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy,No Negative, The breakfast was amazing and had great value for money The room was comfortable and the bed was massive perfect for a jet lagged traveller The bathroom was clean and large It was also lovely that there were coffee and tea facilities in the room free of charge 
256183,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, There was rubbish in my bathroom bin There were no flannels in the bathroom There was no complimentary water in the mini bar so I couldn t make any tea They did however respond quickly when I raised this issue It felt so far away from the city centre , The staff were friendly and this made up for anything I didn t like 
256184,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy,No Negative, A modern hotel ideal location for Accor Arena Also close to metro making access to major attractions relatively easy Rooms are clean and comfortable Complimentary bottled water and tea and coffee facilities in the rooms was an added bonus Overall a good experience 
256185,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Nothing all good, Clean comfortable hotel staff very friendly and helpful All in all an excellent weekend we would definitely stay there again if we went back to Paris 
256186,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, some details could be improved add a coffee machine cup un glass not paper in the room provide toothpaste , Staff were nice room really clean and soundproof despite the Fete de la Musique outside
256187,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Access to car park very very tight and the parking alarm was going mad , We went for a concert and the location was superb right next door Staff could not do enough for you and everything was spotless Also ideal location for visiting other places in Paris just up the road from Metro 
256188,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, More bar staff need d on duty when concertgoers exit the accorHotels Arena nearby , Bed linen Changed EVERY day really good when every day was 35 degrees C 
256189,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, No Air Condition on 22nd June night , This hotel does not have its own parking It just share the public parking near to this Hotel When there is any event occurred at the Arena the customer will then hardly to find a parking Will it possible for the Hotel to assist customer to reserve parking during check in 
256190,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The pillows on the bed were very small about half the size of a normal pillow and not comfortable This affected the nights sleep In addition the air conditioning would not go below 24 5 , The hotel is very convenient for the Accorhotel Arena and there are a number of restaurants near by Easy Metro link into the centre of Paris 
256191,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy,No Negative, Very much enjoyed our stay here it s a beautiful hotel in an excellent location The staff were all very helpful and our rooms were always clean and tidy It s in a perfect location for the Arena as its a few steps from the hotel and there are plenty of bar restaurants and shops near by and the metro I d recommend this hotel to anyone We will be coming again in the near future Thank you for a wonderful stay
256192,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Scrambled egg would like more English channels on tv for night time when going to bed also what would be nice is a bike hire facility outside hotel as walking around can take its toll on the body in Paris specially for ppl who have walking disabilities easier to ride a bike than is to walk some ppl don t understand this but very true , Bed was comfortable room very cool in 40 degree heat outside No noisy aircon Only issue was not much in terms of cooked breakfast menu for room service so had to go down early even then food wasn t much of a menu for breakfast what was on offer was very nice apart from scrambled egg which was more like custard 
256193,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, It was expensive for the facilities it has No swimming pool or entertainment , It is situated beside the Accor Arena and was just right for us as we were attending a concert 
256194,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Just temporary but because of major roadworks it looked a bit messy outside, Hotel was very clean the staff were very helpful and friendly Complimentary tea coffee and water Right next door to the accor arena
256195,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Small issue I didn t know minibar contents were included in the room rate until I checked out tried to pay for an item Wasn t in description Train works going on in front of hotel not noisy but a bit of an eyesore However lovely area behind hotel more than makes up for it , Large airy room with air conditioning Novotel reception area very calm and well decorated slightly funky feel Overlooking arena so handy for concert Sunday evening Beautiful park next door leading to restaurants shops in old warehouses Close to metro Gare du Lyon 
256196,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Waiting time at bar was too long especially when the hotel were aware that a concert was being held adjacent to the premises and a high proportion of their guests were attending the concert Additional bar staff for the evening in question would have been a good idea , The room and whole hotel were spotlessly clean All staff members were extremely helpful and polite from the point of entering on our first day to when we left We didn t eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food but the selection of hot cold drink options within our room was excellent The bed was extremely comfortable and the air conditioning was a welcome essential during our stay 
256197,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Asked for a few more pillows because each of us are used to sleeping with 2 and there was 6 of us they struggled to be able to find any and brought 3 up but 2 with no pillow case Bit yuck, Loved the fact breakfast was free for the kids Cemented our decision to have breakfast in the hotel every morning Metro was very very convenient and easy to access Able to get to all major sight seeing attractions with little difficulty using the metro and rail systems Staff were wonderful all extremely helpful
256198,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The 7 I had to pay in case I damaged the room I understood for security reasons but then never got back when I checked out Bit disappointing since I never damaged anything , The location was fabulous Staff were really lovely and could hardly find a thing to fault Bed was comfy view was lovely LOVED THE BLUETOOTH DEVICE for my phone Genius move there Everything was great 
256199,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Booked a room with double bed and a sofa bed found room was only a double took 2 attempts at requesting this to be resolved before anything was done Overpriced and NOT worth the money they rip you off for , Not much really
256200,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The menu in your restaurant the children s options were unavailable on our second night we found an alternative restaurant just across the road which catered to both the children and our needs it was excellent, I particularly liked the courteous attention and assistance provided to my family and I by the young bartender who was exceptional
256201,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Price for the money I would say average but we stayed there during hockey championship in next door arena , Excellent breakfast clean rooms very kind and helpful staff 
256202,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The price could have been better but I m sure relative to other properties same area same type is probably comparable It is paris after all , Location is 100 meters from Accorhotels arena
256203,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The AC was not working which was a bum because at nighht in the room it gets really hot Plus there was constructions outside which no one informed that really bothered me since I came for a vecation Its not as close to the center as many commented but accessable thru metro ,No Positive
256204,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The shower temperature wasn t consistent Our room didn t get cleaned one of the days The beds were very hard and pillows were uncomfortable Neighborhood was lacking charm of other areas in Paris Breakfast wasn t a good value , The bathrooms and showers were nice The rooms were very clean The hotel is very close to good metro connections Lobby was very nice They had a really nice balloon man that made amazing balloon creations for the children 
256205,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Hotel is located next to Arcor Arena If the room is looking at this side one can expect a lot of noise in the evening Staff lacks English skills Organisation can be improved , Hotel is in a good location with good connections to the city Breakfast is excellent quality 
256206,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, I turned up and they had had a systems issues so had no rooms available even tho I had a booking They gave me a cab to another hotel but it took time and wasn t what I needed after a long day,No Positive
256207,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Separate wash room is not good for me we need bathroom and wash room together, It s good to stay in this hotel it is near to station restaurants store and bars are near to hotel
256208,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Noise outside and rooms to hot not enough fresh air, Overall the staff was excellent even with a language barrier could not be more helpful Food excellent Highly recommend
256209,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, When we arrrived Therese at reception was rude was not customer friendly told us we are early and we would need to coke back at 2 as tuatvwhen the room would be available she didn t even offer to take our bags The room was not the same as the pictures the toilet was disgusting has marks in it the floor was dirty there was marks on the walls I was glad to be out of there most of the time exploring Paris the only time we went back was to sleep I or any of my friends I traveled with will not go back to this hotel , Just the reception area as when you see that you think the hotel is amazing And we loved how the reception area smelt 
256210,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Food prices in the hotel were really high breakfast is way over priced 35 50 is crazy Just across the road there was a cafe offering half that , The room and staff were 10 10
256211,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Toilet seat was very very low in room It was very hot in room even with the heating off , I stayed in Paris for a concert the venue was right next to the hotel this was amazing i could roll to and from the venue The best thing about the whole stay was breakfast wow this was amazing really good the room was nice comfy bed and a bad and shower toilet was seperate from the shower Staff was super helpfull and very friendly Great stay it was amazing The bus stop for my international bus was really close by aswell i definitely recommend this hotel 
256212,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, When i ve been there the end of Jan 2017 the view outside is not very nice because there was a roadworks right in front of the hotel s gate And there aren t many restaurants near by so we didn t have many choice and have to go quite far for dinner , This is a very good quality hotel in Paris I love the room The staffs are nice all of them can speak well English 
256213,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, If I had known there was road works and renovations and construction going on in front of the hotel I d have probably booked elsewhere It wasn t the most pleasant welcome to Paris when finding the hotel , The hotel was lovely and much better than I expected Particularly the room layout and lighting It was lovely Plus the location was ideal for getting around Paris easily 
256214,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Thought adjoining rooms meant door between were actually adjacent rooms a little inconvenient with children , Very tidy rooms close to train station parklands river walks and Bercy restaurants
256215,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Staff were slow on occasion not as warm and welcoming as other places but not rude , The room was very tidy and felt like a good quality hotel room was a good temperature and we didn t need to walk far to our room 
256216,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, We thought that for a superior room the toilets where very small very low Not sure what was superior I have stayed in many novotel and the room looked similar apart from the furniture that looks more posh , It was really close to the arena where I went to watch the handball
256217,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Pillows were not great , Excellent location 5 mins walk from nearest metro station and 10 mins walk from the Gare de Lyon Fantastic for visiting all the major Parisian sights Comfortable beds Good choice for breakfast Not cheap at 18euros a head but as children under 16 eat free we only paid for 2 adults we have 4 kids so excellent deal 
256218,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy,No Negative, Hotel was in a perfect location Couldn t have been closer to the metro and numerous restaurants It was very clean and had a modern style to it Thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Paris It was our first time visiting and we found the Metro very easy to use I asked for a special request in our room as it was my girl friend s birthday and they happily obliged It was ready and waiting when we checked in They spoke great English was was helpful and the hotel was quiet at night Delighted with our stay here Will recommend to our friends 
256219,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Nothing, Everything Perfect location quiet large comfy bedroom separate toilets from bathroom cleanliness 11 10 kettle mini fridge Impressive choice for breakfast all taste catered for in a nice airy room All staff was exemplary friendly and helpful This will be our only choice if we return to Bercy
256220,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The mini bar was included but only two small snacks were available The pillows were hard and uncomfortable The shower water temperature went from hot to cold in between shower Only one pair of slippers and robe even though we were two persons staying and the hotel was informed ,No Positive
256221,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The streets were dirty Some of it was as a result of nearby construction Odd bathroom configuration Only two thin paper cups provided for inroom coffee tea A bit pricey , Directly across from the Accorhotel Arena Metro and Gare de Bercy a short walk from hotel Bercy Village a 10 minute walk The Yitzhak Rabin Park is lovely The staff were friendly and helpful Nice bar area Nespresso machine hot water kettle in each room Beds were comfortable Room size 6th floor more than adequate 
256222,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy,No Negative, Friendly and responsive staff Got some problems with credit card while booking They kept room reserved for me even without card confirmation Clean and comfy room good breakfast 
256223,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Nothing, Reception were excellent particularly Marie handled the airport transfer from hotel to airport We were coming from the South of France to take an early flight out of CDG On the way to the airport my daughter found she had left her phone in the room David the driver was brilliant called Marie who found the phone and sent it through another taxi to the airport Alls well that ends well Thank you Marie
256224,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Room service I ordered room service three times and each time they go the order incorrect , Staff were excellent on reception nothing was a hassle and made you feel very welcome
256225,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The pillows were not comfortable high and stiff the bed itself was comfortable the toilet was separate from bathroom in our room, The staff was very helpful The room was very clean Mercy
256226,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, IT was ok but first night we arrived late 11 30 and the we did not get our room they Said the send us to another Hotel and we did and came back next day bee do not know why but we were tired and it was too much to go to another hotell for one night I informed them we are going to do late check in and they said no worries it is open 24 h ,No Positive
256227,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, I dont like the fact that the toilet was separate from the bathroom especially as was no sink doesnt make sense as you still need to use the bathroom to wash hands , Was a good place to stay as we were only across the way from going to the concert that night 
256228,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Cleaning staff 1 kept on knocking on the door even when there was a Do Not Disturb sign 2 toilet rolls and shampoo rationed during our stay as was bacon at breakfast Also the room cleaning product left an unpleasant smell Expensive once breakfast and parking were added in , Location next door to Bercy arena Metro and Gare de Lyon 
256229,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Front desk possibly underdimensioned given the number of rooms, Very close to Bercy underground station and arena Large clean room with standard Novotel features Front desk staff helpful excellent breakfast
256230,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Not a particularly friendly place A lot of the staff were indifferent to us One of our rooms was ready at 2 30 the other room not until 4 45 One room had two permanent pools of water on the carpet The wc and bathroom were very small and uncomfortable , The location was suitable the breakfast was reasonable 
256231,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The room was sweltering as air con is so bad that I think it breaches the trade descriptions to say this hotel has air con Not much better with the window open and then had noise until after 3am , Location fine except you have to walk with cases from the road as the Les Halles development works prevent vehicle access Lovely bar in the foyer Restaurant also spoilt by development works 
256232,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, I had an issue in my room on the second night of my stay Luckily I was out until quite late when I got back to my room it was flooded Not only that but there was sewage in the bath and shower from where I have no idea When I went down to reception to advise them of the issue they mentioned my room wasn t the only one and quickly relocated me to another room I was not offered any kind of compensation or offered any assistance to relocate A sincere apology and some form of compensation would in my opinion be the minimum I should have received I had intended to make this hotel my regular place to stay as I will be travelling to Paris often however after this experience I am not going to do this , Great location and generally clean
256233,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, The room layout was a little unusual with the toilet being separate from the main bathroom It was a little pricey but it certainly wasn t extortionate for a Saturday night in a major city , Very convenient for the AccorHotels Arena which is next door and the Bercy Village for shopping and restaurants The staff were helpful and friendly The breakfast buffet selection was extensive 
256234,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Our taxi was called by the staff It didn t show up Which almost made us late for our train It was quite stressful The rooms were very hot , The adjoined room were excellent The elevator was controlled with your room key which was a safety factor 
256235,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Loads of noise outside the hotel due to construction work going on air conditioning not working our toilet was not flushing properly For a hotel that calibre your just paying for the name Over priced not worth it,No Positive

256237,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Separate toilet was great but awkward for hand washing when someone else was in the shower No bin in toilet, Lovely clean room Friendly and helpful staff Good choice for breakfast Perfect for attending events at Accorhotels Arena Would definitely stay here again 
256238,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Over priced by at least 30 a night expensive food breakfast 5 euro tax bar staff seemed like they was doing me a favour by serving me and 8 50 for a beer ha ha the bathroom sink smelled of sewage I had to hold my nose whilst brushing me teeth , Location to music hall is next door quiet and relaxing
256239,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Need muslim shaver in toilet cleaner didn t cleaned properly Like bedsheets where not changed stock not replaced, Overall good hotel with lovely staff 
256240,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Separate toilet sometimes create smell issue as the cleaning will not be as good as the bath room , The bed and pillow option is the best the room is spacious and the sofa is comfortable
256241,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, when check out I asked for something to other staff however the staff was quite unkind and rude to speak to me Not satisfied with Staff s attitude , when check in a staff kindly upgraded to the executive room which my boss stayed in same level 
256242,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Not enough tea and coffee Only 2 cardboard cups for drinks No free biscuits Uncomfortable pillows Noisy because of building works next door, The staff were very friendly It was next to Bercy Arena Large rooms with big beds Very good value pre concert meal
256243,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Kitchen were unwilling to make me a club sandwich because they were busy After a little argument they eventually sent it up Not good for a hotel in my opinion , Location Free Wifi Staff
256244,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, Noisy from roadworks outside interconnecting door with the room next door This was very flimsy and had no soundproofing , Great location for our stay very easy to reach from the airport and lovely breakfast All in all a nice convenient hotel that I would book again

256247,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy, There were road works going on and the hotel was under refurbishment as well so the reception and the lift area were cluttered , The room was nice and I love the Nespresso coffee machine I love the free fruit at the counter as well I love the balcony and the 6th floor is quite and nice I have a separate shower and a bath
