28329,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing it was great , Very clean great location with a room view of the eifall tower close to a metro station with access to the whole city Not much noise from outside and friendly staff
28330,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The rooms facing the Eiffel were very small compared to the attic rooms The room service had a weird habit of unlocking and entering the room for cleaning This was irrespective of the fact if we are sleeping or bathing inside the room This happened all 2 days of our stay , The Non Eiffel rooms are very spacious with huge bathrooms Every room had a Samsung phone provided by the hotel with data connection We took the phone for our parisian tour and it was big help as we could use google maps The hotel is 200 M from 2 metro stations and just 1 stop from the Eiffel Great Location with MC Donald Monoprix and numerous restaurants around 
28331,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The gym in my opinion wasn t really a gym all it had was a tredmill and weight machine So a little disappointed with that , Staff were very friendly and acomadating The view of the Effiel tower from our room was amazing And was only a 10 15 minute walk to the Effiel tower itself 
28332,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The beds are super comfy and the rooms are extremely clean The absolute best feature of this hotel is its staff They were all so helpful and courteous They made our stay great and I am sold This is the hotel for me whenever I am in town 
28333,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, There was nowhere available for us to have a shower after we checked out It was a very warm day after sightseeing it would have been nice to have a shower before leaving for the train station , Lovely decor and great shower 
28334,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The site did not have an iron to borrow , Staff was very welcoming and helpful Spoke English and recommended restaurants nearby We were able to get a nice view of the Eiffel Tower from our bed at a reasonable price Hotel was walking distance from Eiffel Tower Front Desk was even able to hold our luggge after checkout while we did some final exploring before our flight home 
28335,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, We LOVED it here We got a room with the view of the Eiffel Tower and it was dreamy to wake up and see that each morning The location is just a short walk from the Metro which is insanely easy to use We were worried it would be confusing but it was great 
28336,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing to fault but we didn t use any faculties as ate and drank out of the hotel We parked at the hotel which was unique as they had a lift you drove into , We booked a room with a view of the effiel tower and boy it did not disappoint it was definitely worth the extra money 
28337,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing, We were upgraded to the room on the top floor with an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower it was very romantic and very quiet which was lovely there was a market outside on Wednesday morning where we got some baguettes and breakfast it was very cultural and interesting walking to the Eiffel Tower in the evening was only a 15 minute walk and it was very magical and easy to get back to the hotel the staff were very helpful and spoke very good English as well as this metro access was great we could get around the city no problem I would definitely recommend getting a room on the top floor 
28338,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I could only find two faults within my stay The view from the hotel rooms were not as good as anticipated only getting a glimpse of the top The rooms were quite small looked much larger in the pictures , Excellent little hotel Lovely decor great location only 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower The staff were excellent very polite and brilliant service Hotel was accomadating and flexible with check in times 
28339,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I paid for a room with an Eiffel Tower view and all I got was a view of the tip of the tower Total lie The room and hallway smelled bad the Room was so small I couldn t turn around, Close to metro
28340,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, the coffee machine didnt work in the room the noice from the train station the pice for the two night was not worth it the room service came from the restaurant teo doors down and the plates were not taken away from the room but the towels were replaced , the staff where friendly The room was nice with the eiffel tower view 
28341,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Shower drainage wasn t great , View of the Eiffel Tower was awesome Position close to metro meant it was easy and cheap to get around with Eiffel Tower within 10min walk central location Markets across the road were nice Room was very well sound proofed Rooms looked recently refurbished and were very nice Staff very friendly and helpful Good water pressure 
28342,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, we liked the complete hotel and all of its facilities Especially the generosity and proficiency of the Team of Staff members, We went there during our European tour for two days from England via the train to a very warm welcome and a fantastic bottle of champagne in our room I asked for a room overlooking the Eiffel Tower and this was accommodated We sat and drank our bottle overlooking this most fantastic sight We must thank the hotel for their efficiency and the assistance of their Team Members for the most fantastic stay 
28343,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, If I had to nitpick maybe the rooms could be a little bigger but this is just a tiny thing that I really didn t even care about Great stay, The location was EXCELLENT It it within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower and just a short walk to the metro We were able to go everywhere we wanted to go in hardly any time at all There are plenty of shops within very close walking distance and delicious restaurants We really enjoyed our stay in Paris because it was so easy to get around 
28344,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Small rooms hight price for a very average service and quality of accomodation , In general the hotel was OK The location is of course very good if you want to reach the city center on foot The view from the rooms is directly at the road and metro trains which is not so attractive The only rooms with a nice view are on the top of the building but they cost even more The hotel is clean and modern but the rooms are so small that we could hardly close the door of a bathroom being inside In general I felt that I paid too much for what was offered 
28345,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Hotel reception under staffed Front desk is usually empty and had to wait 15 mins to jus get our bags out, Hotel location was ideal and the room was cozy
28346,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Wifi was not stable Except that nothing more to complain about Small but very clean , Very clean bed Clean and quiet neighborhood I didn t eat breakfast in Hotel 
28347,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I didn t like that the room was stifling hot and the air conditioner was not turned on in the room We had to ask the front desk staff to turn on the unit It was very disappointing that there was not an independent thermostat within the room The room was also dated and small , The front desk staff were extremely helpful and nice 
28348,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nine, Bed comfortable toiletries Le Occitane bathroom very modern and clear spacious room has Nespresso soundproof quiet environment walking distance to Eiffel Tower
28349,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Great location easy walking distance to major attractions and an amazing selection of food and drink nearby The local market on Sunday was an added bonus 
28350,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Bed was uncomfortable, The view from the room is fantastic and the facilities are great but you do need to stay more than one night to enjoy using them 
28351,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, There s no desk in the room there is a table so if you need to work a lot from behind a desk in the hotel it can be inconvenient , Clean modern no nonsense hotel with nice designer rooms 
28352,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Room was compact but well arranged bathroom modern bed comfortable The only thing was that there is no real closet They have an area in the room for hanging clothing and there are drawers but space is limited All in all the positive things about this hotel very much outweigh the small inconvenience of the closet space We would definitely stay here again , The hotel was within easy walking distance from the Eiffel Tower which we had a beautiful view of from our hotel room the metro numerous cafes and a small dept store up the block which had a wonderful bakery inexpensive baguettes croissants etc all within a short walking distance EVERYONE of the staff members were as helpful as possible I was able to practice my French and the staff was so helpful in indicating for us how to get to the various locations we wanted to travel to by metro Location of hotel was very centrally located All the hop on hop off buses were only a few blocks walk by the Eiffel Tower Best part of the Hotel experience was the wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower both during the day and the beautiful lights of the tower in the evening I would highly recommend if you stay here to splurge and get a room with a view 
28353,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Everything was excellent except after telling us there would be a phone for us to use for messaging looking up places of interest etc it was removed from our room after first night and not returned We were told it was for updating but that wouldn t take 4 days Would have preferred for it not to be offered But that was the only disappointment A fridge would have been handy , The friendliness of all the staff They went out of their way to assist The hotel was so perfect for us we feel Lucky to have found it 
28354,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, More information on excursions if I m being picky can t really fault the hotel for anything , The location and view was very good The phone we were given for our stay was very useful and a great idea 
28355,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, nothing, Everything about this property was great I booked a room with a view of the Eiffel tower and got exactly that A mobile was provided free for use during our stay which was invaluable Will be back 
28356,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The breakfast was basic and too expensive for what was offered compared with other similar hotels in Paris The bar was basic and did not offer any draft beer , A good cup of coffee was prepared individually by order at breakfast time The bedroom was large for Paris and the bedroom was very comfortable 
28357,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Hard to pick anything out if I was being really picky all I d say is instructions as to how to use the coffee machine Ive never used one before so that s my own fault and maybe a mini fridge as we bought our own milk tea and sugar and ended up throwing away the milk , The most comfortable bed I have ever stayed in the views were amazing and breakfast in bed made the trip extra special 
28358,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, No mini fridge in room to keep drink foods cold No ironing board facilities in room Don t think you should have to pay for laundry services, Location staff members rooms overall service excellent 
28359,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, If I was really fussy I d say the lack of a fridge mini bar was the only thing I missed Nothing at all to complain about , Just a ten minute walk from the Eiffel tower and with views of the tower itself from the room this hotel was an excellent choice Loved the decor very nice staff comfortable quiet despite the metro running outside Great location for walking to cafes and restaurants near many sights and with two metro lines running outside Hope to come back to Paris again soon and Le Parisis will be my first choice 
28360,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing in the Hotel but conned by the Taxi so watch out , Location was very good and there was even a twice a week market outside the door As I was on the 5th floor the noise of the market didn t impact and I could view the Eiffel Tower which I had paid to see The friends I was meeting stayed in a more expense Hotel but it was too busy and nothing in the room was working and they had no view even though they were very close to the Eiffel Tower A good smaller 4 deserved rating 
28361,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The front desk staff who checked us in was not friendly and talked to us like we were his student The reservation was a junior suite but it was actually a double bed plus a sofa bed in the double bed room A suite is misleading In addition there were only two glasses for brushing teeth in the bathroom and two glasses for drinking water while we were a group of three I called the front desk and the same staff answered the phone He insisted that there were no glasses in the bathroom and even there were the hotel would not provide an extra glass for brushing teeth to us I requested him to come to the room to show him what glasses in the bathroom I was referring to and he agreed So I then put down the phone without saying another sentence He came to the room after 15 mins with one glass for drinking water He then insisted that the hotel would not provide the 3rd glass in the bathroom after I showed him that there were two glasses in the bathroom I was so shocked at his answer and I did not want to argue further with him Before I closed the door he turned around and said to me Next time when you finish talking on the phone you should say goodbye before putting down the phone At first I did not understand what he meant but then I realised that he actually complained about me putting down the phone without saying goodbye How ridiculous is that I think he forgot that I was the guest and he was the staff I did make a complaint when I checked out and the female manager did apologise to me However this really affected our mood staying in this hotel , Location is excellent 1 min s walk to the Metro and a lot of restaurants and stores around 
28362,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing , The receptionists were particularly welcoming and spoke English which was good for those of us using rusty French The bedroom had a lovely view of the Eiffel tower and had beautiful toilietries provided So close to the metro and spoilt for choice on where to eat and drink 
28363,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Maybe I didn t like that Eiffel Tower view I saw the tower from my room but I expected more with the price that I gave , The room was very clean and comfortable The Staff was very friendly they got 5 stars from me It s a quiet and elegant place The hotel is near Eifel Tower about 5 10 minutes walk Maybe I didn t like that Eiffel Tower view I saw the tower from my room but I expected more with the price that I gave 
28364,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Initially we thought that the breakfast was included in the price of the room but upon checking out we were informed that we had to pay Still it was worth it , The staff at this location were very friendly helpful and professional Breakfast was great The bed very comfortable and a lovely bathroom There are many restaurants bars and shops in the neighbourhood which we enjoyed tremendously It is about 10 to 12 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and about the same to the nearest stop for the Hop on Hop off bus The Metro station is a block away which made it easy and convenient when going sight seeing and when arriving from the airport For the price we paid it was excellent value and I would readily recommend it 
28365,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast 17 each Showers wouldn t stop leaking had to use most of our towels to stop it from going into the bedroom no choice on pillows I didn t sleep well only had really soft Superking bed was really two singles pushed together You are not guaranteed a room with a city or eiffel tower view Be prepared to spend a lot of money here 4 for a bottle of water Reception wanted to charge me extra 10 just because I asked him if he could phone me a taxi We asked for a wake up call and didn t feel like we got one no alarm clocks in the room almost missed our flight if it wasn t for Uber Bring lots of Euro keep quite a bit on your bank card to book Ubers cheaper and have enough to pay for a velib bike fine Never say yes to a looky looky man and don t ask why if you are told no You should have a pleasant stay , Peaceful and luxurious feel Very helpful staff Has sauna and executive option Climate controlled room with electric shutter and medium firmness bed ensured a great nights sleep for my husband Lovely lady receptionist did everything she could and even upgraded us to privilege for free Location is 20mins walk from Eiffel tower and there are lots of cute cafes to have breakfast or a beer in 
28366,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, We had a fantastic weekend at the Hotel Parisis the staff were supurb right from arrival and provided everything we could have required the room was modern clean tidy and had an excellent view of the Eiffel Tower The hotel is also fantastically located within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower and also the Metro which made exploring paris very easy We would highly recommend 
28367,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The staff in the hotel went out of their way to help us Our room was ready early so we could go in and freshen up before exploring They even let us borrow an adapter plug when we realised we bought the wrong one The hotel was in a great location too only a 15 minute slow walk from the Eiffel Tower The bars and restaurants around the hotel were great too The room was clean and comfortable with a great shower and an amazing big window with a view of the Eiffel Tower Worth every penny and would love to return 
28368,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The room is smaller than I thought it would be but their cute chic design made up for the lack of space, I have to say that I am impressed with this hotel Having heard rumors about how the hotel staff in Paris can be rude I came there with low expectations but the staff was really nice just the right amount of professionalism and friendliness Our room was clean and it looked fresh and new we also had a room upgrade where we could see a little bit of the Eiffel Tower The breakfast was good too for just 17 it was a treat I love that every room has their own samsung phone with 4g that you can take anywhere with you it was really helpful The Eiffel Tower is about 1 3 kms from the hotel so you can walk or take a taxi for 7 
28369,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The phone they gave us with data was so helpful and helped us to get around the city There we great restaurants cafes and shopping walking distance The metro is a very close walk as well 
28370,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The staff seemed a bit snooty about having a young man in a hoodie bringing McDonalds through their lobby I think they expected more upper class guests , The view of the Eiffel Tower from the window was great The rooms were very attractive and comfortable Amazing location
28371,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Great location Very central Staff were excellent Didn t try the breakfast Didn t look to impressive for the price and there were many other places to eat Really enjoyed the proximity to the Metro was very easy to get to any our meeting places for various tours 
28372,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Staff very friendly room was very clean and the bed VERY comfy We also had a great view of the Eiffel Tower which was great we looked forward to watching the lights flashing from the comfort of our hotel room 
28373,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing, Rooms were really comfortable especially the beds and really big for Paris bathroom was so clean shower amazing and with great toiletries the reception were so friendly and helpful with directions The bar area was really nice and drinks reasonably priced I would definitely recommend and would return as the hotel was situated close to the Eifel tower with lots of lovely restaurants and cafe s nearby and a tube very close A great choice couldn t ask for a better hotel 
28374,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, At the check in the manager wrote down my CVC code on the pretence they need to check me Later I realized they can t do that won t stay at this hotel again have to reissue card now Really disappointing , Bed was comfortable bathroom was clean
28375,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Excellent accommodations Hotel was new and modern Room exceeded my expectations in size and comfort Bathroom was modern with an amazing shower Great location Spectacular view of the Eiffel tower and within 4 min walk to metro 
28376,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was very expensive 17 Hotel locked itself up at night and one night we were unable to get in for 30 minutes , Decent location A few minutes walk to the tower Quite a longer walk to other attractions Free cell phone to take and use while in Paris Amazing bathroom Elevated train line runs right in front but it has rubber wheels and is hardly noticeable Hundreds of cafes nearby 
28377,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Paris is an expensive city so all rooms in any hotel are expensive , Staff exceptionally friendly and committed to providing extra service The room with a view of the Eiffel tower is amazing Very comfortable bed great bathroom which looks like it was new renovated with a good sized walk in shower The biggest room I have had in Paris Lovely area to sit and have a drink and believe that this is where breakfast is served Many restaurants nearby
28378,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing its all good , Its very luxurious and I LOVED the shower Room Service are great and the extra touch of an additional phone to take with you where ever you go is a nice touch 
28379,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Only issue was that room had no view window and instead had a large skylight with excellent shade system , Reasonably priced plentiful breakfast Staff were superb especially reception Room very updated and large by European standards Interesting smartphone offered that is preloaded with info about attractions transportation and more but we never inquired as to the cost Taxis and Uber were pretty available 
28380,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Good location The Eiffel Tower was a 10 minute walk The beds were super comfy and had two very good nights sleep The room was bigger than I expected The large shower was great with L Occitane toiletries 
28381,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I can t think of a thing , Jean Pierre immediately made us feel more than welcome He is extremely patient and knowledgeable The woman running the breakfast I am sorry I do not know her name was lovely and the breakfast wonderful 
28382,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Great hospitality great staff great location affordable price perfect place to stay I stayed there with my partner for 3 nights we ll come back definitely Even a room at lower story had the Effel Tower view 
28383,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Temperature in the room was very odd I was hot and cold but r wasn t tooo bad I still very much enjoyed the stay, Everything The stafff the room the decor 
28384,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I wish the toilet space wasn t so small it did make me feel a bit claustrophobic I wish there were a few more English speaking channels other than the news , Le Parisis Hotel is a beautiful hotel located in quite a central location Very close to the metro station only 10 minutes from the Eiffel Tower and heaps of restaurants surrounding it It s not too far from the Arc de Triomphe or the Champs Elysees about a 30 minute walk but it takes you through some beautiful views of Paris If safety is a concern we felt very safe in the area We walked to the Eiffel Tower around midnight and came back around 2 30 but the area was still very lively with lots of people walking around The staff are extremely friendly accomodating We were always greeted with a smile and always asked about our day and what we planned to do for the day We were allowed to check in at 12 because our room was ready at no extra cost which was a very nice touch considering we d been in Paris since 9am All in all it was an amazing stay and I would definitely recommend it stay there again 
28385,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The stay had been going pretty well We decided to go to Disneyland on one of the first days we got to Paris On our last day in the hotel the cleaners TOOK the presents souvenirs that we both from Disneyland We advise the reception about this straight away and the said they would ask the cleaner about it the next day and send me an email as we were leaving a few hours later I waited 3 days to hear something back from the hotel and received nothing I then took it upon myself to email them and they replied saying there is nothing they can do and that I have no proof they took anything I did not find this an acceptable or professional response I replied to their email and have still yet to hear back from them two weeks later I would not recommend this hotel as I find it uncomfortable to think that someone was going through my things took something that wasn t there s and to be told I ve no proof Will definitely not be going back ,No Positive
28386,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, There should be more than one English speaking television channel, The hotel was very small but vey nice The underground transport system in Paris is amazing
28387,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Very few English channels on the tv considering they target the UKI market for reservations Curtains in the room don t close very well, Great staff clean fantastic location very comfy bed and room 
28388,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, We were in a very small loft converted room Toilet was tiny size of a cupboard and the door just about opened without touching the edge of the toilet so had to leave door open due to feeling claustrophobic We were given dressing gowns on our first night which were then taken away and not replaced by the cleaner , The bed was big clean and comfortable The bathroom was big toiletries were good quality A hotel mobile was given with access to internet around Paris
28389,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The friendliness of the staff and how helpful they were The location is just a short walk to the Eiffel Tower and has great shopping and eating nearby 
28390,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing , Everything From the moment we stepped inside and were greeted for the checkin to the moment we departed and were able to leave our luggage for 7 hours before our train back to London The room was clean quiet airy had very comfortable beds The best surprise for us was the fact that the hotel provided us with a mobile phone in the room that we were able to take with us during our visit It had all the best travel apps on it and we had an unlimited data and minute plan location location location Short walk to the Eiffel Tower Very short walk to the tube station Loved our stay at the Le Parisis and we will definitely book this again when we are next in Paris 
28391,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, We arrived in Paris quite early due to the time of our Eurostar and wasn t able to check in until 2pm I know there are check in times it would have been nice if we could have settled into our rooms earlier We also didn t have a Samsung phone in the room like they said we would have, The room was a really good size and the specification of the furnishings and bathroom etc was lovely
28392,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, , Very good amenities two metro stations nearby Eiffel Tower and Seine banks are reachable by feet within a few minutes Good restaurants and bars around Very quiet room although it was directly beneath the elevator 
28393,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, From the start of our stay all our wishes were fulfilled with ease and reliability The staff in the hotel is very welcoming and friendly The hotel room with view of the Eiffel Tower was amazing 
28394,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, What I didn t like was that we were not told that breakfast was not included in our price when we booked it and the food provided was really not up to par They had no umbrellas if it was raining outside , I liked that it was in close proximity of alot of stores and restuarants It was clean staff was very attentive Hotel was very quiet 
28395,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, We booked a twin room but they only provided a double I had also emailed prior and asked that they ensured it was a twin and they said it wouldn t be a problem But then they still gave us a double,No Positive
28396,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The desk receptionists The staff lacked courtesy most of the time I paid premium for a room with a view and since it was a 4 star hotel I was expecting a 4 star service I wasn t offered the bathrobe for the Sauna I was ignored when I asked for a refill for the coffee machine The staff can be more friendly I wasn t expecting the snobbery , The Eiffel tower view and the Nespresso machine in the room The room was comfortable and clean 
28397,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, A male staff member was rude the room is small you can here water running when neighbors take their shower, The property is very well organized with new facilities I really liked the fact that they give a cell phone with a 4g connection The amenities they put are of a great value and quality and the shower is great after a long day of walk
28398,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Maybe the price as it s more to just a boutique hotel there are market wet dry in front of the hotel cause smelly air , Location very near to the underground train Hotel facilities is good Staff are friendly 
28399,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Evening reception continuously on smoking brakes in front of the main door did not advise that on a Sunday they don t provide room service except for sandwich, The bed was very confortare and the place was extremely clean
28400,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The hair dryer wasn t working they could have replaced it but I didn t ask for another one , The location was great The staff are super friendly I liked the breakfast 
28401,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing , Everything about the property was perfect Location Value Service Second time staying here and was just as pleased as the last visit Would suggest people to eat out for breakfast as their are a lot of cafes and restaurants within 5mins walking distance 
28402,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Free breakfast, Great location for sights and ease of travel Rooms slightly small but that s expected for central paris 10 euros a drink at the bar is a down side as well
28403,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, We felt that 17 each for breakfast was a bit steep given the limited choices but what was there was lovely , The location of the hotel was great short walks everywhere and the metro just outside made going further afield easier
28404,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was not included in my booking but when we went to have breakfast it wasnt worth it however the location means you have many options to choose to have breakfast from instead , Great location great rooms great service Worth every penny 
28405,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing , I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough The staff could not be more helpful and our room provided stunning views of the Eiffel Tower The location was great and directly opposite the metro which was ideal for accessing all major tourist attractions Our room was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean The perfect choice to celebrate my 21st birthday a big thank you to the staff for helping to make it so special 
28406,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, rooms too hot but it took us a while to understand the automatic window openers , very calm although close to the center very close to metrostations We visited all spots in Paris by metro nice and friendly personnel
28407,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Absolutely nothing couldn t fault it at all , Absolutely loved staying here The staff were so welcoming warm and friendly They couldn t do more for us we arrived early so they stored our luggage whilst we went to do some sight seeing Later when we went to dinner they took the time to ask how we found our room and if we needed anything The room couldn t have been better The view of the Eiffel Tower was amazing And getting to lie in bed and watch the lights twinkle away honestly made our stay So special and romantic The location of the hotel couldn t have been better 2 metro stops only a few minutes walk away and the Eiffel Tower only took us 10 mins I couldn t recommend this hotel enough so much so that they day after we got home I booked up again for my 30th birthday in September Can t wait 
28408,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was a little too expensive , Easy to get in and out of central Paris and getting to and from Gard du Nord also really simple All in all a lovely hotel lovely staff Great view too
28409,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Hotel breakfast was slightly expensive but there were a ton of options in the Grenelle neighborhood right outside the front door , Staff was extremely pleasant and attentive The view from the room was top notch We will definitely return to Le Parisis the next time we visit Paris 
28410,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing, Excellent hotel close to lots of places to eat Staff we always polite and attentitive including the ladies that serviced the rooms And close to metro station which we used everyday
28411,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Being picky would have been nice to have an iron and board in the room this was provided when asked for however so not really an issue Breakfast teabags instead of earl grey that s about it, Great view of the Eiffel Tower from the room no street or metro noise when window closed despite it being so near Comfortable and enjoyable experience
28412,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Very poor wifi signal and soundproof isn t that great as you are informed whenever a metro is getting close , Location is good and staff are friendly and helpful 
28413,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I wish there was a restaurant in the hotel that would offer dinner because it s pretty hard to find a good place for having dinner , The room was really nice and comfy just as pictured The staff was friendly and helpful I really enjoyed the hotel and I would definitely visit it again 
28414,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The staff is amazing and so friendly Felt like being apart of a family The property is centrally located and easily accessable Very nice and chic hotel
28415,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, No view of the Eiffel Tower not much options for parking , Typical boutique hotels with modern chic design The facilities were clean good location and friendly staff Our rooms were quiet with lots of complementary coffee and tea 
28416,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I hated the fact when someone took the stairs it moved the front door so I felt that someone was coming in the room I also noticed that anyone can enter the main hotel reception and access upstairs with security The reception is most times at night unattended and you don t need a key passcode to activate the lift For a 4 star hotel this is needed It made me feel unstable , I stayed at room 56 and I loved it The space of the room gave an apartment feel and the bed and shower was amazing I also loved the window Location is excellent
28417,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The bed was comfortable and the staff was very helpful The lady at the front desk on our first night went out of her way to help me print our tickets to Disneyland for use the next day when I had forgotten to print them prior to our trip 
28418,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing to fault Everything was suberb , The hotel could have not been better very clean and brilliant location The reception staff went above and beyond to make our stay extra special Hamid and Victoria were both wonderful 5 service to them We will all definitely be coming back to the hotel xx
28419,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, A little pricy but I guess it s normal for the Paris area, We had a window view of the top of the Eiffel Tower so that was beautiful to wake up to At first glance the hotel doesn t seem fancy at all but it very nice and modern on the inside 
28420,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing bad comes to mind , The location is everything walking distance from the tower right in front of the subway station and close to bars and restaurants The bed is very comfy and the room was perfectly clean

28424,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, We chose this hotel because of the services advertised and expected at a 4 hotel only to be left disappointed when there in fact was no room service and the bar didn t open for the entire weekend stay , The Hotel was lovely very clean with a great location 
28425,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Near active train tracks but with the windows closed it shielded the noise Breakfast was not included as I was told only those who book directly get that not through booking com and the price for a breakfast was expensive for mediocre food , The beds were extremely comfortable shower large with rainfall showerhead view of Eiffel tower not too far away 
28426,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, French is not my language so I didn t read a card to ask to clean the room so they didn t clean , I loved the bathroom There is a Pizzerie next to the Hotel deliciuous

28430,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was a little pricey so we ate elsewhere Rooms should have ice bucket , We were greeted with a smile and a lil humor The room was modern and very clean Fresh crisp apples and water awaited us in the room We booked the room with an Eiffel Tower view AMAZING 
28431,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Staff could have been a little more helpful pre arrival Asked for a cot for another room in our party and was told it would depend on availability when we arrived It was provided and staff were very helpful while there but not the best impression before the trip , Very comfy rooms and nice showers

28433,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The staff member in the morning did not seem very helpful when we asked him if he could call a cab We ended up taking care of it ourselves instead , We spent the night here after our civil wedding The room had an incredible view of the Tour Eiffel and the metro line 6 The rooms are modern but chic The breakfast was simple but good I would definitely stay here again 
28434,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The floor of the shower was as slick as ice I had to put a towel on it so I didn t slip and fall Quite dangerous , The staff was outstanding Everyone was friendly helpful and treated us like family 
28435,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I did not like that the hotel was short of staff in the evening By short I mean there was no one except one person at the reception and that was it so for everything I wanted I had to go downstairs Room was very small for a family of 3 there was no space to move in the room no place for luggage at all no tissues were provided to us in the room There were stains on the carpet The room was cleaned everytime we went out but the cleanliness went down as the day passes by we were in the hotel for 5 days , I loved where the hotel was located it was at walkable distance to the Eiffel Tower and train station was just outside the hotel 
28436,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The man in the reception the day we arrived wasn t very polite only that man all the others were very friendly Also there should be a little fridge in the rooms , Good hotel very clean and in a good location

28443,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, What let the hotel down was although the bedroom and bathroom was very attractive it had a basic feel Open wardrobe had to ask for ironing board and iron no black tea or milk but strangely two green apples and two bottles of water Also no guest book on services For 270 a night felt it was overpriced , Friendly staff Good position close to Eiffel Tower and two metro stations Front rooms on floor five and six have Eiffel Tower views beautiful bar lounge Liked the Nespresso machine Comfortable bed great shower There was a good value room service menu although we didn t use it as plenty of caf s nearby

28446,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Sorry I really can t think of anything , We had a partial view of the Eiffel tower and a beautiful room There was a bit of a problem with the plumbing initially but the staff was great about dealing with it The hotel staff esp Hamid Yves and Dimitri were wonderfully kind and helpful and made us feel at home And the breakfast and where it was served was absolutely the best We had a great stay and will certainly return one day 
28447,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The first night our shower would not get hot Upon calling to complain they said they would fix it tomorrow The next day the host barged into our room after knocking with a secondary person without introducing her They then disrespectfully stood on a towel in our bathroom and left in on the floor after judging the fact that we were not out exploring at noon Felt very disrespectful and unprofessional He then told me to repack my stuff and meet him downstairs so he can give us a room in a few hours It was absurd I went down to complain and finally there was some accomodation ,No Positive

28450,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, No room Service after 22 00, Very helpful staff beautiful room nice location and a great view if you are looking for the stunning view but don t feel like paying above 300 euros per night this is the place to go
28451,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The hotel seems to be better in picture In reality the room was too claustrophobic There was no staff to help us with the luggage We had to drag the heavy luggage ourselves Reception was a podium with a single person with laptop attending the guests Me n my daughter felt disgusting with the hospitality after such a long journey from India We recommend to go with branded hotel chains ,No Positive
28452,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, One of the staff was not really on the ball He forgot to make an important call for us and he wasn t very attentive The rest of the staff were great , The bed was fabulous I hated to leave it The location was perfect as we mainly had plans for the Eiffel Tower and the Seine There were plenty of restaurants near by

28456,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I paid extra for an eiffel tower view as it was my boyfriends 30th birthday but the view was shocking Nothing like the pictures I wanted it to be special and romantic but all we could see was the very tip of the tower Not worth the extra money and I would have stayed at a different hotel had I known Staff could have been a little bit friendlier as well , The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was amazing The coffee machine in the room was a bonus for my boyfriend too and apparently made nice coffee

28460,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Great hotel at a great location This hotel is really worth its money You are a 3 minute walk away of two Metro stations and a short walk of the Champ de Mars park The stuff is also really kind and helpful The only thing which isn t that convenient is that there is no restaurant in the hotel itself But there are plenty of restaurants next door There s also a small Carrefour on the other side of the street which has all you need 
28461,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Lift is slow The bar only had 3 beers lol so they were gone within a few minutes and were told to serve ourselves by getting the beer out of the fridge behind the bar Over priced for what you get , Location 10 min walk to eiffel tower Clean modern room Room had a great view of the eiffel tower which looked spectacular at night lit up Close to metro 
28462,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Just a little incovient at the checking in One of the staffs said they were not ready with the room yet ask us to wait and forgot about us there for 40 mins And it was 4pm when we were there how could they didn t have the room ready yet Also it will be better if the room is bigger The size of the room is enough for two but don t feel the luxury feel like good specification standard hotel size room Also we booked for tower view rooms they are right next to the metro and we have been given the first floor So there is not much view of the tower more of watching train passing through Gladly the window is very good to block a lot of noise otherwise it will ruin my trip So try to avoid first floor tower view room if you can it doesn t worth the money , The hotel is excellent Location is really good good for shopping dining and closed to the tube Love the interior and the lounge area Some staffs are really nice and helpful I had a breakfast there one morning the waitress is giving me everything she have in the kitchen I was so stuffed that day

28487,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The smell of the room was almost intoxicating every time we walked into it after a day of being out I think it could be because of the renovation but an air freshner should be introduced or some sort of carpet spray , The hotel has been newly renovated so all facilities are almost new The room we had on level 5 Room 55 was spacious with Eiffel Tower views Also because we were on our honeymoon they had left us a congratulatory card on our table with some mini cupcakes and macarons

28508,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The first receptionist , I choose this hotel because I wanted to book a room with the Eiffel tower view I reserved a room but they denied my reservation without telling me A few days before the departure I casually checked the reservation and I realized there was no reservation I called the hotel that refused to give any explanation and refused also to give me the room at the same price of my reservation The result was that I had to pay an extra of 100 to have the room I booked 1month before The room in total was 400 euros for 2 night and 2persons Despite the lack of kindness of some members of the stuff the hotel was ok The view of the room was wonderful and unforgettable You could lay on the bed while looking to the Eiffel tower It was very romantic The room was clean they also changed our towels the day after Perfect if you want a romantic week end

28519,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, only came across 1 member of staff that was helpful No staff in bar waited 20mins and gave up in end Gym and sauna not open while there Only 2 English speaking channels on TV Still parts of hotel being renovated so was a bit noisy at times , Location great Close to attractions Eiffel Tower 5mins walk and plenty of good places to eat and drink close by Nice rooms very clean and comfortable bed Great shower 
28520,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The breakfast was expensive and did not offer too much to choose from so the advice is to eat outside there are plenty place around the region When we arrived at 15 00 which was one hour past the check in time our room was not yet ready we had to wait and the front desk person did not even explained initially why we had to wait and after 10 minutes we asked what was taking so long and he in a very rude manner told us to be patient The room did not had an information brochure e g if you need to call to the front desk you need to magically guess that you need to dial 9 I also needed to use an iron which I had to go downstairs to get it because there was no way to know how to call front desk and the receptionist asked me to bring it back after I was done very informal hostel kind of approach so those little perks you expect to get when you go to a 4 star hotel you will not get it from this one , The location was good the shower and bed were very good 
28521,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Elevator jumps after reaching to the target floor A bigger window would be better , Very close to the Eiffel Tower great view at night when the light is on Many restaurants bars markets within walking distance Complimentary water tea coffee and apples in the room Friendly staff And the shower head is awesome 
28522,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I booked 2 rooms for Effel tower view but When I arrive hotel with my family hotel staff told that they do not have Eiffel tower view room I felt very bad When I asked hotel what is the purpose of booking in advance They replied that this is my choice now if I want I can go to another hotel I was very angry as I visited 1st time in France Anyway I manage But when I paid the bill they charge the full amount of the room They should charge less as it was given the room without any view When I asked them to give discount as you have not given the room of my choice Hotel staff told me that you write a E mail then they will think to return some amount This is really very bad , I did not like anything in the hotel It is an average hotel not the 4 star category 
28523,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, When we arrived we had to bring our own baggage in and take it to our rooms via the lift that was still being finished and had wires hanging out and loose tiles in the floor No explanation was given for this There is no fridge in the room and consumables weren t restocked each day When I went to book an additional night purely to avoid the hassle of moving our luggage I was quoted a price I could get cheaper on booking com Many times I told the staff that it was my wife s 30th birthday including when booking but nothing was done to make the stay special for her at all Pretty disappointed especially for the price , Mostly new and clean Short walk to the Eiffel Tower 
28524,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, The hotel is classed as a four star but has no facilities to speak of We arrived at about 7 00pm and wanted a drink but were told the bar was not in use The restaurant did service breakfast but that was it If you wanted lunch of evening meal you had to go out Luckily it s in a vicinity that has lots of restaurants Our bedroom was advertised as having a view of the court yard but all we had was a blank wall facing us , The staff were really helpful and couldn t do enough for you with regards to helping you find your way around Paris The hotel bedroom was nice and clean and we had maid service every day 
28525,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Very close to Eiffel Tower within 10 minute walk privelage room had very nice view of the Eiffel Tower which on the night time looked amazing all lit up sparkling Sunday morning market opposite was lovely to walk through and some lovely fresh pastries for breakfast Hotel staff very friendly and room very spacious

28527,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, We arrived at the hotel on a Sunday and found that our names were not on the arrival list at the lobby Unbeknownst to us we had through our own fault made a booking for the wrong day Monday instead of Sunday Instead of working with us to try to figure out what was going on the man at the lobby immediately told us in the most unpleasant manner that he didn t have our booking After ignoring our repeated requests for the WiFi password so we could look up our booking confirmation email he instructed me very patronisingly to calm down informed us repeatedly that we were wrong and proceeded to give us a condescending lesson in etiquette though we were at no time rude and only confused and understandably alarmed at the thought of possibly not having a reservation In the end a room was available and told us we could have it for which we were grateful though he did it in the most unpleasant combative manner The lift to our 6thfloor room was malfunctioning so we had to lug our luggages up two floors of steps without any offer at all of assistance Our room when we got to it was well appointed with a lovely view but had a strange and mouldy smell A pretty hotel but the welcome we had gotten just left a vile aftertaste , Clean pleasant facilities with great view and convenient facilities
28528,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, You can hear your neighbour in a room Its a small detail but every time cleaning lady exchanged towels in bathroom she left only shampoo Even though we running out of soap shower gel and lotion we were given shampoo After 4 days spent in this hotel we had 6 bottles of shampoo and no soap and shower gel at all , Really nice hotel newly furnished View on Eiffel tower from your room Perfect location and friendly staff It still in process of reconstruction but on a good way This should be a 5 star hotel Next time in Paris I am staying in this hotel only The money you pay is really worth

28532,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I think the rating is false Staff are not helpful at all I had to ask for water to be put in my room everyday of which it was only put on the day we arrived The cleaning staff would leave dirty glasses Ordered wine on the day we arrived and the dirty glasses were still there on check out yet our room was supposedly cleaned daily Totally disgruntled, Nothing
28533,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, Terrible smell of artificial perfumed room spray gave me an asthma attack We had to open window and door to clear the smell and be able to breathe again Reception area equally poisonous , Location Our bathroom was designed for the disabled so it was very large Comfy beds and pillows Stylish furniture

28543,Le Parisis Paris Tour Eiffel, I have nothing negative to say about the actual hotel but when we were there they did not yet have their new name displayed outside it was formerly called Ramada Tour Eiffel which made it a little confusing when we arrived as it is not obvious from the street that it is actually a hotel Other than that no negative points from us , We had a lovely newly renovated room all brand new and spotless Bed was very comfortable and shower was great We also had a good view of the Eiffel Tower which was just perfect especially when lit up at night Staff were among the most helpful and friendliest people you could wish for I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel again in future Thank you Le Parisis for an excellent stay
