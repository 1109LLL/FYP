111936,Hilton London Metropole, Having stayed here multiple times I was a little bit disappointed with the breakfast Both mornings the breakfast was cold , Always stay at this hotel due to the location and easy parking We stayed in a family room for 5 and would recommend Nice size and big enough for everyone Staff were lovely
111937,Hilton London Metropole, We were in the West Tower and the distance between our room and the pool fitness area required two separate elevator trips and at least a 5 minute walk in between plus we had to walk through a conference registration area definitely NO walking around the hotel in your swimsuit Kids younger than 16 years have to be accompanied by someone over 18 year old High chlorine content in the pool No hot tub Pool only open 11am 9pm so no early morning swims and the evenings are packed with families The bed closest to the door had such an obvious divot in the bed could see it when you first walked into the room as to where everyone must sit sleep when they stayed in that room Hide a bed couch was comfortable enough No fan in the bathroom Would have been nice to have a small refrigerator in the room, The buffet breakfast was amazing Highly recommended but go early Close to both Edgware Road tube station and a pick up drop off bus stop for several London bus tour companies i e Golden Tours 10 15 minute walk to Marble Arc and Oxford Street for shopping They did offer luggage storage until your room was ready don t expect to get in early Spacious room Housekeeping was very prompt 
111938,Hilton London Metropole, The staff rudeness was the most horrible experience in particular during check out I requested late check out at 1pm instead of 12pm one hour I was almost threaten to be charged 20 pound per hour if I didn t leave now The experience was horrible and rude The floor is not renovated Floor 7 very old style and room is very small to the extended that you will hit your feet finger every time you move Elecricty plug are designed in wrong places No place for bages Toilets took age for flushing refill Mini bar is empty so if you request water they will charge you 5 pound delivery The price for this rook is too much, I guess location
111939,Hilton London Metropole, Room we were allocated triple room very basic had to change twice because of smell in room Shower did not work properly in the third room Breakfast quite expensive and not a very good choice quality , Location Very near tube line and restaurants Bar and snacks can be purchased in the hotel

111941,Hilton London Metropole, No drinking water was provided which is very strange I was in Frankfurt Vienna Paris where all those hotel I been in providing free mini bar usage I am non alcoholic guest where those hotels on those cities have given us free mini bar , All fine and crew are very supportive 
111942,Hilton London Metropole, Their AC was not working and the first 4 days were 87 88 89 90 I called for 8 hours the front desk the first day with them saying they were working on it and it would be fixed within the hour Then I had to go down to the front desk and they moved us to other rooms but the other rooms were still 26 5C and the rooms did not get comfortable until the weather broke , I liked the location
111943,Hilton London Metropole, The Service in the bar every time was a disaster I stood for over 15 minutes at one stage If the bartenders even had made eye contact with me I would not mind waiting as long But they don t even acknowledge you until they are ready to serve you , Very comfy beds
111944,Hilton London Metropole, Shower products don t smell very good The breakfast could have more variety of fresh fruits, Hotel staff is very friendly and helpfull it made a difference The extra bed was in the room as requested Food at the restaurant was very good and prepared timely Pool is good although a bit crowded It s conveniently located near a tube station
111945,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast buffet was expensive and the quality of the food was questionable We had problems with the climate controls in our room The room was small cramped by our standards and the decor dated Very little clothes and closet space , The staff was very welcoming and professional The common areas lobby lounge etc were conveniently placed and reasonably comfortable and spacious The concierge was generally helpful

111947,Hilton London Metropole, The toilet door was broken called the service desk twice no one came to fix the door The AC was leaking water which made the carpet wet with bad smell ,No Positive
111948,Hilton London Metropole, Small room facing a brick wall and the main road Avoid the Tower Block which is old with slow lifts Faulty lock in the door meaning that the key card only worked sporadically Had to replace the key card a number of times Very busy overcrowded lobby , Breakfast was good
111949,Hilton London Metropole, The Ethernet wasn t working so we couldn t listen to anything on our speakers The bed was so creaky every time we sat on it we thought someone was knocking the door One last minor we asked for a late check out when booking the room and I understand it was subject to availability but we were travelling a long long way next day and our request wasn t bought up and we were refused No biggie really except we were soooooo tired , Mohamadou who checked us in was very loverly and friendly and made us feel very welcome We also got a decent upgrade for a reasonable price from Paige Great value for money All the staff we interacted with were great helpful and friendly

111951,Hilton London Metropole, Bedroom was dated and needed refreshed Pillows poor and not comfortable Toilet needs upgrade, Sky bar sights and sports bar Location good as next to local shops and train line 
111952,Hilton London Metropole, Our room was tired and a bit shabby with no mini bar and a fridge that was broken , Breakfast was great staff were friendly and location was perfect for us We were going to a concert at Hyde Park which was walking distance 
111953,Hilton London Metropole, Well first I think the hotel now is over crowed that staff especially the reception lady is just vey cold Although in my book I have requested for early check in she have insisted that she cannot guarantee a room until 3pm What she missed was that I have travel more than 18 hrs on a plane before that I took my time to get into the hotel since my flight was very early arrive at Heathrow at 630am I was finally check in at 12am although I was told some guests was already check out at 10am I was finally check in by another person at 12am I think she should be train to identify that guest were tired to comfort us that she will do her best to help us get an early check in instead of quoting the standardized position to say she can only assure a room at 3pm One other thing is a got a soft know at 8am in the morning by the cleaning team asking what time am I going to check out so that they can do the room cleaning I feel your overall hospitality standard has gone down , I used to stay at this hotel frequently about 10 years ago I generally like the location of this hotel and I have lots of good memory there In this last visit I find the guy that look after luggage temporary very friendly that soot away the stressful face of the reception that handle me So was the lady that pick up plate during breakfast find time to chat with us and ask if there is anything that she can do to make our stay a lot better 
111954,Hilton London Metropole, The air conditioning was broken and room temp was ridiculously hot First fan brought to the room was broken then second one worked a bit Repairman sent to fix air con he cleaned out the filter but not much else very poor air coming through very hot and uncomfortable night Room decor was tired and worn loo seat was broken It was all a bit of a shock as we stayed there for a few days in October and the room was beautiful and comfy this was like another hotel if we go again I would insist on a room in a different part of the hotel Staff are always friendly and try their best though , The location is great for Paddington Beds were clean 
111955,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel is very old and expensive and everything wasn t working one of the lights fridge the door was stuck and can be closed and we have to wait for an hour for the maintenance to come to fix it although we called them 3 times and told them the problem that we can t leave the room and finally very expensive parking cost, The location
111956,Hilton London Metropole, Fire alarm testing on a Sunday without any prior intimation Could lead to panic attacks or worse for people of that disposition, Everything Efficient businesslike
111957,Hilton London Metropole, Power went out in my room only in the morning I asked the room next to mine and they were fine I was in a rush to leave so I did not report this , The location and restaurants
111958,Hilton London Metropole, nothing really, The hotel lobby areas was lovely and well lit and airy and very nice the male receptionists who checked us in was very nice and jovial and spoke to us Same applied to the concierge desk personnel the room was ready early which was a bonus but if not they had offered to take our luggage and keep till later Having grown up and lived and worked in our family hotel I know it is hard to please us hoteliers as we seem to expect more or we see the faults quicker but this hotel was just great in every aspect so well done The room was fine and adequate for 4 people bathroom a bit samall but very clean and again enough Breakfast very efficient for such huge numbers staff were polite and let everyone in to a table without delay 
111959,Hilton London Metropole, I left a transparent small plastic bag on the table in my room containing small paper items such as my parking ticket in Dublin Airport receipts dockets etc which were removed by housekeeping and presumably dumped They should not have been touched and their removal caused me huge problems when trying to retrieve my car from the long term car park in Dublin Airport Also other items of record which I needed to retain have been destroyed I made a complaint to reception on my departure which was met with a shoulder shrug from the girl who couldn t wait to see the back of me Hilton s customer service at reception was woeful and utterly uncaring I was even charged 12 for wifi in my room which they should have waived as a first gesture to acknowledge their cock up Overall very disappointing ,No Positive
111960,Hilton London Metropole, Deluxe room was tiny Room vague smell of sewerage Sports bar didn t know anything about sport Won t stay there again, Location is the main thing it has going for it
111961,Hilton London Metropole, Very Rude staff Really dirty rooms broken air conditioning Failing door key system Overcharging on 4 different occasions in 7 days Eg 4 breakfast charged for 5 wrong change Etc etc Charge for mini bar not used Complete ripoff, Location
111962,Hilton London Metropole, The aircondition was leaking and thereby dripping on the spotligt below which was rusty there is an increased possibility of ignition and fire with such an failure whichwe told them They did react profesional and said they would check it imidiately But it should not be noticed randomly by two fire safety engineering PhD students they shoud have noticed it themself The beds were hopeless and the room was furnished as it in the 90 s, The location was great 
111963,Hilton London Metropole, Room bathroom a little tired Bathroom had no extractor fan shower too hot or too cold Wet soggy stain on floor As I prepaid my bill the receipt was posted under the door at 4am ish which woke us thinking someone was at the door Breakfast a bit disappointing Continental selection ok but started to clear away at 10 30 when breakfast is meant to be served till 11am hot breakfast option limited , The Room was spacious with a decent view Extra large bed comfy Air con in working order Quick checkout facility able to skip the queue Close proximity to Paddington Station Edgware Station and Marleybone station 
111964,Hilton London Metropole, The worst hotel I have ever stayed at They have serious racial discrimination problem to Asian tourists Room air conditioner was out of order concierges asked me to open the window and cheat me no more available room so disagree to change Can you imagine that They charged me a lot per night and I had already pre paid via booking com After more than one hour wrangle the manager aggreed to change another room with air conditioner finally I will never be back again and I have the duty to condemn their disrespect to guests , Breakfast is ok 
111965,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast and restuarant expensive although same as other hotels in its class in London Plenty of other options a short walk away though , Fabulous views from the tower rooms all of London at your feet Clean and spacious public areas and quiet room 
111966,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, The staff were really friendly couldn t fault them at all The hotel was BIG with so many guests resulting in a bit of tension queuing for breakfast but overall a very nice stay worth 700 for two nights b b Probably not location is good for London My two teenage girls felt very intimidated walking past the endless staring men sitting outside the cafes on the approach to Marble Arch but once past them all was good 
111967,Hilton London Metropole, Although I don t think the room was worth what I paid It was a very basic cheap looking room and definitely wasn t worth 200 a night , The room was clean and comfortable and the service from the receptionists was good 
111968,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, The location was good for tourist primarily using public transport There are quite a number of good quality restaurants at reasonable prices in the vicinities A
111969,Hilton London Metropole, Had to change rooms at 01 00 whilst travelling with two children Was advised would be contacted by guest relations manager first thing in morning however at 7pm the next I had to visit guest relations as no contact had been made Ruined the whole trip for my two nieces , The hotel facilities services and location were excellent and the staff were very friendly 
111970,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel is vast with the size in order to feel like you are having a 4 experience the service and staff need to bridge the gap for customers to feel looked after having paid a premium This was not the case there was a conveyor belt mentality with staff at check in and hotels Knocking at the door even though Do not disturb signs were up both mornings not good with kids I had to request my mail copy of the bill over a week after check out, The swimming pool and size of room for 1 adult and 2 children was good
111971,Hilton London Metropole, We went to the Top floor bar and both my wife and daughter ordered a non alcoholic Mojito When the bill came we were charged GBP10 for each drink the barman said it was his managements instructions to charge the same price as if it had alcohol I subsequently complained to the Hotel manager who explained that it is a sub contracted bar and not part of the Hilton group He recognised that it reflected badly on the hotel and soured visitors stay at an otherwise faultless hotel hope they get rid of the bar operators,No Positive
111972,Hilton London Metropole, My shower was not working in the toilet I complained In the reception they sent someone to repair it after 2 hrs next day the sink was was leaking I think they really need to repair their toilets room was fine,No Positive
111973,Hilton London Metropole, You need to upgrade corridors really stuffy feeling you can make it refreshingly pleasant Second time we checked in 12 th floor room was badly smelling of wood polish wood smell my wife almost got sick, Your staff and service are very good reception housekeeping and resturant staff
111974,Hilton London Metropole, The swimming pool area looks a little tired and I had to use the family toilet to change my handicapped son which was a little awkward as they have no lockers So I then had to carry all our clothes with son in tow through to the lockers in the changing rooms Someone hasn t though this through , Service was fantastic The concierge met us from our taxi and got my son a bottle of water straight away as he noticed he was looking a little hot All staff were polite and there was no queue for breakfast even though they were serving lots of people 
111975,Hilton London Metropole, The staff at reception could be a bit nicer I had a problem with my booking as the girl at reception was not very helpful The receptionist charged me The Hilton rate and not the rate that I had booked on Booking com I was charged straight away on my card despite requesting to pay with a different card and then told that i would have to wait for my refund even though this was her mistake This was eventually sorted by the manager but 5 days later I still have not received my refund It wasn t a great start to our break away We booked a Superior queen room which was basic at best I would not like to have seen the standard room The bedroom smelt of cigarettes upon arrival and had not been cleaned to he standard you d expect from a Hilton hotel the beds were very hard and the shower curtain was ripped and tatty not professional looking Also we stayed on the 8th floor and there was access to open the bedroom window even a small bit so we had to have the air con on all the time ,No Positive
111976,Hilton London Metropole, breakfast was terrible no queue system everyone just stuck at same section Coffee served was cold Would stay at hotel again but would have breakfast out, Room was lovely and comfortable 
111977,Hilton London Metropole, Took 2 room changes to get what we asked for Air con was rubbish Asked for an early book in and didn t get to our room until 4 40pm Possibly the worst Hilton we have ever stayed in that includes Bath which was truly dreadful Still trying to work out what the Metropoles idea of executive room is ,No Positive
111978,Hilton London Metropole, Unhelpful staff Lack of information Smell in room Member of staff in room on arrival Dirty outdated bathroom Would not class as delux Rubbish view Noisy neighbours , Breakfast although it should be included in the price Nice big bed 
111979,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast food was good but it was very crowded and the tables were too close to the buffet so people were bumping into each other Not safe if carrying hot food liquids etc, Location room clean
111980,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, This is the first hotel where some of the toiletries was not there Like even a 3star hotel keeps showercap and small sewing equipment This hotel was missing The room was booked for people however toiletries shampoo shower gel conditioner was kept for 1 CM even after informing the staff continually only from 4 day the toiletries were kept for 2 people 
111981,Hilton London Metropole, However the rooms were sub par Very small and cramped and the pillows were too soft almost unusable Also the air conditioning seemed to be malfunctioning and the room was very hot for the entire visit despite being on maximum cooling , The lobby area pool and gym were very nice and well represented The breakfast was tasty and had a good variety The hotel staff were very helpful and accommodating overall The sky restaurant was very nice and the food was delicious Great view 
111982,Hilton London Metropole, The beds were very uncomfortable and the gym and pool were very small , Heated mirrors in the bathroom spectacular views free baggage holding area friendly staff and delicious food were everything we loved 
111983,Hilton London Metropole, My advice is to book a hotel that costs half the price as you will get the same standard This hotel is definitely NOT worth the room rates they charge Where can I start We stayed in the East wing cannot rate the other wing 1 East Wing lifts dont really work especially in the morning waited 10 minutes then got stuck then the doors wouldn t open when we reached the floor when we finally managed to exit the lift there was no stairs alternative only the fire escape which lead into the backroom of the hotel bar when reporting the problems with the lifts we were told they work fine and only busy due to many people going to breakfast 2 No water pressure in the shower 3 Both shower and sink taps gave either boiling hot water or cold no in between 4 The room was freezing when you entered from the hallway it was like stepping outside in winter I reported this and tried to turn it off or set to warm instead but to no avail When requesting a blanket as none were in the room I was told they would not provide us with one They offered a couple of extra sheets after I kept insisting it was too cold to sleep but never showed up not until i rang the third time after one hour threatening to go down to the reception and create a scene 5 Both the room and the bathroom were extremely outdated and shabby , The beds were very comfortable 
111984,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms Food Service Everything is just terrible I wanted to cancel from the first instance I checked in but the booking Com did not help nor the property management, Nothing It was terrible Booking Com has fooled me with the rating This is a 3 star or less hotel Very dirty smells awful Everything is over 20 years old Very noisy
111985,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, It was busy so we were allowed to check in 20 mins earlier but could not get key to room till 3 0 clock Left luggage there went for coffee then when we returned about 20 past 3 the queue was massive so we still had to wait another 20 mins so much for early check in couple we were with couldn t get into there room till 5 30 due to room not ready even tho check in was 3 o clock it was bit of a pain as we were due to go out and meet up at 6 o clock
111986,Hilton London Metropole, The room decor is very dated The room has no view , Very convenient location its a short walk from paddington train station otherwise just take the cab from paddington train station after taking heathrow express from the airport Near the hotel are 2 metro subway station edgware station so its very easy to get around london across the road and a few minutes away is the bus stop and we took the bus to oxford street to shop There are plenty of eating places near the hotel and tesco is very near The breakfast is good The car rental is at the hotel so that is super convenient 
111987,Hilton London Metropole, The other people staying in the hotel were very rude pushing in lifts and past you Dirty looks from the men and woman staying there Hardly any English in the hotel Left a day early even thought had payed in advance Would never visit that hotel again Men arguing with bell boys shouting at them Not a nice experience at all , When first checking in we were given room 2023 it was from the 1980s Awful room for the price immediately went down to reception and they charnge it to a refurbished room on the 15th floor Very tiny rooms 
111988,Hilton London Metropole, There bed it was awful I didn t sleep at all and it was so stuffy in the room wasn t allowed 2 open the windows and to much noise from above I hated my stay there also when I got there my room wasn t ready so they gave me another wasn t what I booked won t be going back there again , Nothing 
111989,Hilton London Metropole, The room we were in 508 was a little dated in the bathroom department The toilet flush would not work well and once used it took a good 20 minutes to fill enough to flush again The worst thing about this hotel is that there are no stairs The lifts take forever and frequently arrived already full there are 23 floors We gave up and tried to walk down but the only stairs are fire escape ones which are obviously not supposed to be used as when you get to the bottom there is a no entry sign on the door , The bed was very big and comfortable Breakfast is excellent with an amazing choice and lots of staff to assist 
111990,Hilton London Metropole, Not enough tea and coffee etc in the room considering there were 3 of us we were only given 2 of everything But staff quick to deliver more to our door upon request ,No Positive
111991,Hilton London Metropole, The room service was not up to the standard When we reached late in the evening we were told that the room that we had reserved was not available and after a long wait it was arranged for us ,No Positive
111992,Hilton London Metropole, The worst experience I had was with service of the concierge where they asked to carry my luggege on my departure because they said they do not have many people to help the guests of the hotel Besides some were mean with other guests together with some arrogant and mean receptionists they need close monitoring and follow up , The location and the facilities which provided some comfort and relaxation
111993,Hilton London Metropole, Staff un engaging at checkin Could do with out a personal trainer conducting a class in the small gym The tower wing hallways need urgent refurbishing , Location and Iron in room
111994,Hilton London Metropole, Stiff beds , The location Friendly staff Big and clean rooms compared to other rooms in London Good facilities in the hotel and the room Very close to paddington station and oxford street

111996,Hilton London Metropole, The bar prices were a little bit expensive , Breakfast was excellent and the views over London from the bar on the 23rd floor were spectacular The swimming pool sauna and steam room were a real bonus 
111997,Hilton London Metropole, couldn t get the free wifi to connect might have been me bath panel was a bit tatty and worn shower outdated 17 99 for breakfast was too much cafe just outside for 7 25, good staff apart from the cleaner walking in at 9 30 to clean the room but overall yes not bad
111998,Hilton London Metropole, Waited 20 mins to put our bags into storage long queue I asked 2 staff on 3 separate occasions to get some extra resources put to the task they spent ages walking around discussing who to ask to help In the end the chap that should have been on the business desk that I had asked in the first place helped if only he had jumped on board sooner Very frustrating and not my job Also the mini bar in our room was completely broken off and empty Venue is quite a way out of the west end and the tubes were out of synch at the weekend so we had to catch a fifteen pound taxi to get back to Soho , Receptionist was helpful and gave us free wifi at her discretion because our booking was screwed up 
111999,Hilton London Metropole, It wasn t clean It didn t say there is a car par charge Car park very expensive Breakfast staff Buffett were un friendly Rushed us throw the breKfast,No Positive
112000,Hilton London Metropole, I loved everything , Wonderful staff and location The beds were super comfortable We got an easy early check in for free Lots of complimentary service 
112001,Hilton London Metropole, The temperature of the rooms was extremely hot and uncomfortable The rooms were still dirty There was food on the room when we checked in My friends got bitten by bugs They woke up with multiple bites I can t believe Hilton put their name on this hotel It s very subpar for the brand Hilton has built , The staff was very friendly The lobby was aesthetically pleasing but the rooms were not 
112002,Hilton London Metropole, Slight aggregations were The selection on offer in the executive lounge was not that extensive but sufficient The female member at the desk in the executive lounge spent most of the time on the phone talking to her friend for so long talking about things unrelated to her work I had to move in the end to get away from hearing her conversation Very unprofessional I mentioned to her that the air vent above the door in my room was leaking she said she would send someone but that did not materialise probably still on the phone to her friend and couldn t get through to maintenance , Room a decent size but not overly big Pleasant view of the city Bed very comfortable but just didn t get to stay in it that long to enjoy it to the fullest Facilities are good in the hotel 
112003,Hilton London Metropole, Room was very hot There was a heat wave and the room s AC could not cope , Room was very clean Cleaning staff attentive Convenient location near subway station

112008,Hilton London Metropole, I did not like their concept of taking a deposit of 30 pounds per day as security deposit I was shocked to know that at the time of check in I was not prepared for this kind of an additional cash outflow refundable though Nevertheless I paid by cash Although I could have used my credit card I did not choose to pay through credit card and wait endlessly for the refund My previous experience at another chain of hotels I did not get the caution deposit refunded Next day i got the shock when i found the hotel had debited my credit card for another UK Pounds 30 as security deposit despite their holding my cash deposit I got it refunded in cash after I had to do some hard talk as it was purely their carelessness After this glitch on Day 2 I insisted they remove the credit card number from their system and thus saved myself of further debits and hard talk , The restaurant staff were polite and courteous The concierge was helpful Housekeeping team were meticulous Check in and check out were neat but for the episode on debiting my card with security deposit despite holding a cash deposit from my side 
112009,Hilton London Metropole, Downgraded a room to what we paid for as only room available at the rate we paid was a smoking room As a non smoker this was not ever to be acceptable , Comfy bed Fantastic location 
112010,Hilton London Metropole, The 23rd floor seemed completely isolated with the rest of the hotel Felt like I was staying in a youth hostel during my student days , The gym and swimming pool 
112011,Hilton London Metropole, dinner menu was limited, Check in was friendly Concierge very helpful Breakfast superb tho coupons only valid that day Room was superb Pool dry and steam sauna very good Staff wonderful The VIEW from the room was splendid 
112012,Hilton London Metropole, Hotel only seems to air condition the lobby and business conference rooms Hallways always hot Room had air conditioning but hardly did the job Was frequent topic of conversation in the elevators with other visitors Room was clean but tired looking Bathroom was clean but tired looking as well Bed not very comfortable Could feel the springs Hotel definitely needs to invest in some form of pillow or foam mattress top Concierge was friendly and tried to help with tourist questions but you can tell that their expertise lies more in the business area not leisure area , Breakfast that was included with reservation was excellent with wide selection Convenient location walking distance to Paddington train station 5 blocks and Edgware Rd Underground station was only 1 block away Room was clean All restaurant and bar servers were extremely nice and accommodating 
112013,Hilton London Metropole, We were promised the day s newspaper delivered at athe door however that did not happen I informed the concierge every morning about this It was promised that the next morning the newspaper should be there That did not happen ,No Positive
112014,Hilton London Metropole, Twin room was not very spacious however we did have the option on check in of a larger room with no view or the smaller one with the view and we chose the later so no complaints really, Had access to the executive lounge which was really good and relaxing after a day of walking Food served in there was excellent especially loved the afternoon tea 
112015,Hilton London Metropole, Run down facilities basic utilities not in working condition Air condition was not functioning shower water lacks pressure staff not trained and can t offer any solution overall a terrible experience, Nothing except location
112016,Hilton London Metropole, On our arrival the reception staff could not find our booking through Booking com waited 20 minutes and then sent away and asked to go back a little while later while they sorted it out I had to re send them a copy of my e mail booking confirmation not impressed On our last day you are allowed until 12 o clock to check out so we went for breakfast and on return to the room the cleaner was there had moved everything of ours re made the bed changed the towels etc etc we tried to explain but she could not speak English so we had to phone down to reception and get them to speak to her not impressed , Nice big bed and lovely view Stayed here many times before

112019,Hilton London Metropole, Ordered room service never arrived Glazed doors in bathroom mean you are watching yourself on the toilet as you use it not really what I wanted to see Very expensive drinks 4 20 for a diet coke which would be less than 1 in M S next door , Good location for access to the tube line we wanted But that was why we booked that hotel

112027,Hilton London Metropole, Room was disappointing as we had booked a superior family Room It was smaller than the standard family room which we had stayed in before but thought the up grade to superior would give us a lovely large room but no is was not at all like the picture on the website showing a lovely large room with 2 doubles beds and steps down to a large seating area to accommodate a sofa bed too our sofa bed was made up and you couldn t open the fridge or sit at the dressing table Waited for 15mins to try and get served in the bar one evening so disappointed with the service Last time we stayed there in March staff were really good and the room much bigger Waiting time in the restaurant for breakfast was too long the facilities not big enough to accommodate the amount of guests staying ,No Positive

112041,Hilton London Metropole, As everywhere in London you pay a lot but you do not really get the value for the money Hilton is no exception furniture and rooms where older and you could see that they have been used for a while As said above the women on the reception who checked us in was not very nice all others I have talked to were exceptionally nice looks like we had bad luck with her , Location is very good Most of the staff was very friendly unfortunately tunately the women who checked us in was not Terefore the start into our vacation was not too good I do not know whether she was annoyed by us or not in the mood of working anyways somebody like that should not have contact with guests

112043,Hilton London Metropole, I had to wait a bit to have my check in done because their system was off so my very first experience right at the entrance was bothersome The rooms were old and had carpets to which I am allergic The mini bar didn t open and even though I complained about it on the first day it wasn t fixed Expected a lot more from the price I paid , Sympathetic staff The only saving grace of this hotel is its great localizatiom 
112044,Hilton London Metropole, The view from the room was looking at another side of a building but as we were only there for 1 night it wasn t an issue for us , We were caught up in the BA IT problem and had to book a room at the last minute The Hotel is conveniently located 10 minutes walk from the Airport Express station at Paddington The staff at reception were very helpful in getting emergency toiletries to our room We had a meal in the restaurant which was OK

112053,Hilton London Metropole, Not a family hotel Hotel is too big for them to manage Things like room service information etc will be delayed and not suitable for people to travel with babies toddlers, Just a central business hotel
112054,Hilton London Metropole, The room was filled with ugly old furniture and ugly style Totally not worth the price I paid Not up to standard compared to many Hilton hotels I have been to before Not worth the price I wasn t happy with my stay at all, Location and breakfast
112055,Hilton London Metropole, Needs more toiletries and a faster checkin system it took too long to check in especially on a hot day , Great location and great views from the hotel bedroom 
112056,Hilton London Metropole, The room carpet had lots of stains fridge not working the decor needs updating was shocked at the standard the room was at, The Reception area bar down stairs shop ground floor really nice
112057,Hilton London Metropole, The renovations in the Tower Wing where we were staying were horrible Just the colors the tiling everything was cheap and not of the standard I am used to from this franchise Following issues with the renovated tower wing where we stayed 1 The key cards are like trying to break into the room You have to master the speed and angle to successfully get in Went down 3 times before the staff had to teach me how to use the key cards 2 The sink drain clogged These are supposedly brand new fitting The bathroom in general was too small no hooks for clothes and the showers had no pressure 3 The curtains were falling apart The curtains would constantly fall down very cheap fixtures installed I believe either the contractor or the principal of the property has cut corners or not allocated enough funds for Hilton standard fittings Also the breakfast is not comprehensive smoked salmon waffles and pancakes all separately billed when they should be free within the buffet , The location was great as always The staff professional and helpful as always They sent me a nice cake for my birthday 
112058,Hilton London Metropole, My room had a leak in I paid over 500 for a room that leaked the got put into another room with a really unpleasant over and not clearing some guest before me had water in a glass and that was it cleaned and the television didn t work I did email the hotel but obviously I have had no response I feel because I m a younger client I was brushed aside and it taken seriously ,No Positive
112059,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, The room was spacious liked that there was a small fridge so I could store some water etc Beautiful looking restaurants but only had the breakfast as we were out visiting

112061,Hilton London Metropole, I asked for semi skimmed milk for the room tea facilities and well I am still waiting for them The swimming pool needs updating and no privacy in the ladies changing rooms , Comfortable room and facilities Easy check in and checking out Taxi available 24 hours a day 
112062,Hilton London Metropole, Except for the common areas the hotel needs a serious remodel They put us in the West Wing and we asked to be moved The hallways had an odor to them The HVAC system made so much noise there was no way we were going to get any sleep in that room It was like a Motel 6 The restaurant was like a buffet in a cheap Vegas casino , There was plenty of food on the breakfast buffet if the noise didn t bother you 
112063,Hilton London Metropole, same breakfast everyday, the house keeping is very good and it is in very good locality near by stations and transport facilities oxford street is hardly 1 mile everything is near by and love staying in this hotel if i go to london again i m sure i will book in this hotel
112064,Hilton London Metropole, I stayed in the hotel for 8 nights The lobby is deceptively attractive once you head up in the lifts it all deteriorates The costs were relatively high for the size and quality of the room The room is old and quite crummy carpets are dirty etc My booking com booking did not come through to the property so I arrived and there was no reservation on hand and no room available at 5pm I couldn t wait long and therefore had to access my bag in the hotel s toilet which was not a comfortable welcome Then the hotel put two holds on my credit card for the full amount I alerted them to this fact but this was not immediately reversed possibly the delay is not their fault but this mistake did mean difficulty with access to money I fell in the bathroom shower due to inadequate old facilities The shower is a bath conversion and had a small no slip mat It is very slippery and no warning There is no anti slip on the floor of the bathroom and it s very easy to fall The bathrooms were dirty let s just say the stuff that should have been in the toilet was on and around the toilet on arrival , The location is good 
112065,Hilton London Metropole, Corridors were quite noisy in the evenings and I could hear someone having a conversation in their room at 5 in the morning couldn t work out if it was room next door or floor above, Was right outside edgware tube station 
112066,Hilton London Metropole, We were offered an upgrade for 20 but when it came to paying it was 40 so we didn t bother They also wanted us to pay 20 hour for late checkout so we didn t bother with that either, Location was good 10 15 minute walk to Hyde Park and Oxford street
112067,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, I could not work out why there are so many negative reports about this hotel We were welcomed by porters who took charge of our luggage reception was excellent our beds were comfortable the water in the shower hot We made a cup of tea In the morning we had a good breakfast included in the tariff The wait staff were pleasant No smells 
112068,Hilton London Metropole, Service was worst as I have ever seen in a Hilton property Public water has gone for 4 5 hours in the hotel Room was OK but the bed was uncomfortable not like a Hilton quality standard We stayed 3 person in a room but housekeeping didn t put 3 pairs of towels slippers and toiletries in the room We had to ask for them , Location
112069,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms were not cleaned properly Dirty mugs and glasses were left as is or washed off with water leaving it dirty Staff did not take responsibility and did not do anything to help Will not stay here again and will not recommend either ,No Positive
112070,Hilton London Metropole, Not happy with having to pay 60 at check in if you were to use anything room services then it could take weeks to get back apparently Why no pay straight back into your account when you check out,No Positive
112071,Hilton London Metropole, Room cooling system didnt seem too good Even with boost on wasn t cool enough for our liking, Great choice of food for breakfast Broken hairdryer replaced quickly Room very spacious
112072,Hilton London Metropole, Water went off first night and electricity to the room went off second day Staff were unhelpful resulting in us having to trawl around the hotel to find someone who could assist Eventually found one member of staff who was able assist us ,No Positive
112073,Hilton London Metropole, Booked the superior family room got put into a smaller room as our room wasnt ready we were not happy with this as we had paid for a larger room Staff then showed us the room that we had originally booked however this room stank of cigarette smoke I have asthma so it was not suitable for us to stay in there the lady that showed us the room said herself that it was not acceptable and that she wouldnt have stayed in that room either We then got put into another room and got told that there were no others available This room had awful views curtains hanging off the wall electric sockets coming off the wall the mini bar wasnt stocked crumbs on the floor from the previous occupants the ironing board was broken and the room was smaller than what we had originally booked and paid for Ruined the trip which was for my mums 60th birthday and her first time to London We will definitely not go back , Lots to choose from for breakfast buffet was being restocked all the time so it was hot and fresh Staff were friendly
112074,Hilton London Metropole, We stayed 3 person in a room but they didn t prepare it for 3 person Only 2 bath towel 2 sets of toiletries no slipper in the room Also on Saturday 4 5 hours the water has gone in the hotel It was unbelievable Nobody can tell me it is a real Hilton It should be a fake property The bed in the room was uncomfortable where their springs are moving and looks like it is a not a standard Hilton bed quality , Location was fine Nearby to the tube station 
112075,Hilton London Metropole, The Hotel services and facilities had deteriorated much compared to our previous stays years back The beds were very uncomfortable and making a lot of noise , The location and WIFI
112076,Hilton London Metropole, Our flight arrived at 5 30 am our check in was at 3 00pm We were not able to check in early However as it turned out our room was not ready available at check in time and they upgraded our room Don t expect to check in early , We had two double beds in a large room The location is very convenient to Paddington Station and the Edgeware underground station The staff is very professional The concierges were wonderful I have stayed here in this Hotel many times and ithe service in consistent
112077,Hilton London Metropole, A wee bit farther away from the main tourist spots so we spent an extra 15 USD a day on transport Uber and Black cab then if we had stayed in the city center proper Due to a packed sightseeing schedule we chose to not use the Underground Tube but there is a station just down the street and you can easily keep those extra pounds in your pocket if you take the time to learn the routes The extra transport costs were totally worth it for my family given the large American size rooms with two ultra comfy queen beds It can be challenging to find a reasonablely priced room that works for families with kids when staying in many European cities but those gorgeous historic buildings are what makes the cities so incredible so pick your poison and enjoy each day Minimal street noise allowed us to sleep like a rock after a long day of absorbing everything that London has to offer , Great property Very clean the staff went out of their way to help us with the smallest of things Several coffee shops and cafes nearby to grab snacks and a quick lunch before headed out for the day 
112078,Hilton London Metropole, Second morning for breakfast we were shoveled into an overflow area used as a temporary restaurant Food was cold Not enough staff and food to meet demand Very poor ,No Positive
112079,Hilton London Metropole, I have been a regular guest for 5 years and this is the worst experience ever I may not consider staying in this hotel again Looks like they give priority and more care to guests who are staying for business purpose i e conference events 1 Furniture was kinda damaged 2 beds make sound and not comfortable Toilet base make sound every time you flash 2 House keeping clean the room only upon guest s request They don t clean good 3 At the time of check out they charged us for using the mini bar although we just took them out to put our stuff in the fridge and we returned all items in the fridge the night before we check out The problem is that it took them 30 mins to send someone to check the mini bar while we are checking out which made us late for the airport 4 Some staff especially at the reception are aggressive 5 Breakfast options were very bad comparing to my previous stays , Location
112080,Hilton London Metropole, Had to wait for ages to get into the parking garage and wasn t told before booking that it was 25 a night Also I think it s disgusting in this day and age that hotels charge for wifi It was 12 a day I would expect the Hilton of all hotels to provide this free of charge I ended up hotspotting my friend the whole trip so he didn t have to pay The room was quite old with a very old mouldy smell in the bathroom and as for the view well we were probably given the worst room in the whole hotel , Staff were really nice and helpful
112081,Hilton London Metropole, room cleanliness wasn t very good bed was uncomfortable toilet roll softness could of been of better quality queuing for breakfast was annoying overpriced for the overall quality of the hotel would not stay there again , staff were helpful food in the restaurant was very nice view from our bedrom was amazing 
112082,Hilton London Metropole, The windows were very dirty The room was near the elevators and the staff door and noisy There was only one chair in the room The room was rather small and a bit shabby the cupboard door could not open all the way Hotel did not supply a detailed receipt for the room , Comfortable bed 
112083,Hilton London Metropole, breakfast disappointing better at Premier Inn and the coffee left a lot to be desired, we were treated with cheerful courtesy and Kindness On arrival there had been some mix up with our booking surname listed wrong but soon all was resolved We were meeting guests there from USA and we were able to join them for breakfast without extra cost to them or us All desk staff were friendly and helpful The price was fine considering it was London The building site was at an angle to the hotel but the sound proofing was good Where in London is there no development Altogether a good experience 
112084,Hilton London Metropole, The fishy smell in the room The tired shabby decor in the room Room temperature difficult to control, The Edge Bar great staff well made cocktails pleasant surrondings Location short walk to Edgeware Rd tube station very easy access to most areas of London
112085,Hilton London Metropole, The type of bed is not comfortable , Nice location in the Edgware Road nearby many restaurants and shops also opposite Edgware Road Tube station Not far from Hydpark and Oxford Street Good choices at the buffet breakfast 
112086,Hilton London Metropole, The view wasn t good and overlooked vents and brick walls We went to the sky bar and were Told that they weren t serving alcohol which was a one main reason we chose this hotel No where did it mention that this would be the case and we weren t informed by the staff either , The breakfast was amazing and the cocktails were lovely and reasonably priced The complimentary bottle of prosecco for my girlfriends birthday was very kind 
112087,Hilton London Metropole, the room unfortunately was way below my expectations considering the price and the star rating Wi Fi very bad, the position of the Hotel is great and the staff very helpful and friendly
112088,Hilton London Metropole, Everything The hotel rips your eyes out We paid 500 for 3 nights then arrived any were charged a further 30 a night deposit FOR WHAT No coffee in the room a broken hairdryer a room which was boiling hot and unable to open the window The pool area was dirty and noisy with children s swimming lessons I will never stay at a Hilton hotel again The bed and pillows were very uncomfortable, Nothing
112089,Hilton London Metropole, Some signs on the light switches would of helped also how to turn up the heating , I loved the beds very comfortable Had problems figuring out the shower but once I got it working the water was nice and hot with good pressure Having a kettle with tea was a god send after a hard day sight seeing 
112090,Hilton London Metropole, The length of time it took to check us in The bad smell in the room which we discovered was coming from the air conditioning as it went away when we turned it off , The view
112091,Hilton London Metropole, Room looked much better in the picture Bed wasn t comfy and creaked Very expensive Sky lounge wasn t serving alcoholic drinks even though it was advertised that they do Executive lounge not a very good option as only serves drinks until 8 and only continental breakfast not full English served in there , Cleanliness and location
112092,Hilton London Metropole, New beds choice of pillows , The hotel staff were very good friendly and polite restaurant food was good although long wait to be seated and waited quite a while before tea and coffee were served on both mornings Very very disappointed in the comfort of the beds one bed was not to bad but the other was awful very hard made noise every time you moved I had to take pain killers the next day as my back was so painful and not everybody likes feather pillows would be good idea to put other types in wardrobe also think rooms need a little freshening up looking tired 
112093,Hilton London Metropole, The rooms are so small we are two people in the room and there is no place to put our luggage in the beds and the pillows are not comfortable at all the price is too high for a room like this I have expected something fancy with paying this price , The lobby atmosphere
112094,Hilton London Metropole, Bad is not soft Reception made all the charges too complected I was charged over and over again and could not get a simple explanation of what is going there, Hilton is quality they try to make that place extremely convenient Close to Tube and to Heath row Express Great Breakfast Concierge offered Taxi ride to airport which was very efficient
112095,Hilton London Metropole, everything staff were unhelpful I had my belongings stolen and they were unhelpful would not go back rooms are so so small and I PAID for an upgrade I asked for a quiet room but got quite the opposite I would NEVER stay here again I will stick to the grane in st pauls , bed was comfortable but that s it 
112096,Hilton London Metropole, Beds uncomfortable and pillows too soft personal choice A opening window to let in fresh air would be great , The staff were very attentive and very helpful 
112097,Hilton London Metropole, Hotel employees made a lot of noice at 02 in the night while trying to force an fast check out envelope into my room through the door crack This kept on for 5 minutes and I couldn t sleep again until two hour later Thought someone was trying to break into the room Then they woke me up again at 08 the day I was checking out which is not OK Mentioned it to the receptionist but he didn t listen he was too busy Low water pressure in the shower and it took forever to get done , Walking distance to Oxford street 
112098,Hilton London Metropole, Customer service was poor Didn t clean our room next day regardless we asked by phone We have to ask for coffee and tea bags next day They told us room with view which wasn t true Charged us with internet for one day on two devices 24 we had to challenge that , Location
112099,Hilton London Metropole, The room was slightly small AC Heating system slightly temperamental too hot Hot water in shower also temperamental No bottled water in room this should be a given It s a very popular hotel so lots of people in the lobby Lacks the exclusivity of a luxury hotel in central London but it s so well priced it s a good option in general , Location is very central and the hotel is very well priced The lobby is spacious and luxurious Breakfast was nice 
112100,Hilton London Metropole, The breakfast was very poor for the money the sausages were like bullets and it was only just warm I don t like the idea of paying a deposit of 30 for the mini bar which I was not going to use as it takes a week to get your money back, The staff were pleasant and helpful
112101,Hilton London Metropole, I didn t like my room so much I was expecting for Hilton hotel to have a second chair in the room and also little bit more comfort and space I think there wasn t enough space in the room , The facilities are very very good You can have everything you want in 1 place I like also the fact that there is plenty of space to common areas to enjoy coffee or whatever you like 
112102,Hilton London Metropole, Was very disappointed with the hotel Was not value for money for any aspect Our room was scruffy and our view was awful We could not open the window even slightly so very stuffy to sleep in The breakfast experience was awful Felt like we were in a works canteen with the food matching this description too Would not stay here again ,No Positive
112103,Hilton London Metropole, Air conditioning didn t work Bathroom fan did not work slipped in the bathroom very dangerous doors bang loudly sound proofing awfull Bathroom needed renovating very small for a family room I think it was the worst room in the hotel ,No Positive
112104,Hilton London Metropole, The beds are comfortable but could do with better quilts or blankets as I found them very light which didn t help my sleep Very expensive items in the fridge so I avoided eating or drinking from it The tea and coffee making area is a bit awkward and not very spacious to prepare hot drinks , Overall excellent experience Very friendly staff in the lounge but I feel the prices are a bit expensive for the food Nice bathroom family room very accommodating 
112105,Hilton London Metropole, Long queue for breakfast although the problem was well managed by the staff they did their best to seat us as soon as possible , The breakfast was amazing lots of choice 
112106,Hilton London Metropole, The rooms were tiny There was little lighting in the room and it appeared that there were too separate sides of the hotel one for commoners and one for the people who were paying more I m not sure how much more because I was spending 350 Definitely not worth its money , One of the only good things was that the beds were comfy 
112107,Hilton London Metropole, The additional 30 deposit requested at the start of the stay The hotel already had a pending payment via credit card and so I think it s unnecessary to request an additional payment , Clean and spacious rooms 
112108,Hilton London Metropole, everything, This was a floating cruise ship hotel mass market long line to wait for breakfast and loner line to wait to get elevator absoluteley horrific experience
112109,Hilton London Metropole, Not enough tea milk and sugar in the room but room service quick to supply more when we requested it , The bed was huge and so comfortable Room airy and immaculately clean Beautiful en suite with amazing shower Stayed a number of times and never disappointed So quiet at night too Looking forward to staying there again as soon as we can 
112110,Hilton London Metropole, Pool ideal for quick dip but the rubber flooring was a bit smelly musty damp smell Also check out bill had 4 mini bar charge but we hadn t had anything we didn t reprt this due to it being a small amount and the queue at reception still annoying , Good facilities for a London Weekend with Family Edgeware Rd Tube Station across the road Starbucks in the hotel very handy in the morning if you did not want a full breakfast right away 
112111,Hilton London Metropole, Older rooms are dinghy Some staff were rude , Close to public transport nodes New rooms are nice Good views Good Breakfast Most staff were pleasant 
112112,Hilton London Metropole, Very poor room service the phone did not work No toiletries were included such as toothpaste toothbrush bathroom slippers The refrigerator was not switched on even after speaking to the staff Not enough milk provided , The location

112126,Hilton London Metropole, Gym and swimming pool closed when I arrived at 9pm although website for the hotel had stated open until 10pm Room in need of an update peeling cracked paintwork and old carpets Felt rushed at breakfast with staff removing crockery before I had finished and disturbed by hotel cleaning staff 3 times before 9 30 am despite being due to check out on that day Payed more than I normally would for a London hotel to have use of gym and pool however have found higher standard accommodation for a more reasonable price in London although without a pool , Swimming pool Had an early morning swim and had the pool to myself

112128,Hilton London Metropole, When we tried to check in there wasnt a room available yet We asked the staff if we could drop off our luggage and we got referred to the luggage room at the other side of the hotel After we found the luggage room there was a sign referring us back to the counter just across reception so we had to walk back to the other end of the hotel again where we started off in the first place The communication could have been better , Nice bed and decent size room Even tough you are in the centre you can t hear the traffic noise very well
112129,Hilton London Metropole, I had to change my reservation so I called the hotel but they said I had to call Booking So I called Booking and the staff was very helpful however they could only make changes if the hotel allowed and it was very hard to contact them it took more than a week to have an answer back from Hilton at least in the end the hotel authorized the change , Staff was very kind they helped us on everything we needed special thanks to Ariana and Rafael and everyone greets you in the hall Breakfast was great but always crowded Rooms are big and beds are very comfortable It is very close to Edgware station so you can take Bakerloo Circle and Hammersmith City and District lines and there are many restaurants and small markets nearby I definitely recommend 
112130,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms were a bit tired Bedding acceptable but not executive level expected , Staff were helpful and polite Swimming pool and fitness was good Executive lounge breakfast was excellent
112131,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, Raphael checked us in and seeing on her booking that it was for a special occasion immediately gave us an upgraded room from a twin to a 2 x queen size room on the 5th floor He was absolutely fantastic What lovely manners polite and funny and very welcoming 
112132,Hilton London Metropole, I requested to pay on arrival but money had cleared from my bank account a day before arriving The room we were first given was very dingy and standard felt as if we could have got a lot better room with Travelodge or premier inn , they changed our room when we requested and the staff were very helpful
112133,Hilton London Metropole, Given the wrong key card for room on arrival which could have led to an embarrassing situation and more importantly a security issue as we were allowed to enter a room that was already occupied response from management was basically oh well that happens got new staff No form of compensation goodwill gesture as we lost couple of hours waiting for new room Buffet breakfast dreadful cramped cold food and kids picking up food then putting it back not acceptable , Spacious clean hotel with good facilities

112138,Hilton London Metropole, Room smelled like a smoking room disgusting and for a Hilton Hotel not appropriate A hotel that charges you 300 Pounds a night should provide a free internet access We are living in the digital age guys you should rethink your business model The trend will be clearly to have free wifi and Hilton will charge the guests till the last moment they can until the competition provides free wifi Lead the market don t follow ,No Positive
112139,Hilton London Metropole, Must walk through lockers and pool for the gym breakfast buffet is a cattle call sooo crowded staff gets behind Food is not a value better to eat at a local pub , Near to Paddington and close to Soho Covent Garden and Hyde Park Small room but very clean Comfortable bed and pillows

112142,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms was too hot even when AC on Didn t like only a hot Duvet on the bed and not a sheet also The breakfast buffet was okay but nothing my girls liked such as pancakes not always available or waffles Very crowded restaurant Ended up eat breakfast out a few times , Easy access to Tube station

112144,Hilton London Metropole, The minibar was not refillied and the room was smaller than we thought even when advertised on the website We had to pick up the water bottle at the front desk You had to pay for the omelet at the breakfast even when the breakfast was fully prepayed The sports bar for gold members was closed before 10 00 o clock in the morning At the front desk we were told that the sport club closed at 10 30 am , Wifi workes very good The breakfast was very good and we stayed in the Sport bar during the breakfast Executives lounge was perfect and very well visited by the members 
112145,Hilton London Metropole, The staff is absolutely not helpful So if you are looking on for decent accommodation reasonably priced and great location this is an awesome property However when it comes to staff guiding you on what to do where to go or even in room service for basics like multiplug adapters or porters for bags at time of check out etc horrible , Very convenient location right next to the Edgware road tube station The north wing rooms for families were great The east wing refurbished rooms are tiny but good 
112146,Hilton London Metropole, Since we only check in on the 5 March for a week s stay we left our luggage on 4 March to visit Scotland a token charge for left luggage should be appreciated instead of the standard 24 pounds charge , The breakfast was splendid but not much choice for Muslims travelers Happy if there were more halal food like bacon though halal chicken sausage was available 
112147,Hilton London Metropole, Had a newly refurbished room but had to get 3 sets of keys for the door swipe and a concierge finally had to come and let me into the room Bad staining on carpet and very damp smell to the room Very noisy Poor for the price paid ,No Positive
112148,Hilton London Metropole, A little bit too expensive but finally it was all worth it Is so close to every station and you can see all London I will definitely come back , The bed and the view were amazing I am totally satisfied
112149,Hilton London Metropole, 30pp deposit on arrival must be paid and if securing by card it can take up to 5 days for refund No free wi fi in bedrooms Was shocked to be charged 25 for two glasses of red wine in the ground floor bar absolute rip off , Great location ten mins walk to Oxford Street tube station close by with easy access to the City Check in was quick we were given an upgrade and our room was available on early check in Staff were friendly and helpful Hotel was clean and rooms comfortable 
112150,Hilton London Metropole, The room had a shower and no bath availble room was decorated to an express hotel standard rsther than a luxury hotel standard, clean newly refurbished rooms Smoking rooms option availble attentive and helpful staff

112152,Hilton London Metropole, Most staff were helpful but not all I did not like the fact that you were expected to pay a surcharge for every drink you purchased although i did get this deducted not everyone realised they could I don t see why there is an expected charge to pour us a drink, The rooms were clean and comfy and breakfast was excellent something for everyone
112153,Hilton London Metropole, Maintenance of the room was slightly less than you would expect for a Hilton for example damaged light fitting resulting in a hole in the ceiling Nothing very serious though , Perfect location for seeing the sights in London Good deal for a family room in that location Room service menu prices were surprisingly reasonable 
112154,Hilton London Metropole, Mini bar was used first night but items never replaced Check out lady was unfriendly when i told her my bill not left under my door No sign of i am sorry or any such sentiment Rude, Location view from sky bar on 23rd
112155,Hilton London Metropole, I would have liked a room on a lower floor , The service and guest relations as usual were terrific The staff are always friendly and polite at this hotel and the guests are diverse and there is a good atmosphere I particulalrly enjoy the fitness club which is part of the reason I stay here 
112156,Hilton London Metropole, The room is like a cage I was in room 1904 Why do Hilton treat guests that way Why don t you make the rooms more bigger Its only one room and the guests are travelers they need to feel comportable when spending a bussy day out , The rooms are too small I was in the room 1904 Rooms should at least be 3 5 to 4 meters wide I think Hilton should make a redesign of the rooms plan 
112157,Hilton London Metropole, The whole hotel is really old I think they need a renovation really soon I wouldn t go back to this hotel, The hall is big and is a good place to work or have a fast meeting for business purposes The pool area is old but still good to have it
112158,Hilton London Metropole, Somewhat pricey but would still choose this hotel over others due to good staff and overall standard of accommodation If restaurant and bar prices were reduced slightly then it might encourage guests to buy within the hotel , Staff very attentive and helpful Hotel very clean throughout 
112159,Hilton London Metropole, The room was quite small and right opposite our bedroom door there were staff lifts which were making noise all through the night , The bed was huge and very comfortable We loved the hotel bars and restaurants Our en suite bathroom was lovely and the heated mirror was a bonus for applying makeup 
112160,Hilton London Metropole, Went and eat in the sports bar Couldn t even eat the food as the fish was gone off and the chicken was so over cooked plus you put Parmesan cheese on the cheesy chips which smelt,No Positive
112161,Hilton London Metropole, The rooms They were definitely not up to Hilton standard the rooms were dated and the bathroom was grubby and not maintained to a high standard We had no hot water in the room on our final day , The hotel facilities were lovely the bars were very clean and to a high standard The staff in the Sky Bar were such an asset to your team 
112162,Hilton London Metropole, 1 Rooms were not spacious 2 Lack of basic amenities you have to ask every time for availability Dental Hair Room Tissues Soap Sleepers Snacks water shoe polisher etc 3 Any order through room service will cost you additional 5 Pounds per visit 4 Wifi kept on connecting disconnecting 5 Travel tour guide arrangements to be improved, 1 Location of Hotel is great 2 Business Center working is good 3 Cleanliness remained good
112163,Hilton London Metropole, Hotel was fully booked and there was not possible to eat breakfast in the morning without queuing for 30 minutes There was no lock on the bathroom door big trauma for our teenaged kids Only towels for two people we were four It took two tours to the reception to get additional towels , Nice beads and very comfy pillows Good location walking distance to Paddington station 
112164,Hilton London Metropole, Beds were not very comfortable The air conditioner in the room did not function properly and it was freezing during the night The breakfast place on the 3rd floor was too formal not very inviting It could do with a few homely touches It looked like a function room , Very nice and helpful staff 
112165,Hilton London Metropole, The beds the mattress was like wood not much comfort on them at all , The staff were amazing especially the manager I had an issue with the booking and he was brilliant He gave us Breakfast for free the whole stay Swimming pool was fab and in general the place is lovely 
112166,Hilton London Metropole, We stayed in a wing in a dire need of renovation The carpets were old and there was an unpleasant smell in the corridors Noisy elevators The room looked as it has not been redecorated for 30 years old refrigerator with some old flaking labels nothing inside apart from a box of juice left probably by previous occupants Wooden tub casing coming off and cheap Wifi coverage was ok but VPN connection was blocked so good for watching YouTube but no use for remote work and serious business I can understand there may be rooms of different standard in a hotel but then the charges should also be adequately discounted I am especially disappointed as I am a member of Hilton Honours programme , Good location tube pub stores within walking distance 
112167,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast is best enjoyed early The food is good and freshly cooked the staff work very hard and keep the standard high But the restaurant used is tight for the number of breakfasters After 7 30 queues can build up both for entry and at the buffets which can make you feel a bit crushed and rushed , I visited for a conference and trade show with towards 700 attendees Facilities were excellent both for lectures and for the exhibition As a hotel it was more expensive than my usual budget but it is easy to see why the price is justified and I feel I got good value for money Staff were always smiling never intrusive but available for the slightest thing the secret of success The food was the high point for me There are several contrasting options I tried Edg and Fiamma Relaxed but efficient service at table good menu choices Food was perfectly cooked and well presented special thanks to Guiseppe and crew The after dinner cocktails are intriguing and well worth sampling 
112168,Hilton London Metropole, For a hotel of this Standard I was shocked at the quality of tissue paper provided Some of the Reception staff seemed a little confused about doing their job , Comfortable bed smoking option available High rise great city view Room service was excellent Attentive staff overall this hotel is a great location environment and atmosphere 
112169,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, Very nice breakfast with a variety from day to day The rooms were like other Hilton hotels very good as always We will definately consider this hotel for our next trip to London 
112170,Hilton London Metropole, Food bedroom condition , Hotel bars are good restaurant food is average and bedrooms are dull and need upgraded London is a very competitive city and your bedrooms are long overdue a revamp 
112171,Hilton London Metropole, Nothing in the rooms as far as shoe shine etc room was too hot air con did nothing and window didn t open Huge queue every morning to get into breakfast , Breakfast was good
112172,Hilton London Metropole, Original room was awful very old and tatty After complaining they moved us to a new room on a different floor Poor value for money, Comfy beds That is about it 
112173,Hilton London Metropole, Would prefer to have a fridge that you can store your own items instead of the electronic devise that charges you every time you move a drinks item , Easy to park Quick to check in Great location for central London but just outside the congestion zone Edgware Tube over the road regular buses to Harrods an Oxford Street shopping Nice bar area Good quick breakfast stop with Starbucks coffee 
112174,Hilton London Metropole, Parking charges 35 per night yet in westminster 24 parking was 20 Breakfast was disorganised with staff cherrypicking the que to sit at tables the feel of this place has dropped from my previous visits breakfast supervisor did not lead by example and watched me help myself to 2 jugs of coffee for my table and the table next to us then told the waitress off very bad This hotel has turned into a money making hotel with no care for the customer years gone by the customer would have had understanding customer service now unless you are seen to have money by your race or creed you are dealt with accordingly Floor staff seem scared of there employers and speaking to a couple confirm that they are Is this a hotel i would support in future Looks like moden slavery in the employment world , Bed was comfortabe and my waitress was great she was first class breakfast was good 
112175,Hilton London Metropole, Paid wifi is ridiculous 30 quid deposit was per night and is not a common practice in hotels despite their printout at reception Paid cash got it back promptly Otherwise would have been waitng 7 days , Clean Comfortable Surprisingly quiet even near the lifts Staff have been trained well good check in and check out 
112176,Hilton London Metropole, There s no ventilation in the rooms as windows are sealed shut Because the rooms are so warm you have to use the air con in the middle of winter The customer service staff are useless and frankly I don t know what their purpose is Never again will I stay in a Hilton hotel And your ratings are totally false , nothing we had a dreadful stay
112177,Hilton London Metropole, Some of the pillows had no cover which was very unhygienic They put a single duvet in a double duvet cover and they put it on a double bed There was no drinking water bottles in the room , Good location
112178,Hilton London Metropole, Being woken up by housekeeping to CLEAN our room on morning of check out at 7 30 ish even though we were not checking out until 12 00 as per hotel policy Waited ages to get into breakfast restaurant , Our rooms we had 2 for the family were really good and comfortable 
112179,Hilton London Metropole, Not able to turn down the heating in the room it was 25 degrees and this far to hot for me The pool was closed and this of course was a huge disappointment The breakfast is too pricy specially for children 18 pounds for a breakfast for children is far too expensive , Service check in facilities the price level at the restaurant The staff are very good 
112180,Hilton London Metropole, Many parts of the hotel have seen better days and the surrounding area is perhaps not very appealing to tourists Personally I also think that the bed was too firm and squeaky , My room in the West Wing was large comfortable and modern I also liked the fact that there was a subway station just around the corner 
112181,Hilton London Metropole, The only thing we didn t like was the location , Our room was fabulous We where on the 17th floor and the floor itself was spotless it looked as if it was newly done but as we passed lower floors they didn t look so nice they were very dated looking 
112182,Hilton London Metropole, The beds were creaky and the pillows too soft Also the room was very warm and it took a long time to cool down No water available unless paid for from mini bar , Overall a great experience though and the issues noted below didn t detract too much 
112183,Hilton London Metropole, The room we stayed in 809 in the Tower Block was dark a bit shabby Dark because there weren t enough lights some of the light bulbs had gone That room looks straight out onto a wall Having said that we weren t there on holiday so it wasn t such a big deal Also the hotel has over a thousand rooms so it s likely that because we d booked a low price option we were at the shabby end of the property We stayed on for a couple of extra days over the weekend but unfortunately the indoor pool was closed when we wanted to use it The hotel is huge impersonal but functional if you get a deal good value for the central location , The Edgware Road area is fabulous lively lots going on in the immediate surroundings of the hotel Plenty of shops interesting restaurants Hyde Park a short walk away Buses tubes on your doorstep Great base from which to do anything in London 
112184,Hilton London Metropole, interrupted in the early hours of the morning with staff walking into our room unannounced twice shower did not work properly and a c did not work at all ,No Positive
112185,Hilton London Metropole, Very disappointed that we couldn t enjoy a drink after 11pm with our children and had to send them unsupervised away from us They were working in a show and didn t get back to hotel till late all they wanted to do was chill out and enjoy each others company playing board games etc but that was cut short Also another reason we booked the hotel was because of the swimming pool and the children were extremely disappointed as were we when they were told they couldn t use it Very disappointed with the stay this time am considering staying elsewhere in the future, Very disappointed that we couldn t enjoy a drink after 11pm with our children and had to send them unsupervised away from us They were working in a show and didn t get back to hotel till late all they wanted to do was chill out and enjoy each others company playing board games etc but that was cut short Also another reason we booked the hotel was because of the swimming pool and the children were extremely disappointed as were we when they were told they couldn t use it Very disappointed with the stay this time am considering staying elsewhere in the future
112186,Hilton London Metropole, We were very disappointed because the swimming pool was out of order during our stay That was the reason to book this hotel and then we couldn t use it Staff wasn t bothered , Very spacious room Breakfast was excellent 
112187,Hilton London Metropole, The staff never spoke clear English It was very hard to understand them and they couldn t understand us Very very frustrating Would not recommend or come back to THIS hotel, The breakfast was fantastic plenty to eat nice and hot
112188,Hilton London Metropole, Cleanliness could have been much better Bathroom had plenty marks all over don t know whether they are recent or not but definitely needs updating You d assume if you get a 3 bed apartment you d get 3 towels etc Which was not the case , Location
112189,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms were a bit small for the value of money but they had everything you could need and were clean and comfortable , Fabulous facilities and very helpful staff very cloe to the city centre and Edgeware Road tube station is just a few steps from the hotel 
112190,Hilton London Metropole, There was a door adjoining to another room and although the people next door were just talking normally so its not their fault I could hear everything until 1am in the morning I called reception to ask for earplugs but they didn t have any I cannot believe they have not had received complaints for this before I could here the entire conversation To be fair they did say they could try and move me but at 11 30pm after a long business day I couldn t stomach packing everything up Small other issues the fridge had nothing in it there was not even water Also the shower was very very problematic Firstly the shower head didn t work and then the water wouldn t come through properly for about 15 minutes The hotel staff made a luke warm apology excuse the pun but I didn t really think they took these problems on board and I got the feeling the hotel was just too big with too many people to cope , Facilities in general Everything you needed in the room location of hotel Despite a number of issues I would stay again giving the benefit of doubt as I have stayed here a few times previously without any issues
112191,Hilton London Metropole, The base of the bed was a wooden one and it made a lot of cracking noises when you moved Definitely needs changing to a divan base Bit busy at breakfast if you go after 9 30 am It s a shame they had pancakes only at weekends Bathroom needs renovation , Size of bed was good for 2 kids ages 10 and 15 Size of room great for a family of 4 Very quiet as well Good black out curtains Enough storage Breakfast had a big variety 
112192,Hilton London Metropole, The bed awful mattress was lumpy and bed creaked continuously Breakfast service was good but they only gave one tea bag each and we felt a bit rushed by the staff Overall very good bar these couple of issues, Hotel was in a superb location Edge ware road tube station close by Breakfast was excellent with wide variety and choice Sports bar was excellent for food and drink and reasonably priced 
112193,Hilton London Metropole, Internet connectivity could hv been better Room temperature was a bit cold i am not sure if the room thermostat did do anything to increase the temperature , Staff was friendly and helpful Bed was comfortable Overall had a good stay 
112194,Hilton London Metropole, The room was very cold and because I came in very early in the morning and needed to sleep they gave me a room s lot lower than I paid for Never had to sleep in a room that small in a hilton chain ,No Positive
112195,Hilton London Metropole, No freshly made porridge for breakfast only a pot of oat so simple which you add water to we were very disappointed with this , As usual everything was wonderful
112196,Hilton London Metropole, Bath in the bathroom, Staff were very helpful with any questions The room was very comfortable following recent upgrade Bathroom was especially nice heated mirrors and lovely shower Breakfast especially the omelette was delicious 
112197,Hilton London Metropole, As above, It was very loud we got an upgrade but they put us next to the lifts and the kids above us kept us up all night we did not like it and did not even get asked how was our stay and we got told when booking it was next to big Ben it was no where near the staff as in the cleaning lady and the check in boy was really nice after that was not happy
112198,Hilton London Metropole, Nothing springs to mind bar not knowing if the tap in the bathroom is safe to drink drinking water , The bed was the right firmness the shower was nice with a good temperature and presures behind it and we will be trying out more of the facilities in the future Also liked the smell of the orange shower gel 
112199,Hilton London Metropole, Where was woje up in the early hours of the morning with lots of noise and door banging which made the night uncomfortable, The staff was very helpful and nothing was a problem
112200,Hilton London Metropole, I did not like the bed it was squicking and the wifi was not free of charge The bathroom was old and rusty Overall the room was not a Hilton stantard , I really liked the food that was offered 
112201,Hilton London Metropole, Just take a look at the photos I am a H Honours member and this should not be allowed They should be listed as a hostel no disrespect to Hostels I tried to complain and was offered an upgrade on my next stay the temptation of some H Honours BONUS POINTS don t make me laugh don t stay its not nice and a health hazard,No Positive
112202,Hilton London Metropole, our toilet door was broken when we arrived and it took two days to fix it they make 30 deposit for a day which was a bit strange because there was no minibar , safe and clean hotel very good location for public transport users nice breakfast and friendly personnel no problem or charge for our early check in 
112203,Hilton London Metropole, My room was a little cramped but windows were so big and wide they helped with making it feel less so , The shop facilities were great The staff were exceptionally helpful
112204,Hilton London Metropole, My only critique is that the temperature dial on the shower was hard to get right I couldn t find a medium when using it when it wasn t freezing or very hot , This hotel is gorgeous Easy check in process nice and helpful staff everywhere in the hotel particularly the restaurants cozy and clean room though my personal highlight was the beautiful view from the sky bar at the top of the hotel A gorgeous view of London that is difficult to find without paying a huge price 
112205,Hilton London Metropole, The room was tiny felt really squashed Our window was facing a building site not a nice view of London, The bed was comfortable the hotel is in a good location within walking proximity to Oxford street
112206,Hilton London Metropole, The bathroom was tiny the shower head had to be held in place or it spun away from you The TV was difficult to work Breakfast was cold disorganised and rubbery no offer of tea or coffee or explaination of how things worked Also no clear directions of how to find my room in the West wing and was told it s a bit of a walk to your room but you have the best views in the hotel Really best view as if see picture lol also the picture of the hallway was the distance from the lift to my room right at the end of the marathon length corridoor Breakfast staff were the only really friendly ones Also cos I used the mini bar to store some lunch for my course and two drinks they tried to charge me 24 but didn t explain why luckily I opened the sealed envelope to see what it was all about and called reception to argue the toss it was only when I said I hadn t used anything that they admitted that it was probably cos I stored stuff in the fridge Got it refunded eventually though i would not stay there again Also Arabic guests treated very differently than anyone else, The room itself was nice and the location was handy

112224,Hilton London Metropole, The breakfast Hall seemed unorganised though there were very nice staff waiting to seat us though they weren t sure which seats were free This could have been due to the sheer size of the hall Customers were asking for table service on hot drinks which is usually acceptable but there weren t enough staff to cater for such a huge hall Each side of the hall had a hot food cart the issue I found with this was the kitchen was on one side of the hall meaning the food on the furthest cart was not refilled as quickly as it should and had customers waiting for it to be replenished Though there was a massive and very good selection of food and drinks on hand to cater for everyone This wouldn t put me off of using this hotel again as everything else was superb ,No Positive

112253,Hilton London Metropole, People staying at the hotel were smoking despite it being a non smoking floor Even though the staff sent security to deal with the issue it was only solved temporarily the problem kept occurring throughout our stay at the hotel and you could smell cigarettes in you room and in the corridor There was dust on surfaces near the bed so it s not ideal for anyone with eczema or allergies TV kept flickering and did so even when you lightly tapped the cupboard the TV was on Shower temperature couldn t be controlled properly the water was lukewarm for two nights straight only the first and the last night was the shower hot enough to have a comfortable shower in There were also unknown stains on the carpet floor , The staff were nice and were quick to deal with issues Water pressure was good Staff was quick to respond to requests like asking for extra blankets

112258,Hilton London Metropole, I did not like the rent car office at hotel premises instead for hotel reputation they should deal with one of well known car rental company, the location facilities 
112259,Hilton London Metropole, 1 The service was sub standard After check in we had to find someone to help us take all of our luggage to our room they then took 30mins to bring our luggage to the room It was a huge distance between reception and the elevators of the west wing which we really didn t like as there was no easier access to our wing of the hotel 2 The room itself was terribly outdated The bathroom horrible with no shower only a step in bath A serious update is needed especially for the price you pay we didn t expect such old finishes poor quality of toilet bath 3 Our room was double booked whilst unpacking another family opened the door walked in Very poor management on the hotel s part Although they apologized for this afterwards through a simple phone call there was no compensation offered which another hotel would ve gladly done if they had made a similar mistake Given that the Hilton is such a huge hotel with over 1000 guests this kind of mistake is unacceptable because dealing with many guests at any given time should be their specialty It felt more like the staff couldn t handle the number of guests during our stay 4 We requested another room that had a shower rather given that my mother struggled to use a step in bath The room offered was much smaller only for 2 people but it had a step in shower which was the only reason we agreed to move but were told we would still be charged the same price for this new room as the family room we were previously booked into This to me is unacceptable given that the room was smaller not a family room 5 The breakfast situation was really unpleasant besides there being a very poor variety of foods drinks breakfast was served in the banquet hall because the usual restaurant which was much nicer could not accommodate so many guests , Location

112265,Hilton London Metropole, Poor quality of reception staff My friends room keys not working Need to go down several times just to keep on changing the key No staff offered to go upstairs to check if the customers ok They we re waiting for more than half an hour outside their room door w a 5 years old autistic child throwing tantrums In the end they where moved to a different room Still no staff re assured them nor check if they were ok , Location is near the train station which is accessible to London area The Sky23 Bar and Restaurant has a very good staff and very accommodating A star quality staff indeed 
112266,Hilton London Metropole, But would be much better if the hot food was kept hot rather than left to cool The plates need to be cleaned properly as every plate I picked up was either dirty or had dried detergent stain on them , There was a good variety of food for breakfast

112277,Hilton London Metropole, Having stayed here a couple of times before I was beyond disappointed this time around The location is ideal and there is parking and leisure facilities However upon check in we were given the keys to someone else s room Thankfully no one was in the room when we opened the door We then went back to reception and were given a new room There were stains all over the carpet of the new room Only 3 TV channels worked The extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work The seals on the windows were broken so the condensation meant you couldn t even see the spectacular views of the city which is factored into the room price We weren t offered any hot drinks at breakfast on both mornings of our stay We had to try and find a waiter who would respond or made the mistake of making eye contact with us otherwise they were all doing their best to ignore us and try to get on with what they were doing Eventually when we did get someone s attention they brought a fabulous latte and a cold flask of hot water for a cup of tea with no milk We then had to find a jug of milk ourselves as the waiters yet again disappeared It might have been quicker to go milk a cow We resorted to taking one from another table The changing rooms in the leisure faculties left a lot to be desired in terms of cleanliness I walked into the changing room with my two year old daughter to be met with a mound of dirty used towels I would have estimated perhaps 80 or so My daughter was more than thrilled at the sight of towel mountain but I on the other hand wasn t The humidity and stench wasn t a good combination Further upon getting into the pool the floor of it appeared to have sand all over it Free foot exfoliation I would expect that at a beach resort but not an indoor pool All in all not the best experience at a Hilton by far and I ve stayed in many worldwide Very disappointed ,No Positive
112278,Hilton London Metropole, Felt that the rooms were a bit basic for the price we paid in comparison to other Hilton hotels we have stayed at I also struggled to obtain hot water on one occasion, Really good location and staff were friendly and helpful

112284,Hilton London Metropole, The room on the 21 floor really smelt of sewage almost like dirty water and it was so bad it make me feel sick so I asked to be moved I would not usually complain I spoke to reception and was told that I could either go to the reception desk to collect another card or wait for the concierge to come to the room but I would have to wait a half hour for the conceriege I was very tight for time as I needed to shower and change quickly for a function This is very poor and quite unbelievable With no choice I went with all my bags to the reception I was given no apology and was moved along the corridor Having taken all my bags back this room also smelt I needed to get ready and go for the function so I did not mention it For 123 this was a very poor experience not only because the room was sub standard but because the reception felt it was acceptable to tell me that I had to wait half an hour for a new room key I won t be staying again and having relayed the experience I wouldn t see my colleagues staying anymore either ,No Positive

112316,Hilton London Metropole, The room was extremely warm Temp stayed between 24 25 degrees Despite speaking to staff on 3 occasions A maintenance man tried in vain to fix it however we had no choice but to keep the air conditioning on at all times which is not ideal , The staff were very friendly

112321,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms are a bit tired and the restaurant serving breakfast isn t big enough for a hotel of this size , Great location very convenient for Paddington a Station and the West End 
112322,Hilton London Metropole, I booked 2 rooms a month in advance on arrival at check in they could only find 1 room and it took about 25 minutes to sort it out witch was stressful as we where going to a wedding and needed to leave I really thought we would not get the other room I had booked both rooms on the first floor next to each other we ended up on the 3rd and forth floor separated I was disappointed as we were all really looking forward to staying here , Lovely hotel
112323,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast was extremely busy staff coped very well with clearing tables etc there just seemed to be too many people for the size of the restaurant, Fantastic location just opposite Edgeware Tube Rooms spacious quiet and comfy beds 
112324,Hilton London Metropole, This is the first hotel I have stayed in for 2 nights where my room wasn t made up after the first night Although breakfast was very good we were not offered tea or coffee with our meal on the second morning , The hotel is very impressive and modern Reception and restaurant staff are extremely polite and helpful The food is exceptionally good even though price is on the high side it is worth it

112326,Hilton London Metropole, The rooms were basic not any better than a premier in and we re very small Staff were not very helpful I was just quite disappointed for a Hilton and the price I paid , The actual hotel was lovley the reception and the sky bar lounge e c t the rooms were just disappointing
112327,Hilton London Metropole, the bathroom was shabby and dated it needed painting the toilet seat didn t fit why don t you just have a large shower instead of a bath The fan didn t work it steamed up The living room window also condensed a lot, the location and the friendly bar check out was good The pool changing rooms were poor my daughter didn t feel comfy changing with other people there wasn t enough privacy 
112328,Hilton London Metropole, The pool chemicals turned my six year old granddaughters blond hair a greenish colour Also a drain smell in bathroom was at times unpleasant , The general ambience and friendliness of staff

112331,Hilton London Metropole, We had high expectations travelling 200 miles to the Hilton metropole to be greeted at check in to be told we had to settle for a smoking room as there was no other choice and if we didn t like it we would have to down grade from a deluxe king room to a single room was a disgrace we settled in the end for the smoking room as we had very little option to do otherwise and although the views from the room where quiet impressive the actual room was no more impressive than a premier inn a massive dissappointment from start to finish , Decent location
112332,Hilton London Metropole, Mattress was very hard Room a little smaller than I imagined for a superior queen suite , Able to book in early as the room was ready and staff were very friendly and helpful 
112333,Hilton London Metropole, The room was the size of a postage stamp and cold We booked a delux room on booking com and it was confirmed that we had a large delux room that slept 3 of us Me my partner and my daughter The bed was a small double and there wasn t any room for even a pull out bed to fit in My partner was shocked by the plug socket also when switching the kettle on The view outside our window was of a wall Really not worth the 171 per night that we paid , The breakfast was the best part about this hotel although it was extremely busy 
112334,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel assumed that our late check in meant we weren t going to stay at the hotel and gave our room away even though we had pre paid We turned up at 11pm and didn t get a replacement room sorted until 12 30am The room we were given only had 1 double bed although we d paid for 2 and were given 2 camp beds to accomodate all members of the group Not what we had paid for After distress plenty of phone calls to reception we were refunded 50 as half of our party did not recieve what they had paid for a king size bed , Our complimentary breakfast was lovely a great selection of pastries fruit and the option for a cooked breakfast also Lovely bedroom king size bed was very comfy camp beds ok Good location across the road from Edgware Road tube station or a short walk to Paddington station Staff quite slow to react rectify situation but did apologise compensate for poor service
112335,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms very dated Matress well past end of useful life very uncomfortable Breakfast facilities insufficient for number of guests leading to long waits even at quieter times ,No Positive

112337,Hilton London Metropole, The price for a relaxing drink in the bar was outragious prevented us from spending any quality time in there , Our room was a good size clean with a decent view The breakfast was very good 
112338,Hilton London Metropole, Room we booked was not available even booking 6 weeks ahead so got stuck in a twin smoking room that was horrid they told us to open the window The smell stayed with me all weekend and as a non smoker it ruined the trip The picture quality of the TV in room was unwatchable cables hanging out from the wall Bad toiletries provided Room looked like it needed a total refurbishment Got a free meal in restaurant that was average but had to pay for drinks , View from 23rd floor was awesome 
112339,Hilton London Metropole, Staff gave conflicting info re facilities couldn t get wi fi in room large queues noisy from road at night windowspermanently steamed up despite all efforts, Comfy bed clean housekeeping quick efficient near subway station spa facilities ok
112340,Hilton London Metropole, The minibar was empty which it seems is hotel policy but we could have done with some bottled water after a long night out It also would have been nice to have more tea bags and milk as one cuppa is never enough , Spotlessly clean room huge comfy double bed nice quiet night The decor in the hotel itself is modern and classy 
112341,Hilton London Metropole, The room was dirty it definitely wasn t cleaned I asked for a double room I got a twin room instead The shower was broken the room was freezing even if we put the heating on boost There were stains all over the throws cushions the lampshade was falling apart There were blood stains on the sheets , The common areas of the hotel were fantastic 
112342,Hilton London Metropole, My only issue was there wasn t gluten free bread and cereal options for breakfast and couldn t have chips with my evening meal as they weren t gluten free but was given a salad instead took me a few minutes to work out the thermostat as room was a little chilly but it didn t spoil my stay , Customer services was absolutely amazing my daughter was treated like a guest of honour and all staff were brilliant friendly polite service was 2nd to none my daughter and i travel alot honestly the best service we ve had As we are coeliac there was a lot of options food wise and they found alternatives suitable if there was no gf df nut free option could have a decent meal when we arrived after a long journey also at breakfast foods were clearly labled gluten free which saved asking 
112343,Hilton London Metropole, We made two bookings as this was cheaper than one booking which I wasn t impressed about Could have been a little closer to oxford street however it was very close to a tube station , The staff were quick to resolve any issues we had 
112344,Hilton London Metropole, VERY BUSY RECEPTION DESK LONG WAIT THERE AS IT IS A HUGE HOTEL BUT VERY POLITE AND HELPFUL WHEN WE WERE ATTENDED, VERY NEAR PADDINGTON STATION COMING FROM HEATHROW IS A PLUS 
112345,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast hot food could have been hotter slight smell of smoke in bathroom other than that it was great, Great location facilitys great great room and comfy bed
112346,Hilton London Metropole, Non stop queues at the checkin desks Long waiting time for breakfast on Saturday morning No food after 11pm even in the high floor bar only drinks , Much less expensive than other Hilton Paddington which is only few minutes walk away My room was not 100 clean on arrival i e garbage in the trash been in the toilet from the previous guest 
112347,Hilton London Metropole, Wifi charge of 12 99 seemed expensive these days , My stay was really good from start to finish This is a large hotel but the Hilton is well equipped for the mass of people checking they make the process very simple The room was pretty comfortable everything you need from decent tv channels comfortable bed iron for crumpled shirt and a desk to work from I went out in the evening taxis a plenty as you would expect in london Breakfast was excellent great service Even got asked for my opinion on making things better Suggested the add another juice station which was written down not sure if it will ever get implemented I checked out over the phone 
112348,Hilton London Metropole, The fact that we couldnt open the window and perhaps the bathroom could have been a bit more cleaner but overall very good , the staff were very helpful they did their best to provide us with connecting door rooms as we were a family and it was also an upgrade of what e have previously booked The rooms are spacious the location is great many restaurants and cafes as well as the underground station and the bus stop is just 3 minutes walk the breakfast was also great but it can get crowded during the weekends 
112349,Hilton London Metropole, ended up in a smoking room last rooms available I didnt think there were any smoking hotel rooms any more I stank of smoke for meetings next day Staff were apologetic and explained rooms were allocated in turn with these smelly rooms last The hotel was full that night and I was last I would of preferred to know this up front and choose to stay somewhere else , Good check in and check out lots of staff
112350,Hilton London Metropole, Window was appallingly affected by condensation we had to stand on a chair to take a view picture above the condensation, Apart from window it was comfy relaxed great staff and service Any food was of a high standard any interaction with staff was friendly but of the formal professiona nature wanted in such an establishment 
112351,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, The staff is really helpful Bartek has offer us excellet service the room is new clean and comfortable will recommend to friends an families Thanks 
112352,Hilton London Metropole, I made a group booking with Booking com A confirmation was received When we got there not all rooms were available Not all had breakfast This was confirmed Following various calls Hilton blamed Booking com and Booking com blamed Hilton My guests had to be found accommodations in other hotels nearby Breakfast was poor due to the number of guests in the hotel , The hotel is near a tube station 
112353,Hilton London Metropole, Since we move in we asked to change the room because they give us the room that has a really bad smell We have to wait for 3 hours for them to come and bring us to the new room Moreover we ask housekeeper to clean our room but they didn t replace enough facilities suchas shampoo or towel or snacks for enough people staying in the room and this happened almost everyday while we stay at the hotel Even worse sometimes housekeeper clean our room but they didnt replace anything facilities for us , The hotel is not far from the underground station 
112354,Hilton London Metropole, Queue for breakfast Would have liked a more powerful shower but wasn t a problem Woken at 4am by group of very loud people in corridor They were there for half hour Staff dealt with my complaint quickly , Spacious room Good reception staff Very good breakfast Good waiting staff
112355,Hilton London Metropole, In most hotels and establishments wifi is now free as standard So to still have to pay for it is inconvenient and may put me off staying in future Even if charging for service the price is a bit steep Reducing the cost would probably mean more people willing to pay a few quid for it and making it free would be better , Nearby parking was convenient Clean good business facilities and good location Staff very friendly 
112356,Hilton London Metropole, we have to pay extra because one of the rooms was not in the same buidling as the otehrs and they blame it on booking so this was my last time by booking , the kindness of the guest relations manager
112357,Hilton London Metropole, Being charged a deposit for the mini bar at check in and then realise that there was nothing in the fridge , Comfy bed and great shower Great location close to tube Great view of London from our room on the 16th floor 
112358,Hilton London Metropole, I travel regularly and stay in many hotels I was very disappointed in the state of the room not what I would have expected from the Hilton As soon as you entered the room it smelt like the gents toilets which led me to look at the bathroom which was run down and smelly The bedroom was again filthy and the carpets were full of stains Really disappointed , The location was good
112359,Hilton London Metropole, Phone calls at 6am 6 20am and 7 30am Breakfast was great but very busy long queues at times , Location facilities and food were excellent Staff were very friendly and helpful 
112360,Hilton London Metropole, The room was no more than a large broom cupboard not fit for a couple With the wardrobe and open you had to squeeze past The heating in room 418 Tower Block was not working the mini bar was empty the tiles round the toilet were broken I have stayed in better rooms in hotels of lesser stars It is a disgrace that Hilton should offer such accommodation Breakfast was chaotic to say the least no defined areas for items no replenishment of plates No tablecloth on the table we were offered and the service was very poor ,No Positive
112361,Hilton London Metropole, The reception staffs when I did check put they was angry and they spoke with me un politely that I should pay 60 because I m late while the one before her sheft told me 40 They keep me waiting for 45 minutes I left with out bill because they was very slow If anyone from Head Hilton Hotels want there name I wrote all the information in my note book This is the last time with those chilli staff , I liked the staff when I check in only
112362,Hilton London Metropole, The bathroom was looking a bit tired and the TV was a bit difficult to operate Doors could have had better soundproofing, Comfortable wide beds Good concierge service
112363,Hilton London Metropole, Didn t like the fact that although it was a 12 o clock checkout the cleaner started knocking on our hotel room door at 9am because she wanted to clean the room Wouldn t have been so bad but we specifically chose this hotel because of the late check out time as we knew we would be having a late night the night before Not good value for money either we stayed in a king size deluxe room which was nothing better than a Travelodge or Premier Inn room so will not be staying here again , Can t think of anything really just a basic hotel room for the night 
112364,Hilton London Metropole, Price expensive but then that s London, Was a venue for a dinner dance so we stayed over Hotel is big and busy but good Location good and room was nice Nothing really special about the hotel and it was not cheap as it s in london of course staff were good
112365,Hilton London Metropole, I was really up set with the breakfast when we book in we were told it was between 6 30 a11 30 to find out it was 8 30 10 30 and when we came down we had to queue for half hour there was no organisation and the breakfast was cold this is the only thing that would put me off booking here again and it wasn t a cheap room we book thanks, I thought the hotel was lovely staff friendly
112366,Hilton London Metropole, We were attending a wedding so called to confirm an early check in to arrive be told it would be 3 instead of the prior 11am It did get resolved after I requested to see the manager however don t believe we ended up with the Deluxe room we booked although we re told we did So not as nice as expected Breakfast was chaos queuing but the staff were polite , Parking was easy

112372,Hilton London Metropole, The room was horrible and the bed was uncomfortable We were told they would call us when the room was ready so at 4 20pm we arrived back only to be told our room was unavailable because of maintenance We asked to speak to the manager and the receptionist went to get them only to come back with another excuse direct from the manager This made me think the manager was pretty gutless hiding out the back The decor is terrible We were shown a new room with a view like the one we originally booked and upon arrival the window had so much condensation you couldnt see a thing I advise anyone wanting a luxury stay or even a nice stay avoid this hotel I have stayed in a lot of hotel from 3 5 stars and this would be the worse I have ever been in , Nothing 
112373,Hilton London Metropole, Not much but very crowded in breakfast restaurant as the size of hotel , Most of things are nice such as location and service as per their brand I called hotel for tablet PC I left there And Mr Albert at lost and found department handled this issue very quickly so Im very pleased 
112374,Hilton London Metropole, The sky room , The facilities the staff the food the comfort of the room and the location made this an outstanding stay which we enjoyed to the fullest extent possible 
112375,Hilton London Metropole, bedroom was a disgrace very very dated old and smelly terrible beds we asked to be moved and the room was less smelly but equally bad on all other fronts Tiny bathrooms just extremely disappointing all round Air con heating didn t work just a fan blowing that couldnt be turned off , lobby and bar and facilities were nice nad modern
112376,Hilton London Metropole, On arrival everything was perfect then we went to the sky bar for a quick drink and waited 20 minutes to get drink while the staff just said wait one moment We were sitting at the bar The bar was not busy when we arrived The staff seemed to be busy doing nothing Change was slammed on the bar at another customer You were made to feel as is everything was just to much trouble no smile The supervisor that s what she looked like slammed the drinks menu down on the bar at a customer Really good customer service NOT The breakfast room staff did not smile or make you feel welcome maybe 2 out the floor staff smiled Food handled without gloves Breakfast was great , Rooms clean and comfortable

112379,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast was not edible we couldn t have breakfast in the normal restaurant as it was packed so was shipped off to a large cold meeting room for breakfast where it was served freezing Bathroom was not clean and then service was very poor For such a busy and big hotel it had potential but was let down completely, The bedroom was comfortable and fully stocked minibar
112380,Hilton London Metropole, Ordered a sandwich from room service and it s not made very clear that although you have to pay room service rate for the food it s an extra 5 00 for the tray it s brought on, Pleasant hotel polite staff

112383,Hilton London Metropole, The pool was the coldest pool i was ever in thoufh the staff there were lovely there was no movies on the tv we paid for two but i though they were expensive because one of them cut out before the end these are only small complaints , The staff anka the manageress the house maids doormen restaurant manager were amazingly nice
112384,Hilton London Metropole, We requested for early check in which was not met once we reached there We were told as soon as the room was ready we would get an sms but no one from the staff contacted us until we had to make our way back to the hotel in the evening I wish I had taken down the name of the staff member at Concierge but he was extremely rude to which we complained about him as well There were no complimentary water bottles kept in our room which might be considered a small thing but for a big chain like Hilton it can be used as a warm welcome for their guests upon their arrival Hotel is too commercial Feels like you re walking in a mall , Location of the hotel is great station less than a minute walk away Close to a lot of restaurants cafes Spacious room for European standards in the West Wing Comfortable clean rooms
112385,Hilton London Metropole, Beds and pillows were very uncomfortable to sleep on and of very poor quality ask for king size bed but was presented with two beds pushed together Bathroom was tiny and needed replacing As it was a birthday weekend away we thought Hilton would be a luxury relaxing choice of stay but this hotel was certainly not this especially for the cost have stayed in much better places for a lot less money , Downstairs lobby and bar area was lovely Location to tube stations and shops

112399,Hilton London Metropole, Waiting time for lifts was far too long used the stairs but had to come out at level 8 because it was pitch black no emergency lights at all When I first checked in I was told I had booked for 2 adults not 1 adult and 2 children this was incorrect I had to show them the confirmation email from booking com before they would confirm my accommodation for the night they then tried to squeeze an extra bed into a twin room without success before moving us to a family room which had an adjoining door with the guest next door who then complained about the noise we were making Had three visits in total from the guest next door and security guards right up until 12 10am who all witnessed there was no excess noise coming from myself and two 15 year olds on their iPads Not impressed with this at all seen as we had come down from Scotland for one overnight ruined our stay completely Won t be booking at the Hilton again despite being offered a complimentary glass of wine not good enough ,No Positive
112400,Hilton London Metropole, The room was outdated and things where broken the room was very hot so gave us broken sleep , Overall the stay was pleasent the staff where very welcoming and the food was excellent and the location was spot on 
112401,Hilton London Metropole, A few things throughout the corridors and bathroom aren t well kept and according to a Hilton Hotel standard comparing to others that I have been I believe the management team is not going through every detail , The place is very nice and the staff amazing The bedrooms are comfortable and spacious I would stay there again and recommend to anyone 
112402,Hilton London Metropole, I paid for a room that included access to the club lounge or something but nobody bothered to tell me where or what that was The room was pleasant but nothing special and not significantly better than you d get in an average premier inn Nothing wrong with this place but when you take into consideration the price paid it does not represent good value for money , Good location if you need to be close to Paddington very close to the railway station 
112403,Hilton London Metropole, Little tired and worn Expensive internet in the rooms and breakfast was over priced so we opted for local shops instead , Good location for local restaurants great selection of Arabian food close by on Edware Road Close to Paddington Station and walking distance to big stores on Oxford Street Huge hotel with lots of choice for food and drinks
112404,Hilton London Metropole, Cracks in ceiling room had old decor from 80s room smelt foul mood in bathroom bathroom flooded no drainage could barley walk in room Staff un willing to change room Went and stayed in jumeirah in stead , Leaving

112406,Hilton London Metropole, Poor customer service on the front desk from Customer Relations Manager Poor and slow service at breakfast Room not ready for guaranteed check in time, Nothing
112407,Hilton London Metropole, There were double windows in bedroom not openable on 18th floor understandably however the outer one was filthy and therefore virtually opaque The view should have been breathaking The breakfast buffet was a rough affair by this I neither refer to the staff nor food but the hungry jostling hoardes Queuing for entry then the queue for the various buffets made necessary by ginormous size of hotel complex , The check in receptionst from Argentina was welcoming friendly and very helpful The lifts in the tower accommodation were very fast to 18th floor The bed and bedlinen of good quality The location is excellent a short stroll from Paddington and similarly to Marble Arch along the culturally diverse Edgeware Rd Newly renovated rooms in tower 
112408,Hilton London Metropole, NNN, Big hotel have 4 towes 10 min From Oxford St Clean we sleep in 2 quien bed the room eas big and nice The breakfast was good The pool is not big more for refresh the SYM eas good The restaurant for dinner was good Thay have also coffee shop with nice soup and sandwich Around the hotel alot Arab restaurant Alot Moslem propulsion 2 underground 3 4 min walk take you to all places in London 
112409,Hilton London Metropole, The room we had was described as Deluxe it was on the 22nd floor and was more like a standard or sub standard for a London 4 hotel Very small and very dated Hotels should stop using the word Deluxe to describe what are there basic or sub standard rooms, Location all of the main facilities on the ground floor and the restaurants The car parking is also good value for money at weekends 
112410,Hilton London Metropole, Was offered an upgrade before arrival but felt i was being accused of lying on check in Despite having an email to confirm, Fabulous breakfast friendly staff
112411,Hilton London Metropole, My first impression of the hotel was like being in an airport it wasn t good Then my first contact with a member of staff was with an incredibly rude receptionist where at one point I nearly just cancelled my stay altogether I honestly really did not like this hotel , Considering the expense of the night I wouldn t really rate this hotel I tend to stay in a hotel once or twice per month and it would be fair to say I ll never stay in a Hilton again 
112412,Hilton London Metropole, Wifi was quite poor even in communal areas at times and the decor of the room despite being an Executive King Room was a bit dated, Very convenient location and the bed was extremely comfortable
112413,Hilton London Metropole, The bathroom was utterly discussing and dirty as my pictures show There were stains all over the tap lime scale everywhere layers of pee and human waste in the toilet seat fixture some diy repairs and just dirt everywhere stains on the shower curtain The bedding was falling apart my fingers were getting tangled in fibres coming out of the covers There was a burn mark on one of the blankets and the sound knob in the bathroom with dirty and not working The ventilation in the bathroom didn t work and when we all took a shower in the morning everything got steamed up and the room became very hot The staff were unpleasant and that s out mildly The pool was also dirty and the staff was unpleasant to all the guests The breakfast area was chaotic it was like wacky races the floor was covered in food It was scary at times Our room wasn t cleaned on daily basis and we had to used wet towels the next again day I feel we were ripped off It s a hovel and not a hotel Please avoid at all costs , Parking available swimming pool 
112414,Hilton London Metropole, mattress felt cheap and squeaky The 23rd floor bar was such a missed opportunity great views but the tables chairs were so cheap looking and uncomfortable, location good
112415,Hilton London Metropole, The room appearance was quite average Would have expected it to be a bit more fancy for a Hilton Hotel , Good choice of food for breakfast Location was very close to the subway 
112416,Hilton London Metropole, room we got was so worn and cruel that we decided to complain about this we could not get another room for the day after this we had to pay 140 extra for 2 nights Poor service Restaurant was a disaster they managed not to servers that we ordered We ve been to several Hilton hotels before but this hotel is in our opinion the absolut worst we are very disappointed on behalf of our grandchildren that we would give a good experien ,No Positive
112417,Hilton London Metropole, We arrived they couldn t find booking then found the booking but have us double rather than a single we we ve advised we had been upgraded this definitely was not true we had the worst room I usually always say in hiltons and this is worst room by far tiny window no view and the toilet was situatied very strangely , Function rooms were perfect
112418,Hilton London Metropole, No in room fridge , Fiamma breakfast buffet was delightful Fast and reliable internet access Nearby Edgware and Paddington with plenty of nearby shops as well We took the Original Tour bus good thing a stop was just outside the hotel 
112419,Hilton London Metropole, The room was the smallest I ve had on my 5 week travels around Europe and UK , The breakfasts are the best I ve had Location was handy for tubes Quiet and clean room I would stay there again 
112420,Hilton London Metropole, Was disappointed that we weren t given a room with a view as I d asked for one it was my daughters first time in London and it was her 21st birthday present so wanted her to have a nice view , Breakfast was good plenty of choice and variety Bar at top had fab views overlooking the city 
112421,Hilton London Metropole, Hotel toilets dirty and a v big hole in the roof Food was good but no care over cleanliness or presentation Bar staff automatically took an optional service charge on an already ridiculously expensive drink only noticed when checked the receipt a home Certainly not value for money , Room was comfy and clean
112422,Hilton London Metropole, The fact that a chef came out of the kitchen and attacked us in a full restaurant because we sent back our food, The way we were treated in the restaurant Wednesday night I reported it but basically nothing was done 
112423,Hilton London Metropole, The airconditioning in the room we were in didn t work had 2 technicans look at it we then moved rooms the next room was smaller , The staff didn t hesitate to help us when aircon didn t work they gave us a fan and moved us the next day
112424,Hilton London Metropole, Our room was extremely smelly Smelt very damp Not great given we paid 242 per room But we were literally there to shower change and sleep off too many cocktails so didn t complain to staff , Great location for city antics 
112425,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast room very overcrowded and badly organised Almost dangerous with people weaving through queues with food and hot drinks So called hot food barely warm One of the worst breakfast expeiences I have ever had , The bed was very comfortable and quiet 
112426,Hilton London Metropole, There weren t a lot of places to eat at in the area that weren t hallal I ended up walking for about half an hour looking for a pub one night and ended up just grabbing something at the restaurant on the first floor It was okay but I would have liked to have found a more traditional pub , The view was nice and the gym pool was an unexpected bonus 
112427,Hilton London Metropole, Unfortunately the toiletries were inadequate no shower cap cotton buds used partially filled shampoos bath gel much to our surprise We ve stayed in Hilton hotels in Malaysia Washington DC Hilton Dulles airport have never experienced this issue on toiletries , Good location near tube station supermarkets restaurants nearby post office closeby The room was spacious 
112428,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast was not an enjoyable experience no matter what time we went down it was always packed not a relaxing experience, Clean rooms comfy beds ensure you get a room with a view otherwise you could be looking at a bland brick wall
112429,Hilton London Metropole, Check in took a really long time Staff were unhelpful when enquiring about offers in edg bar and food in new seafood restaurant could have been better , Breakfast was lovely Hotel really clean and comfortable and great sports bar
112430,Hilton London Metropole, the restaurant was too crowded I wait long time till find place to setdown no halal foods no fish at all as alternative, yes the bed was ok but breakfast was not enjoyable
112431,Hilton London Metropole, The room could be bigger We have had larger rooms on a cruise ship , The breakfasts were good and the chamber maids were helpful The concierge were helpful too 
112432,Hilton London Metropole, Not hotel s fault but would have preferred to be closer to west end Fairly expensive considering all things but had a good visit, Polite and helpful staff Facilities good and efficient management Close to transport 
112433,Hilton London Metropole, When I book a room in the Internet it was looking good but when I get there I was surprised that they gave me the worst room I have even been it is like a prison also I pay a lot for this room what you will in the Internet you will not get it in the hotel they try to give you nice looking and luxury but later you will find something totally wrong place , i didnt like the place at all
112434,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel lobby is lovely but the rooms are very dated and old There was a funny smell in my room and the walls skirtings and spots in the bathroom felt dirty Needs a bit of a re vamp Also the staff in the lobby kindly said that she gave me wi fi free of charge but normally you need to pay I think that is ridiculous considering the price of the hotel , The hotel was in a good location and practical for the work conference I was attending Bed was comfortable 
112435,Hilton London Metropole, Swimming pool was really cold my little girl wouldn t stay in there Breakfast too expensive, Really enjoy the comfy bed breakfast was very good 
112436,Hilton London Metropole, Having to pay for internet feels like a rip off as it s a necessity in this day and age We were not allowed in our room for 7 hours due to an arranged power cut not communicated to us at any point before arrival but still not offered free internet to soften the blow The lifts are pretty tedious Cocktail bartenders were not great in service or technique The mini bar was dirty and still had the previous guests yoghurt inside it wasn t stocked but we were happy with that in the knowledge it s always a rip off , Great beds location nice gym
112437,Hilton London Metropole, The staff in the reception treat us badly and when I arrived I only get my room ready at 5 00 pm which is very late to rest Even they took 300 pounds and still I didn t get refund that because some receptionists took from my cards more money than required that is the worse hotel in London ,No Positive
112438,Hilton London Metropole, That children must have an adult with them in the pool Some kids can swim very well and a life guard should be on ground to supervise, The bed was comfortable and the room spacious enough for 2 of us
112439,Hilton London Metropole, Size of the bedroom I paid 209 for a room that was small bathroom was also small Paper coming of the walls barely enough room for my stuff During the buffet there was not enough food ran out of bread rolls some staff didn t know what was going on and told me to go and find food on the other tables not helpful Also very expensive for drinks, Baked courgettes were lovely at the buffet Ground floor is beautiful and the event room was great 
112440,Hilton London Metropole, Customer service was appalling general staff attitude was poor for 300 per night I expected at least a decent room , We had an executive room which was tatty dirty the bathroom was disgusting very dated paint peeling everywhere poor flush poor quality shower 
112441,Hilton London Metropole, The milk in our room was off Hard to do with UHT We had a wake up call at 04 30am we didn t ask for The bathroom couldn t fit 2 people in it The windows were filthy for the view We paid 624 for 2 nights and the room was box size and described as a Deluxe There was nothing deluxe about it and all you could do was lay on the bed and watch tv the space was so small and the tv didn t even WORK No volume No clear picture and offer of 4 blurred channels In 2016 this is unheard of The room smelt from the previous person staying when we entered it I would like to add I have never in my life as a performer of 26 years and travelling the world have ever felt the need to take time to write a complaint The booking promised a sofa bed for our son It had a chair The airconditioning in the room couldn t turn off so it was freezing all weekend At 6 months pregnant and with a child travelling with us this lack of service was even more challenging and it has seriously put me off Hilton and bookings com because we trusted you both with our money upon your recommendation The trip gave zero luxury As well we were guests to speak at an event that cost the billion dollar organisers tens of thousands to rent out 3 times a year from Hilton and this information has all been fed back to them now so that valuable custom for this hotel is now lost , The conference rooms
112442,Hilton London Metropole, The person who I spoke to him by phone refused to book a superior queen room 2 double beds while I am able to book it online 2 adults and 3 kids under 10 Note that the hotel can rent an extra bed which exactly what we did but the reservation person unfortunately refused , The superior Family room was big enough to accommodate us 2 adults and 3 kids under 10 
112443,Hilton London Metropole, the tower wing is a little old and dated old carpets however since we only go there to sleep did not bother us much , the location was excellent as it was close to the tube station which has 3 lines the bed was very comfy we did not have breakfast so no comments there there was a young man Bash we think his name was at the Concierge who was extremely helpful and pleasant thank you for patiently answering all our questions 
112444,Hilton London Metropole, Reception staff were poor on handling booking room wasn t ready when got there wasn t pre warned about 30 deposit prior drinks receipt was opt in tip however wasn t previously told this they just assumed Bed very uncomfortable executive room was poor value for money small had balcony but apparently wasn t allowed to open door Bathroom very basic Tried to charge us for minibar when didn t even use it tried to take money from credit card without checking first Executive lounge continental breakfast wasn t very nice hash browns were dry and barely warm Plug near bed was faulty No window to open for fresh air Extremely disappointed Would not stay here again even if we was paid to and very unhappy about spending close to 200 for a room when I have stayed in 30 rooms that are better , Security staff sky bar staff and night manager we couldn t fault 
112445,Hilton London Metropole, There was a water leak from the ceiling in our bedroom quickly repaired but it had obviously happened before as the ceiling was badly marked Maintainance needs work, The breakfast was excellent
112446,Hilton London Metropole, 1 They didn t give me double bed 2 There was no minibar in the room 3 The room size was small It was t worth the money 4 The towels were not enough 5 We had to wait for 20 minutes for a table for breakfast, The location was perfect for transport to AirPort and to the west end
112447,Hilton London Metropole, This is second year for us to stay in the hotel in a row unfortunately the rooms were not ready at the time we arrived in both , The room was very big The beds were very comfortable 
112448,Hilton London Metropole, Dirty old rooms for newly furnished room they asked us to pay extra on check in counter they will ask for higher floor newly furnished rooms extra bed not value of money at all when I requested for 1 hour late check out they gave me 45 mins funny for me anyways I ll not recommend this hotel for families as there is no place for shopping on walking distance other than m S it may be good for business travel, Nothing
112449,Hilton London Metropole, The front desk lady i think her name is Oana eastern european wan not friendly at all Nobody offered to carry our luggages We carried them by ourselves , Only the Location
112450,Hilton London Metropole, Poor organisation due to lack of sufficient staff at one breakfast and Cooked breakfast items should be hot We did not bother to take breakfast a second time , Quick check in and check out Rapid lifts to 13th floor Spacious public areas 
112451,Hilton London Metropole, Umm bathroom curtains need a change and there is a musty smell in the corridors of the 7th floor coming from the carpet may be Anyhow no smell inside the room, Location facilities room size for a family kindness of all the staff
112452,Hilton London Metropole, 1 the room not clean where we found dirty and some garbage inside drawer 2 the matrass were very old uncomfortable dirty and the spring can be felt and they replaced it after two days when I complained many times and they send me small matrass which was smaller than the bed 3 they didn t provide enough shampoo although we were 2 in each room, Location
112453,Hilton London Metropole, I was a little disappointed with the deluxe room no bottled water and only a few biscuits I also requested an early check in between 1pm and 2pm and received a message online a few days before my arrival saying although the hotel couldn t guarantee that would be possible it could well be OK We couldn t check in early and on our return to the hotel from a concert there was some confusion regarding where our luggage had been stored , Good location Excellent breakfast

112458,Hilton London Metropole, Only thing that was wrong that we checked in and went to our room and the bathroom door was broke The maid came in and told us we could swap rooms as the glass was shattered And we got upgraded for the trouble so not a problem , Great place to stay for a trip to London 
112459,Hilton London Metropole, Having arrived at the hotel the staff member checking me in asked if I wanted to upgrade to a bigger room I said no then she asked if I wanted to pay twenty pounds more per night for a newly refurbished room and I said why should I have to pay more for it and are the rooms clean and allergy free She said no that the other rooms were older and I asked how old she asked her colleague and they had a right old laugh saying it was about the 1970s At that point I was already upset and I said just give me the room that I paid for I believe it was room 1216 Upon entering the room the carpet was stained the windows open mold on the windows bedding covered in dust I closed the window due to the dust and then smelled vomit at which point I felt physically ill my husband and I said this was unacceptable and went back to reception We went back to reception and spoke to another desk member which we explained the upset that this was causing us and I was almost in tears as I was so distressed having just arrived here expecting a reputable hotel to be better than this Julian another member of staff overheard us as he was checking out another guest and advised the colleague to upgrade us to the newly refurbished room We thanked him and told him to check the room out that they originally assigned us as no one should have to sleep in those conditions ,No Positive
112460,Hilton London Metropole, Firstly the glass table wasn t fixed to the base it fell off cut 2 of my toes very badly at about 2am in the morning The fact that when I was checking out the lady on reception was more concerned about the table rather than my safety Appalling , The lay out of downstairs the bar area The cleanliness of the room as I work in the facilities business 
112461,Hilton London Metropole, I arrived around 13 00 They made me wait until 17 00 to Check in because room wasnt ready Furnitur is old Bed Not comfortabl Double glass but still noisy, All Staff nice attitude and smiling reception housekeeping resturant good location clean nice Breakfast

112463,Hilton London Metropole, The room was awful and very dated This hotel should not be rated as a 4 More like 2 3 , The staff in the bar downstairs on ground floor were very efficient and helpful
112464,Hilton London Metropole, So me and my girlfriend both 18 arrived at the hotel I booked us a King Room When we arrived at our room the bed was smaller than the average double bed even though it s supposed to be a king and the carpets were stained everywhere The view was terrible and the TV said that it was going to be HD and 40 but that didn t happen The TV we were given was not HD atall and it certainly wasn t 40 So I went down to reception to complain and ask for us to be moved to a king sized room once I asked them that they obviously realised that they had put us in a standard double room I mean it could have been a simple mistake but it definatly didn t feel like one It felt like the members of staff had just seen 2 teens coming for a romantic night in a hotel so they thought they would give us a terrible room It was disgusting and I don t undertstand why they would feel the need to place us in a worse room than what I had paid for Like we pay the same as everyone else so why not treat us the same Just because we may be younger than your usual guests Anyway once we got given the room we eventually paid for it was exactly what it said on the tin except the view could have been a bit better , The location was perfect Right up the road from Oxford street and Hyde park Metro station right across the road too 
112465,Hilton London Metropole, not co operation expensive i waited for 7 hours without my luggage in temporary room without any appreciation or apologize or compensation , location clean Wifi

112467,Hilton London Metropole, The staff are big time thieves I had checked in and they need by credit card for pre authorisation the following day I get three payments through the same credit card totaling 2000 pounds Upon informing the manager in charge she never came back to us she just threw our issue away, The location is excellent
112468,Hilton London Metropole, Our room was quite small and felt slightly cramped Mattress felt too firm and bedding not soft enough for a hotel of this calibre, Wonderful choice of food and drink Very spacious beautifully decorated and comfortable lobby ATM facility and shops Quick and simple self checkout procedure Short taxi ride to several big attractions including the gorgeous Regent s Park
112469,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, Great to have a mini bar as not all hotels have this Easily accessible to many of the touristy spots Madame Tussauds was just one stop away on the tube My children particularly liked our early morning swim at the leisure club on the 2nd floor Good choice overall from the 100 s on offer from this site 
112470,Hilton London Metropole, Just my brother s bed was making noise even it was an executive room , Daniel at reception very nice guy Unfortunately we heard he is leaving but he really made our day and very welcoming which is rare to see specially with British people 
112471,Hilton London Metropole, The toilets in the main hotel I have to say were disgusting , As family room not available we were upgraded which was a very good gesture Nd thoroughly enjoyed 
112472,Hilton London Metropole, I was at 16th floor and I can still hear the noise of the street especially the police siren Room size doesn t worth the money that I paid for ,No Positive
112473,Hilton London Metropole, At breakfast time we were just shown to table and nothing was explained regarding breakfast as in how to order hot drinks and seemed a bit caiotic with people pushing in etc , Everything was lovely which helped celebrate our wedding anniversary 
112474,Hilton London Metropole, The shower was a bit dirty when we arrived, They provide us a baby crib and the reception lady I think her name was laura was extra nice The stuff were friendly The breakfast was ok It was comfy stay with 9 months toddler 
112475,Hilton London Metropole, Aircondition not working They gave us a fan and refused to give another room and the temperatur was 30 celcious we could not sleep , The locatio is good as near tube station 
112476,Hilton London Metropole, I did not like the welcoming also I got my room around 4 30 which should be at 3 00 pm Then when i did the check out I asked for one hour as late check out they didn t accept my request , I like the shops which is inside the hotel also there is a Starbucks 
112477,Hilton London Metropole, The staff at reception were so bad and I checked in my room after 3 and my husband would come at 4 I need to prepare my room, I like the location and the clean our rooms
112478,Hilton London Metropole, The old room on the 5th floor are terrible and not price worthe it Howcome its the same pruce for ghe new renovated room on the 15 th floor, The new room on 15 floor is excellent however the one on 5 floor was terrible How come is the price for both is the same My rating based on the new rooms on 15 floor My rating for 5 floor would be terrible and very bad
112479,Hilton London Metropole, The paid wi fi and some facilities missed like tooth brush and tooth paste slippers vanity kit We had to order them The late check out is only one hour after 12 00 pm, The breakfast was great The best ever wonderful Location helpful staff

112482,Hilton London Metropole, Bad organised I checked in at 3pm as my original plan but my room was not ready the staff said would call me when the room is ready but she did not when I came back in the second time the reception gave me a room whichsomeone already occupied Need to pay for the wifi and it is expensive and not value for money The gym is tiny there are no enough facilities there , As the Edgware station is about 5mins walk from the hotel it is very convenient to visiting diffrient attractions and such as V A st Paul cathedral house of palament Some staff are friendly and helpful breakfast and service of guest relation are decent The compensation is fair 
112483,Hilton London Metropole, The room was extremely bare no luxuries or the usual items you would expect to be provided We also had to pay for breakfast which was expensive, The staff were lovely aas usual and the breakfast was delicious diverse clientele felt like being abroad good facilities
112484,Hilton London Metropole, Nothing, It was our honeymoon and our daughter ordered us wine and strawberries and we were given an upgrade it was amazing the view was stunning it made our honeymoon and the hotel was brilliant as usual

112486,Hilton London Metropole, No net curtains on a window overlooked by numerous windows Necessarily curtains remained drawn during daylight hours , We did appreciate the helpfulness neat appearance and friendliness of the staff The reason for the less than perfect score was that a tin of drink had been taken from the minibar by a staff member who else had access to the room and the charge was added to our invoice With the use of the Executive Lounge in the same corridor we felt no desire for any more soft drinks Our word was accepted at the check out desk 
112487,Hilton London Metropole, No one staff to check if all was okay or not The ac should have been on before I got there or soon after I had never sweated so much as I did in my first night stay You are on your own in the hotel Cleaners cant clean even after drawing their attention to the issue Worst hotel experience ever Made worse as it was my birthday treat to myself Waste of my money and my time Total Rubbish , The Location was ideal for where I wanted to be
112488,Hilton London Metropole, The health club is very average and the access through the changing room is awful , Hospitality of the staff Mohammed at the breakfast restaurant was just too good 
112489,Hilton London Metropole, It s expensive like all London rooms I paid 170 for a family room for one night I have just paid similar in the past and got a much better room This price didn t include breakfast either Breakfast is about 18 pounds and children breakfast for free I have stayed for example at Mal Maison for just under 200 pounds and this was inclusive of breakfast This hotel just wasn t as clean Our room really smelt of smoke even though it was a non smoking room It had three single beds which is what we wanted but I suspect some people have used it as a party room Also the room was a little bit tired shabby There was an old stain on the carpet and the bathroom needs a bit of an update The hairdryer was broken and had a bit of sellotape holding it together Don t get me wrong it was ok It s just 170 is a lot of money for one night in a hotel It really is I understand London is also expensive However I ve come to expect more for my money and you can get better than this for 170 200 for sure , Location is great Staff v very friendly and great with kids 
112490,Hilton London Metropole, I don t like Edgware Road at all But I have to book because I have meeting , Very friendly staff but try to avoid the blonde lady because at resection desk
112491,Hilton London Metropole, The front desk staff were not welcoming The toilett and the showers need maintainance and renovation The air condition is not efficient, The breakfast was excellent and the restaurant staff were amazing
112492,Hilton London Metropole, Nothing, I like that now they have studio suites with full kitchen that enables us cook light meals of our choice although there are plenty of restaurants surrounding the hotel plus room service 
112493,Hilton London Metropole, No breakfast included in the price I think 200 per night should include breakfast It seems your pricing is for wealthy overseas visitors, Staff helpfull and friendly
112494,Hilton London Metropole, Room not available on arrival at 8pm big mix up with rooms alloacated had to complain to the manager and as a result have also writte to the General Manager of the Metropole yesterday , The staff were extremely pleasant bed was comfortable 
112495,Hilton London Metropole, Ilthe room was very run down not worth the money it was very small and apparently we were upgraded to deluxe I would hate to think what a standard room was like even the toilet paper was so cheap and thin and I never complain about anything but will not stay here again if I can help it,No Positive
112496,Hilton London Metropole, We were so excited for this trip as it was our son s first time in London When we arrived we went to the check in desk and were told that the room we had booked didn t allow more than 2 people even though I had a confirmation email that said under 18 year olds were free of charge as long as they used existing beds I also contacted the hotel after I booked online to double check this was ok and they confirmed it was After travelling for a few hours this was the last thing we needed and it took a while at reception to sort out as the reception was so busy It put a real damper on the start of our trip The receptionist was not very friendly and advised us we would have to take it up with bookings com to which I was totally shocked and really disappointed at the customer service The receptionist then advised us we needed to speak to a supervisor but as no one was available and the queue was getting longer she ended up giving us the room we had booked Not a great start to our trip and even more disappointing as we travelled with a party and the rest of the party stayed in the ME hotel but we thought we would give the Hilton a try after hearing good reviews we were disappointed to say the least It was also my husbands 35th birthday the day after we checked in which was the purpose of the trip and I made a request when I booked the hotel to let the hotel know it was his bday so that they could maybe do something special as i had read they do this in the reviews When we woke up the next day nothing had been arranged and when I spoke to reception they told me no request had been recorded and that it was too late to do anything now This was really disappointing as I was really looking forward to my husband being surprised and making our trip that little bit more special but all it was was a huge disappointment I spoke to guest relations to inform them of this but they didn t seem interested , The hotel itself was really lovely food was lovely in the restaurant too 
112497,Hilton London Metropole, Staff not good does not worth the money we paid for it not recommended breakfast very crowded you had to wait for long time to be seated staff very bad they must change compelet crow, No thing
112498,Hilton London Metropole, The complete lack of transparency of this hotel and it s policies and it s staff I ve never seen in all my trips and hotel stays a hotel that takes a pathetic deposit at checkin to then only start taking money during night shifts from my card without my authorisation because to their own admission they want to make sure people don t leave without paying This is truly lame Not ever heard of pre approval To not mention the IMPOSSIBILITY to have in the room fridge any drinks as its their policy apparently to not service tower rooms with that Another incredible one was second evening the shower was and remained cold Impossible to do shower Attitude of staff not fit for a Hilton If you want to save yourself grief DO NOT BOOK HERE , Nothing Has genuinely ruined our 2 day London trip I had to argue on both mornings and on the day of checkout 
112499,Hilton London Metropole, Concierge needs to relfect on all guests needs not just the more affluent, The front of house staff were simply amazing Housekeeping brilliant and room service excellent

112501,Hilton London Metropole, this time we staid we didn t bother with adding breakfast to our package breakfast here is so so busy and ques and London has such great cafes and coffee shops there is a Pret a Manger 5m outside the door of the hotel your choice apart from that nothing bad to say , perfect location you couldn t get any better 15min walk to Hyde Park Oxford Street etc Paid a little extra for one of the newly refurbished rooms in the Tower wing of the hotel REALLY WORTH THE UPGRADE stayed in the old rooms last year and they are a bit tired but the new suite is really really nice Good internet too very clean perfect Make sure you visit the Windsor Castle Pub 5 minutes walk away from the hotel for a real British pint of beer lovely staff the real pub experience 
112502,Hilton London Metropole, No free wifi Poor breakfast menus It s the same every day The egg cooking man in the restaurant dealing in a very bad way and he is suitable for non stars hotel not to Helton, Location is ok 
112503,Hilton London Metropole, One lady in reception was not helpful they thought all Arab are stupid or they don t know nothing they treat as like nothing but I did argue with her so I want to send msg to her treat people as u want to be treated don t be silly , I like the location and the breakfast 
112504,Hilton London Metropole, If we had a dislike it was the young children running around the hotel with total disregard for others An example of this was a young lad riding a scooter between tables in the bar or jumping onto furniture with his shoes on etc This could well have lead to an unfortunate accident or incident when no doubt the parents would blame the staff or other guests However this is a fault of poor parenting rather than members of staff or hotel , The restaurant was comfortable The staff friendly The food was very good and reasonable priced
112505,Hilton London Metropole, Room fixture were old Shower had not enough water pressure Concierge were overworked and were cranky when asked for help Business centre was closed and didnt find any notification for the same Most importantly WIFI was only free when I book through Hilton website only The management should reconsider this given the digital age we are in All other hotels were offering free WIFI , Very good location and a spacious room don t find many like these in London Swimming pool was small but nice and the breakfast had all sorts of variety and was nice The hotel lobby and corridors are wide and you feel relaxed Large lobby area and easy access to tube 
112506,Hilton London Metropole, I hate to say this because they are amazing people but the staff couldn t get our breakfast right I blame the management because they had just one person doing room service breakfast everyday Our food came cold every morning n got orders wrong The pressure for whoever was working at that time was way too much But the management could do much better by getting extra helping hand , Newly built so everything looks amazing The rooms were amazing especially the bathroom I didn t want to leave amazing space and the best part was my babies cot bed 
112507,Hilton London Metropole, Nothing, Good location near underground station near Oxford edqawa road alot of Arabic resturants with good food Excellent staff I like lobby of hotel Actually first night for us air cndition not work they provide us by fan The manager try his best to find another room that night but hotel was full As result he upgrade us to superio twin rom which almost double size of our room from tomorrow Thanks Hilton manager for Your help and understanding

112509,Hilton London Metropole, Not good value of money Parking is charged extra plus the hotel does not provide complimentary water bottles which even a 3 star facility does , Location
112510,Hilton London Metropole, Shower wasn t as good as I expected TV had crap signal Windows where dirty Decor was old Looking at the entrance off the lobbie I thought the rooms must be top notch but was a let down, Bed was comfy room was cosy
112511,Hilton London Metropole, The breakfast in the restaurant was crowded with long lines to access chef preparing eggs I wasn t treated as a Hilton Honors gold guest because I didn t book directly via hotel Marriott is much more guest member friendly Very disappointing , The bed was very comfortable 
112512,Hilton London Metropole, The room we got given was very dirty a lot of dust and wallpaper coming off the walls The curtains had stains on them and the bath shower was falling apart The hallways near the room also had rubbish on the floor I have stayed in a lot of budget hotels in the last few years which were very clean and modern while this hotel wasn t worth the money paid at all and I will definitely not be going back , The swimming pool sauna steam room and the gym was very nice and clean The welcome by staff in reception was also very good 
112513,Hilton London Metropole, I was not over pleased with the room I was in one of the bedside lamp shades looked liked it had dried blood stains on it The wall paper under the window was peeling away and the bath was dirty on the base of it , The staff were nice also the reception and restaurants were nice
112514,Hilton London Metropole, Beds were big however the mattress very noisy and springs in the mattress were making noises with the slightest of movements Bathroom shower top was leaking and looked dirty,No Positive
112515,Hilton London Metropole, The room was dated there wasn t anything in the bar fridge and the fridge wasn t working and expected something a lot better for what we paid to stay, There was not a lot to like would have liked to be in the new section to judge our stay
112516,Hilton London Metropole, The fact the hotel charge your bank 30 pound per night just incase Took around 7 days to get the fees back Also getting charged drinks to our room when we said it wasn t ours had to wait around 20 mins at check out so they could do research into it , Went to watch wimbledon and the location was fantastic
112517,Hilton London Metropole, The room is tiny and I like a really hot shower probably hotter than most and the water although hot didn t go up as high as I like Feather pillows quite flat , The staff and facilities were great 
112518,Hilton London Metropole, Was in tired room albeit clean and was asked if wanted to upgrade to newer at an additional to an already high tarriff Also no internet to room unless paid addition fee , Was very clean the public areas very good
112519,Hilton London Metropole, Restaurant on floor 23 wasn t open for drinks after being told it was 10 charge added to the drinks of which we felt were already at the highest price and to expensive to eat in restaurants at night, Staff very helpful and friendly nothing was to much breakfast was also very good
112520,Hilton London Metropole, When I booked they gave me a room which you could hardly rate it 2 star Smell of tobacco had remained in curtains and carpet They gave me worse room just because I had not book directly through hotel When I asked to change the room they did but again very uncomfirtsble bed and noisy was close to lift and neighbors were slamming the door all the time I did not sleep at all I am not a rich man from gulf countries who carries lots of 50 notes with me i work so hard to get a treat like that The reason I booked the hotel was to have a good rest as I had a appointment in the nearby hospital the mini bar was left emty so no water at night to drink , Location wise was good
112521,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, I had a serous accident 3 days prior to my booking I was on crutches and suffering badly The staff hopped to my aid with a wheelchair and up graded me to a handicap room Thank you to every one concerned From the door man to the checkin staff I will defiantly return 
112522,Hilton London Metropole, However the rooms on the 6th Floor in the Tower building do not match the style and decor of the rest of the hotel and are very disappointing Very old dated and in need of a good make over , Location was close to Edgware Road underground Reception restaurant and bar area very impressive Breakfast was excellent with lots of variety for everyone 
112523,Hilton London Metropole, The rooms were not up to standard very small and dull After upgrading at a pricy cost they were average I was promised access to the executive lounge and was not allowed in and the staff member was rude The plates at breakfast were dirty Overall a bad experience and will not recommend to anyone else , The location was good 
112524,Hilton London Metropole, Staff service very poor Bad on reception Got asked for my passport despite obviously being a UK citizen Received no help trying to get a taxi outside The hotel was too impersonal and overcrowded , Restaurants bars coffee shops all good
112525,Hilton London Metropole, No one seemed to know which end to queue for breakfast bit of a scrum breakfast was good just the barging in and people walking in wrong directions Room toilet had a funny smell not sure if it was the disinfectant or where floor has got wet don t get me wrong room very clean just this smell that hits you as soon as you walk in the room, Staff friendly food good really nice hotel in good location
112526,Hilton London Metropole, The executive room and East wing were scruffy dated decor and not worth spending extra money on I wish I had booked a standard room and saved myself some money , The location gave great access to Hyde Park central London shopping and tourist attractions 
112527,Hilton London Metropole, The room was shameful It was smelly Shabbily done up Curtains falling apart No complimentary water bottle Nothing in the mini bar We had to leave immediately to find water for ourselves after a tiring journey Windows didn t open Torn and tattered sofas in the lobby No free wifi in the rooms however it states on the site that there is free wifi , Nothing
112528,Hilton London Metropole, They look like they re in the process of updating the facilities The lobby bar areas are very nice but the rooms look a little dated a bit of peeling wallpaper bathroom fixtures looked rusty Plus it was impossible to get the AC to work properly either too hot or too cold When they get the entire place renovated it will look very upscale but right now I was a little disappointed in the overall look of the rooms , Very friendly and accommodating staff I can t say enough about them We ended up having to stay there two separate times during our trip and they made that option very easy for us In house bars restaurants are very nice and definitely gave the hotel a trendy upscale look Made first stay in London very pleasant 
112529,Hilton London Metropole, The carpet was not vacuumed clean in the room on the two consecutive days we stayed there despite requesting the room to be re vacuumed on the day of arrival 50 night up scaling is a smart business idea but sloppy floor cleaning is not nor acceptable Far from picturesque views from the 9th floor window on the West Wing Seriously musty damp smell at the lift landing area on the 9th floor West Wing , Breakfast was OK staff were friendly and professional Express room based Checkout Great Idea 
112530,Hilton London Metropole, I have travelled to many countries and stayed in many different hotels Hilton Metropole will NOT be a hotel I stay in again We stayed there 5 nights and only after the third request and very frustrated they fixed the air condition in the room It was only the last night of our stay that we had a cool temperature in the room and were able to sleep last week average London temperature was 91 degree so you can imagine how uncomfortable we were Hallways were very dirty food from room service would stay there all day and carpets were not vacuumed regularly First night after a long flight we had to get 3 sets card keys replaced to be able to enter into our rooms We checked in at 5 and got into our rooms finally at 7 30 PM Good luck if you need the elevators some time the wait is 10 minutes or more I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANY ONE , I have to think hard to see what I actually liked about this hotel NOT MUCH 
112531,Hilton London Metropole, A 4 star hotel for a start, 1st room 804 was dark the paint was flaking on the wall and door jaum the wallpaper was lifting at the edges and the window faced a grey stone wall Upgraded to the 14th floor much better Being from Yorkshire I thought 17 for a gin and tonic and a white wine spritzer was taking the piss Every time I was in the lobby or bar someone was complaining about something
112532,Hilton London Metropole, So I shared my room with my friend On check out date she left early n forgot her bag I had to leave before 12 so I left the bag in the room so my friend could pick it before 12 She couldn t make it n I felt her bag was safe NO IT WASN T Security promise to call me on 4 occasions n never did Am so disappointed is such a shame, Nothing
112533,Hilton London Metropole, very kind and helpful staff EXCEPT those at the swimming pool they treated us and several others in an impolite and rude manner generally poor standard of rooms, location
112534,Hilton London Metropole, Everything fine would certainly stay here again and recommend to friends We met the ladies who cleaned are room 1404 and they were very friendly as were all the staff who we came into contact with , Although breakfast time very busy plenty of staff to help Excellent variety of food for all tastes Croissants were wonderful 
112535,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast was less choices and keep repeat everyday compare on what I expect on Hilton London to Hilton Asia Small is very old and small not on my expectation No shower cap cotton buds inside slipper and etc Cleaner is noisy when cleaning the other room , location was perfect and convinient
112536,Hilton London Metropole, Overall for The Hilton Group is a renowned hotelier however I found that the staff were pretty glum I got woken up by the room cleaner at 8 15am we were booked for checking out at 12 00am Generally very disappointed as I was celebrating our 20th wedding Anniversary and wanted some special treatment felt let down Had requested via a phone call before our arrival to the staff of the fact that a complimentary surprise for my wife would have been a good gesture but I had to remind the staff for that as well , The only thing I liked was the location 
112537,Hilton London Metropole, At almost 500 a night sorry not worth the money Nothing really wrong with the hotel but with so many great hotels in London no reason to come back to this one Its an overpriced 3 star hotel Clean bed and shower Nothing more ,No Positive
112538,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, The breakfast is always an attraction for me although expensive even with the vouchers that are available The staff are always very courteous and helpful 
112539,Hilton London Metropole, Paying 18 for breakfast each day on top of spending 236 per night for a room Outrageous Hearing the people next door at it from my room She was a load one German I think , Nice room
112540,Hilton London Metropole, Some facilities in the room was not functioning even after my complain nothing was done to rectify it eg refrigerator light, The location environment the food is excellent
112541,Hilton London Metropole, Room is too expensive small room in the eastwing for 380 , Staffs were lovely asked a member of staff who didn t look like a muslim to show me the direction for prayers and surprisingly he did

112547,Hilton London Metropole, Worst service ever Very small room Empty minibar for three days despite I asked to fill it as it should No shampoo And I aske for it Four calls and two hours wait to have a plug adaptor Unfriendly personnel Poor breakfast and overcrowded brekfast room Never again for 282 GBP doesn t worth this rate,No Positive
112548,Hilton London Metropole, Bed was very uncomfortable and the mattress far too small for the frame room smelt strongly of air freshener and overlooked a dumping area for old bits of metal , Good location 
112549,Hilton London Metropole, On arrival we were told our twin room was ready but upon entering the room and was clearly still occupied I returned to the check in desk and explained and I was given a room upgrade and use of the executive lounge Upon entering this room we noticed that we d been given a double room instead of the twin we d requested Went back down again and the guest relations desk rectified our room and moved our luggage so maybe the staff at check in just need to pay a little more attention to the types of room bookings , The staff at the hotel were excellent and nothing was too much trouble 
112550,Hilton London Metropole, Didn t get any sleep on a very poor quilty bed Every time you move it made a noise And making love was a no no Such a shame on what should of been a special weekend for me and my partner , Great staff and location 
112551,Hilton London Metropole, Even though we arrived after 4 pm our room wasn t ready It was very expensive for a fairly average king room no iron curtains weren t blackout , We were given bar vouchers to compensate for the hour wait for our room The wifi was good 
112552,Hilton London Metropole, Tried to check in twice and was unable to Got put into a smoking room eventually which was hot stuffy and as a non smoker the smell was really bad , The location was great easy access to Edgeware Road tube station and a 5 minute walk to Paddington
112553,Hilton London Metropole, The Deluxe suite was clean but could have been bit larger , Excellent Location Heart of Central London and 2 mins walk from Edgware Road station Good staff Good breakfast spread Clean rooms I was offered an upgraded Deluxe suite in the Tower building which was refurbished rooms 
112554,Hilton London Metropole, Pretty pricey but that s to expect from like London Need to use the underground to get to most places Wished we had free wi Fi in our room , Great view from our room You can tell is was recently refurbished new and clean on our floor room Enjoyed the drinks at the bar and Starbucks in the hotel Underground station just meters from the hotel Friendly and helpful staff 
112555,Hilton London Metropole, The breakfast was ok there weren t many choices for vegetarians The room service was also poor It took them 1 hour to supply the coffee which we ordered One of the cleaning lady didn t clean the room properly , The beds were very comfortable The location was good and close to edge ware station 
112556,Hilton London Metropole, Mattress is too old and springy Not suitable for my age of above 50 Had backache the next day , Hotel with the most friendly reception staff Made you feel welcome and relax 
112557,Hilton London Metropole, The reception was not very sure if the check in would be possible at 15 00hrs and said there was a maintenance problem In fact I had made a request for an early checkin and possibly that s why the receptionist responded this way as she may not have wanted to the raise expectations However this had the negative effect of getting us upset having arrived in the hotel around 12 00,No Positive
112558,Hilton London Metropole, The room was a bit dated and small for the price Lots of doors slamming from 7am and thin walls so could hear the neighbours talking until late Wifi not free Despite arranging late checkout the cleaners knocked on the door repeatedly trying to hurry us out , Location was brilliant Room had everything we needed big bed bath and blackout curtains Very friendly and helpful staff 
112559,Hilton London Metropole, Extremely large hotel practically 3 hotels in one Breakfast area was crowded and not relaxing , Very large comfy room No card operated elevator for once Very central location in Paddington 
112560,Hilton London Metropole, If there was a separate bathtub and shower that goes with the upgrade , The room was comfortable but we had to do an upgrade to a refurbished room with a nice view 
112561,Hilton London Metropole, We had two rooms and one was much nicer than the other different prices though Also billed for items from mini fridge that we didn t have Had to go to reception to get these removed from the bill , The beds were very comfortable Nice quiet neighbourhood 
112562,Hilton London Metropole, Room was small Bed too hard was noisy in the morning with doors slamming from 7am and breakfast was very average sausages looked anemic , Location and facilities
112563,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel is very old there are different buildings and we were located in the Tower building which I can only assume was the oldest of them all The room smelled awful and the bathroom was even worse It was rusty and had this really bad smell in it The beds were not comfortable and there was only one working power outlet in the room There are No lights in the bedroom except for the nightstand lights so it was annoying having to always open those especially during the day since our windows didn t bring In a lot of light because we had the Hilton building blocking any light that could come in The air conditioning was also very ancient the room could either be freezing or just too hot They definitively need to renovate and upgrade all the rooms found in the tower building WIfi I have stayed at many hotels in my life seldom I find a hotel that charges its customers for wifi Especially in a 4 5 star hotel And Especially in 2016 What a huge inconvenience When you pay 150euros per night one would expect wifi to be free Oh and there is an additional charge for breakfast Everything was an extra charge I think Hilton can do a lot more when it comes to their customers having a nice stay at ther hotel I was talking about how horrible the rooms were with my friends and some customer staying on the same floor as us were all agreeing with our comments So I know I was not the only one Which leads me to conclude that I will not be staying here ever again and will NOT be recommending this hotel to anyone I know Definitively NOT worth it And I would suggest if others can find a hotel at almost the same price go to that one and stay away from this Hilton hotel , The staff working at the reception were exceptional and very nice Location is next to Paddington Station which is Ok coming from Heathrow airport And next to Edgware tube stop 
112564,Hilton London Metropole, Wifi conection in the room is by charge very poor or no conection even being honor member cramp and small if you chose standard room not expected , Location housing service 
112565,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms were small old and tacky Toilets seemed dirty as they were so stained Room was on 21st floor so the smell of fish coming from the restaurant on the 23rd floor was unbearable Bed was squeaky matress cover was stained and the whole ambience of the room was dark and old , Receptionist did her best to help us 
112566,Hilton London Metropole, The cleaner didn t take our cups and saucers for new ones But that s about it really , We got a free upgrade when I was checking in The staff were amazing All the little things like carrying your bags to your room is gone and you instantly felt more relaxed 
112567,Hilton London Metropole, Didn t like the roll out bed Booked a Queen family room with two dedicated beds and got upgraded to a King with a roll out bed Didn t feel like an upgrade and not very comfortable for the third person , Very pleasant and helpful staff Good Location Good hotel

112570,Hilton London Metropole, No usable power plugs in the room Most sockets had some weird round three prong system presumably to avoid being used for anythin else This is 2016 we all have a mobile phone to plug in come on The bed was very creaky and not that comfortable Bathroom is too small had to manoeuver around the tiny space which is where the door opens where you get out of the bath shower and where you use the sink , High quality hotel Lots of staff readily available to help advise and generally sort out your stay Lots of different places to hang out lobby bar sports bar whisky bar etc The breakfast was fantastic A huge buffet with all sorts of hot dishes cook to order eggs wide selection of breads juices fruits etc 
112571,Hilton London Metropole, No free wifi Bathrooms are not clean enough Ice machine does not work there is one on each level s lobby , Easy check in out Comfort bed and great view 
112572,Hilton London Metropole, Did not like to be charged 13 pounds to have wifi in the room there was free wifi in the public areas near the bars but hey This is the 21st century Also our twin room was tiny Ask about room size before you book if this is important to you , One of the best breakfast buffets I have ever seen complete with custom made eggs or omelets Excellent pool and fitness room The concierge services are top notch and the distance to the Edgware Underground very convenient 
112573,Hilton London Metropole, The check in process took long time We ask to empty the minibar since day one and keep it thats way but every morning they refil it and charge my credit card when i complain they said they will refund the money after check out and every morning they do the same its like new staff or am a new guest Friendly advice choose a lower levels and near to the eleveator cause this Hotel is Massive , I loved the hotel and i will comeback again

112575,Hilton London Metropole, Nothing Breakfast a little expensive but to be expected in Central London and there were lots of other places locally , Great location great view from room comfy beds and very clean Handy taxi rank outside Bar in the downstairs lobby provided a welcoming buzzy vibe on a Saturday night V close to Edgware Road tube station and a good sized M S 
112576,Hilton London Metropole, Totally commercial hotel due to its huge size and you don t feel welcomed or served with good hospitality None of the entire staff has smile on their face , Location wise okay as well as the room comfort
112577,Hilton London Metropole, The AC heating was not working properly so the room was very cold There was periodically a gurgling noise coming from the shower drain , Room was clean Staff responded quickly 
112578,Hilton London Metropole, TV in room would not work at all after our first day Wifi situation wasn t good however it sort of made us enjoy our holiday more as we weren t constantly on our phones due to not having internet Also the road the hotel was on was intimidating at night time We were a group of girls and were subject to a huge amount frightening verbal sexual harassment upon walking down Edgeware Road after dark , Rooms were beautiful and spacious Lovely complimentary toiletries Lobby area had a good atmosphere and was very classy All staff were courteous and treated the customer as if they were their too priority Breakfast was delicious so much choice Khris and Jason on the night shift were so friendly when we came home late each night two great staff members Such a central location so nice not to have to walk far at all after coming off the tube at Edgeware Road station 
112579,Hilton London Metropole, Its awful when you go to the trouble to take swim wear find the pool and get there at the right times only to find that half the pool is cordoned off for one child to have a swimming lesson while the other half resembles the London underground in a rush hour , Loved that it was so near to Paddington station and the underground We also loved that it had a swimming pool The rooms were well cleaned each day with a fresh supply of toiletries and drink sundries We arrived a little early but were checked in straight away which was lovely as we were then free to enjoy our stay in London 
112580,Hilton London Metropole, The minibar was empty and did not work as fridge how is it possible to call a room King Deluxe and not have a fridge I only received 2 water bottles for the entire stay The elevator motor sound in the room close to the elevator on 21st floor room 2104 was very disturbing ,No Positive
112581,Hilton London Metropole, After an enjoyable stay six months ago i booked again but found shabby mouldy bathroom and dated decor completely opposite to previous visit Same price , Pretty good wifi and TV

112583,Hilton London Metropole, Changing room in pool need updating Deep clean and no locks on changing lockers Spin dryers required for swim costumes , Central location Friendliness of staff Comfortable bed and reasonable size room for London

112686,Hilton London Metropole, Parking is very expensive and definitely could be cheaper especially when you are paying the rates you do to stay at the hotel Although parking in London as a whole could be quite expensive The room we were in on the 10th floor of the east wing was quite noisy with a strange sound through the night close to the sound of a washing machine , The rooms were comfortable and adequate for a short stay The executive lounge was great very comfortable and welcoming with a range of refreshments The staff were very friendly and helpful if you needed anything 
112687,Hilton London Metropole, Booked two family rooms at one booking but surprise me they didn t book us in a connected room We have 3 adults and 3 child but have to stay in a non connected room Booked 2 nights and paid 965 Not cheap but would expected a connected twin family room , Great location amazing buffet breakfast friendly staff 
112688,Hilton London Metropole, I was located in room 2913 in the Tower There is defiantly the need for a refurbishment Even the layout of the room and the corridors they are NOT Hilton standard I would have expected much better from a Hilton The common areas such as the reception area and restaurant were vey up to standard though However the pictures on booking com did also include the kind of room that I was in and therefore I was not surprised with the outcome , The main areas such as reception and restaurant Breakfast was fine Rooms are clean Good Location
112689,Hilton London Metropole, Mouldy fruit in fridge No hairdryer Had to call down for one Got charged for mini bar I didn t take Lift noise kept me awake all night , Location close to tube
112690,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast selection of breads poor and the same foods in the cooked section were not available every day eg mushrooms , Availability off food late evening It was generally a good hotel 
112691,Hilton London Metropole, We had to use two different lifts and corridors to get to the pool The receptionist was hard to understand as her first language clearly was not English A very busy hotel The maid walked in as I came out the shower knocking as she opened the door at 8 17 am , Clean spacious rooms 
112692,Hilton London Metropole, Didn t like the fact that they gave us an internet code and said it was free and at then of a 2 day stay made us pay 2 13 00 For this fact will not be returning to this hotel , Everything
112693,Hilton London Metropole, The room had carpeted floors which is so old fashioned and unhygienic The hotel is located in a quite shady area of the city so anything you want to do during the day or evening you need to take the bus closer to the city which however is only 5 mins away by bus , We are a Swedish family who were in London for Easter holiday 2016 We stayed in a double room with 2 queen size beds which were just right for our family with two adults and two children The bathroom was a good size with a bath tub Nice products in bathroom too Kettle with coffee tea in the room and two good sized closets The hotel is located close to subway and many buses which take you quickly to the city area The staff cleaned the room quickly in the morning which is definitely a big plus since sometimes we came back to the hotel early afternoon The front desk staff was very nice too 
112694,Hilton London Metropole, Cleaners left our used room service tray in the room when they cleaned It was still there when we checked out , The room was beautifully decorated and very clean with a fridge which allowed us to have milk for our tea The bathroom was beautiful 
112695,Hilton London Metropole, the prices for food was over priced would have liked breakfast included in the price wi fi was only free in the lobby Ice machine in hallway was empty we only had 1 dressing gown 1 pair of slippers 2 towels between 3 when we rang reception we were told that the hotel was busy that there was not enough to go round we did get more towels thank goodness , This was the first time I actually got to spend some time in London to explore it the hotel was great if just a little out of the way but great underground connections to get to everywhere we wanted to go the staff were extremely helpful full of knowledge which really helped great value for money I booked it early was delighted with the price as I knew we would be up out early back late was on the 13th floor in the west wing beds made everyday 
112696,Hilton London Metropole, The breakfast room was very crowded perhaps a second breakfast room would be a good idea The breakfast however was very good with lots of food choices 35 per night for a rollaway bed for a little child is too expensive The climate control in the room 1365 could have been better , The lounge bar was very good and the staff there were very efficient and friendly The barman waiter who served us went out of his way to accommodate us and our children The pool was a bonus for us with children All hotel staff were helpful 
112697,Hilton London Metropole, The room was dirty and small they don t Tell me that money loocked for caution will be looked for 10 days when i come back in italy This is no good ,No Positive
112698,Hilton London Metropole, Due to location I think there was an incessant almost foghorn shiphorn it sounded like going off all day and most of the night every few seconds or so Audible from our room in the tower wing Upon looking out there were a few building yards so assume it was as a result of one of those This was tolerable as we had a short stay Longer than a few nights would have driven me mad Also with regards to location fair walking distance to main attractions in the city which leaves options of taxi tube bus all at a cost , The bed was a large size and extremely comfortable Staff were very friendly and helpful Great facilities restaurants and bars and shops 
112699,Hilton London Metropole, The beds were pretty uncomfortable and the pool too crowded With children The breakfast was ok The only thumbs up is for the location The stars Are calculated and not given by me Max 2,No Positive

112701,Hilton London Metropole, There s a few things The shower head was constantly falling off and the first time bruising my foot quite painfully The swimming pool was constantly full so we didn t bother using it in the end which was a shame as that s one of the reasons we booked that hotel We were told check out was at 12 on the day of departing yet we had the cleaners walking in at 9 30am and then cane back at 10 Felt a little rushed to leave The room being a Hilton was disappointing My friend and I thought we d have some luxury but as it stands I think I ve had more luxury staying at a holiday inn , The breakfast was amazing and the beds really comfortable Location also handy for a short break to the city 
112702,Hilton London Metropole, Very busy at breakfast we got a table quickly but it was a bit of a scrum at the buffet , Location is excellent and staff were really friendly and hard working Room was comfortable with controllable heating Comfortable bed and quiet no noise from traffic or other guests We were away on a birthday trip and really appreciated the little birthday cakes left in our room 
112703,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel overall is good We stayed many times before This time though it was a terrible experience The room was freezing cold because the heating was not working The last thing we wanted at 1 o clock in the morning was the engineer messing about for half an hour to try and fix the heating while we were waiting for extra blankets to arrive Not happy at all And at 149 for one night it wouldn t have broken your bank to throw breakfast in the deal I mean how much does it cost for a couple of eggs and two pieces of toast and a couple of sausages then the day we were leaving we were back in time at the hotel to make sure that we did not overstay at the car park so we wouldn t have to pay for an extra day s parking Alas after waiting for a good ten minutes to be served we were told that there was only one attendant that would accept cash As that particular cashier was very busy dealing with a problem customer I decided to make my way to the other side of the hotel where I was told that there is a machine that accepts cash only to find when I got there that it was out of order So back I trek to the reception desks where to my shock I found that your cashier was still dealing with the problem customer and needless to say by the time we got to pay we were past the 24hour special weekend rate and ended up paying more Not a pleasant stay at all We won t be returning any time soon ,No Positive
112704,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, Excellent staff service and facilities Great views from the room onto many of London s major landmarks Fantastic food and cocktails from The Edg bar

112706,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms more like a 3 star Very dated and basic Not enough tea and coffee facilities Two tea bags to last 24 hours We ended up sharing tea bags Not good , Welcoming hotel Very impressive 4 star main lobby etc 
112707,Hilton London Metropole, Simple things such as only 1 teabag each in the room The toiletries were miniscule 12 5 service charge was added to everything Wi Fi was an additional cost Breakfast was a bun fight too crowded too noisy and staff overworked The room itself could benefit from some TLC , The hotel is opposite Edgware Road Underground which is only one stop from Paddington also the Bakerloo Line took us to all the places we were visiting 
112708,Hilton London Metropole, The room was very basic and very cold everytime I turned the heating up after 5minutes it would automatically go bk down A bad draft coming from the Windows all night with no spare blankets in the room,No Positive

112711,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, The hotel was of close proximity to the main attractions in London such as Oxford street and large shops The staff are rather helpful with any requests we had and the breakfast is rather enjoyable 
112712,Hilton London Metropole, Cleanliness of room disgusting Decoration of room disgusting and falling off walls Hotel staff attitude terrible no help with changing room etc, Nothing we liked experience was terrible
112713,Hilton London Metropole, I booked 3 rooms The 2 twin rooms were perfect but the triple room was dirty smelly and my friends had to be moved which was not ideal at 23 00 , Great breakfast 
112714,Hilton London Metropole, Run down out of date and beds that could be newer Minibar empty upon arriving and then filled up but items missing Too busy during breakfast , Very nice bar with a wide variety of whisky from all over the world Very friendly staff at the bar reception and the sport bar 
112715,Hilton London Metropole, The room was a queen deluxe room with king size bed this is a small room and a double bed Advert was misleading Terrible noise every 1 minute or so apparently which woke me at 08 45 and spoiled my unpacking at 17 20 Have stayed here twice now but will look elsewhere for another time rather than this disappointment again , ease of access to local area Excellent facilities
112716,Hilton London Metropole, The room was ok but big stain on carpet I also got bitten several times in bed Very noisy hardly slept a wink , Great location staff were very nice 
112717,Hilton London Metropole, We were there 3 nights and the room cleaners didn t do a particularly good job each day , Large hotel with all the facilities required in a pretty central place We had executive lounge access which was excellent value for money 
112718,Hilton London Metropole, missing hairdrying in the room old forniture no complementary water in the room usually present in this kind of hotel value for money poor,No Positive
112719,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, No hot waterin the morning due to a boiler failure The tv didnt work due vti a power cut The battery in the safe failed meaning i couldnt access my valuables until a maintenance engineer was called Breakfast was in a temporary facility using the conference centre ballroom Not what you would expect from this class of hotel but I did negotiate a small refund in view of all the problems i encountered 
112720,Hilton London Metropole, Pillows were too soft I couldn t work the air condition well, The suite that I had was really comfortable with an awesome view of the London Eye and the Shard The staff were very helpful and I felt really at home
112721,Hilton London Metropole, Fridge broken Brought new fridge but too noisy Pool could not be used as too much chlorine , Comfy beds good showers but a bit of a sqeeze for 3 adults We are good friends so all ok Nice steam room and sauna Helpful and pleasant staff Great to drop off bags and collect on Sunday evening to go to train Really great for the weekend as so easy for tube and Paddington We will book again 
112722,Hilton London Metropole, The room was too warm we struggled to turn the temperature down felt as though I was in a sauna, Great location if travelling by car breakfast was delicious
112723,Hilton London Metropole, There was no complimentary drinking water and no free wifi Was told by the receptionist that it was a new building but the room and toilet didn t look new Disappointed, Location
112724,Hilton London Metropole, The room was not clean or hygienic The room was also run down and the bathroom was a shambles It felt like I had brought my girlfriend to a cheap bed and breakfast ,No Positive
112725,Hilton London Metropole, terrible leisure facilities the hotel allowed a group of drunk men into the swimming pool the two guys that were suppose to be in charge just laughed me and my friend felt intimidated but the staff did nothing about it when i complain the man on reception didnt even apologise, lovely hotel bar
112726,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, Celebrating a birthday so we got upgraded to executive which was great as I am an ex employee of Hilton for 7 years it was great Breakfast as always was as always up to the Hilton standard
112727,Hilton London Metropole, I stayed in the hotel 1 month ago and stayed in the west wing but this time stayed in the tower wing on the 23rd floor which the view can t be faulted but the rooms are a little dated up there compared to the last room I stayed but ok, Location of the hotel is great short walk to underground
112728,Hilton London Metropole, Negative small inconvenient room old style bathroom no free wifi poor heating system noisy bathroom air refreshener, Positive close to underground and Paddington St big variety at breakfast
112729,Hilton London Metropole, Can t open windows in bedrooms Charges were opaque 26 charged for wifi across 2 rooms which we did not ask for or use Surcharges and up selling at front desk to get our rooms closer together and not very friendly , Clean good pool and facilities 
112730,Hilton London Metropole, The beds were awful our bed had a new mattress which was super but the base of the bed was diabolical just a hardwood hollow base which creaked and groaned every time we moved an inch This definitely needs attention There needs to be a note on the fridge telling you if you remove anything from the fridge a charge for the items will be placed on your bill even if you put them back in the fridge unused , The Reception Manager Aniruddh Mundra was very helpful The AC was super we were in the West Wing All the staff were polite and welcoming Good facilities in the hotel The cafe had charging facilities for laptops a great place to finish work instead of your room 
112731,Hilton London Metropole, I believe the problem started with Booking com who did not inform the hotel of our updated booking which caused chaos on arrival with 15 people to organise and the rooms all mixed up My daughters room was not clean my sisters room had sweet papers under the sheets and a shoe horn when she opened the bed she also had no cold water and her shower was broken We ordered afternoon tea as a special treat in advance as it was my two daugters 30th and 40th Birthdays advising that one person was gluten and wheat intolerant An hour and half later we were still waiting for this they said due to the fact they had to go out and buy special stuff even though it was pre ordered we cancelled in the end as the whole experience was ruined They also tried to say one stand of food with six finger sandwiches on it and cakes was for 6 people The same evening my sister asked if the chips were ok for her to eat they told you they did not know whether they contained gluten or wheat hopeless Also we paid in full on arrival yet the hotel used the bank details I gave Booking com and took 100 out of my account I am struggling to get this back as I write this This hotel for a Hilton hotel leaves a lot to be desired and improved , Close to a tube station nice breakfast
112732,Hilton London Metropole, Neighborhood is low class The room size and comfort does not meet Hilton standards It s old fashioned Bedroom is dirty , It s very close to underground Breakfast is satisfying 
112733,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, Our room was lovely and the beds were extremely comfortable Also staff were very attentive and made our sons 21st very special with complimentary gifts 
112734,Hilton London Metropole, Room is cold heating system is not adequate breakfast expensive TV channels in Arabic are limited and if there not the best , location and check in staff 
112735,Hilton London Metropole, Just a little bit further from the centre than we like but good transport links so not really a problem we would definitely go back, Truly sincere friendly and over and above service they made a mistake on our reservation and gave us a nice present to make up for it Good breakfast practical rooms clean modern good condition 
112736,Hilton London Metropole, For a four star hotel the rooms were very disappointing small in size terrible view of the poorly kept roof terraces bathrooms tiny and shower facilities very poor cheap looking shower curtain not what we would have expected for a four star , Location was good for acces routes to main attractions around London 
112737,Hilton London Metropole, size of the room Its like a matchbox , I like the location of this property It makes you accessible to almost everywhere in london Edgeware road and marblearch has alot of Halal restaurants around which is a plus point 
112738,Hilton London Metropole, Not much , Fantastic breakfast helpful staff clean lovely smelling room Great facilities and catered well for our 5 year old fab room service menu just be careful with the mini bar it charges you even if you accidentally knock a bottle over although reception were very accommodating AMD reversed the charge Will be booking again 
112739,Hilton London Metropole, The room was cold impossible to raise the temperature thanks god we didn t stay long There was no towels in the room when I complained we finally received very old towels pour quality There was neither soap nor shampoo and the maid in the morning woke us up at 8am although I didn t ask for it because it was the weekend and a second time at 5 past 8 When I opened the door to complain the maid was rude The area surrounding the hotel is not safe in the night and some of these people gathered in the loby Furthermore in the morning we saw an old man in pijama walking to the shop I expect this kind of hotel in Karachi not in London This Hotel is a disgrace for the name HILTON I will never go back there and definitely never recommend this hotel I have slept in pour quality hotels in Russia Bulgaria Poland and Romania before the perestroika but I knew what to expect But this there are no words to describe , The concierge was the only professional 
112740,Hilton London Metropole, I had problems getting the temperature of the room to stay at a comfortable level Also there was no shower cap provided among the amenities , The central location is very convenient for ease of travel around Londn 
112741,Hilton London Metropole, Housekeepers are entered into the room without taking any permission, It s very near of everything that tourists are searching for instance Oxford Street and restaurants and many different stations
112742,Hilton London Metropole, The rooms were pokey 1st room they gave us smelt like a fish market 2nd room smelt like an ash tray Hate complaining never do it But had to third room was ok But the staff weren t bothered I reckon as we booked through booking com No way they would treat Hilton bookers like that They decided to renovate the next door room at 8am Sun and Monday morning Noise was unbearable Very annoying Again staff didn t care said they needed to redecorate To be fair they got that right room was in need , Breakfast
112743,Hilton London Metropole, Some of our rooms were showing sign of age bathrooms had abit of mould Not really what you d expect from the Hilton , Great location excellent facilities reasonably priced Extremely helpful staff 
112744,Hilton London Metropole, Communication between Booking and the hotel I reserved a non smoking room with king size bed and got the choise between either arriving I dare say the beds were way too soft for a correct sleep and seemed outdated expecially for this kind of hotel After complaining twice got a room as expected , I liked the staff quite pleasant Nice rooms available but not all rooms are acceptable 
112745,Hilton London Metropole, Small dated room Room service took over 2 hours to arrive had to call to check No apologies for the delay On day of check out maid entered room 4 times from 8am 12 midday didn t even knock the door even tho we were told that checkout was at midday Renovations were happening on lower levels which we were told at check in and this would have been fine had the maid not have also woken us up 4 times , Good location near very close to the underground 
112746,Hilton London Metropole, Windows never opened there was a balcony but the door was locked phoned reception twice to send someone up to open it no one ever turned up , Great Location executive lounge access is really nice with breakfast which is amazing afternoon tea lovely salmon sandwiches and drinks in evening with a wonderful view The staff in the executive lounge are very friendly very accommodating
112747,Hilton London Metropole, For the cost I didn t like that breakfast wasn t included and to buy breakfast it was very expensive I also didn t like having to pay for a roll away cot for a 4 year old One morning we had no hot water , Staff was very nice and helpful Pool and sauna was a big hit with the family Close to the underground lots of restaurants 
112748,Hilton London Metropole, The smell in the corridors was terrible The beds was very bad Way too hard and the mattresses to thin After 2 days I had to go to a chiropractor ,No Positive
112749,Hilton London Metropole, The facilities are a bet old and the gym is small for the size of the hotel , The location of the hotel is amazing Walking distance to Padington train station where you can take the Heathrow Express and in 15 minutes you are at the airport Many underground stations are also steps away 
112750,Hilton London Metropole, The strangest thing ever a suit with no lights Just one small stand dim light for a suit We were living in the dark for 2 nights No smoking suits although the suit had a nice balcony which was closhich No free wifi, Food is good for a London Hotel Location
112751,Hilton London Metropole, The bed could of been comfier considering the room package The room also needed some uplifts That was the only dissapointment, Everything was great the lounge access is superb 
112752,Hilton London Metropole, The swimming pool little small and noting was bad , The best thing for this hotel is it s the loction and i like the swimming pool but in my opinion it s little small but the room was fantastic i hope i can come back to london and i think the hotel have a good staff
112753,Hilton London Metropole, The milk was off at breakfast They told us the jug was dirty which was worse but then they changed all the milk jugs on other tables Other than that a lovely hotel Clean friendly staff and great comfort , Breakfast was great apart from the off milk A bottle of wine was put in our room which was nice
112754,Hilton London Metropole, Everything was 10 10 apart from the afternoon tea fell short of expectations so would recommend you book elsewhere for that , Everything was fabulous The lady at check in arranged connecting rooms for us which made our stay so much more enjoyable The gym spa facilities were great too and there was a photo exhibition happening whilst we were staying The Whiskey Lounge and Edg bar had a great selection of drinks and fantastic atmosphere 
112755,Hilton London Metropole, The first room we got put in was tiny and had a smell of urine, We loved the location it was a perfect location The hotel was really nice and clean and food was lovely Our room was lovely and very comfortable and modern too once we got swapped

112757,Hilton London Metropole, As we paid our total before arrival we were charged an extra 30 pound per night as a security deposit I was told when I was checking out on the 4th of September that this would be refunded on to my card but I still have not got my money back We were also given a mini bar bill for moving things to look at what was in the mini bar I have contacted the hotel and was told that the money was refunded but it was not and that was almost a month ago There was also no wifi in the rooms Also we stayed in a queen deluxe for 3 people but were only ever given one of each towels one shampoo and shower gel , the size of the room
112758,Hilton London Metropole, There was not much selections to choose from at breakfast for non meat and pork eaters One kind of cheese only In the room bathroom there was no shaving mirror and no shoe cleaner sponge, The location was good and the size of bed queen was very good for one person The size of the family room in the west wing was excellent room 1499 
112759,Hilton London Metropole, Small changing room for the gym and pool and was told by the guy at the leisure reception that they had run out of keys for the lockers and I would need to let him know when I wanted mine closed so he could do it for me absolutely ridiculous for a hotel of this standard , Great location superb service apart from the leisure center Food and service in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner was superb 
112760,Hilton London Metropole, As per my previous stay at a Hilton hotel I had to change room three times before finding one in acceptable condition When I checked in I was told I was being given a complimentary upgrade to an Executive room However the room was a little tired and on a top floor directly underneath a roof aircon generator the room literally reverberated from the noise and it would have been impossible to concentrate let alone sleep I was then given another Executive room on a lower floor but this was even more shabby with only two small lights in the bedroom ceiling these were down lighters above the headboard making it difficult to prepare for an evening out or an early morning exit the bathroom was in very poor condition and smelled My third attempt for a decent room was more fruitful and the lady who dealt with me said she would give me a refurbished room why on earth was I not given one of these in the first place which was very nice but the television could not acquire a full signal despite the best efforts of the maintenance man Very difficult to get any sleep due to the noise of the air conditioning Lost my voice within 12 hours of arrival due to the unhealthily dry air Having stayed here several times the whole thing is hit and miss Not good value for money , Staff are pleasant and fairly helpful Convenient location 
112761,Hilton London Metropole, All good, The staff were amongst the most professional and friendly I have dealt with and a special recognition to a lady called Deborah from Italy on the reception
112762,Hilton London Metropole, The room was the smallest room I have every stayed in The room was not clean The towels were not clean as I cut myself and the towel had blood on it and was just folded up and put back on the shelf for the next day The bath was never cleaned as it always had hair in it The lifts are the worst it took me 25 min one night to get a lift to my room The hotel had a convention on at the time so was extremely over crowded Couldn t use the bar couldn t use the cafe couldn t find any place to sit at all as the whole ground floor was taken over by the people from the convention This hotel is very expensive and way over priced for the service and facilities provided I stayed with my family for 12 days and half of us were in one side of the hotel and the others were in the other side of the hotel The hotel was unable to find 2 rooms together Would never stay at this hotel again , The location to the tube was very good
112763,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, Hotel is in a great location Two tube stations within a block The breakfast is wonderful and the selection is great Rooms were very clean and modern 
112764,Hilton London Metropole, Tv didn t work There were very noisy renovations going on at the time of my stay and for the price I paid I didn t really want to be deafened by drilling all day, The staff were very friendly and helpful 
112765,Hilton London Metropole, Enjoyed our stay nothing wrong, We felt like valued customers the little touches of complimentary water and chocolates was lovely Big clean hotel and staff were friendly and we appreciated the early check in thank you hilton
112766,Hilton London Metropole, The restaurant in the hotel was a bit disappointing For such a big hotel I was expecting a better restaurant Swimming pool no rules were applied people were jumping in the water splashing all over could not relax at the swimming pool Too small for such a big hotel , Liked it Felt very good Great value for money Staff very helpful 
112767,Hilton London Metropole, scrambled eggs on the breakfast tray in room could have been hotter and better made Answer is a couldron bowl of boiling water underneath them Toilet did not work and had to get staff to attend to it This took some time as it was weekend Room a bit poky and bed nothing special in terms of comfort Wanted to spend a second night on same rate but staff just said that wad the internet rate no flexibility obviously , Position of hotel is excellent opposite tube middle edgware rd Nice lebanese restaurants around it Hotel was quiet notwithstanding and so was room Staff lacked personality and warmth but were fairly efficient i had the freshly made scones for tea which were nice and came warm There is a nice coffee shop takeway as well 
112768,Hilton London Metropole, Wi fi only free for an hour then you have to pay they give you a code at reception you put that in for the free wi fi if you go over you get charged or try to charge you confusion on mini bar also didn t use anything from bar But they reeled a long list of someone else s usage , Clean rooms breakfast lots of choice although quite expensive small pool and gym
112769,Hilton London Metropole, I think everything was over priced Order a cup cake and hot drink Hotel didn t have any of these at 11pm Something wrong with the hot drinks machine and the cupcakes were no longer available Actually saw the size of the cupcakes the following morning They were over priced for the size , Clean had a nice view of the city 
112770,Hilton London Metropole, Here for a special 21st Birthday Promised by desk that they would arrange something for birthday on the Saturday Like chocolates etc to be delivered to room Very disappointed that this didn t happen and so glad I never mentioned to my daughter View was of glass panels no real view at all , The friendly staff 
112771,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, After being put in a room right by the elevator and just above the underground it was obvious we weren t going to have a good nights sleep but after calling reception they sorted this straight away and moved us to a higher floor with beautiful views 
112772,Hilton London Metropole, Had a very poor nights sleep due to noisy guests next door Phoned reception and they sent security up to ask them to be quieter It was quieter but only for a short time then the shouting started up again and then they ordered room service twice I only got two hours sleep This effected my enjoyment of the next day as I was so tired I was only staying two days so it had a huge impact on my weekend , Close to tube Helpful staff 
112773,Hilton London Metropole, location was a bit further out of town than expected but that not the fault of the hotel It was great for the evening to come back to after site seeing but too far to pop back to drop off some shopping , Great for a young family hot chocolate for an evening drink right opposite the tube 
112774,Hilton London Metropole, Had a meal there and starter was brought at the same time as the main course My granddaughter ordered a pasta dish that was so hot it was inedible It was a shame because the rest of the food was lovely , lovely large bedroom very clean
112775,Hilton London Metropole, The room was small I know i booked a standard room but i felt like being in a 3 person tent Not likely to come back to this hotel based on the room size The room also had its best time It was worn The tv is by 2016 standard not okay It was poor in quality Not something that animated me to rent movies My ipad have a better quality And the last thing Wifi was worse than most internet in Denmark in 2005 , The easy transport to and from the hotel was the best part The sportsbar in the groundfloor was also a very good experience Nice and polite employees all the way around 
112776,Hilton London Metropole, just unsure why I was charged 80e on check in assumed security deposit had already paid for hotel in advance and this deposit dint appear on final invoice, location staff facilities
112777,Hilton London Metropole, They left the window open so I had to sleep with my jack on Also someone put the don t disturb card in the room and the housekeeper did not clean the room , Location
112778,Hilton London Metropole, No WiFi in room if you don t book directly and it is prohibitively expensive to pay for Breakfast is also very expensive, Well sized rooms Good size bathroom and great hotel facilitis Lots of nice bars restaurants and really helpful and friendly staff
112779,Hilton London Metropole, When we checked in they said they had upgraded our room however the room was rather small bathroom needed some care and attention very dated loose fittings electric towel rail didn t work , Staff were very helpful Breakfast excellent 
112780,Hilton London Metropole, The rooms were little and very dated The beds were not comfortable and the hotel was very loud We were very disappointed in this hotel , This hotel had easy train and subway access 
112781,Hilton London Metropole, Teenagers in the pool bombing and disruptive I had to tell them to respect other guests as the attendant on the desk which was directly in front of the pool was too busy chatting to another staff member and not paying any attention to what was going on , Great location lovely food in the restaurant and good service Hotel clean and good facslties 
112782,Hilton London Metropole, As we walked into the hotel to check in we where greeted by staff and shown where to check in As we checked in we found the staffs English hard to understand made it even worse when we phoned to complain they referred us to the restaurants phone line which was totally irrelevant We then went to our room which didn t look anything like what we seen in pictures it also had a bad smell and was very out dated Every night we could hear the lift going up and down and found this very annoying The Hilton also took two payments out of my bank which totalled up to 600 pound which I later had to contact the bank to get this back as the Hilton found that they couldn t do anything to help definitely not worth the money , The only stand out thing that we actually liked was the waiter from the sports bar He couldn t of been any more helpful and food was also nice 
112783,Hilton London Metropole, Main road location and had a view of an office and the nets didn t close fully so had to drawer curtains for privacy but this was so minor compared to the benefits We also only has two towels and one little bottle of shower gel for four people, Large sized family room very comfy pillows and huge beds Great choice for breakfast and easy access to theatre land The pool was loved too and the choice of shops bars and restaurants in the hotel 
112784,Hilton London Metropole, I was over charged in the restaurant items had been added to my bill The response I had from the stafe and manager was unbilivabe inadequate I had wine in my room that had been open by some else During check in my credit card details had been duplicated over 3500 had been eligaly withdrown I spend over 50 night a year in hotels and this was a 1 out of 10 , Swimming Poole
112785,Hilton London Metropole, In principle I should admit this trip in particular we had no problems what so ever , Staff in general were more than cooperative and were always smiling And I must state that after the complete refurbishment the Hotel has become one of the Best in London with no doubt 
112786,Hilton London Metropole, The water pressure was very low and we all took a long time to shower Also wifi should be a given in today s world so it would have been really nice to provide this FOC to guests , The location was good trains were easily accessible and shops were aplenty e g Prem a Manger M S MacDonald s etc
112787,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, Hotel s location is very near tube stations that easily connects you to areas for sightseeing and shopping It s a great place to stay either for business or leisure We stayed in an executive room with free access to the lounge for breakfast snacks and cocktail There are many options for restaurants convenient stores and department store right in front 
112788,Hilton London Metropole, The room was small but for one night it was acceptable The bathroom again was very small but as it was only a short stop it didn t bother us too much Although the bar was nice paying over 5 for a pint is crazy whether you are in Ldn or not that is a stupid price 35 to park the car for over 12 24 hours is a lot , The view was fantastic looking right over the city being able to see the Shard and the Ldn Eye amoung other things The beds were very comfortable and the shower was good and easy to use The lobby and reception areas were very nice open clean and bright areas and the bars were very comfortable with attentive staff Being so close to the A5 is great and also just across from the Tube is ideal 
112789,Hilton London Metropole, In the lobby staff were not observant I waited quiet a while on a number of times to be served And once I was talking I hadn t finished my drink I went to take a sip and the glass had gone , Good access to city Room nice size for the time of stay and clean 
112790,Hilton London Metropole, Nothing really, Excellent location Clean and comfortable Amazing staff particularly in the restaurant who arranged for a small birthday party for my wife that was one of the best 
112791,Hilton London Metropole, Health club could of been cleaner and more accessible We turned up twice and couldn t get in because of maintanance and then because too many people in the pool , Location great if you are prepared to walk but also excellent location for tube Breakfast was excellent Staff were attentive and accommodating 
112792,Hilton London Metropole, I thought a great hotel was let down by its location the smell from all the foreign restaurants on Edgware Road was awful I couldn t smell this inside the hotel only after I had left the hotel and walked towards Marble Arch I asked for the Wifi password and was told it would cost me 15 99 per night, All the staff were extremely helpful The facilities were very good I was Very happy with the Sports bar I thought that was perfect for people like myself 
112793,Hilton London Metropole, Thought the room would ve been a bit bigger but for a long weekend we weren t in hotel much anyway , Nice bar area great tube service can walk to shops on Oxford street or bars nearby too

112795,Hilton London Metropole, staff were rude and messed up our deposit and also payment refused to admit there mistake and refused to give the full deposit back, was clean and slightly modern
112796,Hilton London Metropole, We met with the Hotels Manager to discuss several issues regarding the bad service and are still awaiting a resolution , We had nothing other than complaints 
112797,Hilton London Metropole, The only fault was I was charged for children s meals even though Hilton offers under 10 years to eat free When bringing this matter up with staff out check out very unhelpful and said room was only booked for 1 adult not 1 adult 3 children Even after I stated this was incorrect and I had to input all children s ages at time of booking hence why a double queen room was recommended and booked it took a further 20 minutes to sort with numerous calls to the restaurant I even showed them on the Hilton honors website where it states children eat free and the lady still insisted she had never heard of this before Finally begruggingly she refunded the money , Fantastic hotel for New Year s Eve great facilities and brilliant location Check in was brilliant and accommodated us before checkin time as we had reservations at the theatre Room was lovely with fantastic view

112802,Hilton London Metropole, Have to say the only disappointment was the experience we had at breakfast There were so many people that a queuing system was put in place but not everyone complied with it The hotel staff were too lenient with people just avoiding the queue and walking straight into the dining area to find a table Once in the dining area there were more queues but again not everyone understood what a queue was The food was very average and only warm We would stay at this hotel again but we wouldn t book breakfast as there is a Wetherspoons pub a few hundred years away and their breakfast is very good served hot and much cheaper , Hotel room was excellent we stayed in a superior family room which was ideal for 4 people Our sons are 13 and 15 years of age Loads of room 
112803,Hilton London Metropole, Did not have the family room we asked for and tryed to give us 2 rooms instead but eventually found us a twin room Not the hotels fault but a lot of kids chasing each other about the corridors after 11pm, Great tube access to lots of great attractions Great advice on attraction and the best way to visit them

112824,Hilton London Metropole, For some reason hotel staff woke me up coming into my room twice in the morning by mistake once about 8am and the next about 10am, Location was handy Not far from most things 
112825,Hilton London Metropole, The only down side was the location I know that it s no one s fault but the restaurants outside the hotel hassling you to go in , The staff where very helpful and breakfast was lovely Great value for money

112832,Hilton London Metropole, Nothing of note although if I am going to be really nit picky when I went to get my bags from under the desk in the room I did notice some chewing gum in the corner , What we saw online was what we saw in person Which doesn t happen with every hotel you go to Room with a view also a plus The room itself was very pleasant 
112833,Hilton London Metropole, Unfortunately we had the fire alarm go off twice on the Friday morning of our stay To be fair though this can happen anywhere , The general ambience of the hotel The restaurant was very good The hotel is conveniently situated in relation to where we wanted to get to 
112834,Hilton London Metropole, The only criticism I have is that the housekeeping were knocking on our door at 8 00 am continued to do so until I told them not to Although I discovered a do not disturb hanger I could ve put out I felt as there should be some kind of system in place that they could do this once guests had checked out Was looking forward to a well deserved lie in but I had a grouchy 6 year old who had been woken up a little too early ,No Positive

112837,Hilton London Metropole, 1st room offered was a bit tired and tiny for a suite , Staff were very helpful and special thanks goto Sergio and Andriana for sorting us a different room out promptly and with no fuss excellent staff you must hang on to them 
112838,Hilton London Metropole, The room was quite basic and the bathroom was quite small for the money and compared to other hilton hotels we have stayed in, The staff was really good and helpful
112839,Hilton London Metropole, Felt like a budget part of the hotel West Wing in need of tlc Two check in staff were unhelpful and snooty maybe because we had young children or level of room we had But for 300 a night this was by no way cheap without breakfast , Room was good size for our one night stay tea coffee making facility was of good standard
112840,Hilton London Metropole, No drinks in the mini bar in the room When I called to order drinks I was asked to pay a 5 tray charge despite the note on the fridge specifically saying there would be no tray charge Receptionist eventually agreed not to charge a tray charge Bathroom needed decorating Room rate overpriced Food in the sports bar overpriced for the quality , Location perfect for tube access Lovely patisserie across the road as well as Starbucks and M S
112841,Hilton London Metropole, Staff took 5 hours and 6 phone calls to deliver a hair dryer The noise from the room next us was abhorrent we could hear every word of their TV Upon arrival our initial room had a double bed composed of 2 singles one mattress was only 3 inches thick and you could feel every spring and the bed frame beneath it not what I expected from the 4 star Hilton We were promptly moved but as stated previously it just didn t feel like a 4 star , Hotels location was fantastic 
112842,Hilton London Metropole, Wifi is not free even it is hard to get paid wifi the room is not so clear as I thought so only the big name is Hilton then nothing , location is good 
112843,Hilton London Metropole, The twin room in tower block was small compared to those that I have stayed in west wing which was a bit disappointing as it was a leisure booking instead of usual business booking , Friendly staff

112846,Hilton London Metropole, Chamber maid coming in at 815am Probably our fault for not putting do not disturb sign on the door , Excellent hotel very good location staff welcoming and friendly
112847,Hilton London Metropole, As mentioned In my booking I had booked this hotel as I was celebrating my girlfriends birthday as a surprise Although check in was at 3pm we arrived at 12pm to drop our bags off I managed to check in also at the reception desk The member of staff I checked in with confirmed I had a non smoking room and that she was going to check to see if my room was ready She told me it wasn t and so therefore I could come back later to pick up the room keys from reception We the Left the hotel as we had a show to attend to and some shopping to do We arrived back at the hotel just after 6pm I went back to reception to pick up the room keys only to be told the room was not ready and they only room they had was a smoking room or an accessibility room Obviously I was extremely annoyed as this contradicted what was said to me earlier I was then told that if I wanted a non smoking room I would have to wait half hour or so As I had already made reservations for drinks and dinner elsewhere we were struggling for time so I had no choice but accept the smoking room As a good will gesture the only thing I was offered was free wifi which did not work at all We got to our room which smelt horrendous and had dirt all up the walls and the carpet not to mention a TV that only had 4 working channels that were all in a different language The room we were given was on the first floor and the noise coming from the cars on the street below was so loud we hardly slept all night I complained about the TV a gentleman arrived about 20 minutes later to have a look He could speak any English but all he could say is that the to was broken I could of told him that myself He said their was nothing he could do and left All in all an awful hotel unhelpful staff massive queues in reception and disgusting rooms Will never stay their again and would not reccomend this hotel ,No Positive

112850,Hilton London Metropole, We were told in check in after pre booking 2 months in advance that there was only smoking double rooms available Didn t think this was even allowed anymore We were then allocated 2 twin non smoking rooms which I can only discribe as tiny and disgusting I refused to stay in both rooms and was given an upgrade by very helpful staff this was a much better room but still nothing special On our check out we wanted to leave our bags with concierge to then have to queue for over 30 minutes to do this I will definitely not be returning here , The staff were helpful after I had to complain for different things throughout our 2 night stay

112860,Hilton London Metropole, I did not like the TV channels You should have more satlit tv channels Your bath room lites are dim You need to renovate your rooms including the bath rooms , Your bath top is old The water pressure in the shower was weak
112861,Hilton London Metropole, The wifi is not good at all in the comun areas since its for free and keeps on disconnecting If you want good contraction than you need to pay for wifi in the room which I truly don t understand why this day in age were wifi is for free practically everywhere , The location was great 10 mins walk from Oxford Street The room was good too Stayed the Queen bedroom with two kids and it was perfect spacious and nice 
112862,Hilton London Metropole, I was woken up at 8am by the cleaning staff to access my room to clean my check out time was 12 noon so i have no idea why they knocked my door so early After i sent them away they decided to return at 9am which meant i had very little sleep and ruined my experience of the hotel Not happy with this at all and reception had very little solution to offer,No Positive
112863,Hilton London Metropole, In our room the bathroom was not particularly clean the tv signal was poor and couldnt really see what was on hairdryer barely worked a plug socket was out the wall and gave me a slight shock when i plugged in my phone charger mini bar had barely anything in it, The swiftness of the staff in the restaurant at breakfast and dinner was brilliant all staff polite and helpful
112864,Hilton London Metropole, Premier inn would put the deluxe rooms to shame Finish on rooms was poor for the money No free wifi even in upgraded rooms , Bar and restaurant s good quality of food
112865,Hilton London Metropole,No Negative, Checking in was good and helpful almost received what was requested you would think that a hotel of this caliber would be able to offer twin beds in a disabled room rather than a 5 ft queen size Excellent disabled shower room breakfast was better this time we have been the same weekend for 14 years and watched the hotels standards decline year by year but now it is showing a slight improvement 
112866,Hilton London Metropole, Room was not great and bathroom was especially poor for any hotel let alone a hotel with the Hilton name , Food and facilities along with location were very good

112868,Hilton London Metropole, The towels smell bad and were old The staff put on my account half of the mini bar because I put it on the desk in order to clean some space in the refrigerator for some fruits of mine After asking for a person to come and check that everything is there and unopened they told me a Red bull is missing and I had to pay for it despite we did not drink it The room service food was very expensive We could hear the noises from outside So the experience was kind of a bad memory , Not much 
112869,Hilton London Metropole, The room was too small and the decor was ugly I was in the tower and I saw a wall and part of the street as the view This room charge should have been reduced , The clerk was efficient 
112870,Hilton London Metropole, I didn t like almost everything so many of the staff were very rude for instance we came at 10 00 pm for dinner in the restaurant that takes reservation until 10 30 and the waitress straight asked us for the order when we asked for 2 more minutes she said that we had to hurry up She did not give any service either placed the starter without cutleries and did not bring them either did not clear the empty starter when the main course came An other example at the front desk one of the receptionist agent that seemed to be a supervisor refused to give the change of 11 pounds saying to the one that was checking us in it s my cashier I don t have to give you anything right it front of us result our receptionist had to go to the bar to get the change This is unacceptable and I do work in luxury hospitality I know what I talk about when I say that I would sanction such rude behavior in front of guests Also in the room there is no mini bar and no amenities shaving kit tooth brush cotton and yet were staying in a higher category superior king room The room is much much smaller than it looks on the pictures , The location is perfect

112877,Hilton London Metropole, The bed was very uncomfortable I never have back ache but I felt sick in the morning because my back ached that much I told the receptionist on checking out and she said she would tell the manager but that obviously didn t make any difference to me as I had endured it for 2 nights and was checking out The changing rooms in the swimming pool were tiny And had no privacy You had to basically get ready in front of everyone which I wasn t comfortable doing as I had my 5 year old son with me and he could see everyone getting changed , The hotel its self was beautiful and had everything we could want The breakfast restaurant was extremely busy But on the second morning they opened up a separate suite which was much more relaxed 
112878,Hilton London Metropole, The heating only blew out cold air and one of the windows was stuck slightly ajar, Overall we were very happy with the hotel and services the executive suite was a joy to stay in apart from a couple of minor things The staff were all very friendly and professional

112882,Hilton London Metropole, A hotel of this nature should be offering FREE WIFI all over the hotel considering the fact that room rates are not cheap the time for paid WIFI in hotel rooms is way gone past This hotel should upgrade it s standard by offering this service even lower hotels offer this to their guests , The location it is close to the Heathrow Express and two underground stations Good breakfast 
112883,Hilton London Metropole, It was a bit noisy due to a conference which taking place near my room, I enjoyed the bar near the reception Lovely atmosphere and cocktails The room was warm clean and very comfortable overall Location is great

112887,Hilton London Metropole, The View We upgraded and had a room looking over a storage facility really noisy and flood lights beaming threw the window at night The staff changed our room to 13 th floor but still terrible view The upgrades put you at the back of the hotel I would personally be happier with a standard room with views of London, Location was ok
112888,Hilton London Metropole, I feel that the bathroom needed a bit of updating also the TV signal was not great and the room was very hot despite putting the temp down it seemed to keep going on the same temperature , We were able to check in even earlier than expected making it easier with the children The staff were friendly and helpful and it was a good location The breakfast was gorgeous even the children liked the variety 
112889,Hilton London Metropole, Upon arrival at 11am to the hotel I was told my room would not be available until after 3pm This was done and I checked in completing all of the relevant paperwork to prevent me from having to go through it when I returned I was advised it would be a case of collecting my keys in return In return to the hotel after a busy day in London I had to wait approximately another 15 20 mins on collecting my keys the original room that I was told I would be getting I e 3 single beds appeared to be not available and I had to take a room with a king size bed and 1 single bed If I hadn t accepted this then God knows when I would have got into my room I think for the price of the hotel this was very poor service Also on the final day of our trip my keys to the room stopped working Another inconvenience when you are 19 floors up Then to be asked for ID at the reception when the ID is locked in the safe inside the room is pretty poor ,No Positive

112900,Hilton London Metropole, my friend has claustrophobia which meant she would not use a lift this seemed to cause a problem as we had difficulty with staff trying to find suitable stair access and she had to use fire escape stairs each time, location cleanliness facilities and very helpful manager with the problem my friend had
112901,Hilton London Metropole, Poor rooms for a deluxe king room at 150 a night these rooms were a disgrace Ive stayed in better travel lodges at a fifth of the price The room was dirty had chips missing from the walls and skirting boards Mould was growing on the windows and in the bathroom A delightful adjoining door as thick as a piece of paper meant we were awake at 5 30am when our neighbours were leaving Then awoken again at 8 30am when the cleaning team came to dismantle the room with sledgehammers or so it sounded A full blown argument between 3 members of staff which we heard every word of Regarding the facilities we had a hairdryer that exploded and a tv that wasnt tuned to anything and had no signal A waste of time basically , Good location Allowed to check in an hour and a half early

112908,Hilton London Metropole, Everything from check in takes a hour to check in had also other VIP guests but the hotel was not flexible it was a nightmare stay wifi in this day and age Is charged at 14 per day somehow the Minister was offered twin beds but he wanted double to upgrade it was 60 per night again a complete rip off all complete with staff that are not as friendly and flexible will be writing to Hilton head office but the stay was a nightmare,No Positive

112924,Hilton London Metropole, I was over charged for the parking as the clocks had gone back an hour and the parking machine wasn t updated Therefore the exit time was showing an hour ahead I asked a member of staff for help who told me to pay the ticket 55 and then go to front desk and they will refund the extra hour that I was charged for When I got to the front desk the lady was very apologetic and could clearly see the mistake made She even made a phone call to her colleague to make sure the clocks were turned back on the machine so no other customers would have the same problem She then told me to wait a few minutes as she needed to get authorization to refund the extra hour However this other lady came out and said I was not allowed to have a refund for the extra hour as it was not the hotels policy to give refunds Even the first lady was a bit shocked as to how we were spoken too I left feeling very disappointing as to what was a great weekend , Great location stayed here many times before great breakfast

112933,Hilton London Metropole, Booked a second room for a family friend Ending up getting a room that s not the one that I wanted Ending up paying more manager on duty oct 20th in the afternoon was a prick , Staff not very accommodating Very expensive for a mediocre hotel 
112934,Hilton London Metropole, Had no wifi connection during our stay as we were not prepared to pay the exhorbitant fee of 13 per day It is many years since I have stayed in a hotel without FREE wifi This hotel needs to get with the times in this regard , Upgraded on arrival as initial room allocated was stinking of cigarette smoke from previous guest reception staff very apologetic and new room was spacious and comfortable and fresh smelling Very good choice for breakfast but hot buffet food was at best lukewarm The made to order omelettes were a better choice 
112935,Hilton London Metropole, It s ridiculous to charge a fortune for wifi in the rooms Also there was no free wifi in the lobby Also the minibar was a disaster No Coca Cola No nothing The bathroom was a bit dirty and there s no toilet brush The breakfast is great but it s not worth the price , Very friendly staff The shower was great 
112936,Hilton London Metropole, apart from one gentleman who was amazing the staff was not good When I checked in lady at the desk more interested in flirting than getting through the growing queue concierge most unhelpful waited an hour in lobby for one small request My room was not ready and I was told to take a single bedded room instead then placed in a lesser room with broken curtain , I liked the location and general appearance of the hotel 
112937,Hilton London Metropole, Long queue to check in and then door keys didn t work A lot of staff in reception area but not enough serving guests, Clean room with tea and coffee facilities Staff happy to supply extra milk when asked Walkable to Regent s Park and short taxi ride to ROH

112943,Hilton London Metropole, Mention on the website that we can access the pool during the date we arrive but was told that it was close Got a very run down looking room Everything was old , Location and gotten the high floor as requested and free wifi as a compensation 
112944,Hilton London Metropole, Rude staff old and very worn rooms Very disappointing We weren t impressed two years ago when the renovations were taking place but thought we d give you benefit of another trip , Location 
112945,Hilton London Metropole, the staff specially the concierge were not so friendly unlike other hotels which are less than Hilton this hotel did not over free bottle of water long queue for check in and check out, the bed and bellows were comfortable
112946,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel rooms are a little run down and a little old but they are comfortable, Staff were excellent and very helpful We had use of the executive lounge and this ended up crustal as we were there for business and could hold meetings and catch up during the day

112948,Hilton London Metropole, Having to queue ages to check in which was also the same queue for checking out Had to also queue for a substantial amount of time for breakfast as the room could not cater for the number of guests possible solution is booking a table at the time that suits The bed was very hard the air freshener was over powering , Location near to two tube stations In walking distance to Marble Arch
112949,Hilton London Metropole, Parts of the hotel are really in need of refurbishment and the spa is propper 90 s Baggage storage is free but really slow and bad service there don t leave valuables Walls in our room were quite thin and you could hear the neighbors tv in the morning but nothing to complain about , The metropol is a huge center hotel and most of the rooms are slightly old and tired in typical Hilton UK 4 fashion but some of the floors here have been recently refurbished and we had a nice super modern suite in the Tower wing room 1620 all modern fresh USB charger sockets in the wall for your phone super nice bathroom with rain shower and stonework extremely comfortable double bed and great linnens good housekeeping over our 3 night stay good air con Breakfast was true to the Hilton standard but it gets super busy as it s such a big hotel so get there as early as you can before 7 15 is best All round a good hotel and good place to stay right in the centre 20min walk to Oxford street and Hyde park etc
112950,Hilton London Metropole, Waited for over 30 minutes for drinks to be served to us then was told one of the drinks not available We were told our luggage was on its way to our room so therefore booked a taxi on the strength of this but it didn t arrive for over 30 minutes so taxi waiting Someone else s clothes still in the drawers in the room so cleaning process might be questioned No hairdryer in the room , Very friendly staff 
112951,Hilton London Metropole, I didn t like the overwhelming number of customers pouring at the one point reception If you don t mind you would have another counter for customers checking out , I liked the speed and helpfulness of the staff
112952,Hilton London Metropole, Rooms were on the small side and tired looking They smelt stale nothing that a good blow through of fresh air wouldn t curr , Beautiful ground floor with helpful check in and a good range of facilities for food and drink staff were helpful and friendly without exception 
112953,Hilton London Metropole, The room we had in the tower wing seemed quite dated The paintwork had clearly been covered numerous times and not very well , The location was perfect for the trip 
112954,Hilton London Metropole, Accommodation was only very average for the cost The bed was uncomfortable giving a very poor night s sleep the night before a big event and is most certainly not what I expected Breakfast was over priced and best described as warm and seating was cramped with slow poor service Having stayed in a few hotels recently we have had far far better service and facilities for much less cost and with a personal touch too On departure our comments were not solicited My wife I wouldn t hurry back to this hotel , Pros Location was central for our needs 
112955,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel is very tired and some of the rooms even more so they are marketing King Deluxe rooms as such whether or not they are refurbished or not the older ones are not worthy of the name and should not carry the same price tag , The staff were excellent and very professional They listen to problems and try to find solutions 
112956,Hilton London Metropole, Wifi only free for hhonors members This is somewhat out of place with most international hotels these days , Good hotel Good value for this part of London

112958,Hilton London Metropole, The room we had was awful absolutely stunk of cigarette smoke Had to pay to use the Wifi which is such a joke after paying so much to stay there and don t think the service was up to standard for a Hilton Hotel as stayed in many before over the world ,No Positive

112961,Hilton London Metropole, Most Hotels give complimentary wifi The cost of a 24 hour wifi of GBP 12 is too expensive for vacation travellers For the special deals at this hotel they will give you only the low floors with poor views Bed and toilet is ok but the room s furniture are quite old , 1 Location is v good and very near from the Edgeware underground and supermarket and eateries are available esp for Halal guests 2 Hotel lobby is nice 3 Hotel will take in your left luggage at GBP 4 per day which is excellent if you need them to keep 1 piece of luggage for you for a few days or 1 week whilst you travel out of London to other destinations in UK 
112962,Hilton London Metropole, Bathroom was tired looking with crack in floor tiles Strange smell in room not horrendous but not pleasant , Location was excellent Foyer in hotel was lovely Check in and out very quick and efficient Room a decent size

112964,Hilton London Metropole, They split the bill into different components instead of taking this in one payment Especially as my bank offers a cashback for this hotel but only in one transaction therefore I have missed out on a substantial offer , Bar is a must lovely and relaxing staff were very polite We checked in before the 3pm check in time with great information given from Edem wonderful member of staff 
112965,Hilton London Metropole, Poor facilities bathroom was disgusting Had to be asked to moved to a different room which wasn t much better Won t be coming again , Location was great 
112966,Hilton London Metropole, The staff did not read the notes I made during booking where I had to pay more charges to have comfortable stay In addition the rooms are overused and do not deserve the money paid Last why we have to pay for the wifi in the room while nowadays its free in streets , Location of the hotel was good 
112967,Hilton London Metropole, Bathroom very tired and dirty The hotel is undergoing upgrades to rooms which is badly needed in the tower where we were I did complain about the condition of the bathroom and was given an apology and slight refund Staff were very friendly and hard working , Great location lovely reception area

112973,Hilton London Metropole, The bed was big but one of the mattresses had ruined springs in one of the sides The shower water had no pressure at all , The location was great and we were upgraded to an Executive room

112991,Hilton London Metropole, rooms are tired and in desperate need of a refurb It is crazy that there is no free wi fi in the room only in the foyer The cost of paid wi fi is ridiculously expensive Next time I would book an apartment There were only two tea bags each day Seems a bit mean Not the standard I d expect from a Hilton , Great location close to transport supermarkets and restaurants Friendly and helpful staff 
112992,Hilton London Metropole, The very poor customer service from the main reception On arrival found the required cot hadn t been allocated to the room we called customer service who informed us this would be done within 30 minutes on arrival back from a trip out we found out once again there was no cot We called customer service once again to be told they wasn t sure why the cot hadn t arrived and received zero apology The cot did finally arrive and was assembled however with 30 mins of putting our 1 year old to bed we turned the light on to see the bed Base had collapsed broken creating our 1 year old to go under the mattress We called customer service who brought us a new cot 45 minutes later please note it was 11pm at night at this point it took us over an hour to calm our baby back to sleep however she wouldn t go back into the new cot When informing the front desk the following morning we received no apology and a big lack of concern to what could if been a fatal incident This lack of customer care was unacceptable , All the above 
112993,Hilton London Metropole, no good facilities no free internet the wi fi is expensive bad and unclean bathroom dirty elivators, location is good stuff some are friendly and some are not quiet rooms 
112994,Hilton London Metropole, Nothing it all exceeded our expectations , Access from Waterloo straight up Bakerloo line to Edgeware Road and hotel was opposite exit to tube station Staff were VERY friendly and efficient Pool Sauna and steam room were a real bonus Plenty of taxis outside if you needed them View from 12th floor was incredible 
112995,Hilton London Metropole, First of all we requested to stay in the new tower and we paid for it however they put us in the old tower We waited 5 hours to check in the staff was very rude and inpatient even though we are HHonars We also had to wait even more for our second room To be honest the lobby was breath taking however the rooms were the total opposite They charged us for using the mini bar which we haven t even touched Most shocking thing was one of the room service employees knocked the door while my little daughter was staying inside and asked to see the mini bar then returned and asked her to teach him arabic he also asked for her phone number she said that she doesn t have one and then gave her his skype name on a piece of paper we were in shock so we went to the manager with the hand written piece of paper and told him about it and he did absolutely nothing about it Accessibility after 8pm was limited the ac wasn t working well and the shower was broken i have been traveling for many years and i have been to over 1000 hotels around the world in 54 countries i was surprised that hilton had such poor unprofessional quality of services the hotel was surrounded with poor people who kept asking for money and also one crazy person tried to enter the hotel overall i would never recommend anyone to stay there , Nothing at all
112996,Hilton London Metropole, My bathroom was not clean and cabinets were falling apart Thr location overall was a bit intimidating , The lobby was nice and staff were friendly Transport was convenient too 
112997,Hilton London Metropole, The swimming pool was out of action but no imformtion was given about it The room we booked was for 3 but wen we arrived we had not been alocated a kids bed , Breakfast was good n location was great 
112998,Hilton London Metropole, The deluxe room looks rather old and is way too small for a king size bed Not a good environment for someone who needs to do some work in your room Did not want to stay in the room at all apart from sleeping Can consider bringing your laptop to nearby cafes instead Lobby way too noisy for working , Excellent location 5 mins walk from Paddington Station and Edgware Road Station Ideal location for those who came from Heathrow via Heathrow Express Short cab ride to Euston or King s Cross Station for those who needs to travel to the north by train Many eateries nearby A wide range of selections Near grocery stores and supermarkets too 
112999,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel approach is difficult to navigate by car There is no guest comp for parking which is exorbitant The public area layout is poorly designed and the lift system is chaotic and far too slow , There isn t much that appealed in this hotel however the Whisky Bar was comfortable and less crowded 
113000,Hilton London Metropole, The checking in process was long and tiresome we where called and then ignored for 10 15minutes The rooms were appalling very little space with old appliances littering the room 1980 s fridge was our tv stand Room cleanliness was at best 3 10 For a conclusion location was great however the hotel was not especially for the price that they charge Will not go to this hotel again please look somewhere else , The downstairs lobby was very inviting and allowed us to relax
113001,Hilton London Metropole, Long queue in check in and check out Hotel is Crowded all time Emergency alarms ring more than three times in the nights during my stay around 3 15AM , location Breakfast 
113002,Hilton London Metropole, Edgware road is the worst street in London Can t use the mini bar for items I bought from outside , The location near to edgware road station but far away from city heart

113006,Hilton London Metropole, Hotel needs updating to match other Hilton hotels Beds were not great seemed to be on a wooden stand that made an awful noise everytime you moved Kids on electric skateboards in dinning room and anywhere in hotel that has space Would not stay there again , staff were lovely very busy hotel location to tube and bus 2 minutes walk
113007,Hilton London Metropole, Breakfast needs to be better To long a wait for omlettes Consider another omlette counter Seeng the same person making omlettes for last 8 years He needs support Chocolate spread not available Staff can be more customer friendly in breakfast areas ,No Positive
113008,Hilton London Metropole, The fact that ice stayed in many hiltons icluding dubai and the uk and for the amount i spent to stay just short of 800 for 3 nights you put us on the 5th floor with a a young family which is directly above the function suite on level 3 which lead to us having no sleep till the early hours of sat morning and monday morning due to events i realise that hotels need functions and events to run but surely guests not attending these events should be put on a higher floor away from the music and other noise,No Positive
113009,Hilton London Metropole, Price is expensive a little bit comparing to room size Bathroom facility is vety old TV channels are very poor Lobby of the hotel is very crowded with people , Breakfast wi fi location close to Hyde park and Oxford Street Near to bus station and metro underground only two minutes Paddington train station is 7 minutes walk to come or go to airport Many halal food arabic lebanese and egyptaian restaurants close to it The View from the room in 22nd floor is amazing almost all london Staff is nice and very cooperative Also kettle with tea and coffee in daily basis is available at room 
113010,Hilton London Metropole, Appalling cleanliness filthy windows parts chewed or broken off bathroom door leaking shower empty minibar no free WiFi lifts insufficient for the number of guests pricey and bad quality food Was glad to leave , Good location in central London on a main thoroughfare 
113011,Hilton London Metropole, Once we arrived the receptionist told me that the room is a bit different and wider When I entered the room I found out the furniture of the room is made for handicapped people When I asked to change the room or to upgrade they refused and said they don t have rooms The second thing is that they took my luggage to some other occupant room and they couldn t find it until I investigated and found that they took it to the room next to me The room service never answered from the first call The reception has 6 7 desks but you can find two active or 3 by max , Location of hotel is at Edgware road and this is in the middle of the town and close to the shopping area Oxford St 
113012,Hilton London Metropole, Busy queue as usual in check in check out Also the fire alarm in the room woke me up early morning which is very bad behaviour , Great location

113015,Hilton London Metropole, Two things the paid wifi in the rooms Swimming pool facility is very small, Every thing especially hotel type family room in west wing housekeeping location Security is excellent Breakfast is very good In a nutshell It was over my expectations 
113016,Hilton London Metropole, We stood in the queue for 30 40 minutes to register We needed a change of room and yet again stand for 30 minutes and then again to stand in the queue after vacating and bringing down the baggage the original room for the new one Spending nearly 2 hours in the queue having paid to stay in a bit of luxury is disappointing to say the least Make people wait for such a long period is unacceptable however busy the place is , close to amenities 
113017,Hilton London Metropole, Long queues at checking in desk Very crowded hotel Queues in breakfast room mainly due to not enough staff at manned points The gym View from room non existent Room not ready for check in at appropriate to time Waited for 50 mins after check in time for room to be avaIlable , Clean rooms Friendly staff
113018,Hilton London Metropole, I he been staying here since more 20 years now but this time I think this hotel is finished Lifts were not working properly I got a very small room with a view of some machines kept next door fridge mini bar was not working wanted to put insulin th fridge was extremely dirty no toiletries 2nd day nobody came to clean Sink was choke they and I can go on, Only the location and the breakfast
113019,Hilton London Metropole, We didn t have free wifi and if we have to pay it was expensive , The location was excellent because you can find anything you need near and around the hotel There was a wide variety of food in the breakfast which gave me more choices The staff was very friendly and always asked me if I needed anything 
113020,Hilton London Metropole, Customer service was horrendous they didn t have a cot for my daughter who is a baby so they told me well you are not the only one with kids it was there mistake not mine Gave my daughter a burning hot plate for her meal even after I asked it to be cold 3 nights in a row No power in shower safe was broken air conditioning didn t work all the time Extremely rude staff at front desk For the money I paid I am so disgusted with my stay It ruined our whole holiday I would never set foot in there again , The meal in the hotel was fantastic We eat there 3 nights and it was always amazing food 
113021,Hilton London Metropole, When we got to ur hotel u put us in a room what we never booked And we came down and told u then u put us in the room what we seen on Internet what we did book , Hotel was good clean staff was friendly
113022,Hilton London Metropole, The hotel seemed a little tired and old Needed updating I understand it s not possible to renovate all of it but simple things like replacing the disgusting sofa outside the lifts on the 3rd floor east wing should be done , Location was good and staff were excellent 
113023,Hilton London Metropole, The lines at the check in and check outs were too long and not enough staff there so check in out took about 20 30 minutes, Great location clean rooms and great breakfast options
113024,Hilton London Metropole, Regrettably this time we had a long wait to check in and although after 3pm our room wasn t ready We were later given a room in the Tower as requested but right outside the lift which was noisy and with a view of a brick structure We found a used tissue on the floor in the room and despite reception saying they would send some water up for us this did not arrive We do expect better service for the price you charge , We have stayed at this hotel many times and have always had a pleasant stay It is a nice hotel in a good location 
113025,Hilton London Metropole, Nobody answer when i called the reciption It s take a time when we order food Transferring our called to many staff to got what we needs , Big hotel with busy staff in the reciption Great location Clean room with great views 
113026,Hilton London Metropole, The nonsmoking room we booked smelt of smoke despite the staff spraying extra air freshener Opening the window was not helpful either On our second night we were moved to another room because of this smaller room but nicer views Parking spaces are very tight if you have a big car Check in took a while as hotel was busy , The location was fairly central and there were some good restaurants in walking distance Reception staff are very helpful Rooms clean but tired 
113027,Hilton London Metropole, The waste removal from corridors is very very poor Calling assistance or room service is to no avail during the weekend The cut down staff too much I believe even queuing for the breakfast and waiting for the omelet takes too much time simply because there is only one chief , Staff were great particularly at the reception Location was convenient for us as a family because it was near our flat which was not ready at the time hence why had to book a hotel in London in the first place The chief at the breakfast is a great guy Although he has been working alone serving these many queues of people he has always been smiling friendly and helpful 
113028,Hilton London Metropole, Booked for 3 people 2 adults and a 14 yr old in a super king superior room and was expected to sleep in one bed I had the confirmation from booking com but reception said I had booked for two people and wanted to charge for an extra bed in the room I had to wait nearly 30 minutes at reception for it to be sorted There are few staff on and the hotel is very busy , Didn t have to wait for a lift 
113029,Hilton London Metropole, Room was booked for 2 adults 1 child assumed this included the roll out bed as our D is 7 When we got there Hilton paperwork was for 2 adults only and they wanted 30 extra for the extra bed Refused to pay any extra as my email confirmation said 2 adults 1 child They downgraded our room to family room with 3 beds Room was tatty and old windows were very dirty bathroom was moldy and small Had trouble getting in the room with card waited nearly an hour as queues were large to change cards only for them not to work again Missed most of the evening and dinner reservation Man eventually came up to room and told us we were doing it wrong you have to have a knack with it We spoke to next door who were having same problem and they were made to feel it was their fault as well TV had a bad picture and not many channels Won t be stopping at a Hilton again ruined our weekend , Breakfast location
113030,Hilton London Metropole, Appalling room service incorrect food delivered Being woke at 8 30 by drilling and hammering 40 minutes wait to check in Sky bar closed Interested staff at checkout, Location
113031,Hilton London Metropole, At this price point I expected breakfast and wifi to be included They were not The wifi service was a nightmare to setup and is manage by an over priced third party 12 00 GBP per day for basic wifi service ridiculous In this age wifi should be included just like electricity and running water , Staff was very polite and friendly Two tube stations are within one block of the hotel M S store across the street Lots of cafes in the local area The local area seemed pretty safe Hotel restaurant was very nice food was great The staff helped us setup tours and gave us instructions on how to get where we needed to go 
113032,Hilton London Metropole, I booked as early as February 2015 through booking com However to my surprise when i arrived i was informed that you were fully occupied but after a very LONG EMBARRASSING discussion with the staff at the reception I was finally allowed access to my hotel room This affected my state of mind ,No Positive
113033,Hilton London Metropole, Small rooms for the price Cramped and not easy to move around in Refreshment fridge was broken and not told for many hours but promised complimentary items which were never fulfilled Room had many defects and loose fittings and fixtures, The location was good

113035,Hilton London Metropole, Waiting time at the reciption was around 30 minutes in order to check in , The floor I got a room at was just newly renovated Other floor are poor according to a resident I met there

113041,Hilton London Metropole, When we checked in the hotel didn t have the type of room non smoking room with a double or queen bed I had requested at least two months earlier when I made the online booking they had to transfer us to a different room much later the following day Worse the customer service lady on the phone was very rude and dismissive when I requested for an ice bag to relieve my wife s sore shoulder and headache , Hotel security was very helpful in recovering and returning to us the pearl pendant my wife inadvertently left behind at the hotel when we checked out 
113042,Hilton London Metropole, Avoid the North tower It truly sucks We upgraded to the east tower which was much better Rooms were bigger and showers were better Skip the breakfast package Go to Starbucks instead , Convenient location nice lobby ok staff
113043,Hilton London Metropole, We were given an occupied room to start with but it was changed immediately and upgraded , Very helpful staff Excellent location for a concert at Wembley stadium 
113044,Hilton London Metropole, Unless requested you are given an old room and not a refurbished one , When i arrived i was given a room on the 18th floor the room was dirty and had the most awful smell I was eventually given a refurbished room but only after complaining

113048,Hilton London Metropole, too much time to check in and receptionist was not aware about the room rate that I booked through booking as he tried to charge me 100 When I showed him the booking he then said the price that he has in the system is different and he changed it but I think it took too much time for us to check in WiFi isn t free which it should considering the price that you pay The hotel itself is really old and overall I don t think that I ll stay again in this hotel , Location is ok 
113049,Hilton London Metropole, My experience was okay the room was great bed was really comfy TV services were good as well Staff seemed attentive and helpful but when booking the hotel I was not informed of there being a 25 car park charge I feel that after paying over 150 for one room for one night as well as 25 to park there is not acceptable, The room was really good and clean and breakfast was very good also
113050,Hilton London Metropole, Calling reception for door key card not working nobody picked the phone even after more than 5 minutes of ringing have to go down personally The new card also have trouble and work after 4 5 try The staff were also non cooperative by not providing extra bed as confirmed during booking Have to argue a lot to get the same Found another guest shouting on another reception staff , Prime location
