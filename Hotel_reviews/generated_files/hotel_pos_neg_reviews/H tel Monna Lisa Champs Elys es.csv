264897,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, My only problem was that they cleaned the rooms very late I left my room at 9 30 in the morning and when I got back at 5 in the afternoon they still had not made up the room , very comfortable bed and pillows very very clean and comfortable helpful and nice staff great location

264900,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, It s inconvenient to drop the luggages during the arrival and departure as there is no space to put the car in the narrow and busy street conveniently The most inconvenient part is the missing parking facility for the hotel , The location nearby the Champs Elysees is very convenient We also like the security the availability of the staff until late night The room is clean and isolated Make sure to visit the Brasserie Baroche around the corner for a great breakfast

264903,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, The street can get quite noisy during the night I believe there s a nightclub nearby so I d definitely recommend changing to soundproof windows , Staff was really really nice they offered us an upgrade and umbrellas when it was raining The room we got had a very good space bed was really comfortable and it was super clean 
264904,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, There were roadworks right outside but hopefully they are done now , Locality so close to Champs Elysee and restaurants Rooms decorated with Devinci drawings All facilities available in our room Tea in our room to English standard not normal in France 
264905,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, I had a room with street view and it was a nightmare since AC was off for all rooms so I had to open the windows to get some air and that was horrible the noise was too laud so I had to close and open window all night I tried to change the room but the hotel was fully booked bed was too small for 2 persons Queen bed noise was too laud from windows AC was off and cannot control the temp , the staff were very helpful and nice I cannot say anything regarding staff

264910,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, For cleanliness is very low and there is a cleaner of African citizenship is very hostile to the guests as if the guest come because Agadtha cleaning and avenge the guest of deliberately leaving the dirt inside the bed cover and in the corners of the room And sets of odors towels Guest understatement Quite frankly the latter was a black dot in the period of my stay Another note when booking chose the room that bathroom barriers mean it will be a place for Schauer and got away from the bathroom which does not have barriers to Shore to prevent the leakage of water for the room because bathrooms consumer somewhat drainage is not good by In the night water mired as if we were in the Titanic of water leak from the bathroom of the room The bed was also very uncomfortable and consumer , I stayed in this hotel 10 nights for the secretariat of the very location of the hotel is excellent The reception staff are very friendly and helpful when needed

264913,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, The room was very small and the smallest space for a closet that I have ever seen The toilet was separate from the bathroom and located in a space that rivalled the size of the closet There was no porter to assist with baggage , The location was great close to many restaurants and shopping and just a few blocks from Champs Elysees Nice bathroom amenities and a selection of teas and coffee provided in room 
264914,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, Shower needed shelf soap dish but thats just an observation as every thing was excellent, Reception Staff fantastic and it made up for small issues clean facilities room had all you needed although quite small just a hop skip and jump to Champs Elyesse plenty of bar restuarants and supermarkets high recommended

264920,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, We had the family suite for 4 and we loved it and the only thing that we did not like is the lack of strong lighting We would come back to a dim room and it was slightly depressing I would recommend they increase number of lights and make them stronger even in bathroom , I did not have breakfast at hotel so cannot comment on that We had the family suite and it was big enough for all 3 of us and our bags The best thing was the location a few minutes to Champs Elysee street and a lot of great restaurants around The staff were excellent and very helpful with directions etc One of our bag locks got stuck and the nice lady housekeeper helped us to reopen bag The beds and pillows were very comfortable The heating was good yet room still a little cold We had read about this before so we brought our own blankets Bathroom was great and they had these essence boxes that you could attach to shower and the water coming down would smell better The bathroom amenities that were offered were great nothing less than Hermes and they put enough towels for 4 But the nicest thing was that you get free soft drinks daily and 1 bottle of water Also free coffee was offered in the lounge for anyone all day as well as these delicious Eiffel tower shaped soft candy that were yummy and addictive I loved this hotel and would return definitely

264928,H tel Monna Lisa Champs Elys es, The room that we found on line and booked was not the room we ended up getting once we arrived We found a room with a couch and that s what we booked and once we arrived they switched our room and there was only room for 2 people instead of 3 we had to book another with additional cost which we were not expecting The hotel did discount the room at a cheeper rate but felt that the web page information was misleading ,No Positive
