264988,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, No views as the hotel in a street , Good comfortable beds and extremely friendly staff Good serviceable breakfast buffet Nice theme in lobby and in commons area Metro line is 300m or 2 blocks away 
264989,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, As this was a business trip I depend on reliable internet connection However it was very unreliable The elevator was very small and slow and the stairs to the 6th floor quite steep especially for the extra trips collecting a new room key or internet password , Clean cozy hotel with nice room and comfortable bed Very good location a short walk from the Trocad ro area with lively restaurants etc Happy and helpful staff From the top floor room I could see a glimpse of the Eiffel tower 
264990,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, Nothing really to dislike as long as you accept that nearly all hotel rooms in Paris are small by comparison to lots of other City s, Clean Great location for sightseeing Very helpful staff A good base for short breaks We have used this hotel twice and it is now our default hotel in Paris
264991,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, Nothing satisfied with everything , Loved the quirky decor in the bar lounge reception area the staff were very helpful friendly 
264992,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, Aircon is centrally set to 17 minimum fine for most but id have appreciated going a degree or two cooler after a long walk , Staff are universally friendly and helpful and enthusiaatic about helping Beds are extremely comfortable Cleaning staff are ruthlessly efficient and thorough Room is very quiet great for a good nights sleep Hotel is 10 mins to the eiffel tower and 6 minutes to the arc de triumph couldnt be better placed 
264993,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, They changed the Hotel without asking me nearby but the replacement was horrible Therefore I cant value the Hotel but this behaviour isn t business like ,No Positive
264994,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, I liked everything , I like small hotels because they have a very personalized approach The location the friendliness of the staff and the price are excellent I was staying alone in the room so the size was just right 
264995,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, I think the price is on the high side of affordable , Location Staff were very knowledgeable and helped recommend great places to visit Hotel was very clean 
264996,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, The rooms are so small that you cannot even sit at a desk to work Not good for a business location I had a late flight and when I asked for a room to change into travel clothes they referred me to the basement to change , Location
264997,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, My room was too small for my taste I was especially displeased by the fact that I was woken up almost every morning either by the noise from other rooms or by the noise of what I believe to have been a garbage truck around 6 30 7 00h So this is a 4 star hotel I believe but last time I stayed in Paris I was in a 3 star one and I liked it more as my room was very quiet , Excellent location I am pleased with the staff of the hotel Every time I needed something their reactions were polite and they did their best to do as asked I had complimentary coffee and tea in my room 
264998,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, The wifi was extremely slow and the shower was leaky It was a real pain to find a puddle of water in the bathroom when stepping out of the shower , The bed is comfortable the room and bathroom are nice although a little old and worn out The staff was also very nice 
264999,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, No kettle in room for tea only a coffee maker that doesn t heat up the water enough for tea , Very quiet room Friendly and informative staff Only a ten minute walk to Eiffel Tower and fifteen minutes to the Arch de Triumph 
265000,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, A very very noisy place I heard everything from up left and right sides of my walls and the opening door in the hotel and pouring water and etc Not easy to find parking Some lights were broken, Breakfast is very good cafe and snacks are available in the lobby Bathroom is a big Clean Range of TV channels 20 minutes to TA 
265001,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, the room is a little small but perhaps it s normal in Paris , location the staff is very friendly the hotel is near to bus stations For family with small children it is very convenient to use the the bus which go directly to the city centre and train station 
265002,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, Because I lost my passport and money in Paris So I requested to cancel the airport transportation reservation fee but rejected by hotel The image is very bad ,No Positive
265003,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, There are really not many negatives about this hotel Its a fantastic hotel My only issue is that this hotel is not really a four star If it was rated a 3 star it would be the BEST 3 star in town and customers would feel it was more accurately represented The public areas the front desk with single clerk and almost all aspects of rooms which are extremely basic don t really correspond with most of what is categorized 4 star in Europe Granted Paris standards can be very strange , The staff at this hotel are so friendly and helpful They are the most important part of making this hotel fantastic to stay at We arrived in the worst state of tiredness and with various problems and Daniel was so efficient and kind he went out of his way daily to make our stay better Everyone else was equally nice and so helpful This is a rarity in Paris The hotel is also supremely clean in ALL AREAS Best housekeeping we have seen in Paris in a long time 
265004,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro,No Negative, Very nice hotel in a central location within 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower The rooms were clean the bathrooms are quite big and we managed to get a classic room for a fair price So there is good value for money hotel if you manage to get a last minute promotion The staff at the reception were very friendly The neighbourhood of the hotel is chic and quiet 
265005,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, There really wasn t much to not like here the only thing that was a bit odd was that the toilet roll holder was a long way from the toilet I am just under 6 feet and I had to get off the seat to reach it I am also not a fan of bath shower combinations but many hotels have them , Within a 20 minute walk of either the Arc de Triomphe on one side and the Eiffel Tower on the other A funky little well presented hotel with spacious rooms 
265006,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, The bathroom flooded everytime we had a shower which was poor we had to use all our towels to soak it up, Great location the staff were brilliant 5 mins from the Eifell tower
265007,H tel Waldorf Trocad ro, I was told by Daniel that the shuttle car fee to CDG aeroport was 18 euros per person Therefore it would be 36 euros for my wife and I BUT on the morning of departure there was a different counter person and the driver Charges us 65 euros at the airport driver was Cambodian surname TAGs That was very BAD experience, Daniel was exceptional in helping us with everything we needed Always has a big smile and a sunny disposition
