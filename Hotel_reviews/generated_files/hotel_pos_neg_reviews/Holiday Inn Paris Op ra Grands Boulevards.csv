138360,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, We had requested a double room but when we got toit it had 2 single beds the reception staff were very apologetic and resolved the issue within minutes , Excellent location within Paris the hotel is 10 yards from Grands Boulevard metro station Plenty of great bars and restaurants on the door step and Opera area is within walking distance I would really recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris 
138361,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, There was not much to do inside of the hotel Not much to see or do e g swimming pool , The room was very clean and tidy it was also very comfortable The room was also extremely pretty especially the bathroom The location was amazing as it had so many shops and restaurants to go to of different types and styles 
138362,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, They kept be waiting for four hours to check in even though I informed them of my arrival time more than 72 hrs before I asked for a wake up call the day I was traveling and they never called except calling to blame me for keeping the driver waiting for me and my family for more than ten minutes and their is no house keeping after 7pm or room service, It was the worst hotel experience I had in my life and I tracked a lot from India and Sudan to the USA and U K The staff of this facility was the worst of the worst except for one young french employee from leuon
138363,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, I will never travel back to holiday inn opera very bad experience air condition r not work manager Is not helpful to customer room r very small ,No Positive
138364,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Would have preferred if complementary water bottles toiletries like tooth brush and a small shaving kit were there For the price I paid I expected little more than just a room , Location
138365,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Wifi was terribly slow I did a speed test on the network and the upload speed was 0 72 this is very slow For the price of the hotel compared to other hotels in the area or compared with other hotels in the nearby and better 1st arrondissement I don t think it was good value for the 250 a night price when I booked The location is right next to the Grands Boulevards metro which is great for getting around Paris Although the staff was very friendly and polite I was very surprised that they do not help you with your bags Upon check in a young guy helped me with my bags but upon check out I had to make 3 separate trips to my taxi in order to get all of my bags I have been in Paris for 2 weeks as I will move here next year so I m looking at apartments during my stay I have moved around every couple of days in order to check out different arrondissements Every other hotel I have stayed in during the 2 weeks has been a 4 star hotel that had great deals on booking com They were all cheaper or the same price as this Holiday Inn Novotel Paris Les Halles Empire Hotel and Spa Hotel de Seze and Lyric Hotel have all been great 4star hotels in awesome locations much nicer and in better areas than this Holiday Inn I think if it was a less expensive hotel then I would understand as I didn t have any big issues with the hotel but with booking com and all the hotel competition in Paris you can definitely find better that will really make your holiday enjoyable , The bed was comfortable and location next to metro is great for traveling around Paris Staff was always nice conversational and friendly 
138366,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Issues with the booking but it was elegantly solved upon arrival They pre charge the card with 350 nothing horrible but would have been nice to know in advance , Excellent service Booking com had sold the room as bathtub included but at the arrival there was only a shower After a bit of work from the friendly lady in the front desk she was able to get us a new room with bathtub and also with an extra sofa Nice room and nice hotel 
138367,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, It is not nice that slippers are only for executive rooms I think slippers are not executive thing Room was cold when we entered I expected the room to be warm for winter Cups and spoons at the room was not clean , Good location Grand Boulevards metro station is in front of the hotel entrance Friendly staff Nice to have kettle in the room 
138368,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Everything was good , Loved the location Metro station is in front of the hotel Hotel is very clean Room is comfortable Reception desk staff is very friendly and helpful 
138369,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, 18 00 for a breakfast buffet is a lot considering what they offered Runny scrambled eggs bacon sitting in grease soggy hash brown patty , Room was nice size Location was great Metro right out the front door many places to eat in walking distance Shower had great water pressure and was large 
138370,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Kettle s cap was a bit broken Not a big issue but still worth mentioning Before arrival we changed a credit card since previous have expired but for some reason the hotel tried to reserve an amount from old card unsuccessfully so they cancelled the booking hopefully this case was successfully solved once we arrived to the hotel and our booking was recovered , The hotel is situated near Paris heart so one can easily reach any well known location by foot e g Montmartre Notre Dame de Paris Louvre Rooms are rather wide modern and clean we got one with a kettle We also noted a very good price quality ratio with early booking Personnel assisted with the booking problem see cons 
138371,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Our rooms are on the floor with stairs before arriving the room door And we have heavy luggages that need to move up for 6 stairs are not easy , Staff are excellent and very helpful Good experience in the hotel 
138372,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, No remote for TV and although asked 4 times never received , The LOCATION was the best ever Step out the door to Line 8 and Line 9 Metro Connects to all other metro stations Room was small but perfect size Bathroom great Did not have breakfast at the hotel so cannot comment Bed comfy and room quiet
138373,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, The bed sheet was not clean when we checked in and my wife had some insect bites and the next day we asked the hotel to change and they did Need to be careful when showering in bathtub with glass door as it s bath tub is high and takes some effort to climb into and out Room service did good job of cleaning the room daily and even knew when the shower gel dispenser was empty and refilled it promptly, Location is superb Just in front of the metro station and within 15mins walk to galleries Lafayette and the Big Bus tourist bus stop is 10m away We had a big room compared to Paris standards
138374,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Small room Carpet heavily stained Room 411 Tea coffee sugar not replenished daily , Located outside Metro station Friendly front desk staff Very helpful 
138375,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, The elevators did but work a lot of the time And two out of 3 nights they could not supply us with face towels That is and was important fir me The beautiful mirror in the room was scratched , The staff and the location
138376,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Holiday inn not providing porter service to rooms especially when there are stairs to climb after getting out of the elevator Providing drinking water bottles only for 1 night out of the 6 nights we stayed No gym, Location friendly staff
138377,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Rooms were very small Rooms at the front of hotel got noise from all the bars nearby We got s great deal on booking com Definitely not worth the full price And breakfast is an extra 15 euros on top of that , The location 5 metres from the metro 
138378,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Housekeeping could have been a little tidier ie bins emptied Nothing horrendous , The location and the bistro Le Brebant next door The metro stop outside the front door with access to two lines is convenient So much within walking distance too Staff were friendly and helpful Beds were very comfortable 
138379,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, The room was really small thanks God the weather was amazing so we didn t stay so much in the room but if it had been raining it would have been a challenge But our biggest problem is that we left the hotel 2 days ago but still haven t received the pre payment back on our credit card , When we arrived the receptionist was adorable and really helpful could check in earlier than usual with no problem The room was perfectly clean the bed was really comfy and the bathroom was just perfect Also the internet worked well and when I asked for an iron I received one for the entire weekend 
138380,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, There are a broblem with the wifi conection me and a lot of guests can t login to wifi for 6 days it was very very bad thing The hotel s prices i think it s high prices , First the recipients were very likely and helpful especially abdelhak and iranian one The hotel location is excellent it s near from every thing like metro and bus stations super markets cafes and shopping store The room is very clean
138381,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, 18 is a bit excessive for the buffet breakfast but the room was cheap so made up for the cost Rooms overlooking main street can be slightly noisy , Easy check in comfy bed and clean room Usual Holiday Inn experience 
138382,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, It s locations and the quietness although it s on the grand boulvard , I enjoyed the stay at the hotel staff was helpful I can mention oceane and Eric in specific they both helped me in my luggage I tried The breakfast once I think it should be better and wider in selection I would like to thank the hotel admin for upgrading the room too 
138383,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Rooms were small to my expectation looked like a train cabin at first glance but then no major discomfort Maybe it s coz Paris must be expensive , metro station outside hotel 10 steps No major hassle for anything Good if you wanna stay for 3 4 nights Very much near opera Hop on hop off stops here 
138384,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, For muslim people breakfast is poor there is no halal food so we ate only cheese and scrambled egg price is little bit higher, very comfortable location staff clean metro station is 3 meters far from the hotel entrance 
138385,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, The rooms that overlook the boulevard are really noisy even with the double glazing I had to sleep with earplugs the room d cor is a bit bland and not very inviting The bar area is depressing The superior queen room could have been just a little bit bigger , The location is excellent right next to the metro station The wifi and a c are also excellent The bathroom was nice and modern and the queen size bed and pillows were comfortable There is a safe and minibar in the room If you book way in advance the prices are not too bad 
138386,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, while recently renovated the building is quite old Our room was in a remote corner of the hotel that could not be reached by elevator The staircase through which we had to go with our heavy suitcase was old and quite inconvenient I definitely did not like the location of our room facing a dark alley with construction going on and its size for the price we paid Euro 200 per night Luckily we were able to find a much cheaper and nicer apartment through Airbnb for the rest of our stay , Location recently renovated
138387,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Standard room was quite small and wished for a larger bed Maybe a bit expensive for the room but it was the middle of Euro 2016 and location does compensate for it , Great location no shortage of local bars and resteraunts and right outside the metropolitan 25 minute walk to the Sacre Cours and Loove
138388,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Rooms not ready plus given doubles when we d booked twins Generally it was a bit of a faff getting into them too , Great location right by Metro and loads of bars restaurants 
138389,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, I was charged twice the amount in advance When I arrived in the hotel I notified the staff I was promised a refund within 2 3 days It is now 2 weeks and still no refund ,No Positive
138390,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Very comfortable functional room cleaned to a very high standard and every day Pleasant welcoming staff Overall a very enjoyable stay thank you 
138391,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, The fact that I am a IHG member with Holiday Inn and I did not get my points for staying , Everyone was very friendly even though we got double charged 
138392,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, The bar closed at 11pm on Friday and was closed all week end Upon returning to the hotel after midnight the main entrance was locked We had to knock and show our room keys prior to entering the hotel , The comfortable beds and the absolutely excellent location The metro grands boulevards is literally right outside the hotel s main entrance The hotel staff were very helpful and polite 
138393,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, The rooms were too small and airless In my first night I stayed in a depressing room The following day I asked for a bigger and more luminous one My second room was bigger but I could touch the ceiling it was an attic Definitely not the place for a claustrophobic person like me So I wouldn t define my stay in this hotel as comfortable , The location of the hotel was good The staff was friendly The rooms were clean The bathroom was clean and modern 
138394,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, There is no free wifi internet, The stuff were amazing very helpful They always answer all our questions and do their maximum to make us comfortable It s location was perfect 0 min From metro station directly in front of the hotel door it s overall centered in Paris
138395,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Excellent location took me 15 min from Gard de Nord to walk to the hotel and to Louvre from hotel also Clean spacious and very comfotable room with all necessities Very helpful and friendly staff 
138396,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Coffee machine did not work and the bed was rather hard and the water pressure for the shower was very low Topping up of the tea coffee water toiletries was a bit erratic , The location for metro and selection of places to eat The receptionists were very pleasant and efficient Would stay again 
138397,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Only complaint is that they do not provide free Wi Fi had to fill in some forms to sign up for a membership , Just like many other travelers we have screened through many hotels just to find one that is true to pictures posted online Liked the fact that it is located conveniently in front of the metro Grands Boulevards Breakfast was decent we paid 18EUR per pax as it was not included in our room package Room was clean and comfy overlooking the streets P S there is a waffle ice cream crepe dessert shop around the corner from the hotel that opens till 7am 
138398,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Nothing , The location was really fantastic That s because the metro was close to Holiday Inn Also they served comportable service for my family such as cleaning 
138399,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Some of the staff cannot speak fluent English Beside my room cannot access by lift direct I have to take my luggage for 1 floor by stair Room is clean but the staff obviously is careless I stayed 4 night the cleaning staff give me a new shampoo every day but in fact my shower gel is running out I have to call the service desk to get a new one , The room is big and clean location is far from attraction under this price point Free wifi but slow not fast enough for business needs 
138400,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Poor housekeeping Bed not really comfortable Small window with no view , Staff was very friedly and helpful only one grumpy waitor at breakfast I liked the small breakfast option instead of the expensive buffet Central location Metro station just in front of the building 
138401,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, OnceImarrived the manager sceared me that my booking has been cancelled due to banks refusal to accept payment However letr on they found my booking reference , One step away from subway Grands Boulevard lines 8 and 9 The street is full of cafes Walking distance from Lafayett pigalle
138402,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Breakfast would be better same food everyday , Location is good 10 mins walk to Opera shopping area Room space is consider good for Paris just the double bed is pretty small 
138403,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Booked holiday inn on a famous street I wasn t expecting luxury but a decent accommodation and service standards After check in was shocked to enter a dingy room with no regular height windows room size not bigger than a single bed It was claustrophobic no water bottles with tea and coffee Highly disappointed ,No Positive
138404,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, Very disappointed Holiday Inn is usually a great chain This hotel was not up to their usual standard Most uncomfortable bed I ve ever slept in Breakfast was okay but not great Rooms could do with a renovation looking a bit tired Bar not open at weekends, Was in town for the Tour de France and this hotel is a great location 10 15 min walk to the Rue de Rivoli Plenty of great cafes bars and restaurants nearby Good transport links to the sights of Paris Staff were very nice and helpful Decent sized rooms Wifi good reasonably fast and stable
138405,Holiday Inn Paris Op ra Grands Boulevards, There was a huge music machine glued to the small bedside table leaving nowhere to keep glasses phone kindle etc without knocking them off there was a shelf underneath but that ment leaning right out of bed to access it not ideal in the night I didn t like the open plan shower sink with glass doors right in the bedroom next to the bed I prefer to wash and clean my teeth in private , Good location parking at the Bourse underground carpark is only a 4 min walk away Nice big room
