268055,Hotel Bellevue Wien, The one lift s door did not close properly on the inside and there were no sign on the door to alert the guests in the hotel about it , The room was very neat and clean and the breakfast was great The hallways were quiet and concierge service amazing A big thumbs up for the guy that assisted us though he was just a mere 2 weeks on the job 
268056,Hotel Bellevue Wien, We wanted an accomodation with car parking opportunity and it was shown that there is however when we arrived they said that no parking place left and we had to go quite far with the car our room was not ready although we arrived after 15 00 we had to wait almost 1 hour The staff is not enough for this hotel it seemed at the delay of room cleaning no problem with the quality only with timing and also at breakfast they tried everything however more staff was needed , Clean room perfect location Breakfast was ok Good price 
268057,Hotel Bellevue Wien, We didn t find many suitable places to eat in the immediate vicinity but that may be that we didn t spend enough time looking, I liked the attitude of the staff and the rooms were very spacious
268058,Hotel Bellevue Wien, A bit old furnishing but it s not a problem the hotel has the classical Vienna style No bottled water in the room , Very good breakfast fresh bread good coffee Comfortable room underground and tram stations nearby lots of parking places around the hotel free on weekends Cofee and tea set in the room 
268059,Hotel Bellevue Wien, We were at this hotel three years ago and it was really good But this time everything has changed Breakfast is complete chaos No cups tables not clean obviously understaffed You have to ask for soap toilet paper tissues and even teabags The quality is equivalent to a two star hotel or lower We visit Vienna frequently but don t offer us this hotel again never again ,No Positive
268060,Hotel Bellevue Wien,No Negative, A very nice hotel in a convenient location for the trams Also within walking distance to the centre if you enjoy walking which we do Excellent breakfast Lovely big room and comfy bed 
268061,Hotel Bellevue Wien, As already noted by others WiFi could be improved Kitchen smell at the groud and lower floors however there was no smell at all in the room Yet some ventilation could be improved to prevent such an experience in some areas rooms , Great location close to metro and even closer to tram going directly to the center Clean and tidy excelent breakfast Gym in the hotel did not use however 
268062,Hotel Bellevue Wien, In the Lobby corridors and breakfast area there was a strong terrible annoying smell of fried cooking oil , The bed was comfy and bathroom big and very clean 
268063,Hotel Bellevue Wien, Fresh coffee rather than coffee machines would ve been nice, Lovely large rooms clean and good beds and bathrooms Great setting for breakfast in the dining room
268064,Hotel Bellevue Wien, 1 The BED WAS HORRIBLE a bad quality mattress that was very old I could feel every spring inside As a result I had back pains every morning And I m too young to have back pains 2 The WIFI was either completely unavailable or very slow I had trouble accessing my email and basic websites , 1 The hotel is within walking distance from several major attractions and public transport trains and trams 2 The room is large 
268065,Hotel Bellevue Wien, Bathroom doesn t really have much space to put out your things but given that the building is bit older I don t think that there is anything to be done about it Also the elevators were a bit slow , Staff was very friendly and excellent Bed was extra comfortable Free wi fi Food in the restaurant is great very tasty and the portions are really big 
268066,Hotel Bellevue Wien, There was no garbage basket in the room They did not put new tea or coffee bags every day in fact last 2 days of my stay they did not put any, Very helpful front desk employees Near tram and metro stations Near to nice and not expensive food shops
268067,Hotel Bellevue Wien, WiFi was terrible we tried to ask for help on the reception but unfortunately they couldn t help us , Position of hotel was perfect metro station is few minutes away from hotel Clean and comfortable room 
268068,Hotel Bellevue Wien, Very bad wifi Sometimes I couldn t use viber for write messages When we arrived I looked for hairs in the bath Dirty glasses and cups aren t cleaned every day , Very kindly staff on the breakfast and reception Smoking area in quite small courtyard Supermarket and public transport stop are less than 100 meters 
268069,Hotel Bellevue Wien, Some disturbing soft noise in the room , Nice and clean room Tasty breakfast kind personnel and very good location near U bahn We were very satisfied 
268070,Hotel Bellevue Wien, The only thing that bothered me was the kitchen smell that was present all over the main public of the hotel I mean it was bad so bad that after breakfast on Sunday my clothes and my hair smelled of food It s a ventilation problem I think They should do something about it because the hotel is very nice But the smell of fried food is not a pleasant lobby perfume , The hotel is right next to the Franz Josef train station near a U4 metro station aprox 3 minutes walking and a D line tram station which goes in the centre There are some shops a Billa a DM some smaller shops and a few bars and restaurants near It is a good area in my opinion not very close to the centre but it s a nice area Our room 421 was big clean and quiet There are coffee and tea making facilities in the room The staff is very helpful and friendly The breakfast was plentiful 
268071,Hotel Bellevue Wien, No WiFi in the room Super cold bathroom with no heating system One big bed is in fact created from two small ones , Super nice hotel stuff Amazing breakfast Good underground connection to center 
268072,Hotel Bellevue Wien, The breakfast could have been a little more varied changing more often we stayed 5 nights The tap had a bit of a drip The bed could have been a little firmer It wasn t a double bed but two singles pushed together , Friendly staff Good quality bread for breakfast each morning Quiet and warm room Not in centre but in easy access to centre via tram metro 
268073,Hotel Bellevue Wien, Old bathroom and no shower only a bathtub Worn off carpets and furniture Questionable and ugly electric wiring behind the desk , Breakfast was good and diversified Long breakfast hours until 11am on the weekend Friendly and helpful staff Booked only 2 days up front which resulted in a very good price considering the included breakfast and the location of the hotel 
268074,Hotel Bellevue Wien, 1 Arrived 10 30pm Friday bar just closed no prospect of a drink Minibar poor substitute 2 Disappointing hot breakfast options not recommended 3 Minibar not kept stocked up , The hotel reception staff were extremely helpful with a directions general advice b tickets c electrical problems

268076,Hotel Bellevue Wien, The breakfast compare to the value could be better but generally everything was ok, nice location very close to Metro station Mr Petros was kind enough to give us all the information we need He is excellent 
268077,Hotel Bellevue Wien, Wifi was spotty old mattresses in rooms some liftup of rooms could be in order the rooms remind me of mid 2000 s While breakfast was good the plates are small and I eat the lot and the attendant watched me like a hawk every time I helped myself at the buffet Felt a bit uncomfortable , Friendly and helpful front desk staff large room clean bathroom The location is near train station but you have to walk 5 minutes to Metro Green line There is a supermarket right in front of the hotel so you can stock up on some basics like soda snacks etc

268080,Hotel Bellevue Wien, The bathrooms have no hooks to hang used towels which was slightly inconvenient We also had some problems after our first night with the cleaner obviously not being aware of what their job entailed the hotel only opened three days earlier so I expect this will improve The big pillows in the beds are lovely for sitting up to read or watch TV but I would have welcomed smaller extra pillows for sleeping to be made available as well , The staff was lovely and very helpful Breakfast was excellent The beds were comfortable and the room was lovely Our bedroom had windows that open radiator you can control yourself and heavy blackout curtains Very nice newly refurbished bathrooms 
268081,Hotel Bellevue Wien, As the hotel staff were still working towards their official opening some basic things could have been overlooked Would be nice to provide so e bathrobes slippers waste baskets in rooms would be good Wifi was also a little unstable lost connection a few times , The location was good Easy to get to city centre by tram Tram D station was just round the corner it was a short ride to city centre Staff was very nice helpful warm welcoming
