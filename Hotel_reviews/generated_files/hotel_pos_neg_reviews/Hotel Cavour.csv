474482,Hotel Cavour, All i thought after viewing the photos of the property that they have Jacuzzi to relax i paid extra 15 for the sala fitness only to find out that there is none , The staffs are very accommodating the location is near the city center comfy bed 
474483,Hotel Cavour,No Negative, Room was perfect Large comfortable Clean The bathroom was large and comfortable All what you can expect from a good hotel The Hosts were very helpful and very kind Breakfast was huge The value for money was great The Hotel is 20 minutes walk from Duomo Milan Center Check out was 12 00 and this is a Huge Plus 
474484,Hotel Cavour, Advice to tourists were inadequate , The hotel s location is very central and in close proximity to important places in Milan The staff was helpful and friendly Staff at the Restaurant were very helpful too It was a good old hotel 
474485,Hotel Cavour, It s 21st century and wifi is not working at all Nowadays it is not a luxury feature but a necessity , It was very clean Staff is very friendly and helpful Location is great 
474486,Hotel Cavour, Need to better up the breakfast Although the parking facilities are perfect using them are really expensive , Very clean extremely quite even if it was very close to center perfectly located All is all very good A recommendation is to book the newer superior room as they are not that much more expensive 
474487,Hotel Cavour, A slight problem with the old fashioned key attached to the e card when the room is occupied by 2 people with different schedules Americans might need to ask for the bigger rooms available , Beds extra comfy Noise insulated windows Incredible air conditioning Excellent WiFi Good and cheap hotel restaurant Bery clean
474488,Hotel Cavour, Nothing, We loved the location of the hotel easy walk to the main shopping district The hotel was extremely comfortable and of course very clean and tidy The staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was absolutely divine No complaints at all 
474489,Hotel Cavour, It was noisy at night because of other guests slamming doors and speaking in their rooms , The hotel staff was very welcoming and smiling I arrived aunt too early for the Checkin but they let me in as the room was ready It is perfectly located for a short stay in Milano if you want to do a bit of tourism 
474490,Hotel Cavour, Wifi connection was not stable When returning to your room you should use a username and a password every time, Location is really great as I had a lot of meetings on a walking distance from the hotel
474491,Hotel Cavour, The breakfast was not that good excluding fruit What made us angry was that we had dinner in the restaurant of the hotel one day the bill was like 48 and we paid 50 by cash we were going to leave the 2 change as tips however the waiter did not give us the 2 change back and did not even say a word , The room was big and comfortable the staff at the reception bar and at the breakfast lounge was nice and the fresh fruit of the breakfast was delicious 
474492,Hotel Cavour,No Negative, Hotel was very cozy and easy to access It was near Brera the restaurant district and all the major sights That staff was helpful Best hotel breakfast during our Northern Italy tour by train for over a week 
474493,Hotel Cavour, The breakfast have very little type of food The 1st floor restaurant is crowded , The premium room having wonderful technology and lighting system There is small Tv screen at the toilet mirror I like it The location is not so far from duomo 
474494,Hotel Cavour, Were given a small room with five coat hangers for a 4 night stay where the bathroom door hit the toilet when opened Asked for a different room and had a much better room 3 doors away Why give away the small poor rooms first Was it because we weren t Italian The bar and lounge blended into each other from the reception area with no atmosphere whatsoever Consequently we went out every night , There was nothing about this hotel that we really liked although it was only a short walk from lovely restaurants after turning right out of the hotel Attached photos are of the lounge and breakfast area 
474495,Hotel Cavour, Parking costs EUR39 day We found a few even more centrally located hotels that should put a premium on parking but still seemed to agree on EUR24 day In the end the Cavour turned out a cost effective solution overall but the cost of the parking component looks excessive Parking is on site and quite convenient though , Excellent location at the end of via Manzoni walking distance to Duomo La Scala Brera major shopping areas restaurants etc close to the underground easy to reach by car Comfortable room first rate breakfast helpful and friendly staff All that at a reasonable price for a major city like Milano 
474496,Hotel Cavour, Not enough affordable family restaurants in the area Those that are there Are closed at dinner time , Great hotel frendly staff great breakfast great location for walking to center of Milano fashion district and the Duomo Easy access to public transit 
474497,Hotel Cavour, Extremely unfriendly staff arrogant unreliable unhelpful late with everything totally unapologetic A horrific experience A disaster in organization , Location was good
474498,Hotel Cavour, The front desk staffs are UNFRIENDLY UNHELPFUL and rude room service staff Don t expect a warm welcome or goodbyes nor some help with your huge luggages even if you are a lady They just don t care , The room is clean and comfortable good location as well 
474499,Hotel Cavour,No Negative, Hotel Cavour is an excellent hotel The staff are very friendly helpful and professional They make you feel welcome and treat you as a welcome quest The hotel is very central and close to the city centre and the Breda district The room was very clean well serviced and having a chocolate put on your bed before bed time is a very nice and personal touch My room had a bath which was good for a nice soaking after a long day of walking I used the excellent spa facility and particularly enjoyed the steam room The spa was also very clean and the spa amenities bag includes a robe and jandals The buffet breakfast was very good too with a wide range of food The cappuccino was tasty and the range croissant very tempting I tried the chocolate and whole wheat ones There were even vegan ones The only suggestion I have is to provide more coffee and tea in the rooms and also some milk There is however a well stocked small supermarket very close to the hotel in the Breda neighbourhood I can recommend this hotel WiFi is free and the signal is strong 
474500,Hotel Cavour, It does get crowded at breakfast so you need to plan when you want to eat Preferably a little before 9am But that was never a problem , The staff was very friendly We arrived late the next morning because of our flight but they kept the room for us and even invited us to have breakfast first The location was close to all the places we need to visit Everything was within walking distance from the hotel What I love about this hotel was the neighborhood it was located in There was a park behind the hotel which gave a relaxing walk to get away from the crowds This was a perfect place to be in when staying in Milan

474503,Hotel Cavour, Nothing we got exactly what we expected, We had a functional room which was comfy and a view onto the main road Great mini bar house keeping every day 
474504,Hotel Cavour, Bacon was too crispy and felt like it had added salt my window view was of a woman feeding some birds , staff was fantastic and wifi was excellent Overally a good stay
474505,Hotel Cavour, Cavour can be very expensive for what you get it all depends of the faires since this hotel has a lot of business and fashion guests , The breakfast its clean the bar
474506,Hotel Cavour, I booked a standard room which was very comfortable but there was the noise from other rooms I would recommend that guests choose to pay the extra for a premium room instead They look as if they wouldn t have the same noise issue , The location was excellent and so were the staff The breakfast was very good and the room was comfortable 
474507,Hotel Cavour, The Bathroom is quite small , Breakfast was excellent The location of the hotel is perfect for tourists that want to know the city and places of interets

474515,Hotel Cavour,No Negative, Hotel is ideally located you re in walking distance of the city centre but far enough away from the hubbub to ensure restful sleep The staff are very helpful The double room we had was not spacious but very comfortable clean and well serviced 
474516,Hotel Cavour, Parking garage was remote and no valet Very stressful procedure to park the car Rooms were over priced very small Beds old and uncomfortable No iron for clothes Rooms on street side very hot and noisy , Good location in middle of Milan Courteous staff at the front desk They gave me a 15 discount for broken air conditioner without any unpleasant arguments 
474517,Hotel Cavour, We had basic single rooms which were very clean and had every facility we needed but perhaps they could be a little brighter and more colourful , We loved the friendly atmosphere and the overall sense of comfort It was a joy to relax in the foyer with a coffee or glass of wine after a busy day The bar area which also served light meals was great and the complimentary snacks added to the pleasure The staff were amazing and I would particularly mention Kumar who staffed the bar and was always so pleasant and efficient The hotel was convenient for walking to the centre of the city and there were many restaurants in the Brera area close by 
474518,Hotel Cavour, No air conditioning, No air conditioning The room was very uncomfortable and I had to change to a quieter room so I could open the window How can a hotel get 4 stars without air conditioning I heard others complaining of the same thing
474519,Hotel Cavour,No Negative, The staff were excellent from the reception to bar colleagues Always helpful with excellent English For example reception provided us with excellent suggestions to enjoy a day trip to Lake Como 
474520,Hotel Cavour, We stay at this hotel 3 to 4 time a year and this time our room was the smaller And not basket of fruits My friend had a very big room and the fruits I do not understand,No Positive
474521,Hotel Cavour, Pictures shows spa incl and no additional info on booking com that you have to pay 15 EUR per pax for 2 hours Spa is very small and no jacuzzi as also shown on pictures But clean and relaxing Staff seemed a bit uninterested , The breakfast was perfect Hotel situated close to Milano city centre Clean rooms Nice little bar area to enjoy a night cap but closing to early 24 00 
474522,Hotel Cavour, The excellent location the helpful staff, We have known this Hotel for 40 years The new premium rooms are really excellent and the staff as usual is very kind and helpful 
474523,Hotel Cavour,No Negative, Besides the hotel its location is perfect for me I lived in Milano many years ago like this area when I visit often This is the 1st time I tried this hotel I will return 
474524,Hotel Cavour, Internet is not included in the price and should be added as an extra Not good given the price of the room, Room is spacious and clean Bed is comfortable
474525,Hotel Cavour, Breakfast could be improved also pay attention to various services which cost money Wi Fi is 9 euro per day Parking is 39 euro per day Also the room is quite small , The location was quite good around 15 minutes walk from the Dome

474527,Hotel Cavour, No bathrobe A bit overpriced , Extremely helpful and friendly staff providing with all necessary information and services Decent breakfast for Italy same every day though Overall good impression 
474528,Hotel Cavour, The pillows are not soft But I ve asked and the staff gave me a softer pillow , Location is very good Near Brera and the Quadrilatero della Moda Bus stops in front tram stops just around the corner and metro station 2 mins walking 
474529,Hotel Cavour, Bed and pillows in standard room Breakfast area was too small for size of hotel and food wasn t replenished frequently enough, Executive rooms were excellent Standard room was quite poor with very hard bed and pillows
474530,Hotel Cavour, Breakfast was fine but not memorable , Fantastic location close to everything Secure parking Sleek high tech rooms including colored led lighting Great beds very quiet 
474531,Hotel Cavour,No Negative, The location is very nice for someone that wants to keep some privacy yet the hot spots are quite close to the hotel It is not in a typical touristic area so it is more calm and quiet 
474532,Hotel Cavour, This is not their fault necessarily so Im not including it in my rating but its worth mentioning that there is an unstated 5 Euro per person per night tax that is not advertised on Booking com It was explained as a tourist tax to help with the upkeep of historical sites but that is ridiculous since they all have steep entrance charges to access anyway Almost every museum or site has a charge already associated with it Just be aware that for example you are staying for five nights and your credit card has been charged on Booking com that you will still be paying more when you arrive A couple staying for 5 nights would end up paying 50 Euro 53 more than what the advertised price was on Booking com so its worth being aware of and I dislike the fact that it is not clearly stated in advance The only other dislikes here would be the beds and pillow that were very uncomfortable but in the grand scheme of things it is not a show stopper The TV was a weird little 14 inch think mounted on top of a cabinet at a strange upward angle that made it impossible to watch Again not a huge deal for us since we didn t plan on spending any time in the room watching TV anyway , Wonderful location about a 10 minute walk from Duomo Piazza 15 minutes to the Castello and 10 minutes to the canal district so very centrally located and perfect for moving around on foot Staff is friendly and helpful we asked all kinds of annoying questions from the desk and they were in good humor and gave us great information that helped a alot 
474533,Hotel Cavour, Breakfast was poor and not as wrote that it is very good In Italy they should make better specially in these days when guests knows what is good or not , Very friendly personals As 4 Stars is ok
474534,Hotel Cavour, We did hear some talking and noises in adjacent rooms in the hallways after hours , Very well appointed and comfortable room and pleasant hotel All the basic amenities of the US hotel with a few nice extras 
474535,Hotel Cavour, Unfortunately service at reception was really unfriendly and kind of rude I didn t see 9 out 10 almost any smile on their faces when I asked something or when I left and got my room key everyday , The location breakfast and clean rooms 
474536,Hotel Cavour, Everything was fine , The most amazing thing was the Turkish bath and huge romantich bathtub for two and a TV built into the bathroom mirror Turkish bath is a really special feature We really enjoyed it in cold November weekend Also the room was very spacious 47 m2 with 15 m2 bathroom 
474537,Hotel Cavour,No Negative, we arrived earlier that day just to drop off the luggage they offered us to take the room much earlier than expected also breakfast the next day was paid but impossible to take because of early flight they offered it on the arrival day since it was still in time great service 
474538,Hotel Cavour, N a, The location Walking distance to La Scala and other tourist attractions Professional staff Great breakfasts Good wifi Lots of English tv channels 
474539,Hotel Cavour, a bit noise from the room next door, Very kind staff Breakfast is wonderful Non smoking room very pleasant The maid tidied the room in a very cozy and luxurious way Because we left early to the airport we got a bag breakfast Very comfortable bed
474540,Hotel Cavour, Our room was quite small yet nice and confortable Just avoid going by car as the hotel is inside the restricted traffic zone the hotel reports your plate to avoid fines and parking is very expensive , Perfect location nice hotel friendly staff nice breakfast 
474541,Hotel Cavour, Nothing at all to dislike, Good location charming 1960 s feel about the hotel yet up to date modern rooms bathrooms Decent breakfast V good value for money considering the central location Friendly helpful staff

474543,Hotel Cavour, The staff is not happy nothing against to clients but they look like they are not happy about what they do , Very good breakfast Great location 45 60 mn to Malepnsa using Malpensa express and metro 2 minutes to Av Manzani Clean rooms

474545,Hotel Cavour, Nothing to report, Rooms and bathrooms very clean super confy beds very good quality and great size toiletries showers with chromotherapy are amazing Nice breakfast choices and attentive personnel 
474546,Hotel Cavour, Apart from our premium room the other areas of the hotel was quite old and tired looking Breakfast was decent but so dominated with all things bread and pastries These was some eggs and bacon as well , The Premium room was in a newly renovated area of the hotel It has amazing features such as multi coloured lighting in the room and the shower Everything was finished to the highest standard These features made up for the otherwise quite a small size of the room The staff serving breakfast was fast and attentive The location is excellent as it s walking distance to the busy streets near The Duomo 
474547,Hotel Cavour, No milk was provided for tea in the room, The staff were extremely nice especially the Barman Kumar We had the executive room with the Turkish bath it really was outstanding 
474548,Hotel Cavour, Rooms too small At the front desk not everyone is at the same level of help and assistance, The location was perfect Room too small Breakfast tasty and very good but not too many options 
474549,Hotel Cavour, When you re being charged well over 300 a night you don t expect to be charged an extra 8 per day for a wifi password which in other Italian hotels is usually free I think other extras which we didn t use were also overpriced so you get the feeling that you re being ripped off in a rather silly way , Outstanding location walking distance to Brera La Scala Duomo and the new museum of twentieth century art and good soundproofing our room overlooked a busy street but one heard nothing 
474550,Hotel Cavour, Tea and coffee facilities in the room very poor I have had better in a 2 star hotel and I would not stay here again for that reason may seem picky but far from it ,No Positive
474551,Hotel Cavour, Nothing worthy of mention , A really good comfortable clean affordable city hotel Very well situated for main attractions and with all facilities you expect require 
474552,Hotel Cavour, Carpets in hallway might need renovating , Excellent location Great breakfast We were given an inside room and at our request we were moved to another one with a view to the street immediately 
474553,Hotel Cavour, The only thing which was quite weird was the feeling that the hotel s personnel couldn t find our booking That s why the third bed wasn t ready for our arrival But anyway the solution was found really fast , The hotel is situated in a great place It is really easy to get there The breakfasts were really nice But the best thing about the hotel is definietely its rooms We lived in an executive room and it was really good Great design conncted with comfort 
474554,Hotel Cavour, The furnishings in the room were a bit old and rooms are accessed with a key which you have to leave at reception each time you leave the hotel do any good hotels still use keys instead of cards , Nice and fresh breakfast 
474555,Hotel Cavour, Bar drinks bit pricey , Great location Room was lovely and clean and spacious Air con was a huge factor as temp were 34oc outside Breakfast was well equipped 
474556,Hotel Cavour, The breakfast is very poor and there is no room dinning and parking value is very high The resturant in the hotel is not good The AC was liking in my room, The location is ecellent The staff was kind and helpful

474571,Hotel Cavour, When arrived it was overbooked It seemed solved by moving to a similar hotel around the corner for the first night and the next two nights back with an upgrade The first night in hotel Marin was horrible though not clean smelly room and itchy sheets Upgrade was great though , Very nice staff helpfull and interested The upgrade rooms were nice spacious and clean nice bathroom and walk in closet 
474572,Hotel Cavour, The room can be more modern but i see that they start to change next time we will take the premium and the price for parking is absolutely too much ,No Positive
474573,Hotel Cavour, A minor detail the front doors failed to open once and guests inside had to alert staff to open the doors It happened during the day and there were guests inside and outside so wasn t really an issue , Location was very good close to public transport shopping and sights Front desk staff were helpful and able to advise on getting tickets finding a supermarket etc

474583,Hotel Cavour, There was some construction going on at the hotel and banging Saturday morning quite early woke me up However this is likely a temporary state of affairs , I ve stayed at many different hotels in the Milan area over the years and really liked this one The location was perfect we had tickets at the Scala and it was a short walk to the Opera Duomo Galleria from the hotel The hotel was clean comfortable sunny and had sound reinforced windows Staff was efficient I didn t eat breakfast but it looked plentiful

474590,Hotel Cavour, The room was overheated by our standards There was no iron in the room but one available on the same floor , The room and renovated bathroom were lovely The breakfast was 1st rate The staff were very helpful and the location was pretty good for walking to the Duomo and the castle The 12 o clock check out was a real bonus 
474591,Hotel Cavour, The room was great but had a funny smell that despite telling housekeeping didnt go away , Everything was good had a super meal at the hotels restuarant
474592,Hotel Cavour, The breakfast room was as hot as a sauna which is not a good thing Wifi in my room was not reliable , Helpful staff Location was good for Brera in one direction and Duomo in the other 
474593,Hotel Cavour, Parking at booking com there is information that hotel has its own parking but there is not You have to park the car by yourself at other street for 40evrp per night The bed wasnt comfortable Pure breakfast, The location 
474594,Hotel Cavour, Decor of reception area slightly out dated and did not match modern look of room Breakfast quite crammed, High technology in rooms House keeping excellent Helpful reception staff
474595,Hotel Cavour, Limited tea and coffee no milk Bathroom maintenance is poor so marble looks dirty hotel reception looks dated carpet is old Breakfast varieties are sad , We stayed at the executive wing room is newer and big with good bathroom and walk in closet
474596,Hotel Cavour, The photos of their add at booking com and the reality did not match We were in an old room The take away breakfast was just biscuites and jam , The location 
474597,Hotel Cavour, The personnel was completely uninterested in the guests I booked a superior room and the rate included room service nevertheless upon our arrival we were accommodated in a standard room When I went downstairs and asked staff at the reception if there has been a mistake I could see from the pictures in the email confirmation that the rooms were supposed to look very different I was rudely replied You have a superior room madam we are not trying to cheat here The pictures are not correct When I asked about a difference in the room standard in that case it was explained by provided vegan shampoo shower gel in superior rooms which was a bit ridiculous given the room pictures on the website and elevator showed different The included room service was admitted only after I showed the confirmation of the booking and asked the guy to check with his manager although the room has not been changed after all and no apologies for any caused inconvenience were given by either of them It is a real pity as the neighbourhood and facilities of the hotel are really good our standard room was quite nice and comfortable But because of the reaction of the personnel and the way they handled this situation I will not stay there again , The location of the hotel was perfect great neighbourhood close to subway and in walking distance to many sightseeing places
