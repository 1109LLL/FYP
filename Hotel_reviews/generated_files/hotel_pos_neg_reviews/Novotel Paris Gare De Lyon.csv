90336,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, the abruptness of some of the breakfast staff some of the serving staff were very helpful and kind the front of house however was quite rude in her approach the area around the hotel doesn t feel particularly safe with a young child There were quote a few homeless people taking refuge beside the entrance and to the right of the hotel on the steps between the main train station and the hotel entrance It put me on edge a little and the smells were fairly unpleasant , reception staff were very helpful even though the lady who checked us in was being trained at the time we didn t mind at all The room was clean tidy and comfortable
90337,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, more coffee toiletries The situation for our visit was good but not a particularly nice clean area probably because near main line station , comfy bed helpful staff near to the restaurant we wanted to visit Le Train Bleu excellent
90338,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, For the first time I saw toilet not only not sanitized after previous visitor but not even clean Yellow half dried stains with long hair stuck right on the toilet seat grrrr that was disgusting Second thing was breakfast For the first time in my life I decided to have it outside after seeing what Novotel served Pathetic sausages and omelet In Paris you kidding me Even a year ago it was much better And the personnel Every year they keep asking if that is my first time in Paris Except for reception no one speaks English During the check out they didn t ask if I liked the stay didn t offer the bill after I asked for a bill need it for accounting department they didn t give an envelope , The room except for the toilet was clean and comfortable Not cosy but comfortable enough 
90339,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, The location is great in relation to the station but in a less desirable part of Paris This didn t affect our stay though , Welcoming friendly and comfortable Staff were very helpful The room was spacious and clean The communal areas were home from home Overall a really nice stay and I would book again

90341,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Too hot Although it appeared that we were setting the temperature in our room the room uncomfortably warm during our stay at the start of May The air coming from air cond was not cold When we asked to someone to check the cooling in our room we were advised that the air conditioning was switched off for the whole building for the season , Nice indoor pool good fitness room Beds quite comfortable Cool window frosting on off switch in the bathroom 
90342,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, The outside of the hotel entry way front of the hotel smelled of urine constantly because of the area and never seem to be cleaned up by the city, Incredible customer service very helpful staff couldn t of asked for better treatment

90344,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Room seemed small for a superior and very cramped once the sofa bed was made up it didn t look like the photo Breakfast was disappointing as all of the fruit we tried tasted odd and restaurant was really in need of a face lift The tourist information was lacking somewhat with us being given completely wrong information by one of the staff , Staff friendly and helpful one of them going out of her way to get me some hair conditioner another booking tickets for the Louvre for us Great location right next to the station for easy access to everything 
90345,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon,No Negative, The hotel was very good at all Its close to the train station and its accessible by public transport from every part of the city The rooms are spatious well furnished and clean 
90346,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Initially the window in our room opened without a catch or lock and our toddler could very easily have fallen out the sofa was just below it so easy to climb up to it They moved us to another room though when we raised this concern Also and no fault of the hotel unfortunately the square outside the hotel seems to be used by homeless people drinking so it often stank and was pretty unsavoury to walk through not unsafe particularly but unhygienic , Breakfasts were quite nice and they had children s entertainers The lobby had a separate games area too for children 
90347,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, I would love to see some sort of service whereby travellers heading to Gare de Lyon with heavy bags especially older women like myself could avail themselves of a porter or some help to get from the hotel to the train station as it is difficult to manage luggage along the street and up stairs etc Perhaps a porter service that could be booked on line at the time of the hotel reservation Just a thought ,No Positive
90348,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Neighbourhood is not ideal for walking around not many things to do see you have to go in the centre with the Metro There is no sign for the hotel when coming with metro train I suggest to use exit 11 Sortie 11 , Metro station near hotel breakfast was good the room nice and clean children loved the small pool From airport to hotel from Disneyland to hotel and from hotel to centre of Paris this location is really suitable without any taxi walking distance Free internet a little children playroom and nice staff made the day

90351,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Unfortunately the quickest access to it direct from the gare de lyon train station was via a wee urine smelling badly light side street As we spent our time in out of the train station commuting to various attractions with two children the quick route to from the hotel from the train station was the only off putting part about the hotel , The hotel was super clean modern efficient and quiet Great sound insulation between rooms The staff were amazingly helpful We would definitely stay here again but would access the hotel via a different route 
90352,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, It was very busy at breakfast but they did not have enough staff to replenish everything So often not enough bowls cups etc, Good location for central Paris Helpful staff

90359,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Due to location when wandering the area you cannot avoid the sex shops amusing for children , What you would expect from a chain hotel clean and standard used as a jump point for the gare de Lyon walked out of the back of the hotel straight into the gare de lyon 
90360,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, we are probably used to water in a pool being much warmer but probably normal for hotels abroad, kids liked soft drinks in free minibar and loved the games room especially the xbox and interactive tables we also loved the pool

90362,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, It was quite a warm weekend and the air con did not work Too loud to keep window open Assume the air con for the hotel is generally turned off until later in the year Disappointed to not be able to control the room temperature given the cost of the rooms , Tidy modern rooms and good location 
90363,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Room temperature was so hot in the early morning everyone was sweating in the room Breakfast area is fully crowded especially the coffee machine area is blocking the way if you sit inside the breakfast area , Fantastic location nearby the train station and taxi can be easily to pick up and drop off in front of the entrance

90365,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon,No Negative, It is exactly what you would expect of a city Novotel very conveniently placed next to the Gare De Lyon Quiet room which was great after a long days travel
90366,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, First of all I should say that I m a Genius member of Booking com and in the hotel s features I read that they offer 2 hours early and late check in and check out respectively but when I arrived to hotel and I was extremely exhausted they told me they do not know any thing about it and I stayed almost 3 4 hours in lobby for my room Secondly I paid cash and I paid all the price of the hotel 5nights in check in and they took a guaranty fee as usual BUT i was in other hotels also Parisian hotels and I m aware of guaranty fee they charged me 800 for 5 nights 2 rooms It s so much Thirdly the reception forgot to give me back my exchange money 2 times and always I was like I think you should give me Moreover the range of breakfast options was not too much compared to the hotel s stars Generally speaking i was in at least 5 Novotel hotels but it s the worst , Its location is great just 5 minute walk to Gare de Lyon station which connects many lines to each other The hotel is almost clean and compared to other Parisian hotel is chic and elegant WiFi is so good
90367,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Breakfast was a little disappointing There was lots of food and an extensive buffet but the taste was a little disappointing , Location was perfect as we were travelling from gare de Lyon next day Very friendly staff lovely coffee in room and at breakfast There was even entertainment for the children at breakfast which added to their enjoyment of their stay 
90368,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, We paid extra to get an executive room With that came with a coffee pod machine and free Mini Bar I was looking forward after a long day of travelling to check into the room and have a couple of relaxing drinks Once in the room I find the Mini Bar consists of one small can of warm beer fridge dosnt get turned on until after you enter the room a few waters and a couple of soft drinks No other alcohol besides the warm beer So I got the warm beer and the wife had a glass of warm water We were Disapointed There was enough milk for 1 coffee each and you had to drink that out of a cheap little plastic disposable cup Executive room my Ass We have stayed in cheap hotels in the past but they at least had a coffee glass ceramic cup Bed was very hard and uncomfortable Not worth the money , Location to public transport was great Great TV set in room nice and clean 
90369,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, It was good to have coffee and tea making facilities in the room but it would be nice to have proper cups even plastic ones drinking hot coffee or tea out of a paper cup is tricky , Very convenient location right next to Gare de Lyon and yet very quiet I stayed for five nights and slept like a log each night 
90370,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Mini bar could of had more than 1 beer Pool didn t look inviting and over looked by reception so didnt use it with 2 small children , The staff All polite and helpful

90372,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Having arrived late we tried to order room service as some of us hadn t eaten since midday that day The printed menu offered a small but reasonable selection but everything we ordered was not available and we could only have the Caesar salad Also the trays with the finished plates were not collected from outside the room until late the following day , Excellent location close to Gare de Lyon and within walking distance of the AccorHotels Arena so perfect if going to a concert there Friendly helpful staff and the family room was a reasonable size Good breakfast buffet worth booking 
90373,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, We booked an ajoining room six mths before our trip so our kids were safe next to us and it was given away to someone else Plus outside the hotel is area is a bit run down aroun the hotel not hotel itself, Room spacious modern clean and comfortable
90374,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Pool was freezing and pretty scabby Needs a facelift as does the changing room area Very poor shower in it Looks great in photo but not in reality Didn t see anyone using it probably for that reason Shame , Breakfast was amazing Crepes croissants scrambled egg bacon baguettes cereal fruit and the list goes on Good location right next to the Gare du Lyon Lovely walk along the river to Notre Dame which is not far or pick up an Open bus tour at Gare du Lyon which will take you around the area if you don t want to walk

90376,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, I displayed Do not disturb outside room but they still opened my room in my absence which is not ethical , Just behind Gar De Lyon station and you can travel easily
90377,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Food wasn t great AVOID room service Eat out for the same price and not be disappointed , The hotel was spotless well worth going The local bars were great and the metro was only 2 mins walk would definitely stay here if I visit Paris again

90425,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, No complaints at all , We had a weekend stop on the way home from camping in the south of france and chose this hotel because it had an underground car park and we had a car full of stuff a roof box and bikes It didn t go quite according to plan as the car park head height was only 1 9m so we had to take off the bikes AND the top box Luckily the super helpful staff found a big space in their storage room for us We particularly liked the swimming pool gym and the late checkout on Sunday 5pm because we had a family room The rooms are really nice with modern decor overlooking a small modern square next to the station We loved the glass screen between the bathroom and bedroom which turned translucent at the flick of a switch

90428,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, The reception guy can t even speak English thats the first 4 star hotel I ve experienced with language difficulties Have no sense of service and use more than 20 mins to do the check in I still think they charged me twice for the room cause I received the notification from my first card says payment success and they asked me for the second card , the room is clean and tidy
90429,Novotel Paris Gare De Lyon, Room I received was not the room I believed anticipated I had booked Travelling with two young people 11 13 thought I had booked two sofa beds but assume confusion arose as age 13 is classified as adult We had a queen bed a sofa bed whilst far from ideal was comfortable enough Lack of storage space for clothing was a real issue only hanging space really given that we were three people there for a week we had to keep most of our clothing in cases which looked untidy made room feel more cramped than it actually was We stayed for seven nights perhaps this length of stay is unusual Breakfast continental seemed to be overpriced at 18 euros per person per day in the hotelwhen you consider a croissant or pain au chocolate fresh from a patisserie was 1 euro Square outside the hotel surrounding the gare de Lyon seemed to be a meeting place for groups playing backgammon other board games but throughout the day seemed to also have lots of drinkers homeless beggars I walked through there very early one morning it was clear that many people had been sleeping on benches in the construction area There was a rat scurrying back forth in plain site of everyone no one seemed concerned Perhaps it was ratatouille from the animated film I would not have let my family walk there unaccompanied at any time of day Upset concerned by the number of families around this area sleeping rough prevalent all over Paris even in the champs lys es near the Eiffel Tower, Staff were very helpful their English put my schoolgirl French to shame Hotel was modern spacious rooms were comfortable bright Beds were comfortable bedlinen crisp white rooms were cleaned daily Mini fridge was useful for chilling drinks storing snacks A request for extra pillows was met quickly Had we not been family the glass shower might have been an issue but fogging switch on glass gave no end of fun it was a bonus that toilet was separate Pool fitness room were a welcome addition which we did use but not as frequently as we wished we had The front entrance I assume which leads into a square next to the gare de Lyon had some construction work was going on in the square looked a little unsightly The back entrance which is the only road that taxis etc can access can also be unsightly particularly in the morning but the hotel entrance foyer all made up for that Easy access to metro train bus taxi ber from hotel Also easy access to blue line L euro open bus tour which we used Did not have breakfast there but Ate in the hotel restaurant once for evening meal meal was superb not inexpensive but little in Paris is For family health reasons we also had room service on our last night that was a real treat well presented prompt Lots of places around this area to have breakfast evening meal Supermarkets nearby a monop a small mono prix had fresh baguettes sandwiches drinks Gare de Lyon is amazing the clock tower is stunning visit the station if only to marvel at the sheer size three floors number of shops to see the incredible Le train bleu One day I will eat there Would definitely use Novotel Accor again would use this hotel if I visit Paris again
