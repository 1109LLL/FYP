139633,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The room was a lot smaller than I anticipated and much more suited to a work trip rather than a romantic getaway it overlooked a carpark and there was no minibar , The lobby is beautiful and location is great very central 
139634,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I can t think of anything I didn t like , The hotel was really clean and inviting and were even given a fresh cookie each on arrival We had a twin room which was comfy and spacious enough for the two of us Huge choice of breakfast available including a cooked breakfast buffet style Location was great for Westminster it took us about 30 minutes to walk to the West End which for us was absolutely fine

139639,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We asked for a room with a view stuck us in front of parking We asked for a ride from the airport and did not even respond Small room with no room to lay clothes A noisy air conditioner The entrance of a staff woman into a room without an invitation to a room when we were inside pretend to make sure everything is all right The bathroom sink was not cleaned all the days we were there Somehow they got 4 stars We would give 3 max Make no mistake and be fooled by the name Hilton , Good location near the Perlmano and Big Ben

139641,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, While not family unfriendly it was apparent that the hotel was more for business travelers and those without children We only stayed one night but it might have been more challenging to stay longer with our 6 year old , Front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating We arrived early from the States and were able to get one of 3 rooms available prior to scheduled check in times Good location within decent walking distance to many top sites Westminster Parliament Big Ben Buckingham Palace Nice size dining room with good breakfast buffet Comfortable beds
139642,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Bed was a little too soft to be picky but not a big problem The lighting was a little inadequate , The cookies and flavoured drinks at the reception and the gym

139650,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Thought the bathroom let the room down Large breakfast buffet but completely tasteless bacon and even worse sausages Why would a hotel chain skimp on the quality of a few breakfast essentials which then stick in your mind Bizarre , Good location depending on where you need to be Modern and decent public areas Nice enough bedroom but small unimpressive bathroom Overall good value for money tho at booking com reduced rates 
139651,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The iMac in the room wasn t working but we didn t use it and kept forgetting to mention it to staff when we would leave for the day We left a note in the room for them so I m sure they fixed it once they knew about the problem , Room was modern and super comfortable and free wifi Yay I flew to London so didn t have a car but the hotel wasn t very far from the underground and constantly had taxi service if needed It was also within walking distance of Westminster Abbey Parliament London Eye area It also had air conditioning and constantly provided flavored water in the lobby seriously going to have to start making watermelon strawberry rosemary infused water at home The cookies were delicious too 
139652,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Bad location Pimlico not Westminster Very small room Poor view all I could see was the side of another building may as well been on the ground floor Staff stressed not a relaxing hotel at all Queuing for breakfast at least 25 mins Waiting 30 minutes to book in hotel, Nothing

139658,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Our window opened up onto the Lift area so needed to keep curtains shut at times Made the room a little dark when there was beautiful sunshine to enjoy, Very welcoming with warm chocolate chip cookies and cold flavoured water in the lobby Room was large enough for two and very clean Hotel is well situated off the beaten track so quiet and away from the throngs of Tourists but still just steps away from Westminster and the Thames Would definitely stay here again

139662,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster,No Negative, Good location near Lambeth Bridge and Tate Britain On John Islip Street but a back entrance lets you out directly onto the Thames Nearest Tube station is Pimlico but it isn t too much further to walk to Vauxhall or Westminster Staff all very pleasant and helpful both at Reception and breakfast We had booked an Executive Room so were able to avail ourselves of the wine and canap s on Friday evening before our trip to the theatre We could have had breakfast in the Executive Lounge too but chose to eat in the main restaurant where there is a lot more choice at no extra cost Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice Lovely bread

139666,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The mattress on the bed was extremely uncomfortable and springy Would have preferred a proper sized TV rather than a Mac screen , The property was clean staff very helpful and friendly and location was perfect There was a Mac in the room which could also be used as a TV 
139667,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The breakfast food in the on site city cafe was terrible and way over priced Eggs bacon were over cooked and sausages were dangerously under cooked We walked out feeling unsatisfied and robbed due to the extremely high cost of the buffet Another disappointment was the lack of a pool on site for such a high priced hotel , Gymnasium was in a great location on the top floor with excellent views although very small and under equipped Hotel staff were friendly and helpful

139677,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The carpet in the city cafe was filthy and quite off putting Breakfast was ok but not up to the usual Hilton standard Rooms were just like a premier inn A little bit too far from the tube stations , The staff were helpfull The location was good for westminster On a good bus route to the city centre 
139678,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Odd contretemps on checking in I said I d booked a double room and gave my name but the receptionist seemed to think I was saying I d booked two rooms started frantically searching for the name of the person supposedly occupying the second room and continued to do so even after I had explained that I would be sharing the double room with my wife The matter was resolved after I had shown my booking confirmation on my phone but hardly made for a smooth check in Later when I asked another receptionist about the access to the Executive Lounge which came with the room I had booked I was told that this access had not been activated on my key card this receptionist did then activate it but presumably that should have been done when I checked in We generally enjoyed our stay but there did seem to be a blip here Nor were we given the signature DoubleTree chocolate chip cookie which I later learned guests are supposed to receive on arrival , The clean well appointed room with its large comfortable bed The easy to control shower The floor to ceiling window that provided views and light The Executive Lounge to which we had access with its ample hot and cold breakfast buffet The high speed lifts The secure luggage storage facility after check out The refreshing flavoured water available in the foyer The convenient location near Tate Britain where we went for an evening event and Westminster 
139679,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Nothing to report , Absolutely wonderful start to finish Staff was great check in very simple room spotless Breakfast also wonderful tasty and easy as it was a buffet Taxis right at the door to get around not far from the Westminster tube station

139682,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We loved everything about this great hotel I have never stayed at such a super hotel everything was perfect , This hotel was beyond our wildest dreams it was the most perfect hotel we have ever stayed at The stay started with the wonderful front desk person Joanna who set the tune for our visit She was so friendly and nice we knew we would have a good stay All the front desk people were wonderful answering all our stupid questions with a smile on their faces The rooms were sparkling clean pay the extra and get the breakfast OMG they had everything you could want for a breakfast it was such a good deal we ate a great breakfast and were not hungry until dinner The hotel is situated perfectly easy to get to everything They had taxis right outside the front door ready to take us anywhere The people in the front desk who helped us with our bags awesome Even one day when we were having trouble getting out of the taxi with all our stuff they came out and assisted us Talk about customer service this hotel has the absolute best customer service every It was worth every penny they great you with a warm cookie when you check in even I highly recommend this hotel stay there and you will have a wonderful experience Even the room service was fast and the food was great 
139683,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, There were a lot of stains in the bathroom tiles which is very unpleasant in sense of cleanness I have never hung the towels due to that Also there were stains in the towels as well I felt very uncomfortable while using the bathroom , Cafeteria staff was great Also the location is nice 
139684,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, A peculiar absence of egg cups next to the boiled eggs was rather strange in that it happened two days in a row Despite requesting an egg cup the first day none materialized The second day they brought me two after I had waited a few minutes Also it is a good ten minute walk from the nearest tube station , Very comfortable bed view of the Thames was an unexpected bonus The rooms were pretty well soundproofed The staff were especially helpful We were a delegation of 40 people and they appeared to manage check in and check out very efficiently 
139685,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I did not like it that we did not get what we paid for from booking com It appears our room was advertised as a King size bed in an executive suite but we ended up with a mobility room with a weird bathroom and a queen bed This was after paying almost 200 for the room We complained and were changed to a bigger room with a queen bed However I blame bookin com for this as when we booked the room it was on the basis of an executive room with a normal bathroom and king size bed Our mistake was not to check closely the booking confirmation email which had downgraded our booking to effectively what was left We are very busy people and do not expect this However the price did not change or there was no refund We were attending a dinner and had to change rooms at 11 30 at night after we returned from our dinner As a result of this I will not be using booking com again as I feel ripped off, Location
139686,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The bed was VERY high I am only 5ft and have arthritis I really struggled to get into it and could have done with a stool The matress was also a bit hard for my taste but it suited my husband very well The pillows were lovely and soft It would have been nice to have some instructions on how to use the computer television I couldn t even turn it on , Spacious comfortable room with evrything you would normally expect The staff were very pleasant and helpful The breakfast was very good catered for almost every nationality One of the few hotels I looked at that had full english breakfast either available or included in the price Location in Westminster superb and taxi rank on the forecourt Would definitely stay here again 
139687,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The value for money I would have expected a larger room We had at that stage been travelling for 4 weeks and needed more room to stretch out The TV system is also terrible to use , The proximity to London and public transport The staff were very friendly and helpful
139688,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Phone the phone didn t seem to be working well and I did not have the time to complain Persons who were trying to call from overseas say they found it extremely difficult to get through as the front desks seemed to have been unmanned early in the morning I was unable to receive many calls although family and friends tried calling numerous times , I particularly liked the location it is very conveniently located In fact I would say that it is perfectly located it is just a short walk to Parliament and to major attractions The room was clean and comfortable and the staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful The hotel is really great for a business trip but I would definitely stay there again for a vacation 
139689,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We had to get the bathroom door handle fix as it had came off during the night leaving myself stuck in the bathroom When the room was cleaned no fresh tea coffee or milk was left for us to use the next day , The staff were friendly and the hotel was comfortable The location was brilliant to access the sites and go for a walk along the river

139694,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, There was a long queue for breakfast they seemed understaffed given the volume of weekend guests This made for a very busy breakfast service with tables not being cleared down quickly enough , The location just a few minutes walk from Tate Britain was perfect for us Being given a warm cookie on arrival was a really good touch 
139695,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster,No Negative, Excellent location beside the river Thames and near Westminster Situated in quiet street All the staff were really helpful and happy Would definitely stay here again if we were visiting London Really good that car parking was available under the hotel however the spaces are quite small and you have to be very careful getting into space

139699,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Electrics in kettle drawer were plugged in incorrectly extension was plugged into itself Wasted time to get things going Window latch was broken Noisy corridor banging doors when trying to sleep An inner door might help Toilet roll holder gets in way when on loo Dreadful view from room Need something living inside where you just see concrete outside Lastly on checkout we found someone had used our room number for 105 in restaurant You need to a check proof more carefully and b Be more understanding when there is a mistake , Staff very positive and welcoming most of the time see other comment Excellent breakfast array Early breakfast for marathon

139845,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We weren t sure as to whether the room window was tinted mirrored external glass so had the curtain closed a lot of the time as our room was overlooked by an office block Drawer storage for clothes was limited particularly if you were staying for a few days , Nice touch with the cookies on arrival and whenever you fancied one We were staying for 3 nights and opted not to take the housekeeping every day as offered so ran out of tea bags and milk which was the only niggle We had to ask for them at reception Staff were all very helpful and cheerful throughout our stay Very comfortable bed Breakfast choice was excellent and catered for all dietary needs 
139846,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The 5 surcharge on a 12 pizza from room service , Great location for a function on the South Bank Easy to get to bus routes and walking around part of central London 
139847,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We found the pillows a tad too thick so a pillow menu would have earned an extra comfort point , We chose this hotel for its location close to business meetings and got exactly what we wanted The aircon worked well which is important to us and it was quiet despite building works all round Staff was helpful and friendly 
139848,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The only issue with the location of Double Tree is for older people as the walking distance to transport could be a difficulty I travelled with my mum 76 and sometimes she found the walk to Westminster a little long for her even though it was a good 10 15 minutes roughly , The room and beds were very comfortable The staff were very friendly and helpful The location close to the river was lovely and the walk to Westminster was very pleasant 
139849,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We were delayed a day by the airlines and when the hotel found out the airlines was responsible they made us pay for our room even though they knew we were not coming in , A good location but there was a lot of construction next door

139857,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The room had a continuous water leak with a resulting powerful mold odor Could not get this fixed or moved to a different room hotel fully booked It was extremely expensive given the very poor accommodations , The staff was quite nice 
139858,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Staff at the reception could have been more approachable and friendly Expected a better view of the city overlooking Westminster and Big Ben from the hotel room Hotel should provide complimentary hotel transfer ,No Positive
139859,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Location was ok for us 10mins walk from Pimlico but wouldn t suit anyone with mobility issues who wanted to use the subway , Immaculate and clean Good sized room for London Loved having the mini fridge 
139860,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The room was clean and tidy just a bit on the small side in the bathroom area , The hotel staff were all friendly and made you feel very welcome it was a very good selection of food for the breakfast buffet the millbank lounge was a relaxing place to have a drink meal the bar staff couldn t do enough for you 
139861,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, when I booked it the information said they had parking on the hotel but there was limited spaces and we had to pay 30 pounds to park in the hotel they did say if we parked in the street it would be free but we didn t want to leave the car in the street I wasn t happy with the view we had from the window which was construction of buildings, It was our wedding anniversary and they sent us a bottle of bubbly up to the room which was a lovely gesture we were over the moon the beds were comfy and it was clean and the breakfast was very nice 
139862,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Room was a bit on the expensive side but we appreciate it was in an expensive part of the city , The bed was indeed very comfortable Food in the restaurant was lovely Wish we had a bit more time to do sightseeing but we were on our way home from a trip to Italy and just wanted to get back

139868,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The room was disappointing very small and cramped The shower did not drain properly leaving the bathroom floor flooded as a result of this the bottom of the bathroom door had started to decay For Hilton standards I feel this was below average , The location of the hotel is brilliant if you are site seeing London s main attractions only a couple minutes walk 
139869,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Entrance hall carpet was filthy To far from the nearest underground station not a lot you can do about that , Very helpful staff found my wife s medication after we left and are sending it to us Very efficient at check in and check out

139871,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Struggling to think of anything i suppose it could have been cheaper , The staff varied from very polite to couldn t do enough to help The breakfast was excellent with just about every option you could call breakfast but do include this with your booking as it will cost more to add separately Good size rooms 
139872,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Very poor value as the room was very basic Basic tea coffee making facilities would have expected a more luxurious tea tray as the rooms were over 200 per night Have experienced much better Certainly not Hilton standard Resturant grossly over priced Better rooms at a premier inn and cheaper , The breakfasts were excellent City Cafe staff highly professional Warm cookie on arrival Excellent location with taxi rank directly outside the hotel 
139873,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The room became really hot during the night so we had to put the air con on to cool it down but then we didn t sleep well with the noise from the air con , The breakfast was very good with plenty of variety We had a good view from our room on the 8th floor The bed was really comfortable and the hotel was very quiet In fact we heard nothing from our room 
139874,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Rude staff in the bar and cloak and dagger optional service charges This is meant to be a hotel bar closes when the last person leaves Not here Sat having a nice quiet drink post Billy Joel concert when at 11 55pm the staff came round blew all the candles on the tables out and removed the drink menus even the ones where people were still sat it wasn t just us lingering And in case we missed the hint to leave they made sure we got the message when they put the lights on full and turned the hoovers on Really And to cap it off the 5 thank you voucher for the bar we got for skipping a room service was negated by a 3 83 optional service charge which was included by default on the bill and never mentioned Sneaky , Nice Breakfast Clean rooms and comfy bed 
139875,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, service is too slow at front desk I have asked to be able to pay in cash but as it was a pre payement by card which I though partially to guarantee the room i coudn t undo this and pay cash For a HILTON it was regrettable Front desk reception was not helpful in this way ,No Positive
139876,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Well not much of a view but preferred the front room on my first visit Not much can be done about that , Staff were brilliant Breakfasts brilliant Liked the area where we ate breakfast in sections as you had the feeling of a small amount of people rather than a large area full of people Much more pleasant Very clean Loved the warm cookie on arrival This was my second stay and will stay again 
139877,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Complimentary water left in the day light and not placed in the fridge Food in the Executive Lounge was disappointing Some daily variation would have been nice both at breakfast and dinner The hot food is placed in metal containers with no direct heat and inevitably the food becomes cold Dirty glasses from the bar were not taken away and left in the room unwashed An apparent reluctance to top up on toilet tissue , Efficient lifts Apple TV In room safe 
139878,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Airport coach stop Dispenser for shower gel Not user friendly Better have a side door next to the rotating door A hanging tv would be great , Beddings are nice The Apple computer is great Overall service is fantastic
139879,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The nearest tube stations were all more than a 10 minute walk away view from the room was not too impressive , Staff were all really polite taxi s always readily available outside no unexpected surprises 
139880,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Breakfast is very busy so the earlier you go down the more comfortable the experience The only other thing I would say and it s being really picky is we could have done with more milk in the hospitality tray in the room, The welcome cookies were a lovely gesture and absolutely delicious The breakfast selection was good and the quality was of a high standard The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms clean and comfortable Great bed and good selection of TV channels Great location for central London Would definitely use this hotel again

139883,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The bed was a little small but perfectly fine for two people The walls were thin so you could hear when the toilet in the room above us was being flushed It wasn t overly loud but if you re a light sleeper it s not great , The breakfast was delicious and every staff member we spoke to was very friendly The location of the hotel is perfect if you re visiting the main attractions situated around the London eye 
139884,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The staff of this hotel should learn how to treat their customers We arrived at the hotel early morning and begged the receptionist to give us any room to rest till housekeeping finish preparing our room The receptionist tried to sell us the room of disabled She was very aggressive and rude and told me you should have booked your room yesterday The food in the hotel is disgusting Breakfast is very poor and all dishes and cups smell eggs as they are not washed well I ordered once a stake sandwitch that was only bread with a very small piece of meat that you cant even swallow , The only good thing was the cleaning of my room Thanks to Julia who was great in doing her job 
139885,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The bathroom had no bathtub and the products shampoo conditioner were not enough for 2 persons Poor breakfast and just 2 waters in the fridge 30 for parking in a 4 hotel The parking is free on must average hotels , Good size bed really good WiFi signal great centre London position

139894,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The website reflects views of the river These must have been taken years ago as there are NO views of the River from any place I could find Also the workout room s were small and was hoping for a Jacuzzi too , The staff was very helpful The breakfast buffet was generous and having the cold water in the lobby for guests was a nice touch Always a cab outside and loaning us an extra umbrella was most helpful 
139895,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Bad points are there was no window or extractor fan in the bathroom Had to keep the curtains closed as level with a busy office That being said it does seem like a business man s hotel and we didn t spend a lot of time in the room , Breakfast was fantastic there was nothing you couldn t have The staff are really pleasant and helpful Unusually water in the fridge was complementary and replenished on request

139897,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The room was slightly dated and in my opinion slightly over priced The heating control was sellotaped on and the shower tray had been painted and the paint was flaking off , Location is great took a day before we got to know the area but after we realised we were very happy with the location
139898,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, That the room was smaller than I expected after viewing the website and the building works outside ruin it a little but that can t be helped , The staff were really helpful and friendly and very attentive especially in the exec lounge I only stayed one night but my experience was very pleasant The location is brilliant we walked everywhere we walked a long way mind but it was a good place to be based The cookies were also yummy

139904,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, If you re even a bit in a hurry don t take breakfast The capacity of the restaurant is by far not enough We had to wait for at least 15 minutes and even after 25 minutes the promised fruit which was not longer available on the buffet never arrived ,No Positive
139905,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Fridge didn t work in the room for the stay and the ice machines weren t working either and since it was 25 degrees, Staff were very helpful and the breakfast was excellent

139909,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The hotel itself is new and a bit boring Not much charm If you like new then this would be a good hotel The hotel restaurant wasn t very good The area wa a little quiet and subway access was ok but not great , Room was a good size and well laid out 
139910,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The rooms are not as spacious as they seem and the corridors are really narrow , Perfect location for sightseeing and walks along the Thames The underground is just 5 mins away and all hop on hop off busses stop nearby The rooms are not big but are comfortable clean and quiet with a lot of free extras included Perfect customer service Love the library and cucumber water in the lobby 
139911,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Rooms a little tried looking also had to request for the single bed to be placed in the room after checking as this hadn t been done even though the hotel was aware there was 3 people sharing the room it was only set up for two 2 cups 2 towels ect, Staff were very friendly and helpful 
139912,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Rooms are a mite small and we should have asked for non feather pillows our fault not the staff , The staff were absolutely fantastic They went out of their way to make us feel at home We were a party of 2 grandparents daughter 6 year old granddaughter who was thrilled with her Teddy bear and cookies

139917,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The Apple computer TV kept failing and a technician had to be called in to correct it When it happened a second time the Manager wanted to allocate a different room but as we were checking out the next day he gave us two complimentary drink vouchers and suggested we go to the bar where there was a huge TV and we could watch it there , We were absolutely thrilled to find our room was ready at 9 30 am having just got off a 24 hour flight The Reception staff were amazing and we were given two large cookies to boot 
139918,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I was disappointed in the room It was exceptionally basic I d almost go as far as saying the only thing that differentiated it from a Premier Inn was a different colour scheme We didn t receive fresh cookies on arrival The bar seemed excessively pricey The reason we asked for omelette was the bacon slices were congealed and sealed together whilst the scrambled egg was inedible There was a blood smear on the curtain next to the desk All in all I think Hilton have missed the mark with this particular hotel I wouldbt stay here again sorry, We asked if the chef would mind making us fresh omelettes which he was happy to provide
139919,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, No TV set but you can watch TV on a computer with interruptions The construction site is next to the hotel and as a result you will enjoy a noise from the site in the morning , The bed is comfy Good location There is a small fridge in a room

139922,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, V big and a little impersonal but not unusual in such a busy place Room temp difficult to regulate and building work outside a little annoying, Nice room and lovely cocktails in the bar When we approached staff they were helpful and service was quick a real plus that our room was ready at 10am after we d travelled since 4am 
139923,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We liked everything and would have loved to have stayed longer but was a little beyond our budget will certainly recommend the hotel , Wonderful overall service from friendly staff top quality food breakfast was excellent room comfort and cleanliness hundred percent and just attention to detail on all the finer details was impressive Very happy customers 
139924,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Nothing, Bright spacious hotel The choice of breakfast was fabulous The hotel was clean and staff helpful On check in we were also given a cookie each really nice touch
139925,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Bathroom was a big disappointment moldy n some places somewhat awkward layout The hotel runs a program that if you don t want the room cleaned put a sign on door handle and get 5 voucher the sign was ignored on several occasions once the room wasn t cleaned but we got no voucher once it was cleaned even with the sign on We gave up on one of the days room clean up showed at 5 pm they are clearly understaffed in cleaning department , Good location close to tube Thames and Westminster attractions yet sufficiently remote so it s quite quiet Sleeping area was OK 
139926,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We expected to have a TV but there was not any It was integrated in the Computer on the desk what we did not expect In the description of their double rooms they announced a TV Unfortunally we did not have our binoculars with us so that it was difficult to follow what was on the screen , Friendly staff
139927,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, room small for so called queen room no t v in room just computer this cut out possibly due to bad wi fi lots of building going on around hotel , location good for sightseeing and tate gallery hotel clean

139929,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Needs major renovation new carpets and painting needed Over all dingy and old ugly furniture Bathroom to small No views anywhere NO TV only small computer screen Entry door very heavy not self close Very few restaurants in the area Hotel restaurant not very good expensive black tea 3 50 Canadian 5 80 approx Hotel too expensive for what we got Refused to give senior discount because reservation was not directly with hotel even though other Hiltons in the area give senior discounts , Bed was comfortable Walking distance to center Room size fair for location Taxis readly available Staff pleasant and very helpful 
139930,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, They provided tea and coffee in our room but there was only one tea each and one coffee Hardly any milk There were no leaflets about the area which can be useful when going to a new place , Very comfortable place to stay Comfy bed air con which was very useful on such a hot day Breakfast had such a good choice of foods Quiet to say it was in the centre of London Check out was 12 which I loved because we didn t have to hurry

139932,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The breakfast could have been better and it is quite a distance to a tube station compared to other hotels , The rooms were a good size for a room in London and the bed was comfy 
139933,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, 7 10 minute walk to nearest tube station not good if you have much luggage the Hilton website was poor wrong info about rooms that could fit a rollaway bed and about breakfast FYI if you do an executive room you do not need to pay extra for breakfast It is included both in the executive lounge and in the main breakfast area you can choose either area to go to main area has more choices but it is more crowded The eggs were much better in the main area eggs in executive lounge were a rubbery gelatin like egg casserole every day We felt that the executive lounge should offer the same or better choices than the regular breakfast since you have to pay more to have this room upgrade 1 out of the 3 days we were there they did not have any cookies although daily cookies are advertised on their website not a big deal but an aggravation on an already mediocre stay Hilton emailed us before our trip asking if there was anything special we d like to have in our room when we arrived We replied but received NONE of the items we requested we asked for non feather pillows I m allergic to feathers and a rollaway bed and extra towels for our son We had to ask for these items again after we checked into our room and found they were not there I believe that the email from Hilton was only looking for people who wanted to BUY extra things from them such as a bottle of champagne We did not opt for any extras that cost more as the 500 night was very expensive already Another pet peeve is that they charged for LOCAL calls 15p a minute That is ridiculous when you are paying 500 night Although the hotel was very nice we would not stay there again because we felt it was overpriced for what you receive , Plenty of large towels and face wash cloths unusual for England partial view of river from room 1037 corner room small refrigerator ice machine only one we found in England firm beds closet with about 10 hangers 3 small drawers and a nice cabinet and desk to put things on top of a decent amount of storage on top of closet for luggage storage The men serving in executive lounge were extremely nice and helpful With the executive rooms an evening happy hour from 5 30 7 30 was included with complimentary beer wine soda and an assortment of warm and cold foods enough to make a meal This was very nice after a long day 
139934,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Standard of cleanliness in rooms and the inexplicable allocation of an accessible room from which we moved due to the poor cleanliness and inappropriate fixtures , Location of hotel comfy bed easy to use shower Quality of breakfast 
139935,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The bathroom is very small and the aircon didnt work, The staff especially Manuel and Raphael who looked after my dietary requirements i only asked if some items contained wheat and they said yes but they could go and get me some gluten free sandwichs and returned with a lovely plattter of different sandwiches

139938,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The hotel was oversold and our room had been given away so we were put in a partially constructed room with loose wiring hanging from the wall We had reserved a room for our family of three but got only one double bed There was no soap The temperature was too high and there was no way to turn it down because the loose wiring was what should have gone to the thermostat The front desk congratulated us on getting a newly refurbished deluxe room It did not seem like they were trying to be ironic We did get moved to a normal room on the second day ,No Positive
139939,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Did not enjoy the Breakfast staff were excellent the food was not as good as i expected for this Hotel And lukewarm , The quite nights and comfy bed And the friendly staff

139955,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Thought the rooms were a bit on the small size especially considering it was an executive room, Definitely worth it upgrading to an executive room to get use of the executive lounge with its happy hrs in the evenings

139964,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Breakfast cold on one occasion Bar staff discouraged customers from being served at the bar then had the nerve to charge a service charge for using a waiter Compared to other Hilton hotels in London the rooms where less spacious and the nightly cost was was very high, Location excellant away from hustle and bustle yet close to sights and tube stations
139965,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, i expected to be able to lounge in the executive lounge with armchairs and sofas it is more like a cafeteria or bar, the staff were extremely good cheerful and friendly
139966,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Nothing really we ve stayed here a few times and it works well for us , Clean friendly and we like the location The bar is great for drinks before we go out or for coffees before bed great complimentary cookies

139971,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, the apple screen is too small and too far away to be a decent television substitute , staff was great clean and spacious room fifteen minutes walk from the nearest station but a beautiful walk with Big Ben alongside so we didn t mind 
139972,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I requested as it was my boyfriends 21st for a few balloon s too be placed up in the room instead I got no response back from the hotel which I was very disappointed in as it is a 5 star hotel and paying 100 a night I would of expected a email back at least , I loved the warm welcoming of a cookie after a long travelled day it was a perfect touch Staff were very happy and polite 
139973,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Room very small only 1 armchair when it was a room for 2 Air conditioning didn t work the room was very hot on arrival and the air conditioning didn t make any difference only a lot of noise , Cookie on arrival nice gesture
139974,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The traditional English breakfast is cheaply done and not worth the money The express checkout line was being used for check in and with a bill inquiry pending we were forced to leave to catch our transport We left agitated which wasn t ideal While necessary to manage the check in of incoming guests that queue is not for more complex rooming inquires that are pending It is for guests who are looking to leave in an express fashion Besides what was essentially the last 45 minutes the stay was wonderful , They were able to accommodate for a birthday weekend and the location made the experience great 
139975,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Breakfast expensive for what it was A bit of a walk to the underground either Pimlico or Westminster , Nice airy atmosphere to the public areas Staff very friendly and helpful Noon check out Location good for running along the Thames 
139976,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The only one thing was that the room didn t have the conventional screen TV as opposed to the small computer screen TV, Coming from the States we loved the location near major attractions and yes the breakfast was both beautiful and delicious as well City Cafe for dinner and the entire hotel staff was awesome very accomodating and friendly 
139977,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Duvets always frustrate me One is obligated to be hot or cold nothing in between Not lots of restaurant options near by but the hotel one was pleasant enough after a tiring day of tourism , The cookies at check in and whenever you asked were warm and wonderful Easy walk up to Parliament and Westminster Abbey and down to Pimlico tube 
139978,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We had a few mishaps with equipment in the room our kettle died as did our mini fridge but the staff was totally on top of it and fixed everything straight away The breakfast was 20GBP per person per day which I thought was extremely steep , Room was super clean The staff was responsive and friendly The room was much larger than I was expecting for a European hotel room 
139979,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Food and drink is quite pricey at the hotel but there are other shops around such as sainsburys where you can receive extra goods for good value for money , Very clean and very tidy A very warm welcoming from staff I would recommend if a business trip or a couple s night or two stay away to do site seeing around London When you are welcomed you receive a fresh warm cookie this is very yummy

139984,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I can t think of anything , The breakfast was excellent with great choice of different items Cookie on arrival is a nice touch The 5 voucher offered if you did not want your room serviced is a good idea It suited us as we were in and out of our room all day although we didn t get chance to use it Location was good fir our needs Walking distance of Westminster 
139985,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Early start so wanted breakfast in room This is no longer an option so had to have cold take away food from bar in reception Had to clean tea coffee marks from dressing table on arrival , Well designed equipped room Extremely helpful friendly staff

139987,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Some front desk reception staff don t have good enough command of business English when there is a problem They took a pre authorisation on my card twice placing an extra hold of 800 on it and the two junior staff were very dismissive of correcting it The manager helped me fix it and paid for a taxi to make up for the two hours spent missing our planned sightseeing tour which was great but only after I insisted they fix it immediately Check your bill and get them to explain it as the pre authorisation really add up You can pay for the accomm side to avoid this Beware the 12 percent restaurant surcharge added If the service meal isn t up to it ask to take it off or reduce it Our pre booked private taxi service recommended by the hotel at 5 am for a trip to Heathrow didn t turn up at I waited for 15 min and by then I had give up and go to the airport and instead negotiate a set fare with a black cab who took us safely to the airport Black cabs are safe and reliable Pay more and go with them , Really impressed with staff overall and excellent service I extended my stay and cancelled another booking at other hotels Safe light bright clean hotel with very modern lifts and rooms We ate most nights in the restaurant as my 20 year old was often tired and had a good kids menu Great breakfasts and staff Excellent safe location for families good for walking Government area so be prepared to walk 5 min to things but easy to get to anywhere else quickly Black cab rank outside great for night time 
139988,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I ate the same breakfest for 8 days and I got tired of eating it Close to Westminister while a little bit far away from tube station , Cookies are delicious Staff is ebullient and helpful 
139989,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Providing an Apple iMac as both an in room computer and a TV isn t a great idea Couldn t get the computer side to work due to faulty mouse and the screen is just too small to watch TV from the bed , Great location The room was spacious clean and comfortable with excellent pillows Reception staff were friendly and communicated well Breakfast was excellent 
139990,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Nothing everything was so good , The welcome to the hotel was perfect We even got cookies and it was our birthdays so we also got a bday card with drinks vouchers in

139992,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I didn t like that the website main page said breakfast included so we booked at 129 pounds and then when we checked in the staff said it wasn t included I went back on the next day and its misleading, pillows amazing as was the shower very clean
139993,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster,No Negative, We were given the most amazing warm chocolate cookie on arrival Only a 10 12 minute walk to Westminster and from there you can go anywhere We preferred going this way because we got to walk past the houses of parliament and see Big Ben every day

139997,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The bedding was ripped down the side The shower gel provided had hair in it and was full of skum surrounding the holder I particularly don t care for the room being cleaned during my stay in hotels I m happy enough not having my towel changed everyday We put the save energy ego sign on the door which meant no for house keeping and it was ignored returned back to the room to find my stuff moved The room we were in the window only opened a crack which was disappointing , We were greeted with free hot cookies during check in quick check in and lovely hotel on arrival Good location just a 5 minute walk to underground station Very quiet location regarding road noise etc The little things in the room like the Mac tv toiletries bottles of water fridge safe and hairdryer make it enjoyable and comfortable 
139998,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Not sure about using the computer as a TV too The sound quality was very poor and difficult to hear some programmes at all Also found it difficult to read the channel selection from the bed because it was so far away from us , Bed was really good and we had a nice spacious room Great shower too rather than the usual trickle Breakfast was also very good and hot choices on the buffet were actually hot which was appreciated Nice surprise on arrival at the hotel on a cold wet day Warm cookies wonderful 
139999,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The view could have been better, Warm cookies on arrival were nice but a complimentary breakfast croissant might have been better as we had a child with us

140042,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Executive Lounge was an upsell from Front Desk but having enjoyed Lounges elsewhere this was a real let down with only powdered coffee few cold drinks no alcohol and nuts in a bowl Don t bother Nearest Tube stations feel far on foot and through traffic Will need a taxi to get there and arrive unruffled Queen executive room anywhere else would be big but in London felt small Steep bar tariff so go easy or go to local places for evening drinks , Good location central to Westminster attractions breakfasts good views across the Thames to the South Bank

140044,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, There are long queues at breakfast when you get there around 9 am It would be better if the buffet could be reached from two sides or if there were two or three buffets so that not everyone has to line up for the same table For being a sustainable hotel there are some things that could be improved like no plastic cups in the gym The location is good but no tube station is really close Unfortunately there are high buildings next to the hotel that disturb the view to the river We had a room with a view to a construction site , The staff was really kind and nice always smiling The hotel has everything we need in good quality Breakfast tasted delicious Location is close to the river next to Westminster abbey and House of Parliament

140049,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Way too expensive Bathrooms are tiny Watching tv on a Mac is a bit rubbish tbh Never worth 159 per night 110 would be more like it, Clean and tidy
140050,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The prices in the bar were very very expensive The cost of a glass of wine was more than the cost of a bottle in most other places I can understand why most people went to the Pizza Express around the corner to eat and drink, Location
140051,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Shower water temperature kept changing almost got scalded Did not give new tea bags or milk during second day of stay poor house keeping , Very good breakfast excellent choice Power cut in room staff responded quickly to address problem Check in staff very helpful Liked applemacs in room

140054,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The view was terrible as the building site view from the window was a bit much had to order the mini bar if you wanted it the room was very small for the money we paid only one chair for a double room , I didn t like anything about my stay here would not stay here again ever 
140055,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Breakfast was busy and the tables were close together so we had little privacy but the amazing food and staff made up for this tiny dislike, Perfect location walked a mile to get to central tourist attractions if you don t want to walk there are always taxis waiting outside and staff were always on hand to assist We stayed on the 10th floor the view wasn t a spectacular London skyline view but pleasant Warm cookies a check in were a nice touch and very yummy 
140056,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The only thing that I would have improved on was the mattress on the bed as I found it very hard , Where do I start the staff were excellent and friendly nothing was too much trouble We were able to check in a lot earlier than posted and check out later We had breakfast and the selection preparation and service was superb Everything was clean about the hotel Finally the location was brilliant for what we needed which was a weekend in London to go see a musical and see some sites Thank you

140058,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Hotel offers car parking but it is 30 per night so if your staying a few nights and drove into London this needs to be factored into the hotel stay , The location was brilliant Big Ben London eye river Thames shrek adventure and sea life centre all within walking distance The hotel is very modern with really friendly staff 
140059,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We had to wait two hours fir our room to be ready even though we didn t arrive til 4 The reception supervisor was quite unhelpful when I went several times and only did something once my husband complained heavily , Room was lovely staff were very friendly with children especially

140065,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The bed did hurt my back a bit the mattress was much harder than I am used to , Suprisingly quiet in the hotel could hardly hear any noise from outside And breakfast was brilliant so much choice and all delicious 
140066,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Noise from the building site next door which we weren t made aware of when booking meant a very early start to the day , Full English breakfast was included and was very good huge selection and fresh Staff were very friendly and helpful and free welcome cookies were a nice touch 
140067,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I was travelling with my teenage granddaughter The twin room was very small unbearably hot Even with air conditioning at coldest highest setting impossible to sleep Shower room uncomfortably tiny Corridors of hotel looked shabby paint scuffed The evening meal options were very limited to say the least This hotel apart from the staff does not deserve the name Hilton , Staff were superb They were too good for this hotel 
140068,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, A little far out from theatre district with 4 children but taxis readily available outside the hotel, Clean and value for money on a busy December weekend Warm cookies on check in concierge was very friendly

140070,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, It is really a five star hotel Rooms are small There is no TV I stayed in executive room which comes along with a executive lounge The smallest lounge I have seen in my life Cramped with people and there was no room to sit Went three times there and finally gave up Horrible food No parking space Staff was rude to assist Simply told find a space somewhere putside the hotel on a street The so called Queen size bed is smallest I have seen in a 5 star hotel Very basic facilities Room looked like a hostel room Breakfast was served in a way that it gave me a feeling that I was being served in a flight Smallest glasses and plates possible Avoid this hotel at all cost Only word staff knew was WHAT please or excuse me were not in their dictionary , Location

140072,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We was allocated a room on 10th floor which was on executive floor but the view was poor looked directly at building site nothing else For the price paid it was rather poor but when we asked staff to move to another room they was so accomodating and moved us immediately, The staff were extremely polite and very friendly We had use of the executive lounge which was a lovely addition to our stay Room very clean Would highly recommend this hotel 
140073,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, There is some construction going on in the neighorhood but of course this isnt hotel s fault You hardly ever hear any construction noise and there is a decent alternate walking route available , Location was superb You can easily walk around to see all major attractions Hotel staff was super friendly and caring

140076,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We re not given correct room upon checkin Get rid of the Apple Mac computers in the rooms and put in LCD TV screens Also it is England wet and rain should be umbrellas in the rooms for guests to use , Outstanding breakfast the best I ve ever had in a hotel

140083,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The beds were as hard as rocks Very uncomfortable bedding and pillows , The hotel was not far from transportation either by bus or train Taxis were always easily available also 
140084,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, long queues check in and check out even worse small monitor for Mac plus TV in bedroom with a small hand held device for changing channels very impractical , Bedrooms were comfortable
140085,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The size of the room a delux for three people room 422 was far far to crammed couldn t get past chair at computer without climbing over the bed No place to put our two suitcases except in the window sill Tiny 2nd bed , I liked the look of the hotel and decor I liked slippers and dressing gowns in the room 
140086,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I asked for a room with a bath and high floor Although I got floor 5 of 13 I got no bath However I did check in at 10 instead of 3 which is check in time Also the maids in the hotel could have looked a bit more cheerful as it made it awkward walking past , The bed was amazing So big and comfy best sleep I ve had in a while The black out curtains also were fabulous There was loads of space in the room for me and my partner The iMac was brilliant too useful for us tourists 
140087,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Room was small We were upgraded to a bigger room which we had paid for anyway and it was still small The minibar was empty We had to order 2 tiny bottles of cola and were charged 10 for them , Staff were superb and very helpful

140090,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We had executive rooms and although the executive suite had snacks and basic drinks they could have had a better range, The hotel allowed us to check in early as they had a room ready which was perfect as the weather outside was awful The concierge was very attentive when ordering us taxis and looking after our bags the day we checked out
140091,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Asked for early check in got a reply that s fine When we turned up in the morning said room is still being prepared but they can upgrade us to executive room for extra 150 per person per night That s disgusting , Clean comfortable room Room was soundproof there was road works going on outside couldn t hear a thing in room 
140092,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, There was no leisure facilities Had we known this prior to booking we never would of gone Booked months in advance and requested a twin room and upon arrival was asked did we really need a twin as they had none left Breakfast staff excellent great selection of food shame about the quality of the hot buffet Average at best , Staff were very helpful with directions places to eat etc warm cookie on arrival very nice touch 
140093,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The only downside was that a bath in the room would have made it perfect , The location is excellent with just a short walk to the attractions the staff were very helpful and friendly 
140094,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Queues at breakfast were uncomfortable , Staff are very helpful and were quick and efficient when it became clear that we would have to change rooms due to a faulty lock 
140095,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, There was no mention to us of all the building work going on around the hotel , The hotel was nice and clean and the executive lounge was a very nice bonus The staff in the bar and executive lounge were very nice
140096,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Colleague will not use a lift and stairs upto 8th floor were very grubby and it felt more like a service stairwell rather than another option for paying customers instead of using the lift, Have stayed at this hotel on a few occasions now for both business and pleasure and location service and food options are great for our needs
140097,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Not impressed by the view from my window MI5 Not happy that as a pensioner it took me quite a while to work my television once I found out it was a telly and choice of stations not to my liking You could have had Hot Choc as a drink option Chose not to stay for breakfast as I was cold in my room cold air coming from somewhere and just wanted to go home it was snowing but no fault of the hotel , I was happy to be a few minutes from where I needed to be on the night 
140098,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster,No Negative, Within easy reach of tube central London situation well equipped rooms very comfortable bed pleasant staff In general had feel of high class without the stuffiness that so often accompanies this 
140099,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, It s just a shame that the nearest tube station is Pimlico a good 10 15 minute walk away Taxis needed at night time , Good location by the Thames and near to the houses of parliament etc Great to walk to attractions Victoria Station Buckingham Palace The Serpentine all within 20 mins walk Great bar for late evening coffee and nightcaps 
140100,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The price of the food and drinks in the hotel restaurant Paying 12 for one glass of cocktail should be illegal, The staff were so walm and welcoming the rooms were so clean lovely 
140101,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, No effort made for our anniversary even though informed beforehand I asked to change rooms to at least have a view of the river as opposed to a building site no joy so will not be staying here again , Executive lounge was good and the service was excellent as was the concierge service 
140102,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster,No Negative, Very efficient friendly staff When checking in we were given a lovely warm cookie which was nice Breakfast was excellent Good location too within walking distance to a lot of major attractions

140105,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The only thing I personally did not like was that I it was very difficult to get the shampoo conditioner body cream out of the bottles As we travelled only with hand luggage we could not get any of that with us Also the PC mouse in the room of my kids did not work propper but nothing to worry about as we where out anyway the whole day , It was great Large room very comfortable good breakfast Everything we needed
140106,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I had booked a room with access to executive lounge Befor booking I enquired timing of serving drinks wine and beer etc and hot snacks and told 7 9pm but when I arrived around 8 15pm I was told timing for drinks and hot snacks was from 5 30 to 7 30 pm I wasted money by paying extra for a facility I could not enjoy , Staff was friendly
140107,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Bit of a trek to the tube building work surrounding hotel although ar weekend this was not a problem I expect during the week it might be Bed too firm for me , Breakfast was excellent room clean and quiet staff friendly
140108,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Their in room publication said breakfast was served until 11 am We then had a lie in and got downstairs at 10 30 am to be told that was only weekends The publication did not indicate this , It was a lovely hotel 
140109,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We asked for a lower room as one of us doesn t use lifts We were initially allocated a room on the 4th floor and had to use an emergency back stairs After complaining the Manager got us a room on the 2nd floor which also necessitated using back stairs There didn t appear to be a proper carpeted staircase which was very disappointing and so we will not stay there again , The location was suitable for our schedule 
140110,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We checked in for one night We later returned and checked in for a second night The receptionist when we returned wasn t exactly welcoming or accommodating , Even the standard rooms have every facility that you could need 
140111,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Upgraded to Executive but too much verbal information of entertainment needed something in writing but pleased with offer , Ease of booking in and out and facilities available
140112,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Price of breakfast at 21 50 is very expensive especially for families , Friendly and helpful staff Air conditioned rooms Apple iMac in each room 
140113,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Double bed very small for a 4 star Would expect king in a double room Bathroom a bit warn Lack of drawers Computer instead of TV did not work easily mouse problem and could not turn off from remote , Great location Staff were helpful 
140114,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Hair dryer cable was far to short to effectively use as the sockets were no close to any mirror No view , Good Breakfast Staff very helpfull and efficient 
140115,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, quite a way from the nearest tube station call me old fashioned but would have preferred a standard TV to the Mac, very clean modern decent size rooms for London Really convenient for conference centre
140116,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I felt we were further out than I origanally thought we got taxis everywhere but we had a great time, Very comfortable hotel friendly staff rooms were a good size
140117,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Bit pricey for what you actually get I know it has the Hilton name But it didnt seem that special I found a ball of matted hair in my room It wanted to charge me an additional 50 in case i used anything qhen i arrived I wasnt aware of it before hand , The location was good Walkable to Westminster or Pimlico station
140118,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, the surrounding construction and especially the view looking to the construction was very unattractive and noisy, It s the second tme I stayed in this hotel I like the breakfast voriety the view in the upper floors if available the helpfillness of the staff
140119,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, When we came in the hotel we asked the reception desk if there are 2 more roll beds which we had asked for before our coming The receptionist confirmed that yes and there was only one double bed in the room Then we had to ask for twice to add the extra bed only one instead of two Even if we were staying for two nights we were asked to move from one room to another for every single night We also had prepaid entrance in the Executive Lounge with some refreshment and our card was not valid so we had to ask the reception dest again to help us This we could accept at some no name hotel but surprised us at Hilton , Very friendly people nice clean and large rooms excellent breakfast an Apple computer in the apartment 
140120,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I was in a disability access room which I didn t mind except it was rather starkly furnished Perhaps all the rooms are starkly furnished , Modern clean quiet pleasant
140121,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Our request for rooms with bathtubs were never considered Though I can understand the hotel was full during our stay Hot food at the buffet being way too salty , Friendly helpful staff Nice location Spacious room for London Meeting room with a brilliant view at a nice price for London 
140122,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, N a, Staff were emailed prior to arrival as had complaint with another Hilton hotel They ensured our stay went without any hiccups and were very friendly and professional 
140123,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Quite a walk from a tube station Also took 50 pound a night on arrival in case we used any extras This was forced and we were not asked if this was okay and then when we checked out we were told it would be 2 3 days before the 150 pound was back in our account Joke , Very clean comfy bed quiet 
140124,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The lack of choice of food in the bar eating area and the cost of the good and the drinks A big difference in relation to our stay the same time last year , Rooms and reception
140125,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Had trouble with heating but sorted and communal telephone didnt work when I had difficulty getting into my room Reported it to reception , Staff were AMAZING and very generous 
140126,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster,No Negative, This hotel was in a quiet location and it was perfect for me and my friends The room was lovely and clean Really enjoyed the breakfast lots of choice 
140127,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Some unfriendly receptionists No more view because of new buildings all around , Very nice housekeepers and waiters waitresses in millbank lounge and breakfast room 
140128,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Room size is ok but not big location is walking distance to metro st and thames bridge maybe it is little bit expensive in comparison to other EU capitals, New hotel clean bar is nice comfortable bad breakfast is ok
140129,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Mini fridge had no contents Kitchens closed at 11 30pm so when we returned from a RWC match there was only an option of a cheese sandwich or order in a pizza Pillows too soft and bed wobbly every time on of us turned we were woken by the shaking bed , Millbank Lounge was lovely if pricey Staff very friendly and helpful 
140130,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We had three leaks in three days 1 the shower in the room above ours leaked into ours which was gross It had obviously happened before and the hotel had to be aware of that when they put us in the room because there were water stains on the shower ceiling when we moved in 2 condensation or leaked from the air conditioner in the entryway ceiling 3 the bathroom sink leaked This was not an inexpensive stay and I expected better for my money , Staff was great very responsive The room was a nice size and was comfortable bed was very comfortable Reasonably close to underground and taxis always available The neighborhood was quiet at night and where we wanted to be 
140131,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The door to the bathroom was a folding door and was not easy to close as you had to drag it along the opening There was an unpleasant smell from the drainage occasionally , Hotel in good location which suited us clean fantastic breakfast which was plentiful 
140132,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The booking in at reception was the worst I ve ever had the booking had been dealt with wrongly we had double rooms instead of twin both rooms on separate floors as a group under one booking it wasn t exceptable , The breakfast was very good service poor
140133,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, I disliked the second bed isn t bedroom two bed The second bed was for the kids and we don t have two kit for the bathroom , I liked the localisation and the quiet Good breakfast and easy going 
140134,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, 30 per day parking Still cheaper than on street charges in Pimlico though , Friendly helpful staff Great location Clean and comfortable Nice bar for meeting up with friends cocktails and end of the evening coffees We ll definitely be back If you re looking for a more authentic and less costly breakfast experience look out Tony s cafe 5 mins walk away towards Pimlico friendly big portions great greasy cafe we loved it 
140135,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, This has been mentioned in other reviews but just to reiterate The shower is a bit tight and the water temperature has a tendency to change to scalding and then to ice cold in rapid succession before returning to your desired temperature Sort of like what happens when someone flushes a toilet while you are showering Not a big deal just something to be aware of especially if you are traveling with children , London is a pricey town and this hotel was exactly what you would expect from a Doubletree anywhere else at a premium price That may sound bad but it isn t meant that way We had a very comfortable room and we enjoyed the location very much The staff was nice we didn t really spend much time with them except for check in and check out but they were friendly and professional We traveled in early September 2015 and it seemed as if the hotel was filled with mostly business travelers There is still construction happening across the street from the hotel we did not experience any issues with noise but if you re looking for a spectacular view that could be problematic Once again this is not the hotels fault just something to be aware of before you decide to book Overall the room was comfortable and spacious enough for us and our luggage and you can t beat the location if you are interested in seeing Big Ben and Westminster Abbey which are all very close by It also makes it easier to catch one of the boat rides on the Thames that take off from Westminster pier 
140136,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Too far off the beaten track too much building work going on rooms small and bathroom even smaller, They gave me a fresh cookie on arrival weird but nice thought 
140137,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, breakfast need to improve especialy the continental only a few options available food in restaurant needs more options also and is far too expensive and so are the drinks at the bar, room was very clean and was good in having what we needed
140138,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The breakfast was nice I was disappointed with the eggs I couldn t eat them because they were like slop Lots of other choices to fill me up though , The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Pimlico station Which after a long day seemed really far The facilities were great 
140139,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster,No Negative, Great location great staff very comfortable room excellent value for money especially with the executive room rate that allows access to the executive lounge Breakfast was great with a wide selection of options 
140140,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Had a double room but this was just 2 single beds pushed together so was not as comfortable as expected, The location was ideal as we were going to a concert in Brixton Academy so just a short walk to Pimlico station and then 3 stops away 
140141,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Not really that close to other restaurants running No pool, Like the access in the executive lounge for free Breakfast and drinks and canap s after 5 30 pm Fairly close to some of the sites and shows But not so for the shopping Buses about 5 mins run away Rail about 10 15 mins run away
140142,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Breakfast was extremely busy Juices were made from concentrates Food was warm not hot , Convenient for our needs and suited our purpose as a bed for the night 
140143,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Service is well below standard 4 hours for luggage to be delivered and then got annoyed when I went to get it myself Have stayed here before and service continues to slide May not stay again, Great location and generally well kept 
140144,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Poor customer service We had 20 off our evening meal but this was not applied and we had to claim this in the morning the staff were not immediately attentive to this and seemed disinterested Poor value for money for the amenities, Free wifi and computer in room Good central location close to city
140145,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Building site adjacent to the hotel very noisy when trying to rest in the afternoon and started early at 6 30 am, Lovely hotel friendly staff Husband loved the Mac computer in the room 
140146,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Rooms weren t ready for 3 pm as promised and staff werent good able tying you know what was happening, Nice quiet room good location for most things
140147,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The only thing I did not like was one of the concierges We wanted to go on a night bus tour and he essentially said that we missed it It Like there was only one We did the research ourselves and found one taking off close by Ridiculous Worst concierge ever , It was a very clean modern nice place It had a little frig nice glassware in the room lovely steel ice bucket coffee teas etc Plenty of storage and closet with a safe The location was close to Houses of Parliament and Big Ben Close ish to Victoria Station and Buckingham Palace 
140148,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Menu of on sight restaurant was somewhat limited but breakfast buffet on the executive floor was excellent , Only had one night after a red eye flight but location was great to see the sights and facilities were very nice Bed was very comfy Complimentary buffet was great for breakfast and wine and beer in the evening 
140149,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, The room was generally clean and comfortable as you would expect at a Hilton property but there was a previous occupant s hair not from their head on the bathroom floor which we noticed on arrival There is a large building being constructed next to the hotel and although we didn t have any issues whatsoever with noise the construction was the only view from our bedroom On one occasion during our stay we tried to call the 24 hour room service number but there was no answer although the staff on Reception were very apologetic and dealt with this professionally and promptly The shower temperature after it was adjusted to your preference sometimes fluctuated between freezing cold and very hot This wasn t so much of a problem for the adults as we could move out of the flow but we had to be very vigilant if showering with our 2 year old child we forgot to request a room with a bath We only reported this on check out and the staff did not have the opportunity to resolve this during our stay so this is by no means a comment on the service we received which was overall very good , Friendly helpful staff Good location Delicious complimentary cookie on arrival 
140150,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, 30 per day parking seems pretty extortionate when the prices to stay at the hotel are already so high There is no other options though as the on street parking is mainly residents only or even higher parking fees , Great location for walking on the Thames and Pimlico tube station is 10 mins easy walk Pimlico itself has some great bars restaurants and cafes check out Tony s cafe on Chapel Street for authentic fry ups and a friendly welcome The hotel was clean spacious and the bar is nice The concierge knows his stuff and all his recommendations were great we had some lovely meals Thanks for the free drinks voucher to celebrate our anniversary it s a shame I found it at the bottom of my case when we got home though its the thought that counts I d stay here again although the Executive Deal we got made it much more affordable not sure I d be happy paying almost 300 per night We had a great stay though thanks 
140151,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, Executive lounge only has alcoholic beverages snacks for a very short period of time The view of building work is not very nice to look at , Very clean modern hotel in a quiet location near all the sites making a great base for London 
140152,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, We missed the breakfast by 5 minutes and the restaurant staff wasn t polite they didn t accommodate us So we went hungry until we got into the town Car park was small and spaces were limited Cost us 90 for three days parking which is outrageous Parking somewhere else might of been cheaper , Liked the hotel loved the comfort of the bed and bathroom 
140153,DoubleTree by Hilton London Westminster, There tends to be queue to be seated for breakfast if you go after 9am Particularly when the hotel is busy We waited for 15mins for a table for four Go early get something to go or get room service , The executive lounge access is worth having Great for complimentary light bites and beverages
