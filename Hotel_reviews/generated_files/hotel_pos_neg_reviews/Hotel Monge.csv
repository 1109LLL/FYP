214806,Hotel Monge, Had high expectations for this place and was let down slightly Mostly the staff weren t as friendly or helpful as I was hoping and the room whilst lovely was so small the only thing to do was sleep , Beautiful hotel in lovely location 
214807,Hotel Monge, the room was a bit small especially our triple room for 3 of us Some of the staff were more helpful then others when it came to knowledge about the area restaurants etc , Good location very easy to walk to many attractions and shopping areas The hotel is small but the staff is helpful and the breakfast is good 
214808,Hotel Monge, Electricity went out when my husband plugged in our universal plug No air condition either Gave my grandson and me another room Husband had to spend night in hot room with no lights They did fix it the next morning,No Positive
214809,Hotel Monge, The location is not fabolous but a few extra minutes walking to interesting areas is not a big deal One other negative is you can sometimes hear the metro underneath the building I, This place is new and very classy They have a private steam room in the basement that is free The room as most rooms in Paris is small but doesn t seem too small as it s bright and well appointed I would highly recommend I stayed in 3 hotels this visit and it was the nicest for the money 
214810,Hotel Monge, Lillter bit bigger lobby and more copies of daily papers , It was a real find Beautiful quaint with very kind and accommodating staff Loved restaurant recommendations Made the trip easy and convenient Room was very quiet and we were next to the elevator Breakfast looked terrific even though we did not eat there Will definitely book here again on next trip 
214811,Hotel Monge, I need to note how small the room was the bathroom door can barely open w o hitting the bed so there isn t much privacy Some of the suites looked larger so you may want to consider those as we had a standard double Also please put handles on the inside of the bathroom doors It was so strange that they re so difficult to close when you re actually inside of the bathroom , Everything was really wonderful and the staff was lovely We really enjoyed the breakfasts and the location was superb 
214812,Hotel Monge, Nothing everything was outstanding We hope that the level will be maintained in price and quality , The location was perfect to Metro stations and walking distance to many restaurants The room was very comfortable clean modern and quiet The breakfast was buffet great
214813,Hotel Monge, Nothing, Very high class Smart and comfortable The living area was very smart and comfortable Excellent breakfast The shower and bedroom was all brand new and smart Very friendly service 
214814,Hotel Monge, the room was small, it may be considered a nice boutique hotel Very clean well maintained the staff was very friendly The room had some details with charme 
214815,Hotel Monge, Could hear subway rumble from room though not enough to keep me awake Fancy shower required constant calls to front desk for help in turning on and off a real disappointment given the price and luxury of this facility staff said the shower fixtures have been a problem since the upgrade in past year and I am sure they are working diligently to correct but certainly not what you want in a hotel of this caliber , Very helpful staff and beautifully decorated facility Super clean 
214816,Hotel Monge, 1 No free water in the room for the second day and the day after Free for just the first day but we pay full amount everyday we stay which is not fair 2 No kettle in the room It is not convenient enough We must go to first floor and ask for hot water and bring back to our room by ourselves , Bed and bathroom are good Location is perfect Environment is very good 
214817,Hotel Monge, The only downside of this premium location was that the rooms were very small We didn t spend much time in the hotel room so that wasn t a huge deal but we did have a lot of stuff with us and it felt very crowded , An amazing location in the heart of Paris The hotel staff were beyond helpful very friendly with a polite sense of humor The hotel kept our bags while we traveled to Bordeaux and had them up in our room when we came back The internet connection was very strong everywhere in the hotel and the lobby had all the morning newspapers including the NYT in addition to a collection of very delicious sweets
