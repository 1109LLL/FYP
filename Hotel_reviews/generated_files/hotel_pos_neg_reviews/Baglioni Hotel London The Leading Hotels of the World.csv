222218,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, The extra service charges presumed on your final bill after your stay that go automatically onto the bill I HATE THAT if I wanted to tip I would add it to each bill but they already did this too anyway I am minted so it s not a problem however this is just a bit much and should change , Almost everything
222219,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, The dinner was fine but not memorable, Bedroom was stylish and comfortable A very pleasant place to be The bar terrace was a special place for a drink or meal 
222220,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, The room had low ceilings and the smell is terrible it s like you are sleeping in the perfume isle The flow of the room is horrible and the finishing is not worth the 5 stars , Staff and location
222221,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World,No Negative, Instant upgrade as soon as we arrived my partner needed cigarettes and a staff member went to collect a packet for him instantly which is excellent service We also needed urgent laundry and the housekeeping team fulfilled our request very quickly Extremely happy 
222222,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Poor room view Food was excellent in restaurant but surroundings setting could be better but assume that is down to lack of space The service throughout is excellent but in the restaurant the waiter was what I would describe as too keen He whipped plates away before one of us had finished eating which I was brought up to believe was bad manners etiquette and he was a bit pushy trying to get us to have a second main course , The Maserati Quattro Porte We booked it for the transfer from Kings Cross but then also took advantage of the complimentary service provided by the hotel Staff were all very friendly and the concierge was incredibly helpful when our concert was cancelled at arranging something else for us to do Food at the Italian restaurant was delicious 
222223,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Nothing The hotel was amazing thank you for the first class hospitality , The standard of service was faultless from the check in through to the checkout It has to be one of the best hotels that I have ever had the pleasure in visiting Special thanks goes to the conceirges Tadas Vitkauskas and Phillip Morris Phil went out of his way to make me feel at home and both Tadas and Phil directed me to the local shops restaurants and amenities They also gave recommendations of places to eat and visit The breakfast was excellent and so were the staff I had an omelette made to my liking before my gym session and they made my breakfast according to my dietary requirements The gym and spa was first class with outstanding staff and facilities Many thanks to the trainer Erik Solang for an excellent personal training session pushing me to my limit but giving total support and encouragement the way a personal trainer should be I had a full body massage after the training session too which helped my muscles relax and recover As I was celebrating my birthday I also received free chocolates macarons and a top of the range bottle of Prosecco I will definitely visit again when I get the chance Thank you very much for an excellent stay 
222224,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, A continental Breakfast was very expensive at 26 per person, complementary prosecco in our room Arrived just before 3pm room should have been available from 2pm We sat in the bar and had a complementary cup of coffee whilst waiting 
222225,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Didn t dislike anything about this hotel, Excellent hotel staff were so friendly nothing is was too much trouble beautiful rooms and great location
222226,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World,No Negative, Fabulous complimentary use of the hotel Maserati within a 2km radius of the hotel excellent start to every day for us Terrace bar also excellent although small so get down early for a table if the sun is shining 
222227,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Only thing missing was the ability to make a normal coffee in the room there is a very good espresso machine but that s too strong for us , Clean comfortable excellent location for Kensington and Albert Hall The room was very good in all aspects but the staff are the crowning glory Everyone spoke to us at all times and the reception door staff are first class probably one of the nicest hotel experiences we had in a long time Particular mention to Ricardo a very pleasant and professional receptionist 
222228,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, It was disappointing to not have any view The windows looked out to brickwork and this made the room very dark I do not like laminate flooring in a bedroom either and we had this It made the room less cosy and quite noisy We paid for breakfast on the second day and were offered a glass of water which we had This was charged 4 95 as a separate item on our breakfast bill when I feel this should have been part of the breakfast buffet , We had complimentary coffee when we arrived as we were early and our room was not available The staff were attentive but not over the top or insincere Throughout the whole hotel it was immaculate and it is in a fantastic location The hotel kindly provided a car to take us back to the station on our departure 
222229,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, The refurbished bar is too bright cold and the atmosphere has been removed They also add a service charge to everything including one for housekeeping and a 1 charity donation which makes them look good , Great location nice staff
222230,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, There was no kettle tea making in the room There was a coffee machine but I don t drink coffee However when I asked for kettle cups milk and tea the staff were on to it right away , The staff were amazing so friendly helpful and attentive
222231,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Quality and choices at breakfast very good but pretty expensive, Our first time in a Baglioni hotel and it definitely won t be the last If you are looking for a first class hotel that goes the extra mile to make your stay feel special then this hotel fits the bill Fantastic location across the road from Kensington Park and exceptional service and friendliness of all of the staff Made to feel very welcome at arrival by reception and this level of service and attention continued throughout our stay by all of the staff nothing was too much trouble Restaurant and bar was excellent for cocktails dinner and drinks once again the service could not be faulted Junior suite was spacious and very warmly decorated the bed was very comfortable and the nightly turn down service was a very nice touch only a 5 minute walk from the Royal Albert Hall
222232,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Nothing, The size cleanliness overall comfort of the room the staff was wonderful The location of the hotel was perfect to our venue for our evening entertainment
222233,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Location isn t great although you re near an underground and across from Kensington Hyde Park Finally the couch in the room isn t very comfortable and the shower doesn t have a separate removable extendable showerhead , Staff was very friendly and responsive Bed was extremely comfortable Room overall was very nice Food is amazing 
222234,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Service in the restaurant could be a little slow there were a few maintainence issues with the room but they were sorted out , The room was lovely the staff are warm and welcoming There is a bartender who is a Negroni expert 
222235,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Although we booked a superior room it was very small and dark and faced to the back into an alley Bathroom needs a bit of an update but not too bad , Staff were great Location very convenient for West London High St Kensington Hyde Park Knightsbridge Pleasant 30 min walk across Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park or short car ride to Oxford St Coffee machine refills of still and sparkling water and chocolates all lovely Maserati great for short trips and saved on taxis Beautiful bathroom products Other Italian touches also good We had a special rate so price ok but full price would not be good value for money 
222236,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Breakfast overpriced for what it was Also came with lettuce on the side which was a waste and got in the way No need to serve salad garnish with a breakfast , Staff were excellent very friendly and helpful 
222237,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Minor point I know it s an Italian themed hotel but for non coffee drinkers perhaps tea making facilities could be considered , Staff were genuinely and extremely courteous Environment beautiful Rooms lovely And the restaurant serves authentic Italian fare My dishes were excellent Huge compliments to the chef please And because I m no good with names let me extend my warmest regards to All the staff who made sure my stay was perfect 
222238,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, I didn t like the dull colors it s not what matches my personality the room was very small and the door is opposite the bed the toilet is small and black floors are very cold as the floors are marble The view from the window was walls I didn t like that at checkout they added 45 on my bill saying it s for service and charity without informing me prior to adding on my bills , It was great staying in the hotel staff were very welcoming the location is amazing opposite Hyde park and 10 minutes walk from Knightsbridge and harrods it s worth trying it my unlike s should not effect others as my opinion and defers from others 
222239,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Realy minor details to know the best independent shops what is hot in cultural scene what is worth to visit better TV programs realy minor details Shampoo and gel may be from Hermes or malin goetz things that matter to smart travelers, Staff are perfect very kind indeed very patient with our requests and questions
222240,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Although the espresso coffee machine was lovely in our room the addition of a kettle with tea and coffee making facilities would have suited all international guests , The staff were all very friendly and accommodating We were able to check in early and were delighted when we were upgraded to a junior suite We will definitely stay there again 
222241,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Not worth 380 for a nights stay Food I ordered to the room was not what you would expect from a 5 hotel neither was the bed , The lobby was beautiful and the staff was amazing Lovely bathroom 
222242,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, We were only there for one night , Friendly and helpful staff Room upgrade Classy and comfortable A hotel and staff happy in their own skin unpretentious and genuine 
222243,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Nothing it ticked all the boxes, The Staff went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful The hotel has an exceptional warm comfortable feel Is in a great location We stayed for my husbands birthday and everyone went out of there way to make his day extra special by leaving a cake in the room We were also given an upgraded room which was superb and so unexpected We had friends join us for afternoon tea which was also a great experience and ended with another wonderful birthday cake Do stay at this lovely hotel if you get the chance you won t be disappointed 
222244,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, It took too long to make my porridge in the morning and the reason was because the other table had too many orders, The food was great The staff very nice 
222245,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, The design is not as good as I think the furniture design interior design and light design is ok not matching with hotels of the same price The view is ok but facing the main Street and has no privacy when sit outside , Location is ok close to Hyde station but far from places where things take place
222246,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Not a thing , The entite experience was wonderful The service levels offered by the staff are top class Food and beverages of exvellent quality The decor and ambience of the hotel are sublime Very conveniently situated to Kensington shopping area and underground 
222247,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, There was not one single point of the hotel and staff to dislike , Upon arrival at the Hotel we found the Hotel staff provided an outstanding service and were extremely impressed by the standard of our suite We felt that no request was to much trouble Bed was a dream to sleep on We would recommend this hotel to friends family and business colleagues without any fears of disappointment 
222248,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, If I had to critique pillows were a little too hard, Fantastic Hotel very Helpful staff Donato Bottiglieri Federico Floris Tim Spencer and Tasas Vitkauskas could not do enough for us Maserati Quatraporte was great to use within 2 mile radius 
222249,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, On arrival mid morning we were invited to eat to hotel As we had missed breakfast due to early flight we asked for some eggs toast and coffee The waitress said breakfast had ended 15 mins prior but she would ask chef He refused to make it I don t think this meal was an unreasonable request and would not have taken 5 mins Not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel and certainly not for the price we paid , Rooms were lovely Staff very friendly
222250,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Rooms are too dark housekeeping is not available after 11 00pm They actually sent up a doorman to change the bedsheets The restaurant cafe in the lobby is very average for a Baglioni, Location only 
222251,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Night Room service menu lacked much choice , Service was 10 10 Room was Beautiful All the little extras make this hotel go the extra mile free transport in the Maserati was an added bonus too don t think about booking this hotel just book it would stay here any day with pleasure 
222252,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Overall I thought the prices were at the very top end of similar hotels I ve stayed at Adding service charges on everything at the time of checking out, Staff service and facilities were excellent 
222253,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, I ordered one medium boiled egg for breakfast and they brought me one hard boiled egg and a cheque for 10 pounds I was at least expecting a charge of 5 pounds , Perfect service wonderful room with wooden floors and window to open very pleasant 
222254,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Shower door wasn t sealed properly so the bathroom got soaked when taking a shower , lovely room and the staff were amazing Nothing was too much trouble

222256,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Too many mirrors in the bathroom My husband said he didn t like sharing his shower with a fat guy , The room was beautiful Elegant and stylish The staff are marvellous friendly without being obsequious and helpful in absolutely every way 
222257,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, I used stay there few times they were great But now I did not like the concerige service they did not know what to recommend and they r slow I had to do my search using the internet, I liked the cleaniness of the room 
222258,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, The bed was not comfortable and these days the bar are under renovation plus there is a building next to the hotel are under construction, Very friendly staff and accommodating the hotel is nice and clean location a bit away from underground station but the main buses are passing on the same street
222259,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, i have stopped in a lot of 5 star exclusive hotels the grovenor the Dorchester etc i found the prices the baglioni charged where outrageous 1 glass of wine a g t and 1 bottle lager 42 a club sandwich you charged me 6 to deliver to the room with cold chips then added 12 5 service and an additional 5 for i dont know what this by the way was on top of the 377 i paid for a room with no breakfast although apparently a snip at 24 per head and the 45 overnight parking i knew this before booking of course but the hotel is not one i will ever visit again i paid a similar amount at the grovenor much better facilities rooms and the food and drink prices were sensible by comparison this made the whole experience disappointing i wondered why the hotel was so empty and we were the only people in the bar and restaurant it was blamed on refurbish work but i guess its probably due to the expensive costs the restaurant and poorly stocked bar was mediocre at best the walls where hand painted i was told by the concierge by a child i assumed , the concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful the staff were polite 
222260,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Room was dark due to the color scheme brown and gold No natural light Needs to be brighter , Staff were friendly and helpful especially Phil the Concierge Really knows his stuff 
222261,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World,No Negative, Very friendly staff Rooms clean but not exactly sunlit Comfortably situated near Kensington Gardens It takes a ten minute walk to the next tube station Probably not quite a five star hotel but perhaps the most relaxed and welcoming accomodation in London 
222262,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, Full cooked breakfast on day 1 was excellent day 2 same breakfast but portions far smaller due to a busier hotel after Royal Variety at Albert Hall the night before therefore not consistent Service though was attentive as always , Attentive service and complimentary car was extremely useful as it was raining Very friendly knowledgeable driver 
222263,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, The only criticism was the bed was a little too firm for my liking otherwise everything was lovely , It is beautifully decorated and the cocktails were good It is near the RAH which was the purpose of our visit The staff were very friendly 
222264,Baglioni Hotel London The Leading Hotels of the World, I was staying at the highest floor the room was nice but I would add some more detailes to make it more cozy looking like two little rugs at the sides of the bed would be perfect also the walls are looking quite cold and unattractive so I would put either the wallpaper on it or color it in a bit more warm tone So A few little details would make the room perfect Also the water was leaking right on the floor while showering but it s quite easy to fix I think, Very stylish and welcoming hotel in my favourite area of London
