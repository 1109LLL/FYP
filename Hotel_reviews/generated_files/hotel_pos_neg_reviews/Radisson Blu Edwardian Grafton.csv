45621,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, On checkout it became obvious that I d been charged some extra drinks to my room The gentleman on Reception said he d sorted it out and took my card for two payments room and drinks and valet parking The receipt showed the same actions However my bank account showed that the extra amount for drinks nearly 80 had been taken on my card even though I hadn t authorised it or presented my card to pay that amount I m now in the process of trying to get this refunded And a minor thing a good selection of gins but offered with Schweppes , Accommodating on arrival and helpful with valet parking and taxis to restaurant 
45622,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, bacon at breakfast was streaky rather than usual back and had to enquire for fried egg, Andrew at hotel desk was very helpful and professional on arrival
45623,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, the BOOKING system was very slow once we got to the place for some reason the hotel system did not recognize the booking and we had to wait for half an hour to sort it out The staff said now the booking system is on itsown so sometimes it is not recignized by the system Please fix it since next time it might happen again, bed is very comfortable breakfast is great location very central
45624,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Bathroom layout was odd and shower stall was small No drawers for putting away clothes Could have done without the mini bar , Room was small but comfortable and it had a bay window The place has character and is safe I d stay there again 
45625,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, No mirror where hair drier is Large tv there but needs a mirror too Also dressing table had sockets which really needed a good dust But the rest of the room was ok I did not mention this to staff as was out most of the time but am sure if I did it would have been rectified , Comfy bed hair drier and plenty hangers
45626,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The extra bed could definitely be better We were promised a family room with sofa bed then we were given a small cot that was not suitable The staff did try their best to make it comfortable but it was quite a disappointment , The extra s provided by the hotel really helped us to enjoy our 2 day stay there The staff were very friendly and willing to assist us with the problem with the extra bed in the room The room was a bit gloomy but was good for a short stay The place is located at a convenient spot close to the tube station so perfect for travelling in and out of the place Good eating spots nearby and very close for the shopping enthusiasts as it s short distance from Oxford street 
45627,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Breakfast is perfect has everithing even superfoods Staff is very friendly and helpful I liked my room bed is comfortable and I had a big work table My room and bathrom were not big but I consider this normal for London 
45628,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was tiny and I have stayed in many single rooms in London this one was the smallest ever One needed to step into the shower to open the bathroom door which only opened half way due to a wall There were no drawers for clothing only a tiny shelf in the closet The closet was tiny and nearly full of an extra pillow ironing board , Cleaners did a good job convenient to tube station helpful staff
45629,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We stayed there twice over a 5 day period The first room was not great We had no view and looked out over air conditioning ventilation ducts The air conditioning was poor room very warm However as we wee only staying overnight we weren t in room long enough for it to be a massive issue The suite upgrade was much appreciated and made the last night of our holiday a very pleasurable and memorable one , We got upgraded to a suite which was amazing Great room view was fabulous from our balcony Hotel was very quiet with little outside traffic noise noticeable 
45630,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, People going to book tickets at the reception when they ought to see the concierge and taking over twenty minutes People booking in and having problems paying with cards which holds up the queue People in line getting irritated and moaning because of the wait Disappointed with our meal in Steak and Lobster restaurant as it had been recommended , Friendly receptionist only too pleased to help Changed our room to a higher floor without any problems Enjoyed a nice glass of wine in the bar most spacious and relaxing 
45631,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, It was a bit noisy at night , The bed was very comfortable the room was cleaned to a high standard The main hotel was also kept to a high standard of cleanliness and the staff were very accommodating It was a perfect location to be able to hop on the underground and go where we wanted to go 
45632,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was tiny and rather shabby Clearly very old the USB charger point didn t work the shower was leaky the air con noisy , Friendly helpful staff 
45633,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The TV had some issues we were able to fix ourselves but it was a bit annoying Also if you have the window open at night it can be a little loud because of the street below and there must be a hospital near by because there are a lot of ambulances but this is only if the window is open really , The bed was fantastic as were the bed sheets and the bathroom although small was very nice The cleaning staff did a great job with the room when we asked them to clean and overall we were really satisfied with the room The location is really great especially if you want to catch the tube as it is just across the road and has the northern and victoria lines which take you into the city 
45634,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Stall very helpful Escorted me to my room as I was having trouble with lift Good sized bed small double for a single room but still enough floor space Excellent location 
45635,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Cost of breakfast was really very expensive the two of us could eat outside for far less than the cost of one breakfast in the hotel , Nice clean and comfortable rooms nice and secure and hotel is in a good location with transport readily available and it is only a 25 minute walk right in to the heart of London 
45636,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Reception staff could not locate my booking and took an hour to rebook me before I could finally go to my room , Breakfast was good a big selection of fresh food 
45637,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, When booking the break it is unclear what is meant by guest as I already gave my name and then the name of my guest Turns out that isn t what it means and the booking ended up in my guests name as a single booking not for 2 people I will know this for the future but it is a bit confusing , High standard of quality and variety in breakfast just about everything you could want and great standard
45638,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Pricey but suited my need to stay in that location daughter just given birth to twins at nearby hospital TV didn t seem easy to get to work unless paid extra I didn t mind not watching as wasn t important to me , Bed was comfortable and room was quiet Good choice available for breakfast 
45639,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Very noisy inner yard starting very early morning It looks like hotel personnel is using it as smoking place as result annoying smell from window Very unfriendly control pad of air condition uninformative rubber knobs , Well equiped safe few steps to metro station 20 minutes by foot to Trafalgar square Nice breakfast good restaurant 
45640,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, When checking in to my single room it turned out to be no bigger than a storage cupboard and for 199 per night I would have expected more I had to pay an extra 60 to upgrade to a bigger room ,No Positive
45641,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Really nothing to complain about, Clean quiet and well located The staff were friendly and I ordered dinner from room service which arrived within ten minutes 
45642,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Location is easy for transport but hospital and university is across the road creating loud street noise , Comfy bed basic room well setup facilities great breakfast full buffet 
45643,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The pillows were like concrete, the staff were all great nothing seemed to be too much trouble and there was always a smile whoever we spoke to For wonderful staff this hotel would be hard to beat and I have stayed all over the world at higher rated than this one 
45644,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Old decor only freeview channels in room small room wouldn t say it s four stars only areas that is four stars is reception toilet Also requested 3 time by phone email for the hotel to put in the room a card or anything as such saying happy birthday as it was my girlfriends birthday and we were travelling together so I couldn t do it before hand staff said this would be fine turned up and it wasn t done also as a same sex relationship we had booked a double bed through booking com and questioned at the check in if we were sure it was a double room we wanted or two single beds Felt very uncomfortable by this , Comfortable bed nice toilet and reception Clean 
45645,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The air con didn t seem very effective and the TV wasn t very user friendly Checking in was slow a large group arrived in front of me , Really good sized room I d booked a single but got a double and nice bathroom Excellent location just by Warren Street tube and not too noisy 
45646,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The rooms were cramped and there was hardly any space to keep the luggage or move around The AC unit inside the room was so noisy and we lost our 4 nights sleep When we informed about the problem they showed us another room which was worse Though the staff were trying to accommodate and help the front office manager was an arrogant lady and refused to provide any solution She was ready to check us out on day 2 when I said we were seriously exploring to move to other hotel As we did not have much time a child travelling with us and had luggage too we could not check out Would never book in this place again , The location was fine and front office personnel were helpful 
45647,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We booked a double room and the first room they gave us was very small and the bed was about a 4 ft bed so I had them change us The one we stayed in was a lot better but it had stairs , Easy to find from the tube 
45648,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, My single room was placed in the inner part of the building and was small but it was quite The shower cabin was small and it was uncomfortable taking a shower , Excellent location close to metro station 50 m and Regent s park kind staff good breakfast For the girls there is hair conditioner available in the bathroom Also grocery stores and cafe available next to the hotel 
45649,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Bathroom was very small it was a single room so I suppose I can t complain Service in the restaurant could have been better , The bed was very comfortable The location was really good and handy for tube bus or walking to lots of interesting places The steak in the restaurant was wonderful 
45650,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, having a single bed and as it was warm I needed to use the air conditioning as the road noise was too loud to have the window open and now I have an awful cold , the breakfast is amazing and the staff really helpful
45651,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, a lot of homeless outside the door and immediate area Not sure about safety late at night especially with children , Tube right next door with supermarkets and restaurants near by 
45652,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We stayed in 10 different Radisson Blu hotels in past few years and this was the hands down definitely the worst experience ever For the record we were in the room 365 which is in the never part of the hotel but it rather felt like it s 2 part of the hotel yes this wouldn t got more than 2 stars in the rest of the europe or maybe 3 stars where the standards are stretched but it s far from 4 by any standards Here are the most irritating problems we experienced 1 Double bed was only 120 130cm wide which made whole sleeping experience for two of us quite unpleasant 2 In addition to bed to help us sleep better there was a irritating high pitch twirling noise from the bathroom 24 7 whole time Sounds like a broken ventilation fan than NEVER turns off Not that much of a problem unless it s a middle of a night and you want to sleep 3 Lastly shower was a w f u l It was sprinkling water everywhere but where it should if fact it was leaking on the side where the shower head is connected so there was a little to none pressure in the shower head itself Add in mix that shower head is non removable fixed to the front wall there was quite a success to get any of the water actually on yourself as all of it was leaking on the side and down the wall tiles To make things worst it seems like they re aware of the problem as it looks that someone tried to fix the problem by putting a loose rubber sleeve around the connection which helps absolutely nothing , Location was great and reception stuff was polite Too bad that they fail at more important things like accommodation comfort 
45653,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, It s a bit expensive and our room was small though had some view of the back of hotel , Close to a subway station and can find restaurants and supermarkets in a few blocks 
45654,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I asked for a twin room but got a double bed room and as I was with my 33 year old daughter it wasn t really appropriate plus the room was tiny for 2 people, All was average
45655,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The bathroom was poorly designed No room to put my stuff close to the sink just a very narrow ledge and only a ceiling shower head which could not be adjusted I managed to find the hairdryer not in the bathroom but glued in a drawer with such a short cable that i could not reach the mirror with it My room was next to the ice dispenser so it was noisy even late at night Also very soft bed my back hurt the next day , The staff was polite and the room had tea and iron facilities which was very convenient The hotel is very close to the metro and there are shops close by 
45656,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Very small room a true single room with a view of the ducting from the windows The shower was a tight fit for an average sized person , Great location walking distance from Euston convenient for the British museum and next ro warren st tube The staff were really nice helpful and efficient Breakfast buffet was a great choice I liked the omlette cooked to order staff were efficient The air conditoioning was quiet Room had everything you would want except space 
45657,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, This is the second time I have booked a room with children and the hotel was unaware of it This meant that the family room wasn t ready and a bed had to be made up when we arrived at 10pm The staff told us this often happens with a booking com reservation which doesn t recognise children and this is my experience also I ve made several bookings for two upcoming trips if this follows true I won t use your service again,No Positive
45658,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, More tv channels like sky, Comfy bed lovely quality bedding and large bath towels room very clean lovely atmosphere throughout the hotel security conscious with the lift 
45659,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Like all London hotels the room was small , Perfect location near tube station and easy walk to the theater and shopping The breakfast buffet was wonderful and they had additional dishes that were made to order Very clean comfortable and cozy room I would definitely stay here again 
45660,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Scolding hot water when running a bath early morning Had to take a both in another room The seats on the benches or what they are called along the wall in the breakfast room rather worn and uncomfortable And not the cleanest of fabrics and an odd colour as well , My single room was very spacious for a single room in London And came with a bathtub 
45661,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Messed up my bill on restaurant and restaurant manager was very rude saying I was wrong , Breakfast was tasty but sadly one morning it came over half an hour late and was cold Air con faulty in my room so was offered to move to a small room which I did not do and then moved to a much better twin room only thing wrong with that one was beds are small 
45662,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The rooms were like corridors really small one of the rooms we were shown you had to walk side ways to get around the bed I am only a size 8 They were clean but just really very small compared to the pictures advertised ,No Positive
45663,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The bathroom wasn t amazing little bit mouldy which wasn t bad but it s just you expect somewhere that is this price bracket to be spotless , Very grand clean smelt amazing room was stunning They gave us a plate of Macaroons and upgraded us to a business suite as it was the last night with my partner for some time 
45664,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The security card opporated lifts and doors I found hard to use and the maze of corridors to get to and from rooms , staff were professional and helpful Great room and bathroom Room had USB points and an international power point 
45665,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Hotel was a little expensive but I guess in London you get what you pay for, Good location and breakfast Initial room was very small but the staff quickly moved me to a room with much more space Loved the candy in the lobby each day haha
45666,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Noisy and hot room which had the size of a shoebox Very small bed so small I fell a couple of times almost out and I m very thin don t know how a bigger person would fit in it , Friendly staff good breakfast good gym next to tube station tastefully decorated good wifi tiny room but the space was well used
45667,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, It was very noisy at night lots of emergency vehicles going past the hotel but we were at the front of the hotel on the main road , Location was great very close to Warren Street tube station so travelling around London was easy Room was large especially for central London it was very clean and had everything required 
45668,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Colleagues found the single rooms too small Noisy air con , It was a business trip and myself and colleagues needed breakfast early Declined by staff because it was a Saturday We now need a refund for breakfast 
45669,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The conference room had poor IT and the staff were taking phone calls via their mobile during our seminar This was not helpful considering we asked all delegates to refrain from using such devices during the sessions Staff need to be more professional in this regard As this reflects poorly on the company However the organisers were disappointed with the conference room stating that it was not good value for money , The bedroom was delightful The breakfast was okay but I prefer poached egg and short back bacon 
45670,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I changed rooms as it was noisy nee the lift I found the bed uncomfortable the air con to noisy and the room to hot , The staff were very helpful and pleasant
45671,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, No sheet on the bed pillows far too firm mattress too firm Not enough non decaf coffee they must want us asleep early , Lift security with the card swipe Breakfast was good 
45672,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Overpriced small rooms , Excellent location breakfast Rooms were very small I had to upgrade to a double Overpriced as are most London hotels 
45673,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The singelroom was extremli small The brown carpet no good at all and there were no Slippers The colours dark and dull or just dull The lightning should be bett,No Positive
45674,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room we had was on the front so was noisy some times at night so would recommend room at the back but it didn t detract from our stay, Close to tube station so could get around London very easily
45675,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Air conditioning in the room otherwise too hot But I find air con to be noisy and is not helpful when trying to get to sleep Turned it off but then was too hot , The breakfast choice was excellent Location good for travelling and walking around central London Staff very helpful and pleasant 
45676,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The single room was on the top floor with an uneven roof The roman blinds is not larger than the window so light leaked though the sides , Friendly staff fluffy towels comfortable bed great location just next to the tube station with one supermarket just across the street and one about 100 m down the road The room was pretty spacious for a single room 
45677,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Had a very bad start so bad that I even directly rated it on TripAdvisor the first night as I got fed up afterwards I figured out was a little too harsh on the hotel but had no more chance the correct it Room was small and some staff not friendly this was however not always the case , Great bed and breakfast
45678,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Rooms could be bigger and perhaps we were not lucky enough to get best room, The front office staff was very helpful and very courteous Breakfast was excellent specially croissant Very nicely located 
45679,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, bedroom was very noisey on first floor traffic noise we ate in the restaurant for breakfast staff didn t seem very helpful both days tables were not set up properly missing teaspoons and cups and we booked there for dinner on our second night food was great but we did not stay for the full evening as there was a large table and the service became poor non existent so we left would have liked to try dessert but struggled to get attention paid the service charge but would have been nice to receive some i am sure the table of 17 made it more rewarding for them and they moved another couple from there table during there dinner to set up the big table very poor Radisson Blu, food in the restaurant was excellent location next to tube station reception and housekeeping stall polite and helpfull
45680,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was quite small even for a single as is the fitness room , High standard hotel right next to tube station short walk to shops and various attractions Good breakfast and great staff 
45681,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, We arrived early and they let us check in so we could enjoy our day My daughter loved the sweets in reception nice touch Lovely choice for breakfast 
45682,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was noisy no black out curtains and double bed was really a queen not very comfortable so did not sleep well If you stay there make sure you ask for a room that is not on main road , Excellent location and very friendly staff 
45683,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Had to pay for breakfast before we ate which I found very strange Paying in advance of eating Only ate breakfast 1st day Quite expensive 20 Only wanted tea and fruit but no option for this only , Reception staff very helpful Initially given a 2nd floor room which was not what we requested Moved to top floor room which was much better Very comfortable and quiet 
45684,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing, Location is excellent Next to Warren Underground Station Oxfort street only 10 min walking supermarket accross the street Friendly Staff especially Helena and Mariana on breakfast 
45685,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Although double glazing has been installed since our last stay in room 245 at the front of the property the noise from traffic police and drunk people is non stop from 9pm 6am, Beautiful hotel staff went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible 
45686,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, So disappointed the windows are not triple glazed to prevent street noise and emergency services penetrating the room and ruining a good nights sleep I would not return here for this reason , Breakfast
45687,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, This hotel is in great location very near Euston station and seconds away from Warren street underground station Staff are friendly and informative restaurant was excellent very comfy bed had a great stay ,No Positive
45688,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was very small view from window not pleasant shower cubical very small Air conditioning too loud preventing a good nights sleep Cost of room 219 00 was way too expensive , Location of hotel
45689,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Buffet breakfast wasn t good at all so ordered from the menu this was mediocre Had planned to eat in the steak and lobster restaurant on the Saturday evening but was put off by the breakfast so ate elsewhere , Bed was super comfy excellent pillows
45690,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Shower temperature difficult to regulate Had to queue for 25 mins to check in Room very small , Excellent location right next to tube station and convenient for RCGP Close to Regents Park Excellent breakfast 
45691,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Air condition did not work properly and it was difficult to sleep due to the heat Very small room and bathrom but had all the necessities , Great breakfast 
45692,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The fact that there was a lot of noise outside in the corridor when we were still in bed It sounded like it was the cleaners There wasn t any talking just a lot of clatter , The virtual host Edward 
45693,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room and bed were very small The customer service was extremely slow The wait for breakfast was long and the food was not very nice Very disappointing experience,No Positive
45694,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was quite small and the shower stall very tight I was lucky to be slim Rather book a double room , Breakfast was probably the best about this hotel The salmon fresh yougurts selection of fresh juices made me happy each morning 
45695,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Although a croissant was included it would ve been nice to have butter and jam , Since I had to leave the hotel before breakfast I requested a carry away breakfast and was accommodated 
45696,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Had do not disturb sign on door after having spent night taking part in midnight walk for charity Could hear staff in corridor singing and making a lot of noise when I was trying to sleep , Friendly staff
45697,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing really, Good location next to a metro station Cooked and fresh breakfast with many choices The food in the restaurant was very good both the lobster beef steak menu and the buffet The staff both at the reception and the restaurant were very friendly 
45698,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing In my opinion if someone really had a problem at this hotel then they are just too picky and don t have anything else to do with their time than be overly critical , The shower was so powerful that I took three showers a day just for the power massage Room was cozy which means just enough size for me I stayed in the room from 6am 4pm one day and it was lovely I had a huge window and the room was so silent that I couldn t even here myself think The breakfast was HUGE and included with Booking com reservation that added incredible value I hardly had to eat the rest of the day The staff was awesome and helped with numerous different questions I WILL STAY HERE EVERYTIME I COME TO LONDON They even had big plastic ups to get ice in fantastic The location 23 feet from Warren Station is as good as it gets I ve travelled to 70 countries and 48 States 
45699,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Only a small gripe the fixed hairdryer was nippy and the position of the mirror, My wife can t sleep in hotels well when we go away but she had the best sleep even better than home All the shower and bath stuff was normal size which is good hotel was spotless we will book when we go back to London great location to underground and also kings cross is within walking distance so was good for us as we got train from Edinburgh so holiday started early 
45700,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Hard to fault but perhaps breakfast room needs a bit of thought in terms of bottlenecks in people flow , Fantastic breakfast Excellent friendly staff Nothing was too much trouble Will definitely stay again 
45701,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Good location next to Warren Street tube walking distance to West End Oxford Street etc or easy Tube access Lots of restaurants nearby e g around Charlotte Street plus scent pubs e g Fitzrovia Tavern If you are into cinema the Curzon Bloomsbury is about a 15 minute walk and has a great selection of films 
45702,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, breakfast menu is a little confusing and so is the process to allow food or drinks to be charged to the room, Excellent stay Very quiet in room and excellent service Great food and drink 
45703,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Very small room and had to move things around to get into wardrobe We were at the front of the hotel This was not good when there were two 7am to 11pm convenience stores having deliverys through the night underneath our window , Lots of breakfast fare 
45704,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The fan in our bathroom seemed to be always on The noise from the road was also a bit loud making it difficult to fall asleep but it didn t disturb me the rest of the night , The staff were lovely and very helpful I was really impressed with the d cor and cleanliness The bed was lovely and comfortable I really liked that they had fresh fruit flavored water on offer for guests There was also a tube station literally at the next corner which was very convenient for getting about town 
45705,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The standard room I stayed in overlooked windows opposite so could have done with voile curtains for privacy but it wasn t too much of a problem , The five star service I stayed here 3 times for a total of 11 days over 3 weeks to be close to the UCLH as my husband was seriously ill in the hospital The staff and service were superb and on hearing of my dilema did everything to make my stay as comfortable and worry free as possible Nothing was to much trouble I have a bad back but the beds are so comfy with clean crisp white linen Pillows and duvet were so soft like sleeping on a cloud I stayed in both superior king and standard rooms and all were of same high standard The only difference is you get robes and slippers in superior rooms which are also larger Breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of choice to suit every taste The evening meals are delicious and reasonably priced for a 4star London hotel Buses and tube station right outside the door perfect Would definitely book again if I needed to stay in London and highly recommend 
45706,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The soap dispenser in the shower didn t work The breakfast was warm not hot The coffee was only just warm and I had to ask for a replacement of hot coffee No sweet pastries , The location of the hotel was close to Euston station and had an underground station across the road So for the purpose of this particular trip it was idea The room was tiny but very clean Good breakfast choice apart from no sweet pastries 
45707,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room is small and Americans would consider the bathroom cramped But you re in London why stay in your room , Location location location access to transport options is great
45708,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The internet speed included in the room rate was low but I think that a higher speed connection can be purchased for an additional fee if necessary , Everything was great We went from the airport to the hotel using only the subway The subway station is 200m from the hotel 
45709,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast was the same every day I would have preferred some variety , Staff was very accommodating when I asked to be moved from the first floor to a higher level floor 
45710,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room and bathroom a bit small but perfectly adequate for our two night stay, Great location being right beside Warren Street tube Very quiet at night No street noise as we were at side of hotel 
45711,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Our room was at the front of the hotel looking out on to a busy road With single glazed windows you could hear all the traffic and people out to the early hours Id recommend a room at the back of the hotel based on this , The hotel is practically next door to Warren Street tube station which made getting around so easy The room was exceptionally clean and spacious and the staff helpful and polite The breakfast was amazing I would stay here again 
45712,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I have stayed here before and really enjoyed it Not this time The room I got was tiny and at the front of the building For the price it certainly wasnt value for money The air con was too loud to have on and to have the windows open for air was also too loud but a necessity Never stay at the front of this hotel the road outside is constantly noisy with ambulances at the hospital opposite or trucks and buses all during the night Also their pillows were too big and firm and left me with a stiff neck The day staff are lovely but when I checked out at 4 30 am the night staff were busy chatting about their breakfast deliveries barely raised an eye to me and certainly weren t remotely as professional as the day shift , Great location for what I needed although a lot of beggars around when you go and sit outside next door at Cafe Nero
45713,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, My room booking took a long while to come through to the hotel system and I was made to wait close to half an hour to be given a key despite showing the reception desk a booking confirmation it simply took too long Then unfortunately for the price of my room the room was very very small quite unlike the picture I had seen on the booking com website The chopped fruit left in my room was a nice touch but was without a cover and the bathroom was unclean All in all I would be reluctant to stay again at such an extortionate price , I feel the hotel is nice and comfortable when you walk into the lobby The breakfast was delicious and the staff at breakfast were really great Friendly attentive and provided great service with smiles 
45714,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, It would have been nicer to have had proper bedside tables not individual ceiling spotlights above each side of the bed how on earth are you supposed to read quietly when your partner is trying to get to sleep when there is a huge bright light shining down from the ceiling Or find your way to the bathroom in the middle of the night without waking people up by shining a bright light directly in their face , Easy to get to from St Pancras just a 10 minute walk Nice bar the hotel bar inside not the loud public bar attached to the hotel lovely service from friendly staff 
45715,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, My room was tiny I have never stayed in such a small room in all my life For 91 that was extremely bad value also considering that the hotel is so plush and then to have a room only suitable for a hobbit , Excellent breakfast 
45716,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The breakfast was luke warm , The staff were very welcoming and attentive The room was ready when we arrived despite us being a couple of hours early We left our luggage there after departure and picked it up 8 hours later The room was perfectly adequate for a one or two night stay The shower wasn t very powerful 
45717,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Totally misrepresented by your website images The room was nothing like I expected and had to request be moved on arrival as the room we received was equivalent to a bed in a wardrobe I am staying in another of your hotels in June and do hope it is better , location
45718,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The shower was treacherous The floor of shiny plastic was very slippery worse while using soap And there were no handles to grab onto It was very overpriced , Breakfast was pretty good and bed comfy 
45719,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, It is located close to a hospital so you can hear ambulances in the night The windows are not soundproof so it might disturb your sleep , The rooms are large enough Children welcome Great location easy access to public transport Friendly staff Clean room with all you need 
45720,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, The staff was very courteous and helpful Bed and pillows were very comfortable Location was ideal very close to all the major sights and to the underground There were also plenty of places for a quick lunch or food to go It also helped that there was a Tesco Express 2 doors away and a Sainsbury s across the street I would definitely stay at the Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton again 
45721,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Staff was very nice and kind I want specifically to mention Trevor who was extremely helpful Breakfast is excellent and so is the hotel restaurant for dinner Location is very good a minute to tube and close to British museum and Oxford street 
45722,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We had a junior suit Good room and front desk service Also the welcome set in the room was sweet Only one thing there was no hair comb in the bath Cocktail was good though the environment for the bar is just normal please think how to deal with the strong smell of Loster Because it makes the whole ground floor smelly The breakfast was horrible especially the unfresh strawberry and melon Worse Not even compared to Intercontinental It is like Holiday Inn Bad Both the service quality and attitude of the staff Can you accept someone using vacuum cleaner when you are still haven t your breakfast Not only one table but all around No spoon for the coffee tea yogurt We need to bring back extra breakfast sets for extras space o our table No one comes to serve neither when we were guided nor during the entire breakfast So we had to diy in this 4 star hotel , We had a junior suit Good room and front desk service Also the welcome set in the room was sweet Only one thing there was no hair comb in the bath Cocktail was good though the environment for the bar is just normal please think how to deal with the strong smell of Loster Because it makes the whole ground floor smelly The breakfast was horrible especially the unfresh strawberry and melon Worse Not even compared to Intercontinental It is like Holiday Inn Bad Both the service quality and attitude of the staff Can you accept someone using vacuum cleaner when you are still haven t your breakfast Not only one table but all around No spoon for the coffee tea yogurt We need to bring back extra breakfast sets for extras space o our table No one comes to serve neither when we were guided nor during the entire breakfast So we had to diy in this 4 star hotel 
45723,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, For a London hotel the rooms are surprisingly spacious the bathroom was a very good size The beds were probably the most comfortable I ve slept in The room and the hotel is very clean and in good shape The staff is really friendly The WiFi is excellent I can t fault anything with this hotel I d stay there again and I d recommend it to anyone
45724,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was very small , The room was very small which I was not expecting and so was a bit disappointed I did however enjoy my stay very much because of the lovely staff and the unbeatable central location of the hotel Puspa Felix and Alana were all lovely and helped make my stay comfortable The breakfast was delicious and had a variety of food items 
45725,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, No bed side or reading lights No double glazing very noisy whatever side of hotel your room is in and would imagine gives a very cold draught in winter , Great staff and excellent location 
45726,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Snooty front office staff the opposite of the breakfast staff snootier guests I had to keep the blinds down to avoid being visible to the office across the street , The room was quite comfortable the hotel is next door to a 24 hour grocery The breakfast offered an impressive array of healthy choices The breakfast staff was friendly and attentive 
45727,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing it was all great , The staff went out of their way to ensure I was comfortable and well looked after I have a disability which I did not make known however I didn t need too The staff went above and beyond their duties and were absolutely excellent 
45728,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, room dark painted dark colours felt miserable Shower ran hot then cold all the time not a lot of water came out so it took ages to shower pillows very deep which made it uncomfortable sleeping I ve stayed in radisson s quite a few times this wasn t one of my favourites, I got in a muddle with my booking sent an email and also received a call to reassure me all was OK which I thought was very thoughtful and was given complimentary breakfast as she realised I was pretty stressed that was a very nice touch which I appreciated breakfast was good with a very good choices staff in restaurant where good 
45729,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The rooms were very small and poorly laid out The rooms also had a smell of smoke in them, Staff were friendly and the location was good to both Euston and Marylebone as well as central London locations 
45730,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Honestly could not fault this place , Food in the restaurant was great best breakfast in a hotel ever Staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel was spotlessly clean 
45731,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The concierge tried to give me a bad room even though I asked what rooms are available and which one is the best When I got to the room it was obvious to me being very well traveled that this was not a good room They gave me a new and much better room but it insulted me that they tried when I specifically asked for the best room out of the available ones , Lovely hotel in general 
45732,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Everything about the hotel was perfect the staff amazing and location perfect right next to two underground lines Edna our brewajfast waitress was amazing and the steak and lobster for dinner a must try We can t wait to go back
45733,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The size of double bed was very small and I didn t get much sleep not very comfortable for two big adults Spoilt the visit a lot So I would suggest not to book a standard room if like a large bed , As usual the staff could not have been more helpful the breakfast 1st class Location ideal Room spotless with new carpets 
45734,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Better to book direct with hotel rather than through booking com Booking com stated I had a room that I wanted but it was different to what they had for me Extra hassle for no reason The hotel staff were really nice though ,No Positive
45735,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We loved this property group if 9 in gals getaway from New York Staff were amazing especially Edna who was our breakfast angel Steak and lobster restaurant a must try greatest location for underground ,No Positive
45736,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Hair dryer was cold only no heat so completely useless Also permanently wired into a location too far from the mirror , Friendly staff cosy and thoroughly comfortable room
45737,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The bed was too firm for me Our room door was immediately next to another and was very noisy on closing The shower was a bit temperamental on temperature Would of liked a heater rather than the blower as it was noisy trying to get the room warm , Friendly staff Good location Very reasonable food and drink prices A nice place to be great restaurant 
45738,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing The price of rooms all over central London Perhaps another couple of coffee pods for the machine rather than 2 non decaf 1 decaf No power sockets for phone charger near the bed, Arrived after a long day on a training course met by the very helpful Trevor on reception all staff seemed very professional and friendly always a bonus in central London I was asked whether I wanted to be closer to the ground floor or higher up I answered that I wanted anywhere quiet so he offered me an upgrade from a deluxe double to a business double much larger VERY quiet very comfortable very surprised to get this on a Saturday evening nr Tottenham Court Very efficient check in and out Iron and board in the cupboard always good for any travelling two good sized bottle of complimentary water coffee pod machine small table to sit and eat at Ordered room service dinner steak side salad cheesecake which were all delicious the salad even at 9pm on a Saturday tasted very fresh and healthy which was actually a relatively reasonable price for a room service dinner Even the house red wine was good enough Many hotels could do with learning from this 
45739,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was dark only spotlights in ceiling no bedside lights Bathroom a bit shabby not shabby chic Shower door didn t fit so floor was wet after using shower Sorry but would not stay again , Location 
45740,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Rooms are on the small side although I guess par for the course in this part of London The main problem is if you get a street facing room you re going to be hearing the sound of ambulances racing to and from the nearby hospital Best to ask for a room on the other side if you re a light sleeper , Excellent location with pretty much everything in walking distance Warren street tube station is literally next door Helpful staff and gave me a late checkout even though the hotel was relatively full I really liked the breakfast great healthy options and freshly baked croissants kept coming 
45741,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Excellent location Very helpful staff A good breakfast with plenty of choice Room and bed on the small side Would definitely choose a double next time 
45742,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, The room was very clean had everything you would need good facilities The room was a comfortable size with a modern look Entrance restaurant looked very grand well decorated All staff were very friendly Tube station very close easy to get to attractions A lovely variety at breakfast more than expected 
45743,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, I stayed here as my husband was in a coma and receiving treatment in Critical Care in UCLH Once my daughter explained this to the staff they could not have been more helpful It became like my second home for a total of 9 nights I would strongly recommend this wonderful hotel and the staff 
45744,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The last time we staid the fan in the Bathroom was loud and constant upgraded to a superior room and the fan was the same which is a bit irritating the food at breakfast was certainly good quality but everything seamed a bit cobbled together and the normal pet hate with 4 star hotels no biscuits in the room and no complementary nibbles at the bar , Overall a nice hotel with friendly staff and a good central location and literally 20 seconds walk from Warren Street Tube Station 
45745,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, There were no labels on the breakfast bar to say what was or not Gluten Free Room was small but beautiful the pillows were uncomfortable , Staff were very helpful with regard to Gluten Free food Excellent service all round Perfect location
45746,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, very old fashioned hotel Unlike Radisson incredible tasteless bar and restaurant Personel borderline friendly Old school hotel that hasn t understood consumers have changed ,No Positive
45747,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Early wake up from noise outside windows only single glazed which is no good especially when your in a busy city , The breakfast was delicious the best hotel breakfast we ve had staff were super friendly and helpful The room was lovely we stayed in a deluxe double and it was what we expected Transport links practically on the front door 
45748,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Window coverings The lighting not bright enough The large column in the middle of the room , Liked the fact there were 2 chairs and a table in the room It was quiet 
45749,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Disorganised re my booking which I extended by an extra night and told them about it 3 months in advance Seems it wasn t enough I had to check out of my room and check back in with other cards all quite ridiculous I booked a single room for 5 nights nothing like the pics on the website The first room was pokey just horrible and for the first time in 34 years of travelling I asked for it to be changed Plugs didn t work dark and dingy poor lighting bad wifi noisy and the toilet didn t work Remote for tv too wasn t working Music One does NOT need loud music in a lift and neither does one need LOUD awful singing and other music at breakfast It was SO loud that I couldn t read the newspaper Apparently many people complain and yet the management say it s the hotel policy Hmmm I received a message on Sunday morning to come early for breakfast as it s busy that seems weird too I also received messages from booking com about leaving in the middle of my stay Maybe the computer website managers need to do a refresh Some of the reception staff need more CRM training Always smile and say sorry to the customer and you won t go wrong , Breakfast with fresh fruit was excellent Cooked food also available but don t be in a hurry as apart from scrambled eggs everything is prepared on the spot Beds were very comfy Shower had hot water some hotels run out and the towels were nice and big 
45750,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Eggs Benedict seemed coarsest put together a disappointment compared with the main hot breakfast choices laid out for us , Sliced tropical fruit Brown bread little rolls Bacon Mushrooms 
45751,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Noisy extractors humming all night if bedroom window opened needed as room too hot , Comfortable bed and linens decor in public spaces lovely nice little gym though we didn t use it Good breakfast 
45752,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Staff were excellent and very professional Hotel is very well kept and very clean Second visit and again the hotel or staff did not disappoint Would definitely stay again 
45753,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was a bit too small cor the price , Excelent location and breakfast hotel around university of Londin Definitely a good choice if your budget allows 
45754,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Car parking near to the hotel was a real problem and anyone with a car should check this out before visiting to get the best parking available, Restaurant very good
45755,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Our room was next to the heating system pipe works right outside the window which made a humming noise all night so I didn t sleep much it didn t bother my husband though There was only a tiny window for ventilation Scrambled egg was cold at breakfast , The bed was very comfy and the room was clean Good facilities available in the room and plenty of plug sockets
45756,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, None , Great location Near eurostar and rail stations Near tube stations Good sized room Friendly staff Good breakfast and restaurant Nice decor thru out the space Love the Asian decor 
45757,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The access card to the room stopped working every morning which was a nuisance considering the entire stay was 5 nights Overall it is a wonderful hotel with excellent connection ,No Positive
45758,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The hotel is in a very noisy location next to UCLH accident emergency Additionally the fan in my bathroom made a very loud noise and could not be switched off so not a great night s sleep , The breakfast was excellent
45759,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, nothing , I loved this place What a great hotel Everything is as it should be The location is awesome with Warren Station right outside the door and the price is great I ll be going back 
45760,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The rooms were a bit noisy could have done with double glazing to sound proof , The food was really good quality The staff were great nothing was too much trouble For that reason I would return 
45761,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The only negative we have is the blinds I would suggest that you should have one blind at the Windows the gaps lets the daylight in so if you want to sleep in the day to much light would be let in Sorry , Breakfast was excellent great variety loved the room and bathroom staff very friendly and happy great 
45762,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We returned early to the hotel 3pm on the Saturday and our room hadn t been done which was disappointing The en suite shower room was a bit of a squeeze , I thought the selection at breakfast was excellent The staff on reception and the concierge were excellent The room was nice and quiet being on the 5th floor 
45763,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room facility were lacking Tv remote and the safe was broken They can improve the breakfast selection, Overall it s clean and the location is very good
45764,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, my standard number was too far from the lobby and there were steps on the way to it what was not good as I had a very heavy luggage But when i checked out a concierge helped me with my luggage All other stuff was great , delicious breakfast pleasant staff good facilities and the location was great it s in the middle of everywhere Minimarket bus and underground stations just near the hotel 
45765,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Price of drinks in the bar a bit on the pricey side We had one of the girls book a taxi for the four of us with luggage for Monday morning He was there 10 minutes early and got us to Luton Airport in good time bad point he charged us 135 so I think ye should check out who ye use , Katarina Vujcikova is such a lovely welcoming person at reception and was so nice to us during our visit as were the other staff Email queries to the hotel before we arrived were answered promptly by Katarina and Manager Rose Anne Phillips who made us very welcome 
45766,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, No business centre or office space Rang the hotel to ask if there was somewhere we could work during our stay and there was no office space work room or business centre We had to go to another hotel to meet up and do work Booking in process was over complicated and ended up in me being charged twice for my room , Breakfast Room style Location Decor 
45767,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Just after we had checked in a member of staff knocked on the door with a lovely platter of cheesecake iced with Happy Birthday for my Mum What a lovely jesture 
45768,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, More milk sachets in tea coffee selection , Our whole stay with you was first class very impressed with the choice of breakfast all your staff from entering the hotel to leaving were fantastic in wanting to help you without doubt they make your stay very stress free 
45769,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We stayed at this hotel a few years ago and the room we were allocated was excellent hence why I chose this hotel again This time the room was not as nice ie at back of hotel awful view of air con units on roof top Also the bathroom had no separate shower There was no tea coffee making facilities The furnishings in the room looked a little tired No spa facilities Not value for money , Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice and the staff at breakfast were very helpful and pleasant Bed very comfortable 
45770,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Dark tiny room facing a brick wall hair dryer wasn t working thankfully the very helpful staff changed it and the fire alarm went off three times for no apparent reason I m guessing it was just bad luck, Fabulous breakfast very good bed very good staff
45771,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I stayed in a single room which was the size of a cupboard with a sloping roof The shower was so small I had to step out to put shampoo in my hair , The breakfast was good
45772,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was small and couldn t figure out how to get the air conditioning to work , Very comfy bed indeed Great idea being able to do online check in and choose room 
45773,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Not much difference in size between Standard and Superiour rooms except room rate My room was facing noisy Tottenham Court Road which gave me a hard first night even when windows were shut Buffet breakfast tasted good but was a bit monotonous e g one sort of cheese in relation to the room rates Disturbing continuous exposure to loud music during breakfast even louder at the bar in the evening , Convenient location to get to the city centre with the main sights and theatres partly walking distance and Heathrow Airport as well as the UCL buildings Lots of shops and good restaurants around Small fitness centre located in the basement Very friendly and helpful staff You can easily print out your Boarding Card in the business center Warren Street tube station 50 m away Single room small but ok with the usual facilities including safe and mini bar and very clean 
45774,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Bathroom dated No tea pots at breakfast had to keep asking for top up Tables too close together so people s clothing kept touching you food when moving out or back to from buffet table , Location was ideal for visiting tourist attractions Hotel room clean and comfortable bit overpriced but it was the capital 
45775,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Danish pastry selection sparse and not as fresh as I d expect Some tiles in bathroom need attention and more milk for beverages in room Two just not enough , Clean comfortable room Liked that no request for credit card for extras which most hotels insist on Breakfast very well presented and overall good hotel with very pleasant polite helpful staff 
45776,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing , Very helpful staff Comfortable rooms Gym was good Very good restaurant and breakfast Convenient to store luggage after checkout Easy access 
45777,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Small detail There were no bedside lamps that could be switched on off separately in our room Hotel arranged for a desk lamp which was a good workaround , Location rooms and service are great Special thanks to Katarina and Niall who solved even the smallest issue immediately and with a smile They make the stay extra special 
45778,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The television did not work despite a member of staff trying to fix it , The breakfast had an excellent range of healthy foods Everything was fresh Delicious 
45779,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We paid 20 for two drinks then bar staff told us the bar was closing in ten mins, Location was amazing We managed to walk to almost everywhere we wanted to go
45780,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Had to move room initially due to air con not working We were moved into a much smaller room and had to request to be moved into the same size as originally paid for ,No Positive
45781,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, nothing adverse at all , Great location 2 stops to Leicester sq etc 30 yards to Warren St Tube station which is served by two lines Norris Bikes outside McDonalds within footprint pharmacy Lovely Breakfast clean comfy rooms lovely staff Would def stay here again Ours was a parent child first trip to London for sightseeing shopping 
45782,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Very small room difficult to open wardrobe due to lack of space Kit Kat from mini bar was 3 50 and four months past best before date, Good location friendly staff
45783,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Stayed on 1st floor about 11pm there was someone moving furniture sounding like bowling balls was REALLY loud and made it hard to get to sleep , It was a very nice room and a handy location for our work the next day 
45784,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The breakfast was extremely disappointing The choice and quality was poor there was no option to make requests The staff during breakfast were abrupt and anything asked of them was felt to be an inconvenience Not the best start to the day ,No Positive
45785,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Standard double room had very limited space between foot of bed and wall Awkward to pass round bed if you re on the big size but room was lovely,No Positive
45786,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, English breakfast was poor except for the sausages which were great Bacon was very fatty and baked beans well were beans but huge not what two young boys were looking forward to Great Hotel though and I d definitely stay again , Continental breakfast was superb very tasty 
45787,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Had to ask to move rooms due to terrible levels of street noise all night on first night of my stay resulting in me getting no sleep , Very comfy bed Good breakfast and lovely staff who swapped me to a larger quieter room with an immediate apology and no fuss after noisy first night stay 
45788,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I appreciate that it is central London but the room was Very small for a delux double , It was close to the theatre district which was our reason for being in London Staff were friendly and helpful The room was clean 
45789,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was rather small, The Breakfast was excellent There was something for everyone cooked al a carte fresh pastries bircher muesli The staff were friendly and professional Although on verybusyroadthe hotel was quiet 
45790,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Arrived early 9 30am knew we were to early to check in so we asked if reception would call us when room was available we were still waiting for call at 5pm so went back to the hotel to see why no one had bothered to call us they had forgot Also i emailed to say we were staying for my friends 40th and could we do a little suprise for her We arrived and Nothing we went to chester and stayed at the crown plaza for my 50th which my friend organised and we were greeted with ballons a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine our room I felt id let my friend down , Clean room very comfy lovely food and very friendly staff serving food n drinks 
45791,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast was OK but they had set the satisfaction bar so high in every other department that it was a little disappointing with lukewarm food and very fatty bacon , Free upgrade on the room without asking was lovely very professional and friendly staff Great location if your sightseeing or going to any of the theatres 
45792,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I booked a single room over one month ago as a special deal on this booking site But when I arrived at the hotel the room I got was very small and dark when you looked out the window you looked at a big wall and felt very claustophobic I complained twice The second room was on the second floor very small too and smelled very much kitchen as the ventilation of the restaurant below was directly outside my room I finally changed to a double room for which I had to pay 50 GBP per night extra That room was bigger but also very dark with only one window It seems that when you book via booking com the hotels give you the poorer rooms All rooms that I have seen during that stay are not worth the money paid Of a Radisson Hotel with 4 stars I would have expected better rooms , The staff and service was very good The people working there are all very kind and do their best 
45793,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast too expensive so we ate out Too very small, Very clean and comfortable but bedroom very small It all worked well and the bed was very comfortable but not a lot of space to move or store clothes Very close to a tube station and bus stop and a couple of small supermarkets 
45794,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was tiny bed was tiny windows were filthy and all I could hear all night were tubes and traffic Didn t sleep at all , Location is great Eggs Benedict for breakfast was amazing 
45795,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room 438 was small hardly enough room to get around the bed The bed was rock solid Reception staff were good but bar restaurant staff were slow We went in for a drink in the bar and no one took an order after 10 mins so we walked out Promised tea and coffee at breakfast but was never asked , The breakfast was excellent as were the room facilities Location good but noisy although expected 
45796,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I asked for extra milk for tea in the room had to ask twice then received out of date tubes of milk 10 16 which made me feel ill until I realised they were out of date Also I had to go and buy my own decaffinated tea across the road as you do not provide it I have never been to a major hotel that didn t offer decaf tea There was a lethal step 2 paces into the room which inevitably I fell down as the first thing that takes your attention in the room are the floor to ceiling Windows directly looking onto Warren St station So if you want privacy you need to keep the blinds closed Wifi slow wouldn t stay there again , Good choice of breakfast items 
45797,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Pictures showed a coffee machine but there wasn t one it was a bit noisy at the front of building The tables were quite close together in the restaurant and also there was no decaffinated tea at breakfast and when I asked for decaf coffee the waiter did not seem to understand even though it said that was part of the coffee list , The free sweets lovely selection of fresh fruit at breakfast comfortable bed lots of room in the bedroom quite a good location
45798,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I cannot identify any bad points or room for improvement , This hotel is a great example of having everything right The service was excellent the room perfectly laid out and really clean and comfortable The breakfast couldnt be faulted 
45799,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, That only things I recall not liking were the pillows being to large and the duvet being to heavy Which sounds stupid I know Oh and the only other thing was that it was hard to regulate the temperature in the room at night as the AC wasn t shifting at all , The price was reasonable for the location and for the room The mattress was great That shower though Great bathroom and great access to the restaurant Steak cooked to perfection even half an hour before closing time 
45800,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The nearest mirror to the dressing table and hair drier was inside the room door too far away for being any use My only other negative was the choice at breakfast the bacon was not very nice I would would have liked a choice of eggs and I don t know who thought that BBQ beans were a breakfast dish , Location was ideal for the underground network
45801,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Arriving at 10 30 pm to find out our prepaid room had been sold and then waiting over an hour to be given an inferior room with little by way of an apology Dirty bed sheets , The location 
45802,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly and helpful Nothing was too much trouble and they had great local knowledge Scrambled eggs were the best we ve ever had at breakfast and also great choice of other foods Would definitely return here if go back to London
45803,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Slightly noisy because it is close to a hospital but not a problem This will not stop me from coming back, Great location right next to the metro lots of nice places around to eat or get a drink Walkable to a lot of interesting places The room was small but packed well with anything I could need 
45804,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The food could have been hotter but it wasn t cold enough to complain I don t like tea served from flasks The seat I was given was extremely uncomfortable, lovely staff
45805,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Cold plates for a hot breakfast Coffee spilt on chair when served BBQ baked beans odd choice never seen before in a hotel Dirty plates on table Unhygienic menus laid across plates on the table Noise outside of hotel during the night, Great location just outside Warren Street station Lovely german cafe just down the road for lunch Guest relations very friendly received complimentary upgrade to King sized room although was a little sparse of furniture and steps up to the bathroom odd
45806,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, When we ordered dinner to the room they brought 2 burgers and chips up on 1 wooden board with 1 napkin and 1 set of cutlery We asked for a second set but by the time it all arrived 15 mins later we were nearly finished eating Also the pillows were far too thick they were way thicker than ordinary pillows which meant that we both awoke with neck pain I suggest putting a fat pillow and a normal pillow in each room so that people can choose The placement of sockets in the room would have been an issue if I hadn t brought a multi plug extension , At breakfast we had a waitress called Elena who was amazing She was frequently checking on us taking care of every need and generally being fantastic When I mentioned that this was a trip for my wife s birthday she even brought her a slice of cake which was yummy Thank you and special thanks to her 
45807,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Location could have been better although there were plenty of bus stops and underground stations nearby , Comfiest bed and the best breakfast that I have ever experienced at any hotel 
45808,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, There was nothing I didn t like, Staff very helpful and friendly Kept our bags in storage all day so that we could see the sights before leaving London Very close to the tube
45809,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, No room for my clothes in the cupboard it was filled with an iron and ironning board plus spare pillow As for my underware Ihad to just put them on the top of the dresing table small cupbord had fridge und safe in them the drawer had a hair dryer in it As for our jackets they didnt have any pegs behind doors It was rainy when we were there therefore we didnt want to put them in the cupboard We did tell the friendly staff about the problem and they suggested that we book a king sized room next time Well we did stay for 5 nights and expected more space for our belongings The question of space makes me wonder how it managed to get 4stars even tho it was a beautiful hotel P s why did we need to pay for the TV, Nice breakfasr friendy staff
45810,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Single room is tiny It is hard to move in bathroom No sockets near bed though plenty sockets in the room You can also hear street noises if your room is facing Tottenham Court Road , Super soft and comfortable bed 
45811,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, From start to finish the staff made the process seamless My mother and I travelled to London for her birthday to see a musical The hotel staff wished her happy birthday on us arriving and also left cheese cake in our room saying happy birthday The rooms are tidy breakfast options cater to everyone needs Great location and definitely value for money I will definitely be staying at this hotel again and highly recommend 
45812,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, As I said no heating the first night Second night they tryed to fix with no joy So they bought a little heater Did not keep room very warm The 2 evening Really a let down , We got are bedroom but we had no heating in are room very cold the first night Very an comfortable too sleep Worst night ever 
45813,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We had two rooms for two couples and were there for mum s 70th birthday While our room was lovely theirs was a little shabby in comparison Carpet had stains and the heating didn t work initially but staff sorted it quickly Otherwise no complaints , Bed very comfortable and our room lovely and clean Bath with shower which was nice Great location near tube station Sainsbury Tesco Boots and McDonald s if you only want a breakfast dinner snack Mum loved the view of BT Tower from their window at the back of the hotel Reception staff and housekeeping very helpful Hotel very close to Tube station 
45814,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was a little stuffy at night , We were upgraded from standard room to Business room which was a lovely surprise breakfast was very good lovely bar area 
45815,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was absolutely freezing particularly the bathroom which has a massive old window that desperately needs painting The whole room was dated We were given an electric heater as the heating was quite clearly not working We weren t offered a different room and although the heater helped it made the room look even more undesirable , Location great Front desk staff welcoming 
45816,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Everything at the hotel was fine when you look at it it was clean in general but for 203 that I paid for a double room definitely it was not worth it it was cold the the heating control panel wasn t working properly although the temperature was set te the max all u got was a ratteling noisy fan all night I ve previously paid half that and way better it has been Also there is a minibar in the room however at the check in or when I booked the room at no poin it was mentioned that if u take anything out of it you would have to pay a fortune when I could of gone to Sainsbury s across the road from the hotel and would of got 2 bottles of vodka 1 Boyle of JD 2 bottles of Coca Cola for way more cheaper Only found out that I had to pay a fortune when I checked out I was asked if I ve taken anything from the minibar and I said yes told them what I had drunk and out of the blue with the smile on their face they said that would be 68 I was shocked like I said I could of done a weekly shopping at Sainsbury s including enough alcohol and soft drinks So yeah very very disappointing, The breakfast was lovely
45817,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, 4 pillows all of them big I could probably have asked for a smaller pillow but I was too tyred When will hotels learn that there s no one fits all solution when it comes to pillows , Quiet and nice comfy room with everything needed Excellent breakfast and really good location walking distance from St Pancras

45820,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Very weird smell in my room not very clean lots of dust in the closet There was a wall another window right in front of mine which made it necessary to draw the curtains to have some privacy , Friendly staff Early check in was possible Average sized room superior single Nice bathroom very comfortable bed Breakfast was nice with many different kinds of food No problems finding lots of awesome stuff as a vegetarian also vegan would be ok healthy choices superfoods gluten free

45825,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The housemaid seemed a bit forgetful since one night I was missing a mug and the next day I was missing half the towels , Room was a bit on the small side but this is London very comfortable however You had anything you would need in the room complementary water and fully stocked minibar 
45826,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Was quite difficult to get the room temperature right it was either too hot or too cold at night, The room was small but cosy with excellent access Good breakfast included with the booking and great location opposite a hospital but not much noise from the street

45829,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Having booked two rooms for ourselves and accompanying friends we were a little embarrassed that one room was far larger than the other Although both rooms were entirely suitable for the occasion we did feel slightly unfair to our friends , Extremely helpful and locally knowledgeable staff made our stay very enjoyable Excellent facilities and the breakfast buffet is to die for thank you 
45830,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Extremely clean modern Staff very polite helpful Best buffet breakfast so much choice and hot Beautiful delicious steak with excellent waiting staff 
45831,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing , The service was excellent staff very friendly and approachable and helpful The breakfast choice and quality was excellent Rooms were clean compact but very functional Hotel is very centrally located close to tube station The Steak and Lobster house restaurant was excellent too 
45832,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, First room was terribly small changed it Found dust on phone TV and other items Poor isolation on street windows caused cold air stream for one of beds , Staff is very helpful and motivated Changed the room in 2 minutes solved minor issues Location is good tube is next to hotel bus stop in front of it choice of shops pharmacies McDonalds coffee Good space in second room incl bathroom Breakfast of high qaulity with same choice everyday 
45833,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Size of the room Show also so smaller had to consciously try not to bump my hands elbows into the walls as I showered, Breakfast Welcoming staff at breakfast Quiet during my stay Complimentary basic fitness facilities
45834,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The heating did not work in my room and the maintenance engineer was not available so a member of staff bought an oil heater It let off some heat but was not enough for a very cold winters day Did not get much sleep at all Also seemed to be an issue in the shower where the bathroom would flood each time the shower was turned on Staff were friendly but my luck was that i happened to have a very poor room with many faults For the money i paid for the night and being my wifes birthday and our anniversary date i expected a lot more Sorry for the poor review im just trying to give an honest account,No Positive
45835,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The only negative was at night with many homeless outside of the hotel and many ambulance going through to the neighborhood university hospital , elegant and modern rooms enough space for room hotel in london The hotel has a high professional status Very good breakfast The rooms in front have noice from the street The hotel is located next to warren street station tube only 10 meters Very convenient location to explore london The only negative was at night with many homeless outside of the hotel and many ambulance going through to the neighborhood university hospital 
45836,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The air con wasn t the most effective I have ever encountered but it did not make for an uncomfortable evening , The facilities were very generous for the price and service both in the rooms and down in the reception were excellent You would be hard pushed to find this combination of luxury and service in London for this price 
45837,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The restaurant couldn t cater efficiently with people staying for breakfast Not enough staff to clear tables and possibly not enough tables to facilitate the number of customers which caused queues , Cleanliness excellent the cleaning staff worked extremely hard
45838,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Although a single room found everything a bit cramped , Breakfast was great although i think you need to drop the smokey bacon and barbecue beans not my favorite 
45839,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Temperature control which worked to cool the room less creaky floorboards the whole floor creaked and there was a pillar right next to the bed which was a total obstruction and could have proved quite hazardous if I d walked into it in the night A better organised breakfast where staff cleaned down used tables and reset them within a few minutes to reduce the queue size , The hotel suited our location for this particular trip to London 
45840,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The staff new little about the area on arrival and made little effort to find out If you go to this hotel make sure they do not put you in a room next to the main road it s next to a hospital and I was kept awake by ambulances all night The room was mediocre and in my opinion not at all worth the money paid I m aware that this is London and you pay for the location but for a radisson I m very disappointed , The location was convenient 
45841,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Lots of stairs including three from bathroom to bedroom A little unsettling for my elderly mother , Comfy bed and a clean room next door to the nearest tube station 
45842,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Rooms are too small And bed also very small No rooms for luggage Bathroom ha no space for our own toiletries and cosmetics , Wifi works excellent I like hot rack for towers It is very hygiene

45845,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We struggled to get the air conditioning temperature down to a more moderate temperature It did get a little too hot for us but its a minor point , A very pleasant stay with you lovely room which our housekeeper looked after very well spotless Ken who was the concierge was brilliant very helpful and always smiling The breakfast was very good and the staff very helpful and pleasant We would be happy to stay with you again 
45846,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, You could hear a bit of noise from the road outside but that is to be expected staying in London , The bed in the Junior Suite was fantastic We didn t want to leave The whole room was incredible very spacious and a lovely clean and modern bathroom The staff were extremely helpful and friendly The breakfast in the morning was great with lots of variety and an endless supply of tea Great location less than a minute walk to Warren Street tube station 
45847,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The attitude of two or three DIFFERENT staff members when we asked for sweeteners for our hot drinks in the bar and restaurant They said they didn t have any even though we explained that they were on beverage trays in our room and so they must be available They went away to look and eventually found some but the attitude and lies created a VERY bad impression and was embarrassing , We enjoyed the breakfast very much and would consider it one the best we have had for a hotel in this price range The evening meals in the steak and lobster restaurant were limited on choice but excellent never the less 
45848,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was a little small and a lot of noise from Warren Street tube station announcements , A great location at a reasonable price for central London Good breakfast menu and good d cor throughout the hotel 
45849,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast was included into my reasonable room price but if it is not don t pay for it Charging 20 is completely out of sync You get full English but very little on the continental side one salami and one camembert and it can take time before waiters come and give you more coffee , Staff was very friendly and I was even upgraded from a Standard Single to a luxury bedroom with a king size bed The room was spacious and well equipped and everything was spotlessly clean The bathroom had a double shower cabin and a large sink though the toilet is squeezed into the extreme corner and difficult to sit on AC was superefficient during the day but not adjustable during the night the set maximum temperature could only be changed by getting instructions from Reception The location is very convinient for Kings s Cross Euston University and Westend theatres 
45850,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Glasses coffee milk used first night were not replenished when room serviced A minor point but would expect this done in hotel of this standard m, Staff very helpful friendly The location is excellent with lots of choice of restaurants bars close by 
45851,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Previous guest had been smoking in the room and the room smelt of this I thought we were in a non smoking establishment , Good location near to tube station Being able to leave luggage whilst we went out before returning home later in the day 
45852,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Forgot to offer me the tooth kit After I asking they gave me one soon, Good location and easy to assess There are a variety of facilities including restaurants shops bus stations subway stations and 24 hour convenience stores around the hotel A short distance from the British Museum and Buckingham Palace Room facilities are adequate the layout is also very reasonable

45854,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Reception staff was not particularly professional and or friendly Breakfast was also a negative point I considered it rather chaotic in terms of layout of food and quality in general , The location and room facilities
45855,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, First room was noisy due to the pub near my room and it had sash windows and poor secondary glazing I was moved with no hassle and this room was very quiet , Good service by friendly staff good facilities in hotel and room good standard of cleanliness Comfortable bed and excellent shower Dinner and breakfast both fantastic I would definitely stay again if in this area 
45856,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Bar service was a bit slow tried to order drinks at the bar and were told it was table service Then nobody came to take order Managed to attract attention of waitress and we were charged a service charge for the privilege of her walking 3 metres with 2 drinks Breakfast was lovely but also had to flag somebody down for a cup of tea as none offered , The online check in online payment and online checkout were great Staff were welcoming and always smiling Rooms very stylish and clean 
45857,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Pillows very deep and uncomfortable It s all or nothing with the lights in the bedroom Needs some soft form of lighting other than just having to use the bathroom light as the only option , Location is great and overall feel of the hotel is excellent

45861,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room pretty small Did not like that everything was covered in plastic wrap glasses in rooms sugar cubes on tables it s 2016 time to consider our environment , Friendly helpful staff
45862,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Single room was tiny I know this is central London but wow I got an alarm call at 6am even though I didn t ask for one and the service at breakfast was slow had to wait over 5 minutes before I was made to ask for coffee and then had to ask again when some didn t arrive , Good location clean and modern 
45863,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Superior room was tiny I doubt I would have paid 80 for it but certainly not 160 I barely had enough space to put my bag on the floor I was woken up every 20 minutes or so by ambulances as the windows were right above the main street next to the hospital and the old windows did nothing to block the noise from the street below Despite being advertised as having satellite television the channels were definitely not satellite TV and the WiFi cut out every 10 minutes or so Staff were perfectly friendly though , Great location Loads of shops nearby and about 15 seconds walk from Warren St tube station 
45864,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was a bit small but I guess that is typical for accommodation in London It would be good to have a mirror somewhere close to the hairdryer , The room was very clean and fresh The personal was extremely helpful Breakfast was tasty with fresh high quality ingredients Though located fairly centrally in London the room was quiet and one could get a good night s sleep 
45865,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Rooms are not well insulated and you can hear all the movements in the hall way Each morning we were woken by doors opening and closing , Great location 
45866,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Limited menu in restaurant appreciate that it s steak and lobster but could have had some additional choices , Great location pleasant and helpful staff

45869,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Booked a twin room as sharing with my 18 year old son but when we went to check in they didn t have one Wanted extra 50 or to make us change to a different hotel After some pleading they eventually managed to sort us out with a double bed and a sofa bed for an extra 20 Not impressed, Good location Clean

45873,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I really thought for the price you pay that breakfast should be included the price to add this on is quite expensive , The hotel staff made my fianc feel very special on his 30th birthday by upgrading our room and placing a slice of cake in our room for when we got back from a busy day of sightseeing was an extra special touch Thank you
45874,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The hotel could have had some double or tripple glazing I could not sleep due to the noise from outside the building Comming from a quiet Lancashire suburbia it came as a shock to learn that in central London it is usual for drivers to use a horn all night I have noted for example that from 11pm to 3am you can hear the horn sound from the road every 15 60 seconds at 4 am it goes a bit quieter I think at that time I covered my ears with cussions and went unconscious , Breakfast was fantastic Staff amazing and very helpful Beds were very comfortable 
45875,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The breakfast was poor had to queue for over half an hour not much food available BBQ beans horrible , The bed was incredibly comfy The steak and lobster restaurant for dinner was delicious

45897,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Tottenham Court Road and the surrounding streets are busy with the noise from pubs late into the night I was surprised that my room on the 4th floor did not have at least secondary internal double glazing it was difficult to get to sleep with the noise from a pub opposite the hotel in the street below When a saxophone started playing in the early hours of the morning well that was the last straw , All the staff bent over backwards to accommodate any requests I made Nothing was too much trouble I mean they really did go out of their way to help me Simply superb Generally a nice hotel

45914,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Tv channels limited Loudish fan in bathroom constantly on View from room front of hotel is directly on to office block , Bed comfy Tea coffee got replenished on second morning there which is rare in hotels for some reason Check in and out was quick Staff nice 
45915,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The view from the room faced to internal yard was not quite good but if you stay there for business purposes and most of your day is outside the view from your window stopped to be even a small problem , Everything was great room was average size if compares with London usual size so that s a major advantage location was brilliant Warren Str is right around the corner 1 min walk Euston Sqr maybe 5 min walking amazing breakfast with lots of different dishes stuff was very polite and helpful 
45916,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, It is overpriced for what it is Our twin bedroom had windows opening onto a brick wall For what the hotel offers it is definitely overpriced , Reception staff were very accommodating 
45917,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The smallest room I have ever had could not turn around in the bathroom Extremely tiny No food eggs etc at the breakfast this place is overcrowded and service at the breakfast is very poor, Great location
45918,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Pillows one not enough two a disaster Breakfast for 6 15 am nearly impossible to arrange When it did get itself organised came very good , Bathroom user friendly Staff helpful

45926,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Wesley Swales hotel manager The smell of fish in the lobby Stains on the bed sheets They do NOT offer 100 satisfaction I was offered a upgraded room if I ever stayed at the hotel again considering I d already paid 180 to stay there in a deluxe for one night already I do not find this satisfactory Wesley Swales hotel manager was not apologetic atall It s a shame a brand with so many hotels act in this way DONT STAY HERE IF YOU LIKE GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE POOR , Nice location
45927,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room could have been cleaner as was a bit dusty The noise level was unexpected but part of being in a good location , The location was excellent and the staff was extra helpful in giving direction to attractions
45928,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Some of the restaurant food was a bit poor The meat pie was not very good However the restaurant staff were excellent and appreciated honest feedback , My wife was giving birth next door at UCLH and staff especially Niall Baker Guest Relations Manager whom was wonderfully accommodating and flexible with my changing circumstances arrangements to suit my family I s needs simply brilliant staff

45931,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Stayed there twice and although both times we were very happy second stay the room was not as spacious and the bed was smaller , Close to warren street tube 10 minute walk to Oxford street 15 minute or more to theatres lots of shops and eating places around us Very good location 
45932,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The rooms were a little dusty apart from that cleanliness was good , Myself and my best friend stayed here for our joint birthday to save us going home after a night out clubbing on Friday night 19 08 16 The staff were amazing and couldn t do enough for us We received a complimentary upgrade and birthday cake in our room I would like to say a special thank you to Bachir who looked after us They provided us with a bucket of ice and champagne glasses as we had a bottle of bubbly with us We also had a group of friends come to the room to have drinks before we left for the club to which they had no problem with although there were around 10 of us and were quite noisy for an hour or so I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying here again 
45933,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Could not sleep due to a VERY NOISY air conditioning which could not event be turned off Reception said yes we know some bedrooms have indeed an air conditioning which is very noisy How dare they sell those rooms Play the safe side just go to another hotel , People were nice at the desk But they could not solve the issue with the Air conditioning So at the end nice but helpless again not their own fault 
45934,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room 113 had no mirror close to plugs for hairdryer make up etc , Proximity to tube and train Great location with many shops and restaurants Hotel beautiful clean and with friendly staff Room clean and relatively spacious Beds extremely comfy Shower powerful Water and wifi in room

45941,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was very small and incredibly noisy Located near a lift I heard every person coming going from the lift The pillows were also incredibly large and not very comfortable , Location was good for the course I was going at UCLH
45942,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Price of breakfast We got breakfast at one third of the price nearby When we stayed previously breakfast was included in the price , Location for public transport Nice cozy room Frequency of lifts no hanging around waiting 
45943,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The half shower door did not prevent the floor from getting wet which in turn got very slippery The hair dryer was wire into the desk drawer so you had to dry your hair there but there was no mirror which seemed odd The hotel is located just a couple of doors down from the Warren Street underground which is on a line that was closed for maintenance during the weekend we stayed at the hotel which meant we had to walk about a 1 2 mile to the another line This certainly wasn t the fault of the hotel but it was a bit inconvenient The walk during the day was fine especially since the weather was unusually lovely that weekend but a bit concerning late at night after the theater , The staff was very good and responsive The facilities were overall very lovely The breakfast buffet was very good although a bit expensive 19 50 pounds if not booked along with the room but added later The beds were very comfortable There were a lot of casual good places to eat around the area 
45944,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Had some problems with air conditioning workman tried to fix but it didn t really work that well during our stay , The bed was very comfortable Only problem was our room was facing major street so heard a lot of noise late at night realize this was out of your hands Other than that it was fine staff very friendly and pleasant 
45945,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, The stay was absolutely brilliant a hotel great value for money with great facilities and very comfy beds Excellent location extremely helpful staff Could not have asked for a better stay at the hotel 
45946,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, The bed was very soft and the staff very friendly and helpful The location was steps away from the Warren Street Underground Great location centrally located and easy to get around 
45947,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Too many steps for 70 year olds especially those down into the bedroom Room heard the traffic outside especially the ambulance sirens rushing to UCH Smoking area on the front was totally inadequate and made me feel like an outcast Bar area was OK but could have been more comfortable and welcoming , Next door to underground was convenient Staff were very helpful and friendly Bed was very comfortable 
45948,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing , Room was great staff were friendly and helpful The facilities were everything I needed and it was close to everything I required Will likely stay there every time I m in London
45949,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Terrible front desk trainees they have made double debit payment of my bank card Customer service of Radisson Blu Edwardian didn t answer promptly to my claim After one month still never get answer or help to solve that unpleasant situation My money are still on their account Terrible Avoid such situation by following payments which front desk personnel make , Hotel located in the centre of London with good connections for main streets Comfortable room a little bit old furniture Friendly staff Good food and nice restaurant
45950,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was so small with an awful view out of the window The room was noisy throughout the whole night I can only compare the noise to furniture being dragged across the floor constantly Therefore I did not get any rest at all But because it was for one night I managed I do not think it was value for money at all the hotel is over priced and over rated There were no luxuries at all I appreciate we booked a standard room but small gestures of things like a comfy dressing gown or some good quality miniature toiletries in the bathroom would have been nice touch and made our stay feel more special I can only compare our stay to that of other hotels we have stayed in around the same price of 203 per night , The bed was comfortable the reception area was welcoming and the location wasn t too bad for central London 
45951,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, To be honest there was nothing i didn t like It was all very pleasant , Everything It s exactly what we were looking for It was a fabulous experience 
45952,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, There were tea making facilities in the room kettle mugs but no teabags sugar biscuits which is a usual nice touch particularly for the price quality of hotel , Super location for a trip to the theatre in the West End The staff were all very friendly and attentive The room was comfortable stylish and a good size The food drinks in the restaurant was also superb Would definitely stay again 
45953,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Information in room advised Breakfast until10 30 Monday Friday was actually only until 10 am , The bed was very comfy staff very helpful and pleasant 
45954,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room service breakfast was a let down guest relations were however very helpful, Dinner in the restaurant was great steak was amazing overall service was excellent
45955,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Maybe the room was too cold I COULDNT perhaps change the temperature for my preference but wanted it warmer after using the shower and it as summer also the sinks plugs were hard to open so water stayed in the bath No lighting near the mirror couldnt see myself when I was dressing up , The temperature device in the room was amazing it allowed me to change the temperature of the room variable depending on my preferences I enoyed it alot the room was fresh so the air conditioning was prefect
45956,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Having a connecting door in our room meant we were kept awake by someone on the other side snoring Not having a plug close enough to a mirror for using a hairdryer No access to the minibar fridge , The beds were very comfy Rooms were clean Close to lots of shopping transport and sights
45957,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room in annex reached by walkway steps and confusing route Window overlooked a pub s back garden which was so noisy even when closed Luckily rained for next nights so no more noise Evening host in restaurant originally wanted to seat me in noisy bar when I said no he made me wait 20 min tho I saw six groups leave Only acknowledged me when I asked how long I d still have to wait as a mature solo female I question his behavior , Location close to tube Prompt response to concern re ac Clean and fresh linens Good breakfast options and friendly staff Small single room but comfy well appointed 
45958,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Location was fine just removed from the sights we wanted to see and several blocks from the nearest metro station A bit of a hike after long days of sightseeing , Great staff We arrived early after an overnight flight expecting only to drop off our bags but the staff checked us in and helped us to our room Nice to get cleaned up before a day of sightseeing 
45959,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The single room was extremely small renovated perhaps a decade ago The hotel had problems with credit card authorisation and the anxious staff would send me in the middle of the night to withdraw cash I was having a drink at the hotel bar at night and saw a mouse running through it I refrained from any intervention but it was certainly chilling Overall the location is fantastic but the hotel is below four stars and offers little comfort I do not recommend it if you have any other decent options , I liked the breakfast 
45960,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Good location 20 minutes walk from St Pancras and 15 minutes to Oxford Street Breakfast was delicious Wide range of interesting juices good choice of food hot and cold buffet Room was comfortable and clean Most comfortable pillows ever I booked a twin room but as none were available I was upgraded to a deluxe king that was lovely Staff friendly Would recommend 
45961,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Would have been nice to have a larger lounge are , Bed and pillows extremely comfortable Liked the fact that iron and ironing board and complimentary tea and coffee provided in the room 
45962,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We have get Pentaly 50pounds as we re smoking at the room , It is close to the underground hotel steak and lobster are taste good room is clean but for fat people the twin bed room s bed should very small nice breakfast 
45963,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The window in the bedroom rattled all night despite me attempting to wedge it closed room 403 There was a strong wind in London that evening but I do think this needs attention Very disappointed with breakfast shown to a table and told your server will be with you shortly no one ever appeared therefore apart from the glass of water I managed to get myself I had no beverages The cooked breakfast was lacking I waited a very long time for eggs to be ready by which time I d eaten the remainder of the breakfast as I was running out of time Poor food planning and disappointing restaurant staffing Hotel reception staff extremely helpful , Location excellent for travelling from home and travelling on to business meeting next to Warren Street Tube station 
45964,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing , Everything was really fantastic The staff were so helpful and went beyond what might be expected of them Room service breakfast was on time and hot superb 
45965,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The fan air on unit in the rooms are so loud I hardly slept It even overpowered the busy London street noise , The staff were very polite and went to great lengths to ensure a problem with my room was sorted in the end they moved me to another despite one of them trying to convince me the hotel was completely full 
45966,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The air conditioning was very noisy so disrupted our sleep as the room was too hot when it was off and this was compounded by the most uncomfortable pillows in the world , I checked in online so I didn t have to endure the reception staff
45967,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Stayed in room 224 The room had a distinctive musty smell Not sure what it was But didn t smell very clean , Beds comfy Location is great Stayed here before an would stay again providing the room smelt better 
45968,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, rooms very small which is standard for central london but for a similar price i ve had much nicer rooms the online booking didn t seem to work on my phone so i m not sure if it actually went through or not , the room assigned to us was smoking but the staff were able to change this bed very comfortable and rooms very quiet had a great night s sleep 
45969,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Sent to a smoking room first so had to ask for a change Asked a member of housekeeping as we had no mugs she went and looked and said there were none so Tea making facilities with nothing to put the tea in , Helpful reception staff Friendly bar and restaurant staff 
45970,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Very good location Warren Street station is across the road 2 stations from King s Cross St Pancras on Victoria line Staff very kindly et excellent breakfast buffet
45971,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Hotel bathroom too warm with the towel rail having to be on constantly especially in a small space , Staff could not have done enough for us As we were in a wheelchair all the staff made us feel very special and were so helpful We checked in to the hotel and was instantly greeted with a smile with the young doorman Then greeted with a warm friendly smile by the receptionist We met one of your head housekeeper who assisted us from our room up to the lift of which was a great help Your customer relations lady Katerina was fantastic offering her services ensuring we were given a room that was appropriate to our needs constantly saying if there is anything we need or if there is anything she or the hotel can do for us we only had to ask we thoroughly enjoyed our stay with you Nothing was too much trouble Having stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world with our jobs your hotel and excellent staff receive 10 10 for your services Sorry forgot to mention the staff also in Bar Restaraunt Breakfast were as equally attentitive professional and friendly When I next need a hotel in that part of London rest assured I will be booking with you and your hotel thank you Radisson Blu Edwardian The Grafton 
45972,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Water pressure temperature in shower was disappointing my room was very quiet but looked into an unattractive courtyard , Wonderful staff reception pleasantly stylish finishings in room public areas Really comfy bed fantastic breakfast 
45973,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room on the first night was a bit small though probably typical for central London and ok for one person , The staff were very friendly and accommodating It s quite an intimate atmosphere There was a willingness to please I was able to access my room earlier I needed to change for a wedding which was fantastic They also upgraded the room for me on the second day since I was being joined by a friend Really individual service 
45974,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Checking in was annoying as I was asked for my passport and details twice I did not feel welcomed at all My room looked out onto the main road so was noisy take your earplugs , Very good location lots of restaurants and caf s in the area Room was small but adequate bed very comfortable Room and bathroom clean Complimentary water much appreciated 
45975,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing much the hotel could have done but there were some very noisy guests located near our room and on our first night we were disturbed by banging room doors and loud talking between midnight and 3am An alarm was also triggered but quickly stopped We were about to complain but it then all went quiet , The hotel was boutique style and the room very nicely furnished and comfortable The hotel staff were very pleasant and we were able to check in early for which we were very appreciative having just arrived into London from an overnight flight from Canada Guest relations contacted is before arrival to ask if we had any specific requirements Great stay overall despite some disturbance from some inconsiderate guests 
45976,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Very very noisy room from traffic on Tottenham Court Road at night even though I had asked for a quiet room The chips in the Resturant are not gluten free come on guys it is the most popular item on the menu do not cross contaminate it with onion rings , Staff very friendly
45977,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Expensive minibar small bed, Bed was a bit on the small side for two of us and the mini bar was day light robbery at 3 for a can of cola Fire alarm went off briefly in middle of night for a few seconds and took on the front was near an ambulance station so noisy but overall very good stay and lovely hotel 
45978,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Financial attitude Wanted to pay in Euro and they charged 200 euros more than the agreed price because they wanted to follow the exchange rate of the hotel A rippoff , Breakfast
45979,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The Windows to our room 410 were useless they did not keep out any of the passing noise ALL NIGHT In a hotel of this calibre I would expect that Windows would be sound proof from the outdoor activities to ensure a good nights sleep Also the fire alarm was sounded apparently by next doors building as they are on the same circuit this disturbed our sleep and we had a dreadful night The air conditioning unit was very loud and therefore we had to turn this off resulting in being very warm, The hotel was clean and the lobby area restaurant and bar area were lovely spacious and beautiful the rooms were company but essential for our stay
45980,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Hard to pick any faults , Excellent location to Euston the underground Modern clean interior in a traditional classical building Friendly helpful staff

45983,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I would have preferred to have a window which could be opened even a little bit, For a single room it did not feel claustrophobic and was very comfortable
45984,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The background musak in the bar and restaurant area was horrible and too loud Not nice for breakfast which was otherwise good , The room was comfortable and surprisingly well equipped 
45985,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Mushrooms and bacon could have been cooked a little better , One bedroom suite is awesome we like comfort and space so it was perfect Staff were friendly hotel is spotless and in a brilliant location 
45986,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The housekeeping is slow Takes several hours for them to attend to the room after a request is made , Although check in and check out are a bit slow the staff at the front desk are wonderful I would like to say a special thank you to Maria I had booked an extra night because I was checking out late in the afternoon 5 pm but at check out they cancelled the extra night for me and I didn t even have to pay extra for late check out 
45987,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Pokey room had to clamber across the bed to get to the door from the desk Evidently it was an upgrade Check in was slow and tedious, Price was good and good location
45988,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room on the 2nd floor and had a lot of noise from the road so wasn t able to sleep, Very friendly and clean Perfect location for the tube Wifi was really good Room had everything you would need
45989,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Couldn t have been better for our needs, Excellent Hotel convenient as our son visits the hospital opposite for treatment The staff are amazing and always go the extra mile The pillows are to die for 
45990,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We had to wait till 3 30pm to get into our room , Only a brief stopover on our way to Europe but the hotel is well located for Oxford St etc comfortable room and pleasant bar area and a very enjoyable breakfast 
45991,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The hotel did not read my booking properly and allocated a double rather than a twin Initially they said that they were full and therefore nothing could be done which was highly irritating after a long journey However the house manager sorted it out admirably and we eventually got the room we should have had The girl on the greeting station on Sunday morning breakfast was rude and didn t know what she was doing Fortunately a more capable member of staff was on hand to sort things out and was wonderful , Staff with one exception were excellent House manager very professionally sorted out the chaos caused by the hotel not reading the booking properly The room when we eventually got to it was spotlessly clean and comfortable Also I left my iPhone 6 in the room and this was handed in by the domestic staff for which I am enormously grateful 
45992,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Given the wrong room Lied to by staff on numerous occasions Rude staff grilled me during checkout about the minibar saying that they could see I had opened it and must of had something which I didn t I only looked Poorly managed hotel very little communication when problems occur Informed I had a family room it was a standard double without 2 beds or a sofa bed to pull out I was told a sofa would be brought up which wasn t and when the manager came up to resolve the issue he told me the room was a family room and when I showed him the difference between the 2 rooms on trip advisor pictures he apologized and gave me 15 to spend at the bar just terrible During the conversation with manager my friend heard 2 members of staff down the hall say can t we just give them a family room to which the other responded with nah we re fully booked that s why we had to give them a different room Overall I paid for a lesser room was offered no refund or upgrade I had to review pictures online to prove them wrong and in the end I was only given money to spend at the bar so I had to share a double bed with my friend and in the end was offered no apology and was grilled during checkout about the minibar Look elsewhere if possible , Interior of the hotel 
45993,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, During morning there was a lot of banging sound from the streets and other doors , Very good location if you are looking to do some shopping and sight seeing in the city center Right next to the tube station 
45994,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room slightly small but very comfortable I did feel rushed at breakfast as staff were clearing away at 9 40 and I was offered just one cup of tea that was fairly lukewarm and didnt see a waiter to ask for another last entrance is 10 but there wasn t much on the bars by 9 50 One helpful waiter got extra juice as the kids there were finishing it before it settled on the bar then I heard a staff member appear to chastise him for it he wasnt speaking English so I dont know what he said though maybe they should speak English to each other seeing as we are in England Also I m sure when I arrived when I was being taken to the table another waiter quipped Lunch to the guy showing me to the table it was 9 30 I think they must be under pressure to get things finished by 10 so if that s the case don t say breakfast is served until 10 Other than that a nice hotel , Most staff very helpful and accommodating
45995,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The worst hotel I ve stayed in recent years We booked three rooms and paid by credit card five months ago When we arrived the receptionist only can find two room records but cannot find the 3rd one They asked me to call booking and said it should be booking s fault When I used the phone in the reception I requested to check the room in their reservation system again They found that the room we booked had been checked in by others Wrong guest stayed in our room used our booking records Though they found the mistake they didn t apologize to us and let us wait for a long time to get another room So rude staffs it s really bad experience in London , None 
45996,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, WiFi temporarily not working Long queue at breakfast with extremely slow host , It s quite average I have had much nicer experiences in other Radisson Blu hotels 
45997,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room air con really poor noisy and uncontrollable cooler in the corridor Two rooms exactly the same , Staff were excellent couldn t really do enough position so near Warren St for the tube etc Breakfast very good
45998,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The only issue I had was that I had forgotten to bring a phone charger When I rang reception I was told that I would have to bring my phone to reception to have it charged there It would of been nice to have one brought to my room However the hotel its self was clean and comfortable with very helpful staff , Close proximity to train station 
45999,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The toilet facilities could improve on more handles to hold by the bath and toilet also climb free access to shower facilities I would prefer to have smaller night lights next to the bed than only head lights The hair dryer could have a longer cable so that it is possible to stand in front of the large mirror in the bedroom Alternatively hang the mirror nearer Another improvement could be to upgrade the computers in the business suite as they were extremely slow and had an antiquated browser which prevented me from entering the site to do the flight check in , Great location to reach all tourist sites as Warren Street tube station is 1 min walking distance The beds are very comfortable The room given to us my really old mother and me was very suitable for a zimmer frame as it was really spacious The lift is great for people with walking impairments 
46000,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Pillows hard Evening staff on desk could not answer question about night buses New location better than they did However did eventually look it up and find answer, Great location Good breakfast
46001,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Long queue on check in Not explained that 50 extra would be added if you wanted a tab on the room Breakfast not included in price, Picked the hotel for its location
46002,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The rooms are not very spacious and it can be quite noisy and loud outside during the evenings, Perfect location close to the underground Oxdord Street Regent s Park helpful and friendly staff Great variety of nutritious food for breakfast 
46003,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room very hot with aircon not very effective and very noisy Shower temperatures changed whilst in use becoming too hot to use limited choice in evening restaurant, Nice staff breakfast good
46004,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We booked two rooms with an inter connecting door This was supplied 317 and 318 but the staff could not obtain a key to unlock the door when we returned in the evening Therefore two separate room which was not what we wanted Very disappointing after all the trouble Trevor the manager on duty when we arrived went to to ensure we had connecting rooms Shame he was not there when we got back in the evening , Floor staff very helpfull
46005,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing, Everything was great The room size and equipment were wonderful We had everything we needed any requests were met with quick help Perfect choice for London 
46006,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room could have had better air conditioning quite frankly I don t think it was working at all The wall panel setting indicated 13 deg which would be like the north face of the Eiger yet it felt like the tropics so no I don t think it was working and I ended up opening the windows which meant quite a high level of ambient noise This is not a real negative but i will mention it anyway the TV remote control was infuriatingly slow and made it was quite difficult to select a channel accurately , The room was quite small but very functional and very clean However I would suggest the size of the room is fairly typical London offering Bed was superb lovely and comfortable in fact 
46007,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, No breakfast The room was not cheap and breakfast was a lot extra on top A good pub 2 minutes down the road served full English for a fiver , Rooms excellent Beds ultra comfortable Items provided in rooms were excellent Very courteous and professional staff It s the small touches which make the difference I chose this hotel as it was near to a function I was attending Very good location for tourists Close to tube Loved staying here would stay again 
46008,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The scrambled egg was really runny so just chose different things , Tried a fruit juice concoction that I would not normally try and it was fabulous It was a very relaxed hotel and staying there on my own allowed me appreciate it even more 
46009,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I called a few days before to ask if we could drop our cases when we got to London The reservationist said that we could but he d also request early check in for us When we got there the room wasn t ready which wasn t a problem but Carlos changed our room to a twin I thought that was what I d booked anyway stored our cases for us until our return We returned at about 16 15 but the room wasn t ready but we were offered a double instead Due to time constraints we took it The room was basically a single room with a double bed squashed in Very claustrophobic and not enough room for 2 adults Over priced for what we got and very disappointing The only saving grace was the amenities in the room They were very good , The location the public areas the amenities
46010,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The water in the shower suddenly were changing to very hot When I was booking room there was information that the room is with bath yet I got only room with shower , Hotel was clean and tidy breakfast was very tasty staff were friendly underground station is next to the hotel in the same building is McDonalds loads of shops close to Euston station easy access to London s attractions 
46011,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, High price on all beverages breakfast wasn t very nice for 15 00 19 95 if not pre booked , Nice room good staff good room service nice meal delivered to my room 
46012,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I arrived at the hotel around 17 30 which is way after their 15 00 standard check in time The receptionist did not apologize and just said I had to wait 15min because the room was not ready I had planned to get refreshed to go out for a musical so after 20mim I told her I had to drop my luggage in the room even if a cleaner is in it and head on She reacted as if she was doing me a major favour and passed me the room key Bad check in experience never had this before Then the breakfast It is supposed to start from 7 30 and there were over 30 people waiting at the entrance The staff were clearly not ready I happened to be the first to be asked for the room number then somehow the staff decided to take me straight to a table while rest of the guests started taking tables at random Total lack of structure organization No explanation whatsoever how nor who will be serving tea or coffee after being seated I went for scrambled eggs but it wasn t there at 7 40 so I asked and one staff just pointed at the display table saying it s there Another staff said it was coming in 5min It was delivered around 7 55 and it was more like some milky soup than anything The pastries were of good quality but the coffee tasted like powder I would not pay 15 quid for a breakfast of such low quality if I knew it in advance I hope this was one off like the change of management first day , Room was quite hot like one of the reviewers mentioned but I turned on the airconditioner immediately so that was ok The room was compact with everything you need The bathtub was nice and the bed was quite comfortable I slept well Everything was spotlessly clean Location is quite convenient 
46013,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, My single room was a bit small , The staff were very nice helpful The room was clean had a iron board The one touch card entry were easy to use 
46014,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, I was a bit suspicious about booking a single room and reading previous reviews but what I got was a spacious single with big bathroom bathtub Excellent location next to the Warren Street tube station excellent and helpful staff that fulfilled every request I had lovely breakfast area and variety of choices great value for money 
46015,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was tiny okay most of them are so in London and very noisy I could hear people walking behind the door all night long as if it was in my room The shower in the bathroom was clogged When I tried to complain nobody at the reception paid any attention Though the staff at the restaurant was very friendly and breakfast was nice , Location was not too bad as the underground station is just outside the hotel 
46016,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Restaurant staff some of them were rude and at times I felt bullied rather than served my table was not ready for the time booked and I was told to go out and wait In the restaurant there was a substantial puddle of some sort at the side of my table and it was cleaned only after me asking someone to do it There was no bedside table to accompany the bed and no saucers to accompany teacups in my room I ordered a wake up call but it never came Shower facilities were primitive with water unable to sustain stable temperature The shower tray was old and scratched Temperature adjustment button did not work The sink was blocked There was a wrong date displayed on the telephone display Overall all this would be ok in a budget hotel but I booked this one because I know what Radisson Manchester is like and believed that the standards should be the same in every Radisson hotel When a friend of mine stayed in Manchester she even had a dressing gown and slippers at her disposal and she could choose between harder or softer pillows , Food at the restaurant 
46017,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Wifi connection in bedroom proved difficult to obtain it work in the bar and reception area , Great location Friendly Staff and good atmosphere in restaurant and bar areas 
46018,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, They had failed to register or lost the booking com booking I ve used booking com dozens of times and they were the first hotel to mess up They did find me a room after reading the email conformation on my phone but the receptionist lacked people skills made out she was doing me a favour and failed to apologise The hair dryer cable is fixed to the drawer and won t reach to the mirror, Small but comfortable pleasant room Excellent external sound proofing v quiet for central London There were a lot of people suddenly partying in the room next door at 2am I rang reception and they sorted it immediately Comfortable bed and good shower Well fitted out room
46019,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing Loved everything about my stay Have booked to come back , Comfy bed Good sized as was single room with small double bed Staff lovely Allowed a later checkout at no additional cost Restaurant lovely too Steak was amazing Stones throw from the tube station was a great bonus

46024,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Onions on the breakfast View from the room was a little drab but I suppose that couldn t be helped , Great service from the staff Breakfast served piping hot to our room Location fab right next to tube 
46025,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Nothing, Easy to get to by car just on the outskirts of congestion charge and cheap parking at Euston station 16 for the whole weekend The underground very close walking distance from most places comfy bed and lovely breakfast
46026,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Massive gap between window and frame meant cold air and noise entered the room This led to a poor night s sleep spoiling an otherwise perfect stay , Excellent room with free WiFi and plenty of charging points for laptops and phones 
46027,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The single rooms and bathrooms are very small Breakfast service closed at 10 10 even though it said 10 30 in literature , The communal areas are great for a meeting The hotel was very warm 
46028,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Rooms are still small but I think it is as anywhere in London , Everything was outstanding in general Staff was very helpful and attentive Truly English breakfast plus fresh juices made the day The location is perfect 
46029,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Tea and coffee served at breakfast could have been hotter and better coffee seemed to be stewed and tea was very weak , The beds were really comfortable Choice of food at breakfasts were good and fresh Staff were very accommodating and friendly 
46030,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was not double glazed so you could hear the emergency service sirens all night Then London rush hour starting from 5am , The room was clean well presented The complimentary drinking water was a really nice touch 
46031,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, staff at reception were like Robots although it was a reasonable cost for room room was small i was advised i have given you a QUITE room well we could here all noise from outside it would of been better to say nothing it was not quite , location
46032,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, no complaints the hotel has it right, the receptionist placed us in a room across the bridge floor 2 as it was quiet This was a small room but had all the facilities that we required and was in deed a quiet room 
46033,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, A bit noisy on TCR but had ear plugs , Very comfortable and spacious throughout luxurious surroundings well kept and clean and tidy classic and quality finishes Location suited our itinerary but may be a bit off the beaten track for some I am usually disappointed with some aspect of a hotel stay but could find nothing to moan about here Would use again 
46034,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The fan air conditioning in my room did not work and the maintenance person had to switch it off at the mains Room slightly cramped Lots of noise eg ambulances from the street throughout the night despite being on the 5th floor , Comfortable clean and tidy Breakfast included with a very large range of food and drinks on offer Staff very attentive and helpful at all times 
46035,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was a little dark but for London it was really large , The staff were extremely helpful on the day of check out I was unwell having already checked out I was given a room to rest until we were ready to leave Nothing was too much for them 
46036,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, The hotel location is Very close to warren station underground all the staff are very nice and they can prepare a very good breakfast to go at 4 am Will come back again with my family 
46037,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast on Sunday was chaos Not enough staff Tables left uncleared Had to wait ages for coffee , Location was excellent for Grafton Street tube station
46038,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Small bed maybe according to the type of the room Hairdryer placed in the room hidden and fixed in the drawer Missing a toilet brush , Perfect for travelling around the city hotel next to the tube station Delicious breakfast very tasty salmon and freshly baked croissants Big variety of food as well as of drinks Tesco next to the hotel Sainsbury opposite the hotel great for late night food and drink shopping 
46039,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The noise a guest made during the night trying to get access to a room without the key by banging on the door Cleaning staff knocking on the door around 9 a m on Sunday morning when we were supposed to check out at 11 a m They did the same at a similar time on Saturday as well despite the fact we were not checking out that day , The location not far from the Euston train station and the proximity to other areas of interest in London The bed was comfortable 
46040,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The fire alarms went off twice in the middle of the night but were not addressed by staff Random beeping in my room from 1 30am to 2 00am one night The air conditioner did not work very effectively , The bathroom was nice The Internet was fast and free 
46041,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I always sleep with a window open therefore traffic and reveller noise heard until early hours , Great pillows and very comfy bed just what was needed after a busy day in London Staff very helpful and a credit to the hotel Great location to Warren Street tube station Northern Line which was very helpful for getting around 
46042,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Best hotel beds we have slept in and great pillows Also having free WiFi a bonus thanks In a good area for Easton train station within walking distance 
46043,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, A later check out time instead of 11am , Really good capable and confident staff We were dealt with at checkin by a trainee called Carlos and were really impressed with his professionalism In reality every member of staff we came in contact with were really good they all shone and I would definitely use this hotel and the chain again 
46044,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, For a world class chain one would expect them to contact you back after you complain about a major miss from their front desk team but that feedback didn t happen who cares If any one ends up booing this place please be aware that you shall receive a text message with a link that will take you through a process of an online check in where you pick your room and pay for it That what has happened with me and an hour after my payment was successful i received another text taking me to the payment page again I contacted booking com team who kindly contacted the hotel but the hotel said they don t send customers any text messages to me it is now a fraud i cancelled my card and shockingly when i arrived at the hotel the front desk person said that they do send texts for the customers to do an online check in and that the card i used didn t go through and i have to pay again A few days after i found the payment they say it was declined appearing on my bank statement So again i called them and shockingly the person taking the call declined them sending any texts to customers so after speaking to many others they paid back my money I emailed a complaint and in vodafone kind of style they chose to completely ignore me Thanks Never again, An hour over the phone to get my money back and the same to the bank to cancel my credit cards because of their untrained unprofessional rude staff I can t think of any thing better oh yes completely ignored my complaint saying sorry maybe 
46045,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Old carpets in rooms old bathroom facilities No view Stairs down to access bedroom , Very helpful staff professional accessible courteous very useful
46046,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Breakfast was amazing fresh juices orange grapefruit apple and a special green mix including cucumber apple ginger and celery fresh fruits English breakfast cheese cottage cheese smoked salmon ham sweet things The location very close to Warren Street on the Northern Line was especially convenient for us We stayed there from 31 03 03 04 and only paid approximately 430 for 3 nights for 2 persons 
46047,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I suppose being in London it s difficult to have a view in all rooms but we had none at all It was ok for an overnight stay though Our room had steps inside it and while we were capable but may be a problem for someone less spritely , The reception was courteous and welcoming The rooms were comfortable and clean with hairdryer coffee tea tv etc The restaurant was good and food excellent It was almost next door to the tube station which was very convenient for us and our plans I can t comment on nearby attractions as we were only on an overnight stay I d stay again 
46048,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, A lovely hotel in an excellent location 5 10 minute walk from Euston station and next to Warren St tube Staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms were spotless with great facilities Would highly recommend 
46049,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The only complaint was that the Gluten free bread at breakfast was right next to the other bread next to the toaster and no separate toaster for the gluten free bread My husband has Coeliac disease and these points are very important , The room was lovely and clean Really good breakfast didn t have to queue Had a meal in the restaurant one evening good service even though it was very busy Excellent location 
46050,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room we got was really small and we could hardly move around plus the guy who served us made us pay a completely different rate to what we initially booked online for arriving late at the desk No amenities except for the restaurant downstairs and rather a basic hotel in one of the many Radisson Blu chains OK if you re just stopping for one night and are heading out the next day but wasn t worth the price , The location is very central located near Warren Street St and they have a Steak and Lobster restaurant situated right downstairs Good location with several great shops and restaurants around 
46051,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, A little noise early morning I think may have been from the kitchens, Lovely position quiet through the night A bit noisy from 6 00 onwards gorgeous breakfast and very helpful happy staff 
46052,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The temperature inside our room was really high at least 22 degrees and we weren t able to lower it down At night we had to open a window otherwise we couldn t sleep but then we heard noise coming from the street Also we expected to have a bathtub in our room which wasn t the case and the flat iron wasn t working , The interior of the hotel was amazing looks really stylish and modern The breakfast was excellent and we received a warm welcome at the reception During our stay the staff was very friendly and helpful to us Also the hotel is situated at a convenient location not too far from St Pancras train station and the city centre 
46053,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Perfect location so close to underground station for easy travel around town Breakfast was delicious Very friendly staff As it was my husbands birthday soon after our trip they gave us a nice little treat in the room 
46054,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Difficult to find but only because I was looking for a Raddison sign not Grafton Entrance not very welcoming in appearance , Very helpful reception staff sorted early check in unexpected free upgrade to a double room Well equipped room very comfortable bed 
46055,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Wider breakfast selection e g chef cooking omelettes or other types of food requests Did however cater for gluten free , Good standard and value for money hotel just a very short walk or tube station and walking distance to west end area 
46056,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Shower draining problem Towels are poor quality Room size for single was small breakfast was expensive , Location Hotel upgraded me free of charge to bigger room 
46057,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room would have been just a bit bigger for my preference But most of the time I was in it I was asleep and I don t need much space then , Helpful staff dealt with my requests and queries both before and during my stay very well I had a bike with me secured safely in the luggage room A small room definitely a single but all the mod cons I needed or wanted Slept well enough so bed clearly comfortable for me Everything clean tidy well maintained tea coffee facilities a bottle of water Fifth floor so traffic noise not a problem Breakfast was excellent buffet with an exhaustive choice staff offering frequent refills of tea and coffee And the price was excellent having booked well in advance 
46058,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast was chaotic had to ask for butter ran out of bacon and expected to wait 10 mins Evening drinks VERY expensive Shower wasnt high enough for the man , Free upgrade got over the fact that it took so long to check in The bed was so comfortable Room clean Water pressure good and nice towels 
46059,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was really small I had one night so it was OK Last floor The ventilator worked all night and the staff told me it will switch off automatically around mid night which was not the case it kept running all night but it was not too noisy , The interior design of the hotel is GREAT The staff is nice and helpful Location is good walking from Oxford street Camden town Metro station San Pancreas Breakfast is good as well
46060,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Could not fault anything , Bed very comfy Lovely room Nothing was too much trouble Everything anyone could want at the breakfast table Did have a problem with no water in sink but it was repaired whilst we were out 
46061,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, It s a little expensive but it seems most of London is It seemed good value in comparison to other hotels , Very close to an underground station which made getting around very easy Free wifi was excellent and the bed was very comfortable 
46062,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Noisy They gave us a room over a street pub that was so loud we had to request another room It was a Friday night but still people have to sleep Then the second room had such thin walls we were kept up from midnight to 3am by an amorous couple I was very embarrassed it kept awake my 13 yr old daughter and I had to put on music to try to block out the continuous graphic sounds won t stay there again , Staff nice rooms decent
46063,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was so narrow we couldn t get past the end of the bed without turning sideways neither of us are large It was about 14 inches or so away from the wall Pictures added Bed uncomfortable Only one chair Reading lights were spotlights above pillows Carpet dirty Huge step up into bathroom Room boiling hot aircon noisy Permanent noisy fan in bathroom Breakfast tables so close together we were practically sitting on the laps of the people at adjacent tables Room door did not fit properly so room was very noisy by door into lift and stairs lobby , Toiletries and towels were ok 
46064,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room water was turned off on the second morning Would have appreciated being informed prior to turning off Unable to shower or wash teeth However obviously not a regular occurance and otherwise a really nice stay Pleasant staff , Good location Great steak 
46065,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, noisy room near the elevator and too hot opening the window was not an option due to outside noise breakfast not ready at opening ie no eggs staff unhappy, Location
46066,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The view out the window was concrete walls but we didn t ask for a view so can t complain , The reception team were really efficient The room was immaculate and as 2 friends catching up it was perfectly positioned to jump on the tube to explore the sights of London or only a 15 min walk to Leicester Square 
46067,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Limited restaurant choice only two choices steak or lobster Bill includes service charge then they ask you if you would like to add a gratuity ,No Positive
46068,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast was not reaching the highest quality Room was quite noisy because of air conditioning equipment outside in backyard can be heard only when window is left opened No table reading lamps quite terrible lightning , Staff was very friendly Location is perfect one metro stop to Oxford circus 
46069,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I can t think of anything that could be improved as we only stayed for three nights , Everything at the Hotel was great from the friendly and helpful reception staff to the cleaners The Hotel is right next to Warren St Tube Station which was ideal to explore London with no hassle 
46070,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Some of the breakfast staff appeared to be bored and the service was rather sloppy The breakfast was cool warm rather than hot and the presentation of the food for example a large bucket of wet bacon was really very unappealing , The location is good the hotel needs better soundproofing 
46071,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, One twin room 101 had no windows to look out of they were high and frosted Lack of choice on hotel restaurant munu The bar was quiet but still a long wait due to barman making cocktails for restaurant customers Will book again but eat and drink elsewhere , The hotel was clean and comfortable the junior suite was good value and made the trip extra special Was no noise heard from other guests will be booking again Some good places to eat close to hotel and tube station on doorstep 
46072,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, A bit of luxury in the middle of London Excellent breakfast Very good bed Nice staff No noise from the street or from other rooms Well worth the money will stay again if can afford it Lovely hotel 
46073,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was at the rear of the hotel and was tiny Bathroom was tired and shower changed temperature at own will presumably down to poor plumbing , Breakfast was tasty
46074,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Couldn t change aircon so room was a little cool , Kingsize bed was fabulous very comfy We needed an extension cable this was delivered to the room promptly 
46075,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was a little warm even with the fan on and heating down Someone charged a food bill to our room this was dealt with well by the staff and wasn t an issue but we would have thought that if someone charges food to a room they would have to display a key card to prove what room they were in , Staff were lovely Rooms were clean and had good facilities Good location for the tube local tourists sites Surrounded by good restaurants 
46076,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, They were given a corner room just above Mc Donalds It is small and air conditioning not working well Also the fridge that doesn t open so nowere to put a fresh cream cake It is a very expensive room for what you get and to be honest with you I shall find another hotel , Location is excellent as my relatives who stayed and not me Breakfast is good as I was told 
46077,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Situated in between two tube stations one right next to the hotel and the other reachable in less than 5min with grocery shops pubs and restaurants not far the quite luxurious hotel is a well located place for a London city trip The staff is of course as nice and friendly as you would expect it from a Radisson Blu hotel 
46078,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Extremely small room though it was very well decorated and did not lack essential facilities , Great location in central London next door to Underground station Good breakfast and efficient service 
46079,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Service at breakfast and during dinner was terrible Horrible treatment by the same person working both morning and night We will never use Steak Lobster again and wouldn t pay for breakfast It brings the whole hotel down even though the other staff was nice , Location rooms and cleaning 
46080,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast was only average , Location was perfect for getting around 15 GBP complimentary spend in the bar or restaurant included with the room type we booked Maintenance staff fixed issue with a window in our room very promptly as it was letting in a draught and noise from the street Lobster and steak menu looked great Didn t get to try it as was closed when we checked in at 22 30 
46081,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Got my extra pillows out of the wardrobe and there was no pillow case on one and a dark hair I m blonde called housekeeping and within a few mins it was sorted My room was right next to the lift so at peak times made quite a noise constantly ask for a room away from lift next time , Decor of hotel was just lovely and location perfect for the tube
46082,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The tv and the remote control had an extremely slow connection A test to ones patience , All the staff are happy and smiling Such a good sign I loved it when doors were opened for me Its the little touches that make a stay special Plus I was able to check in early a god send after coming off the overnight train from Scotland Breakfast was a joy Fresh smoothies for breakfast smoked salmon for those of us who don t like bacon sausages Fresh fruit was left in the room on my second day I think they saw that I ate fruit by the remnants in my waste bin So thoughtful 
46083,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The bathroom was a little small and there were no grab rails in the shower The room was a little hot and the only view was a wall, The room was very good for a single room in London The bed in particular was very comfortable and large The food at breakfast was excellent It was nice to be able to order food as well as choose from the buffet The staff were very pleasant
46084,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was very small for two people We could only just move around the bed and the shower over the bath was very basic and water pressure awfully slow Breakfast queues were very long so picked up a pastry and left and didn t bother day 2 , Position by the station and tube
46085,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Que for reception and breakfast was slow and long Room was terrible Small boiling hot and if the window was left open you could smell takeaway food Will not be staying here again Rip off,No Positive
46086,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Queueing for 30 mins at breakfast unacceptable No apologies from staff Waiters hard to find and rude They couldn t cope with the volume of clients and it appears they were disorganised and short staffed , Unfortunately I had to complain about the service received at breakfast However the guest relations manager did upgrade our room for free as a gesture of good will which made the stay better
46087,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Poor service at dinner regarding gluten free options When asked for a salad it came covered in croutons The waiter was asked politely if it could be changed it was taken away and no replacement came It was an expensive meal and not worth the money We ate out at lunch time and if we were late back we went to Sainsburys across the road and bought a sandwich much simpler to get a gluten free choice there The room was clean but smalla and had a view of the alley at the back of the hotel which was noisy with people talking at night Breakfast good , The location oh this hotel is fantastic almost next door to Warren Street tube making it quick to get from place to place The staff on reception were very friendly and helpful The hotel is beautiful inside and very comfortable The room was clean and relaxing but I would request a room facing the front next time 
46088,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, If possible I would avoid breakfast Organised chaos Too many members of staff floating around serving coffee Just let hotel guests get their own Buffet area is too small for the number of guests so queues form , Highly recommend this hotel Absolutely brilliant location with Warren Street tube station 30 seconds walk away and Kings Cross Station within walking distance My girlfriend and I received a free room upgrade upon arrival and a fresh fruit platter which was a nice touch Room was a decent size for a London hotel Very clean Spotless bathroom with soaps shampoo and conditioner Room was very quiet overlooking the rear of the hotel 
46089,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The air con in room was too noisy to use so room was red hot thus us having to have windows open all the stay Bed was soo small for a double, Breakfast was lovely plenty of choice
46090,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The service at breakfast was slow and we had to wait in a queue when there were plenty of spare tables the staff were just slow at clearing them , The room was clean and comfortable great location just a 10 minute walk from Euston Station Great choice for breakfast
46091,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast was chaotic and selection wasn t great bit disappointing, Free wifi throughout handy to walk to certain areas but conveniently right outside a tube stop too Room was a lot roomier than expected 
46092,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The only complaint was the temperature of the room was exceptionally hot as our air conditioning didn t work and slept with the windows wide open for two nights , Excellent location just off the Northern Line Breakfast was a nice extra and was good at setting you up for the day Lovely room and clean
46093,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, One of the spotlight lights had gone out Some of the TV channels wouldn t work There was only one dressing gown and one pair of slippers and there was two of us Apart from those it was brilliant , The bed was absolutely huge which was lovely I liked the idea of the ice bucket and being able to fill it up with ice in the hotel The bathroom was very relaxing I had a lovely bath I love that it is a 30 second walk from the tube station and it is so central It was great the staff asked if we wanted our bags stored for the day when we checked out 
46094,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The generators at the back of the hotel were very noisy stopped me from sleeping on the first night The music at breakfast was a little beaty something more soothing would have been better, Excellent location Brilliant breakfast in fact one of the best I have had at a hotel
46095,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Tv didn t work in the room wasn t really a big deal as spent most of the time out of the room , Room was quiet breakfast was good and bed was comfortable 
46096,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Be careful to sleep at the right side of the hotel meaning not at the side of the street We first got a room at the street side and it was very noisy I knew we could not sleep there so we asked for a room on the other side which was great and quiet Bring your earplugs just to be sure Second what we found very strange is that the breakfast could be better organised Every day there were lines waiting for breakfast We had a 45 min wait on saturday morning If you come around 10 am the waits are gone , The room was wonderful the beds were good and it was clean I liked the location most Located right next to a subway station it was very convenient 
46097,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, If we had to pick something the quilt didn t quite fit the duvet cover , Trevor was great when checking in out Free room upgrade complimentary chocolates strawberries as we were celebrating a 30th birthday Room was lovely quiet for all it was a busy street Range of food at breakfast was really good Location was great Would definitely recommend 
46098,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, nothing, superb comfort and cleanliness Excellent housekeeping and reception service Breakfast delicious No negative comments at all Great all around location for stations and central London 
46099,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast service was nonexistent Had to fetch my own coffee no one visited the table and no directions given on where to go for what , Sean at the bar was very good 
46100,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room was so small and smelled as an ashtray Staff was not really helpful The hotel need a serious renovation as it s outdated and shabby The bed size was also smaller than in any hotels I stayed before The breakfast starts at 7am which is too late already but they start it at 7 30am on Saturdays So I had to go to the airport without having breakfast And yes They do have a huge construction site right in front of the window and you can hear all the sounds of constructing from 6am Avoid this hotel , Location is good 
46101,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Waiting for over 15 minutes to be seated for breakfast having to continuously seek out staff to bring coffee and ordering hot water came with lots of attempts to get it right They were just so over worked I think and could do with more staff at peak times Need more ambient lighting options in the bedroom it was either horrendous spot light over bed no lamps or softer light option which was necessary for middle of the night or early mornings, Location superb clean warm front desk staff excellent 
46102,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast starts to late, Had 4 night stay as son is in UCLH opposite tried to extend stay due to complications as hospital and they wanted 50 00 per night more than my original booking price breakfast should start at 6 not 7 never again 189 00 per night well over priced
46103,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I do not know why but I had a reservation for a large bed and upon arrival I was the announcement that it is Valentine s Day and we will have separate beds Then the room was quite busy in the next room which were separated by a locked door Some equipment in the room already noticeably worn mess on the roof while looking out of the window it looked nice, Personal very kind helpful and friendly breakfast super tasty and ample selection of everything clean and filled
46104,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I can t think of anything Maybe the price but that s justifiable by the included breakfast and the location , The hotel looked absolutely incredible and it s location was ideal 20 minute walk from St Pancras Itl and Warren Street Underground Station literally across the road The staff were lovely and the included breakfast was delicious I m looking forward to coming back next year 
46105,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, We stayed for a full week Although the breakfast food was good it could be more varied e g breads cheeses eggs cereals It would be nice to have some basic vegetables in addition to nice fruit that was offered The dining room staff could be more efficient in serving coffee actually good coffee re filling items on the buffet table etc The toaster is awful Several of the tables wobble Room 433 is very nice and quiet but the bathroom is so tiny and hard to maneuver in it , Fantastic location close to the Warren Street tube station Very clean and efficient check in and check out Very helpful reception and concierge staff 
46106,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Having to wait 1 5 hours for our designated quiet room after the promised 15 00 room ready time Lukewarm English breakfast items on the buffet , Very pleasant room and facilities apart from the dawn deliveries dustbin men outside 
46107,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Room far too hot air con didn t work but there was a window which opened rare in London but still hot room The corridor outside the room was the part of the corridor floor which was laminated tiles and not carpeted so ladies heels clumping pass all night meant we didn t sleep much and people s voices carried down the corridors Shame because we liked the hotel and staff and room layout though bathroom would not fit someone bigger than size 14 between the door and sink Just wish we had managed to get some decent sleep Reported it to staff next day who did apologise Tip check your room has carpet outside , Location and the deal was good 
46108,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Our check in should have been 3pm I had contacted the hotel for an earlier check in to which I had no reply Finally checked in at 5pm We were offered complimentary drinks in the bar but all the same to be checking in 2 hours later than we expected was disappointing , Room was surprisingly large beds were huge extremely comfortable Breakfast was amazing Flowers brownies in room this was a really nice touch for our Anniversary Would recommend we would definitely return 
46109,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Bathroom is not too spacious not a big issue but there is no hair dryer and toilet brush which is unusual , Good location kind staff nice and clean room comfortable bed good breakfast

46114,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Staff could of been friendlier Reception could have been more helpful and attentive my wife left her handbag in the dining room and we reported it but a most lackadaisical attitude did not help , bed comfy and a good breakfast
46115,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room didn t smell fresh on arrival but of stale air There were no bedside lamps and the overhead ones were too bright There was no plug socket next to the bed The breakfast buffet hot food was cold The seating in the lounge and restaurant was uncomfortable as the sponge seat was no longer supportive and the bench seat fabric had dark patches that were off putting , I like the USB sockets in the plug socket The bed was so very comfortable and that was the best thing along with the staff 
46116,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, A few extra bags to tuck a bit of laundry into my suitcase would have been handy , Polite pleasant staff more than happy to help nothing was too difficult
46117,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Toilett flush from 18th century didn t work properly Tiny room with old windows we could barely open Breakfast was huge chaos Had to queue for buffet forever Food laying around on floors Waiters filled up containers with food on regular already used plates About 15 empty juice bottles on the bar left no more juice for us we arrived ad 9 45 on Subday morning Our table didn t get cleaned in betweeen so we sat there for over an hour with our used dishes that s not a relaxed Sunday morning breakfast No porridge musli only available upon request they are charging GBP 19 if you have breakfast extra not sure what for Luggage was stored in a meeting room downstairs unlocked we had to go in and search by ourselfs , Tube station next corner 
46118,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, A screw fell out of the wardrobe door and it was hanging off for the duration of our stay we didn t report it until we left The soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken and despite reporting it it wasn t fixed until we left a written note beside it The steps inside the room which my husband managed to fall down when he got up in the middle of the night and no he hadn t been drinking No bedside lamps so I had to read at night by the ceiling light Room was comfortable but the word Deluxe has been much misused here , Complimentary bottled water and magazines in our Deluxe King room Staff were very pleasant especially a very helpful member of the housekeeping staff who fetched us a bucket of ice after we asked where the ice machine was located Very comfy sofas in the bar area which were bliss after a day of walking 
46119,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, internet connection was a problem air con was not very receptive tried downing it down but took a long time to get cool, excellent staff service food excellent room was very comfortable
46120,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Outside of building looked rather untidy and shabby hard to find a no distinctive sign flag we walked past the entrance The main problem I encountered was difficulty sleeping This was due to noise throughout night mainly from corridor Also the room was very warm and stuffy despite us trying to turn temperature down on air conditioning control In the end had to put the noisy fan on I had a very important exam the following day the final exam for qualifying to be a GP , Very good breakfast nice clean bathroom Staff very friendly Nice reception area with water and fruit to hand Nice decor inside nice dining area

46125,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Breakfast was not well organised Apart from toast all food was on one counter so even if you just wanted a croissant or a bowl of cereal you had to queue with everyone else We waited 15 mins to be asked if we wanted anything off the menu and having finished our breakfast still hadn t been asked about tea or coffee I eventually went off to find a waiter with a coffee jug We were obviously sat in an area where our designated waiter was off having his own breakfast A shame as everything else was good , Everything needed for a comfortable stay Room small but have to expect it in London All staff we met were very pleasant The location was brilliant very central with a tube just a few yards away Bed as very comfortable and not much noise from other guests

46138,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Unfortunately I didn t sleep a wink we was in a room at the back of the hotel which housed several generators These kept humming all night and to make things worse we had scaffolding approximately 3 meters away from our window with workman starting work early in the morning approx 7 ish These were really loud with all sorts of hammering and drilling Spoilt my experience really as i was too tired during the day , Very Friendly staff at the reception and concierge Great location with easy access to Central London and Euston Station

46150,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Sitting directly next to strangers at breakfast because tables were so packed in they all but touched , Handy location for our needs in London the deluxe king room was spacious by London standards and an interesting layout 
46151,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, I always have to ask for extra pillows as not in room Had to take a card reading from me despite me paying in cash This meant that money was held from my account for 7 days It has meant bills have bounced and i have recieved subsequent charges , Staff were friendly and helpful Hotel is clean to a high standard Also in great location for tube and central London 
46152,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Rooms very small beds small the web site rooms looked big and spacious I moved from my 1st room I was very disappointed my second room was also disappointing the TV was horrendous and the kettle did not work The resturant was uncomfortable tables too close together packed in no room to move cooked breakfast terrible scrambled eggs the worst I ve ever eaten Very disappointed Staff were aware of all of the above prior to me checking out and all I was offered was a chat with customer service this did spoil my visit to London it was my 13 year old sons first visit to London and the hotel stay spoilt it No view , Location was excellent

46160,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Not so good service at dinner in the restaurant and given large wine as standard wasn t requested Coffee Machine in room 501 had to be placed on floor to plug in as countertop plugs too close to top to allow plug in Extract in bathroom on constantly rather than linked to lights with 15 min overrun , Good location adjacent to Warren St tube comfortable room good reception service and good variety for breakfast

46169,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, It was impossible to sleep The single paned windows leading directly onto Tottenham Court Road meant that every conversation siren car lorry and bus could be heard Never again , Location for business purposes was good 
46170,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Air conditioning very old and unhealthy Rooms stuffy Shower was going from hot to scalding for no reason Dangerous espicially for children Stayed in two different rooms and this happened in both rooms , Very clean Staff very friendly and helpful 
46171,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Small dark rooom , The room was horrible So small it finishes before it begins In that small room There was a partition next to cupboard The approach towards the cupboard was not possible There was no space to keep a single suitcase It wasn t at all worth of money In that small there ware three steps as well can you imagine the space

46175,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Upgraded to one bedroom suite Because the card for the room would not open After 30 minutes they upgraded us Still was disappointed but did help ease the situation Front desk was rude and cold , Poor check in As I spoke direct and ask if we could have early check in They had no record of this Breakfast was a chamble there must have been 30 tables that had not been cleaned and had to wait 15 minutes for a table and then given to someone else Very frustrating 
46176,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, Single room is small I couldn t leave my large hardcase luggage opened without blocking the passage way But maybe this type of size might be common for central london I m not sure Oh the street can sometimes be a bit noisy as well , Location is excellent right next to Warren Street tube station Other than the size of room i was happy with everything including the breakfast and the staff were quite helpful as well 
46177,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The lights in the rooms make you feel a bit like your on the operating table and the hotel does not provide any solution to that They could sell candles just to make it a tiny bit cosier The bed was really small for two adults but we decided to look at things with a possitive attitude and therefore the small bed became one of the cosiest part of the trip , The service was excellent breakfast was yummy and the location is great The room was clean and the tub in the bathroom turned that one hour into a real treat And finally we were allowed to check out late at no extra cost so I would say overall very happy with our stay

46181,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The rooms were very plain For the money I spent I expected a little better decor to match the lobby design at the least It was clean but very disappointing on the decor Learned that we had to pay to even just watch local tv , The lobby was very attractive and the staff very welcoming and informative 
46182,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room is a bit small, It is perfectly located near the Tube just have a minute walk Even walk from hotel to oxford circus it takes around 20 minutes only Staffs are helpful

46186,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The walls of the rooms into the corridors must be made of paper as you can hear every door in the corridor shutting Very disturbing if there are any very late or very early arrivals departures , Perfect location 10 steps from tube station so central ON Victoria Line so extremely easy access from Stansted 
46187,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Breakfast in my room Food was hot fresh and very nice with a menu you could tailor to your choice Room was a luxury single and very comfortable Easy to get to all the major shops
46188,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton,No Negative, Great location a stone s throw from Warren Street tube station and 2mins walk to Euston Booked a single room to stay over to join friends for a SOHO night out and have the convenience of getting to London St Pancras the next morning Room was clean and nicely decorated bathroom compact but clean and well stocked Room had traffic noise as it was facing the front road so I called reception to ask to move rooms They sorted it straight away I explained I was in a rush to get ready to meet friends He told me to carry on getting ready and brought a new key for my quiet room which meant I could move my stuff when I had finished and dash straight out to the station Great service Free wifi and complimentary bottled water in rooms Breakfast was included and was a good hot buffet Staff efficient and smiled For under 200 I felt like I had a good deal 
46189,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was tiny the ac blew directly into my head the windows were also too close to the bed The blind was ripped the room was dirty The bathroom sink was blocked The wrong room service menu was in the room which delayed my order as i had to wait for delivery of a new menu There are only two hot vegetarian options on the menu The fire alarm went off at 11 30pm i called reception to ask what i should do they said they were investigating and would call me back they did not The ac meant i woke up with a head cold and was feeling ill and missed breakfast I asked for another room but was told the hotel was full I had just come back from Paris so was tired and had to do some urgent work I did not have time to follow up on my complaints My stay was awful and made me unwell This is not a four star property and I will not be staying here again I would like a refund I was asked for my email address but have not yet heard back from the hotel they fobbed me off with a free stay for a special occasion but feel I have been fobbed off , location to EUSTON Station
46190,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The room was located in the first floor just right above a bus station it was very annoying coz of the noise The windows were not good and not isolating the noise , I liked the space in the room
46191,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The staff was slow and not very helpful at checkin and first insisted we had a reservation for a single room only Eventually they admitted we had booked a double but the room and the bed were so tiny it might as well have been a single The room was way too hot and the thermostat did not work properly There was a very long corridor with many steps to the room which made it rather difficult with heavy luggage , The location and the Internet speed
46192,Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton, The single room could be a bit more spacious Having said that they made very good use of the space and for London standards it s still good , Spotless modern and comfortable room helpful staff central lovely breakfast
