27867,The Park Tower Knightsbridge a Luxury Collection Hotel, No real complaints Not really an English flair more like a good business hotel All the amenities were there however My wife says it was a typical businessman s hotel with no place for a woman to set down and put on make up Unfortunately most hotels have this problem Are there never any women involved in designing a hotel room A good value for our money overall , The eggs were NOT fluffy Overall the hotel was bright clean and In a decent location with very pleasant staff A great lounge We were quite pleased overall 
27868,The Park Tower Knightsbridge a Luxury Collection Hotel, The staff very rude Upon checking in unpleasant greeting Was not escorted to my room Came back to the hotel after a night out Staff engaged me and others into a rude line of questioning Had to look for my key to get into the hotel as doors were locked I would expect the door man of a five star hotel to recognise guests staying in the hotel As I was walking into the hotel on this night the door guy let the door hit me on my way in as he didn t hold the door open It seemed a bit racist to be honest I paid almost a thousand for two nights for such ill treatment Was not impressed by the room dinning Food was plain Worse food I ve eaten in a five star hotel One more thing Upon checking in staff rudely asked for my passport whilst I m actually a resident here I gave him a debit card to process the payment for the room and after he rudely asked if I could use a credit card instead And then he seemed disappointed when I said I only have debit cards I don t see the difference between a debit and credit card I think it s a racist hotel I m staying in jumeirah carlton next time And I do come to London a lot Your loss losers, The private lifts
