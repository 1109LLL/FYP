418379,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Rooms were a bit cold since the weather was not warm enough for summer and they shut the heating off , Staff was very pleasant especially Peter who is the first person you see getting of your taxi and when you are leaving the hotel for your city tour 
418380,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, There was a shower panel missing which made showering a bit difficult , We did not have breakfast as we were not really hungry and there is a set price of 25 euros They gave us a free upgrade to Suite which was VERY nice My husband had a medical problem and they handled that magnificently Nick the night staff member was superb 
418381,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Nothing, I am biased as I was upgraded to a suite which had 6 rooms Quite amazing place I love the Art deco interior I had two bathrooms one ultra modern with separate shower and one left in the original green tiles Wonderful wood everywhere I have never seen a hotel like it Staff were very helpful 
418382,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Most staff were not attentive to us or didnt seem to care or be helpful I dont want to play the race card but that seemed to be the only plausible explanation we were not assisted with our luggage to our rooms we were not even shown to the lifts which were in some corner Although we had witnessed how helpful and willing to help they were with other guests On one day my husband got in the lift with an elderly couple and you could see how they physically clinged to one another and made sure that when they got off on their floor they shut the lift door behind them one of those ancient open the door lifts so he could not follow them It was quite upsetting Maybe not many black people stay in such nice hotels , The beds and pillows were amazingly lush
418383,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, It is very easy to get lost in this hotel as it is an old building and there are a lot of different corridors There is a lovely old charm about it and the architecture and design of the hotel are just beautiful This lift did stop working for a few hours on one day however this was quickly fixed , The location is excellent just a short walk into the main area of Amsterdam and the red light district To go to the museums is also very easy either via bike or public transport The wellness centre is great to relax in after a long day of walking around and shopping ect 
418384,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam,No Negative, Very comfortable bed well stocked free mini bar Good breakfast with lots of choice very clean and friendly helpful staff Would thoroughly recommend 
418385,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Curtains had the remote control to operate them and sometimes they started living their own life for several minutes, Staff was extremely friendly the room very cozy I just love everything 
418386,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, At check in they take a 150 euro deposit on top of your nights accommodation I found that odd and a bit unnecessary They start to vacuum the hall quite early which was a bit annoying too , It was a convenient location walking distance from train station and the centre It is about 25 min walk to Jordan and Anne Franks house and 30min walk to the Van Goh Museum however you can get the tram from the station which is 5min walk The room was comfortable and the minibar is complimentary The pool area is just ok but nice to be able to relax at the sauna after a day of walking 
418387,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam,No Negative, Walking into the room our mouths dropped It was huge And that was just a standard room The open mini bar was a fantastic feature that they should include with all 5 star hotels It was fully stocked every day The service was what you d expect from a 5 star place Friendly and also funny staff were there to help everywhere you looked The location was central to the shopping and restaurant districts I wish I had a chance to dip into the pool however it did look relaxing 
418388,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Though the size of the room was quiet fair but i didnt like the setting of the bathroom It didnt seem to be modern and i felt the cleaning wasn t proper though i do not mean to say that the room or bathrooms were dirty The bathroom fittings and towels were dated and not as per the standard as expected The carpets in the rooms and outside were not upto the standard as expected The wallpaper makes the room look over the top but at the same time did not give a feeling of a five star hotel but instead of a boarding house The temperature of the room was bit high for my liking and it couldnt be controlled from the controller as it had zero effect of the temperature of the room and fortunately i had a room with huge windows and i kept them open for cool breeze and fresh air The hotels had in stock much less umbrellas as required for the guests The weather at Amsterdam is unpredictable , The location of the hotel is near Grand Station and service and staff are quiet helpful and polite It is a popular hotel due to its location and rooms as offered Though it is sort of a labyrinth as it appears to an old some sort of public exchange building now converted into a hotel but the building in itself is nice Though it is in centre but it is located at one corner and you need to walk a bit to reach major attractions but walking in itself a pleasure and every road every corner has a story of its own The rooms are fairly large and comfortable bedding My room had an excellent view though i wouldn t say the same for my friends who got a separate room So would suggest that a room with a view of side canal be preferred and be requested at the time of booking itself The hotel is quiet packed and we were unable to seek any accommodation for early check in as we arrived quiet early in the day and we deposited our luggage and came back after touring the city for a while we preferred to eat outside as Amsterdam has lovely cafes spread all over The minibar was quiet exhaustive and included in our price and was a welcome addition 
418389,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Added Champagne and Strawberries to the hotel room for arrival These were never delivered to the room and the staff tried to charge me for them on check out They did not believe me when I told them and have to ring around to get confirmation that these were not delivered to the room I was not impressed with the attitude of some of the staff , Location was very good 
418390,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Service not great in terms of replenishing the room we had three in a room and at 75 extra per night for the extra bed we expected 3 cups etc but had to keep calling for hat The topper mattress in the beds wasn t attached so you sort of slid off on the night Air conditioning was hopeless, Location was awesome Building very interesting Huge room
418391,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, In two days I left the hotel early morning and come back after 6 hours and no one cleand my room I had to call them every time to clean it , location near to the central station and damrak street complimentary minibar water coffe tea etc 
418392,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam,No Negative, good location near the station for day trips around Amsterdam and we also enjoyed using the pool every day while the free mini bar was also a nice arrangement and well appreciated
418393,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The bed and pillows were uncomfortable Cleaning was only ok , Very nice hotel with excellent location The room was nice with high seiling and big windows Staff was nice and helpful Wellness was complimentary and it was great place to relax after walking around the city 
418394,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Staff not helpful as i requested to change my room on first day because it located in the ground floor next to main road and was very noisy and not comfortable but they just ignore me I requested also to clean my room every day before 1 0 PM also they ignore my requisite TV channels not working and i did ask front desk to fix it but once again they ignore me beside all that 5 star hotel without Air conditions was surprise for me frankly overall experience was very disappointed and not worth payment for 5 star , Spa and location 
418395,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Breakfast very expensive have certainly had better for a lot less money, Very interesting hotel unusual decor we liked it but may not suit everybody handy for train station 
418396,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Breakfast wasn t included in the price which was a shame Also the lounge area is stark and it doubles up as the restaurant Not very appealing for such a lovely hotel I expected comfy sofas to sit in around the bar area This was disappointing as there were just cafe like seating areas , The room was lovely and all facilities were super The pool and well being area were fine 
418397,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The Amrath hotel is very old marble walls and hallways the decor in the rooms is very dark If you appreciate modern hotels then you will be disappointed , The location The bed very comfortable good service 
418398,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, there were old spider webs in the room but they fixed that for us very fast But not something that you d expect in a 5 star hotel can always be spiders but these webs were old and dusty and a lot of them over the room We arrived on a very hot day and the hotel has no air condition so keep that in mind if you are traveling in the summer months we requested a fan and they came with it right away and that helped a little bit , The bed was very comfy room was nice The building is absolutely beautiful Staff was over all very nice The complementary minibar was a nice surprise even if they forgot to fill it 2 times over our 5 day stay But when we called the lobby they came right away with the beverages 
418399,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Inadequate and confusing booking deposit system No staff in leisure centre No prebooked appointment Or room requests honoured Careless and non chalont attitude of night staff Had to share the room with a MASSIVE beetle That lived in the curtains stopped sleep Uncomfortable topper mattresses that won t stay on the bed Had to ask for almost everything that should have been automatically provided towels etc Noisy service lifts operating through the night No one around to help or understand that we couldn t get a restful night Came home very tired , The architecture
418400,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, a littttttle bit far from central station about 4 minutes walk , The hotel itself should be a viewpoint It s so classical with a big room and high ceiling Except the small closet everything is perfect Besides the staff gave us a big surprise after he knew it was our honeymoon trip at the lobby when we checked in The mini bar is free 
418401,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, We did not like food or service in bar and a lot of people around had problems on the same night We also had to ask to move rooms as we were originally placed in a room literally on a construction site had asked for a quiet room Were then moved to 4th floor with canal view and enjoyed stay Because our stay was so short 3 nights it was a shame that on the first eve we got awful food service and that room , Located very near Amsterdam Central Station china town and red light district Lots of restaurants etc nearby 
418402,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The pool looked a little worn down a bit more care or maintaining the hotel generally , Beautiful large rooms still retaining original features of the building Extremely comfortable and free mini bar much appreciated on the hot days 
418403,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, See above Only downside was that the hotel had no AC and our room facing the canal and sun was quite warm we happened to be there in 80 F weather which is not that common the staff did everything they could when we mentioned it providing a fan which did help a bit the next night Room was modern and well kept plus a free well stocked mini bar Really enjoyed a well need soak in the large tub , Beautiful old hotel with incredible interior artwork was the original city customs house About three blocks from train station and tram stops Hotel sold us tram tickets Service was superb Everyone very helpful Abigail Rex and the concierges who s names I can t remember were extra helpful Also dinner servers They exceeded our needs 
418404,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, One of the elevators is very old and would occasionally get stuck on certain floors if the door wasn t properly closed Other than that this hotel was wonderful , This hotel was absolutely beautiful and in a great location very close to the train station The concierge was very helpful and gave my partner and I some great recommendations for our stay in Amsterdam Highly recommend 
418405,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Dirty rooms mice in the bar when tried to use room service only had 1 thing on the menu we could order dirty mini bar and not cleaned once bathroom dirty even when asked for room to be serviced still wasn t clean dust all over telephone next to bed and on light bases, Comfy bed champagne left in the room for my birthday staff at the front desk very helpful and friendly nice location
418406,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The lift is incredibly slow , We got upgraded to a wonderful room in 3 levels and perhaps the best view of Amsterdam And in our booking the mini bar was complimentary never had that before Sure it is a bit expensive but worth it 
418407,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The service the quality of the rooms especially the one they gave is a room right beside construction works that is super noisy at 6am Located in the farthest end of the building with no view which is smaller than most rooms as well and it felt like we re in a dungeon Worst off I booked and paid advance but the time that we checked out asked us to pay additional 200 additional for the rooms coz apparently the amount paid on prepaid was just for reservation I m so confused coz it defeats the purpose of what booking com is offering Overall very unpleasant experience , I only like the history of the building 
418408,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Only the fact that there was building work going on next door at the time we were there , Absolutely marvelous building huge rooms and rambling corridors Loved the art deco feel The staff were kind and helpful A pity there was building work going on outside but after complaining about the noise we were moved to the other side with no problems The hotel was an easy walk from the train station and we enjoyed the market square of Nieuwmarkt which was also very close 
418409,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, It is a lovely hotel just not for us too dark boring And Amsterdam is certainly not that , Very comfortable beds terrific bathtub it was just a bit to staid quiet for us Need a bit more activity action in surroundings Views from rooms not really acceptable And very expensive Historic Hotel just not to our liking Location too remote We like to be in the thick of things 
418410,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, When you first get to the floor your room is on you think Oh Oh look s pretty old but that is the charm 100 year old hotel with rooms and bathrooms tastefully updated , The staff were great The breakfast was great and the pool sauna s and hot tub were fantastic 
418411,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Need fitted sheets on the bed they kept slipping off Need air con we were got in May and were given a fan but would be v hot in summer , Very close to station and all facilities friendly staff very helpful Free mini bar Made it extra special for a birthday with fizz and a card in the room 
418412,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, no air conditioning could not provide twin beds did not replenish monitor and said they did heatwave and sheets not changed after 2 days dining room not open for dinner, beds were comfortable building architecturally spectacular
418413,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, I appreciated the old building but that was all I like about it , I found the room was very dusty there was a bottle cap under my bed I found some of the staff to be dismissive when I complained the shower door did not close I had to ask twice for it to be fixed the TV did not work in my room and at breakfast there were cups with chips gone off the side The selection of food for breakfast was cheap and average I certainly do not rate this hotel as a 5 star 3 star and that is being generous I would not spend my money again to stay at that hotel Lisa Michelle Ryder
418414,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, During our stay there the noises of construction started very early in the morning aprox 7 a m We complained to the staff in reception but there was no change And the breakfast was quite common not worthy the price , The hotel has a beautiful facade in an excellent location and the staff look friendly 
418415,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Bed had a wooden surround that made it very uncomfortable to get in and out of bed Needs to be redesigned Reception area has been relocated and was quite chaotic when checking in and out Too small an area needs a rethink, Upgraded to a quirky suite Lots of nooks and crannies and no dust anywhere
418416,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The shower in the bathtub everything got wet Difficult to find the elevators and they did not always work Fitness centre could also need upgrading Expensive breakfast , Quiet room Nespresso coffee machine in the room friendly and helpful service desk nice style and good location
418417,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam,No Negative, The rooms were luxurious and there was a free mini bar which was restocked as needed The staff were all super friendly The receptionists escorted you everywhere instead of pointing us in the direction needed We were offered umbrellas as soon as we arrived Reception was very professional The breakfast was enormous Unlimited good coffee too Nice heritage building Housekeeping staff were friendly and professional English was all good The wellness centre is a great place to relax when waiting for your flights They had a pool warmer than 32C A spa and several saunas at 70 and 90 F 
418418,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, You get what you pay for This is a great hotel right near the train station Hotels are a people to people business The person that checked me in walked me back to my room She didn t want me to get lost since the hotel is chunked up a bit into sections and mazes She had my luggage the whole way The food from room service was excellent and on time The entire staff was friendly My bartender one night tried to teach me some Dutch Forget the think in terms of you have worked hard travel in Europe can be tiring and you deserve a bit of a rest I had some trouble connecting to the internet and staying connected I actually think it was settings on my devices that got changed and not indicative of issues at the hotel Since entering The Netherlands my phone had issues which resolved themselves upon leaving The Netherlands , You get what you pay for This is a great hotel right near the train station Hotels are a people to people business The person that checked me in walked me back to my room She didn t want me to get lost since the hotel is chunked up a bit into sections and mazes She had my luggage the whole way The food from room service was excellent and on time The entire staff was friendly My bartender one night tried to teach me some Dutch Forget the think in terms of you have worked hard travel in Europe can be tiring and you deserve a bit of a rest 
418419,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Most things are great about the Amrath Last time we stayed we book a suit but this time we just went for a double room but the service seemed to be lacking a little this time It took a long time for rooms to be made up mini bar was not stocked up one day large amount of TV channels not available Small details but they add up , Love the location and the facilities available at the Amrath they rooms are also a great size 
418420,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Location is not bad but a little bit of a walk from central locations , Very grand building rooms were very spacious and the complementary mini bar was a nice bonus 
418421,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam,No Negative, We really enjoyed our stay here its a very nice older building We stayed in a very nice room with a kingsize 4 poster bed overlooking the canal its a good location minutes from the train station All the staff were friendly and attentive the wellness center was great we had a nice massage when we arrived they have a nice steam room sauna and very nice pool we enjoyed a three course meal in there restaurant the breakfast was very good and included many items and the free mini bar was a bonus we would stay again anytime in amsterdam 
418422,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The location the bathroom was very small We had a larger bathroom in the room we changed from but this bathroom was on view from the bedroom with no door for privacy Also this room was stifling hot and couldn t open a window This hotel doesn t have air conditioning Also just fancied a Baileys for nightcap but was told they had run out, The staff were very friendly
418423,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Due to flight time arrivals we did not get in until 9 45pm Even though we had booked more than 10 months in advance we were assigned rooms on level 1 Outside our windows was scaffolding and the windows were extremely dirty from the construction We found a window could not be secured One workmen waved to us Room was very dark Bar restaurant staff ignored us for 25 mins at which time they advised the kitchen had closed at 10pm Reception staff should have advised that kitchen was about to close when we checked in , Bathroom fittings and internet were good Room was spacious 
418424,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Room service could be improved The room service number never answered tried 4x so I had to call reception and they had someone call me back The steak and fries were nearly cold when they arrived Also the steak wasn t salted and was not served with sauce as it was described So nearly cold steak with no salt or sauce but I was too hungry and it was too late for me to bother calling again and waiting for service I ended up using the mayonnaise for the fries as the sauce , Thanks to having to care for a sick child I came down late for breakfast after it was already closed and they were cleaning up the buffet A staff person told me no problem she d get them to whip something up She brought scrambled eggs ham cheese fruit pastries I was so grateful That is true 5 star service 
418425,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, This is a mediocre 4 star at absolute best It does not meet criteria for 5 star accommodation under any definition and is very tired in terms of facilities decor and staff commitment Disappointing overall , The hotel certainly has character
418426,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Lack of staff in breakfast room Staff more concerned with clearing and relaying tables after earlier diners at 8 15am than ensuring there was a good supply of all types of food and drink The bacon was overcooked and very salty Request for fried poached eggs was initially refused with an argument between waitress and chef however the eggs did appear after about 20 minutes The waitress was very apologetic for their shortfalls Very dark hotel with no natural light in corridors Lift broke down and we were on 4th floor Some receptionists appeared not to be fully trained and for example didn t know about shoe cleaning service advertised in the hotel guide , Convenient for city station and trams Staff were both friendly helpful and apologetic A free minibar no spirits was stocked daily although we did not use to the full 
418427,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, View from the room superior room junior suite on an A C unit and to a next door construction unpleasant atmosphere Breakfast not matching this category Last night during our stay we discovered mice in the bistrot and then even in our room which was on the other side of the building We were offered a little compensation appr 130 EUR on a 2400 EUR total bill We didn t want to end our vacation with a huge argument but very disappointing though In any case the problem was seemingly known by the hotel management this should be a no go for a 5 star hotel , Good location nice architecture spa friendly staff huge rooms 
418428,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Small window to the outside world could have been a little cleaner, Hotel was like a grand old castle centrally located in the Red Light District close to Dam Square and Niewmarket
418429,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, I wish they d cleaned the bathroom counter better but everything else was perfect , The breakfast buffet including the yoghurt bar was amazing The room had a free minibar with delicious beer The toiletries were wonderful and smelled really good and the bathtub was so deep It was easy to walk there from the main train station My bed was super comfortable 
418430,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Wi fi flaky in the room Shower door broken Electric curtains open between 0715 and 0730 which wakes you immediately , Good central location Nice room but not five star no feeling of luxury all a bit tired Staff all helpful and cheerful enough 
418431,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Room was a little dusty for my liking could have done with a really good deep clean generally was acceptable just for the quality of the hotel it should have been better , Great building good location staff very good 
418432,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, the quality of the breakfast and the lack of proper bar facilities The check in and check out procedures and the fact that the hotel had retain a payment made at checking in which i had to contact them about on return home, The central location of the hotel
418433,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The Spa Treatment facilities ambience and quality did not come up to a 5 Spa only 3 , Excellent location Historical Hotel and ambience Large Spacious Rooms and very well equipped Very good breakfast quality and choice Swimming pool sauna and steam room very good and gym well equipped 
418434,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam,No Negative, Beautiful facility Historic building nicely adapted to modern hotel Spacious well appointed room Friendly helpful staff Nice pool and health facilities Quiet with very comfortable bed Close to train station and central sites And an Easter egg on our bed at night 
418435,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The hotel was very drab It was dark and kind of unsettling Even our couch was black don t want to even consider what was hiding there The staff seemed very friendly Our room was not clean by 3pm past check in so they gave us a complimentary upgrade and ONE free drink ticket for 2 people The free drink ticket was humorous The bartender ended up giving us 2 free drinks because it seemed ridiculous Upon checkout we were charged 800 for the complimentary upgrade The woman took our information and said she d call after they figured out what happened there No one has contacted us It s been 4 days The room was rushed when they set it up for us There was trash on the window sills and our mini fridge was not restocked We had ordered champagne to be in the room when we arrived but had to call down 2 times before it arrived Then the guy who delivered our luggage was basically asking for a tip we didn t have any euro on us Checking in here is not a fun process The whole thing is a scam Our room itself was 3 stories Sounds nice but it was a complete pain The stairs are very narrow and hard to get up and down The bedroom is on the second floor but the bathrooms are on the first and third The entire room was very dark and almost wet You have NO control of the air just heat Also for a 5 star hotel there were no robes something I always look forward to I m honestly not sure how this hotel has 5 stars I d give 5 stars to the breakfast but 3 to the hotel itself , The bathroom was incredible although it seemed like they just threw a bathtub in without thinking 
418436,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Due to work I had to leave early and had to pay for a night that I did not enjoyed When asked the staff if I could reebook for a night the following week they said they could no due to the fact that because the reservation was done via booking com they had no say ,No Positive
418437,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam,No Negative, The whole experience was amazing a great superbly quiet hotel perfectly located Rooms were very comfortable indeed fantastic beds Free minibar and Nespresso machine were a real boost 
418438,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, didn t realize my sister and I would have to sleep together but thankfully it was a king size bed so no problem , Breakfast especially was terrific 
418439,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Lack of air conditioning having to ask staff to open the window not given a key to do this ourselves Menu choice was poor and breakfast expensive They ran out of supplies of milk for tea and coffee in the room but did not tell us and we had to keep asking for jugs of milk as left none each day Facilities need much improvement, Friendly staff
418440,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Be careful enough what side of the hotel your room is on Get on the smaller canal side not the side of the main road it is noisy to say nothing of the construction going on right outside the hotel We had to move rooms after one night it was so bad the girl who checked us in made a mistake and put us on the wrong side Breakfast was good but service not good You order eggs if you are not treated as though you are invisible and then they forget to get them from the kitchen When you repeatedly chase up they finally come cold and rubbery as they had been waiting to be delivered for so long This happened two days in a row so on the third day we went into the kitchen ourselves to monitor and get the eggs when cooked All was good after that , What a fascinating hotel Amazing historic architecture and d cor This is truly a unique property that needs to be experienced It even has an old paternoster lift only works for demonstrations though The location is excellent particularly if you come by train as it is very close to Amsterdam Central Station The room while old was comfortable and quiet you can even open a window Wi Fi was good The room service salads were excellent too 
418441,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, It was stunning we liked every aspect , The hotel is absolutely unique art deco marriage with the older style This was the Shipping House in old times and the design refers to the sea and sea gods creatures etc Personel is very nice and helpful I loved the way they interacted with my 2 5 old son And finally we have been upgraded which was amazing surprise 
418442,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Cleaning of room could have been better we also found rips in bed sheets when the room was cleaned the toilet paper was not replaced not enough clothes hangers sauna area was smelly , Good range for breakfast friendly staff Mini bar included was a great touch and stood it apart from other hotels we looked
418443,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Ground floor room next to noisy street, Amazing customer service My room was noisy and they were so nice and upgraded us Lovely spa and great location Daily free mini bar was lovely
418444,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Nothing, Beautiful hotel 5 mins walk opposite railway stn Lovely big bedroom with a large comfy bed Nice swimming pool upstairs with a sauna and jacuzzi Very friendly staff and juts round the corner from all the sights and nightlife 
418445,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam,No Negative, Had a really good stay as the room was very nice larger than expected and well cleaned Staff were friendly and helpful throughout and the spa area was great Location was good as we were a short walk from most attractions 
418446,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Appalling value for money In my opinion this is not a 5star hotel Cleanliness in the room was a joke the bathroom although looked great had a faulty sink and shower The heating was inadequate for the room the broken down elevator which was still not fixed on my departure I was promised an iPod dock on arrival which I specially requested and then had to argue the point and pay a deposit when the hotel agreed to fulfill the original promise Not enough hangers the steam room is not hot enough and does not generate enough steam The staff hovering for a tip was incredibly uncomfortable I would not stay here again Also my cc has been overcharged by A LOT , The pool 
418447,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff and hotel were good consierge Barry was fantastic Room magnificent only complaint is that they took a double holding deposit off my credit card Good location and facilities a little pricey but worth it
418448,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Breakfast not included and too expensive to add But not great problem as coffee machine in room , Free minibar coffee machine in room Spa Good Location short walk from Central train station 
418449,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Breakfast was dissapointing for a 5 star hotel The bacon was scorched and selection very limited way overpriced , The hotel is walking distance from Central station 
418450,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Barry the concierge had great experience with regards to the Thai boxing out there and he really made my trip more enjoyable , The staff and guidance they gave was spot on
418451,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Would not recommend the breakfast not value for the money Little on the hot items and would expect a wider variety for the 19 5 each price tag Can get better outside the hotel The spa is okay was cold when we went down later at night the jacuzzi was also out of order while we were there Not the best steam room the seats were cold and carried on turning off , The hotel was perfect location but not noisy 5 minute walk from central station ad walking distance to all attractions Very unique and would recommend if you like architecture and ask for a room on the higher floors for the views ours was superb 
418452,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, One of the check in staff had a less than welcoming attitude when we arrived And the 250 Euro that we had to pay upfront as a security deposit seemed a bit excessive , The spa facilities are lovely We chose to have a check in massage for 30 euros each which I can highly recommend Beds are extremely comfy 
418453,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, We like to hang out in the bar when we are away but didn t feel we could do that here more like a dining room with a bar at the end than a place to lounge Bloody Mary s weren t very good Steam room wasn t very warm , Room was very spacious and bed extremely comfortable Gentleman who showed us to our room was very friendly and knowledgeable of the hotel and area 
418454,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The room was poorly furnished for two people Inadequate hanging space and not enough drawer space One morning we had no hot water in the shower and had to call for assistance to get hot water in the bath and taps There was no decafinated coffee in the breakfast room, Comfortable beds very friendly staff free mini bar
418455,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, 2 hour wait to check in Stains on WC floor Noisy bathroom extractor fan that would not switch off Staff forgetting to send something that was promised Using the wrong credit card on check out even though I advised them All in very poor experience for a 5 Hotel , Room was very big and electric curtains are a fantastic touch Massive comfy bed Great Wellness Centre 
418456,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, We d usually leave the room around 10am explore the city and get back around 5 6pm At which point our room would still not have been clean Housekeeping would then turn up between 6 and 7 which seems way later than anywhere else we ve ever stayed At this time we want to relax and get ready before heading out for the evening but the guys cleaning the room There was a window in our room but it overlooked other windows We booked two single beds but got a double had been travelling all day so didn t bother mentioning this but wouldbhave been nice if they got it right The hotel looks a bit dated in the cooridoors , Complimentary mini bar Comfortable bed Nespresso machine Big bath Large room 
418457,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, I have stayed the hotel previously over a number of years The breakfast was undoubtedly the worst that it has been The cooked breakfast was not fresh and over cooked Service was poor ,No Positive

418469,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, The general poor state of the bathroom especially the leaking shower screen and I spent half an hour looking for the remote control for the curtains after it was stressed to me to us only this means for opening and closing After failing to find the said remote control I checked the curtains to find they were manual closing so better staff training on each rooms specific characteristics would certainly assist and create a more professional informed feeling for the guest s Please understand this is a minor matter and I did see the funny side it is just confusion when non is needed , The staff and d cor were both very agreeable and the location was ideal for our purposes

418500,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, Room 104 is a disgrace The desk is positioned right up against the bed so to roll out of bed meant rolling onto the desk it was literally touching the bed and the TV faced away from the bed so badly you had to sit at the foot of the bed to watch it We asked Esther in customer relations on the Monday night if we could move and she said she would sort it for the morning Came down in the morning and they had no notes from esther so we had to start all over again Insisted on a room move and got 127 which was better but was so hot we had to leave the windows open and the noisy chatter and laughter filtering up through the middle of the hotel kept us up all night and we missed breakfast the next day Spoke to gino in the morning who sorted us out with an upgrade to 323 and a bit of money back We told him if we had been staying longer than three nights we would have checked out So overall we wanted to love the Amrath but in all honesty we probably won t be back How you can achieve five star status when you have no aircon and a climate control system that left me waking up in a pool of sweat defies description I honestly believe you know about the problems with room 104 and allocated it to us because we were either first timers or were not paying full rack rate Regardless you ve not made friends of someone who works in media and understands the importance of five star customer service , Maritt and the bar staff were brilliant and the room we ended up in for our final night was great Couldn t fault the breakfasts although we didn t make it down for our second one due to reasons I will explain below Gino you are a star thank you

418592,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, You have to accept that this is an old hotel that can only do so much to modernise without pulling down all the old facilities and charm, Great location just a short walk from centre but far enough away to be quiet

418594,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, My room was number 100 and it was quite impossible for any guest to locate there following the signs I asked for help and they showed it to me explaining that the building was not constructed as a hotel hence like a labyrinth The first time trying to find there was weirdly entertaining as the hotel looked more and more like the set of The Shining with all those seemingly aimless spaces rooms and doors It looked more like a theme park with a haunted hotel concept Also on the second day and while checking out it was quite like a test against madness trying to figure my way in and out Not finding a bottle opener and the TV remote in the room combined with this lost theme upon my arrival which made my stay fun in a twisted way I don t know if the entertainment problem of finding the room or the way out was unique only to some rooms but it can also be dangerous for people who have mental issues Also I don t see how that kind of space can be evacuated in case of need If not intentional the lost theme may be degraded a bit by actually working on how better to indicate locations to guests , The staff was professional in a classical and sincere manner the hotel was very central and strangely likable The room was spacious with high ceilings Bathroom was up to date with various facilities They filled the mini bar with free drinks daily Something many hotels don t do at this time I had a very interesting experience there trying to find my room

418610,Grand Hotel Amr th Amsterdam, We are very unhappy with this Hotel which is mentioned as a 5 stars but which is not reliable at all we booked 2 rooms through booking finally when we leaved the hotel we paid a higher price than planned on the reservation because we requested an additional bed in one room and finally we discovered one week later that they used our credit card number for another invoice of 150 euros without asking or sending any information justifying this new invoice Our bank is investigating but it looks like they invoiced the Breakfast which was included in the booking price This hotel is really a shame ,No Positive
