146513,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, The price tag to stay here is high , A beautiful hotel in a great area of Paris with very high retail shopping and nice restaurants Hotel staff was very accommodating with great attitudes The room was large and very clean and comfortable 
146514,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Coffee took over 15 minutes to come out at breakfast but I assume they were busy The sauna and stream were closed for renovation, The hotel restaurants were amazing and they had an excellent concierge that helped us arrange all of our bookings during our stay Staff was all extra friendly
146515,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Lack of English speaking programs on TV and although a very nice place we felt that it was overpriced we expected more wow for the money only saw a lukewarm small water bottle and a couple of cookies in our room upon arrival in other places we were treated to a spread of cheeses sausage snacks pates crackers etc and that was for less money for the room , Liked the air conditioning and the service
146516,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris,No Negative, it is geroge v so worth the expense we arrived very early around 11 am and staffs at the front told us we could check in as soon as room is ready for us didn t mention check in time is 3 pm and we were just trying to keep our luaggues before check in They were doing everyting they could to check us in as early as possible Meanwhile we were just shopping at shops on george v and they called us to let us know that room is ready it was around noon so we checked in around 12 Everything was so smooth and and people were very nice Room is lovely and comfortable we had a wonderful stay for 3 nights 
146517,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Bit overpriced , Exceptional and attentive staff Met and accommodated every need Genuine kindness and helpful The suite we stayed in a suite that overlooked the city and Eiffel tower as it sparked at night City was quiet and peaceful just after the election 
146518,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, nothing, I recommend this hotel in every way don t care about how expensive the hotel is it worth every dollar you pay the looks on my wife s face when we reached her smile when we entered the lobby made me love this hotel compared to any hotel with its price range George V four season tops them all without thinking for me id rather pay more live in this luxurious hotel if your visiting Paris you didn t stay at least once in your life here you haven t been to Paris I felt like royal when I was there 
146519,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, The property was like a Las Vegas hotel Decor was opulent and tacky I usually stay in Paris at boutique hotels but stayed here because we thought it would be nice for Valentine s Day I travel constantly and always in the most luxurious hotels The decor of this hotel was boring and I don t really love the neighborhood too commercial Paris is so magical but this place makes it feel like you re in any other city Also if you don t like perfume do not stay here The halls and rooms have so much perfume you can barely breathe Definitely not worth the money , Customer service was great 
146520,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Room service is way too slow I ve lived in hotel end of last month and they still holding the deposit from my credit card for almost one month when will they finally charge the bill from my credit card , Location 
146521,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Waiting for friends in the lobby was very difficult nowhere to sit The bar especially from early evening onwards was always full, The croissants were excellent The staff very helpful and friendly
146522,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris,No Negative, The staff was superb We were there for business and to celebrate my birthday Everyone was friendly and we were greeted with courtesy and a big smile Love the George 
146523,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, The Hotel had Electricity Breakdown for 2 hours between 19 00 21 00 hour on Friday and another 1 hour on Saturday Also on Sunday the Lobby wah hosting an event of a Travel Agency BAr and restaurant were not open for Hotel Guest We are regularly customers of Four Seasons Hotel around the world but this time it was very disspaointing and they denied to compensate us ,No Positive
146524,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, The pool has disappeared to make room for the extended Spa facilities It was also the first time that I have experienced a power cut at a hotel but this was probably out of their control and after about 2 hours all was restored Otherwise very little not to like , Wonderful attentive service amongst the best that I have experienced anywhere The concierge service is very efficient organising tickets for special events and for pre booking at art galleries and museums A charming hotel with excellent choice of restaurants Lovely spa and small gym beautifully decorated with fresh flowers and choice of refreshments Has a glamorous feel but still feels quite homely 
146525,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, The prices for meal and room service transcended obscene and were quite offensive I get that this is an expensive hotel but 200 for a buffet breakfast of pastries cereal smoked salmon cold cuts and cheese for two is ridiculous when five star Sydney hotels with harbour views charge a fraction of this We ate out every single meal breakfast lunch and dinner , The room was truly sumptuous as you d expect from the price 
146526,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, The bathroom toilet area smelled musty In comparison to other 5 star hotels we were not addressed by our names which would have been a nice touch , I got a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower at night and appreciated the extra attention given to my young daughter I am also thankful that arrangements were easy to make with their Concierge for transportation pick up from the airport after a very long flight 
146527,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris,No Negative, We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and had the most fabulous experience Room service came w Evian water and a bowl when our friends dog was thirsty That s service 
146528,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Difficult to identify what we would like to see improved as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay this time just as much as the previous year I would like to hope that the prices for the accommodation do not elevate to an unreasonable level over the next few years I do think the breakfast buffet price is a little high and would like to have seen a nominal price for a coffee croissant light breakfast alternative It would suit those of us who are down for breakfast at 9 30am and planning to lunch at 12 , Enjoyed the luxurious ambiance throughout the Hotel Appreciated the extra attention by the staff who were friendly and helpful at all times They provide a small but well equipped fitness room and lovely pool in the Spa The Hotel Bar is very comfortable and the service by the bar staff was brilliant Dining at the Hotel is also a great experience the finest quality produce and wonderful varied menu s 
146529,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Nothing, The Best thing about my stay was the staff I know a thing about customer service and they were the best Its always the little things that count eg remembering my name etc I didn t get the opportunity to eat breakfast there but the spa and the pool facilities are beautiful and accessible The location is 15 minutes from most places so yes LOVED IT
146530,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, The food in the inside Resturant are not the best and the price are so high , The location is perfect and also the staff are so nice and the best concierge in all other hotels 
146531,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris,No Negative, What a beautiful hotel this is the location service facilities staff are second to none the attention to detail in fact there is just nothing negative I can say about it
146532,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Nothing , Nothing was too much trouble it was my Daughters birthday weekend and they upgraded us free of charge and left a complimentary bottle of Champagne in the room thank you so much 
146533,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, I don t feel the value for the price especially in the restaurants Room was spacious and gorgeous but a few stains on the carpet and sofa , Staff was extremely friendly and helpful room was gorgeous and location was great 
146534,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris,No Negative, A beautiful hotel with very nice staff The bedroom was luxurious and the bathroom was to a truly deluxe standard We will return on our next visit to paris Russell Powell
146535,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Expensive and the absence of a breakfast buffet More vegetalian vegan options at the bar restaurants would be much appreciated , The Four Seasons standard 
146536,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Absolutely nothing, The whole experience was sublime Attentive helpful friendly staff superb facilities in the room but would have liked to have been able to make a cup of tea beautiful decor and the most incredible and exquisite attention to detail 
146537,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, The only thing that is a killer are the prices they are not too unreasonable 200 Euro for a modest in room breakfast 400 Euro for an airport transfer While I can afford this it is way too much even in comparison to other 5 star hotels anywhere in the world , Excellent staff clean room perfect facilities A great wifi with excellent speed you have a free version and you can upgrade to a high speed internet connection for a certain amount The food delivered by room service is very tasty and food is fresh Concierge is perfect The SPA is magnificent with very excellent massages and treatments Our first stay in this hotel but this is now a favourite for us 
146538,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, There was nothing to dislike , The welcome was outstanding as was the service provided by absolutely every member of staff The Hotel is beautiful and reflects everything that is wonderful about Paris I came with my daughter for a relaxing time with no stress from anything and that is exactly what we had The food and drinks available were presented so very well and the quality of same was first class All of the facilities were amazing I cannot rate the Hotel or it s staff highly enough and I cannot wait to return neither can my daughter We love the Fiour Seasons 
146539,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris,No Negative, The excellent service we received from all the staff at the hotel It was obvious that nothing was too much trouble to ensure that we had a wonderful stay 
146540,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Really nothing but if I had to be really picky the wait for a couple of drinks late in the evening in the Gallery Bar was rather long , Wow what an experience worth every penny Having honeymooned in Paris forty years ago we decided to return to the city for our anniversary and to push the boat out by staying here I can honestly say it was worth the expense and is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in I had booked the Cinq restaurant in advance for our actual anniversary meal and they had obviously passed this on to the reception team We availed ourselves of the offer of Sedan Car service to transfer us from the train station to the hotel and the driver who met us was super We were greeted on arrival by a staff member and taken directly to our room where a bottle of champagne on ice and a delicious chocolate cake awaited us The deluxe king room itself was beautiful tastefully decorated beautifully appointed and with a view of the Eiffel Tower The bathroom was also luxurious The staff were all fantastic and the service level very high We did not eat breakfast at the hotel but did have a glorious dinner in the Cinq restaurant Faultless in every respect The spa which you can use for free was wonderful We did not book any treatments but swam in the stunning pool and whirlpool as well as using the steam rooms and saunas situated in the male and female changing rooms There is a pleasant caf area too A great way to relax and not busy I like the way there is a facility for children to swim at certain times and then adults only time Taxis are available outside the hotel the nearest metro station George V is close by on the Champs Elys es We were made to feel special by everyone at the hotel and my only problem is how I will be able to stay anywhere else in Paris should we go back as it will be hard to match the quality of our suberb stay here 
146541,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris,No Negative, Friendly and knowledgeable staff cleanliness windows that opened everything worked properly coffee machine A first class luxury hotel experience from start to finish 
146542,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris,No Negative, THE Staff were very friendly and attend to guests with smiles At the restaurant two of the persons that stood out in their services deliveries were Benjamin and Nicolas as well as a lady from Argentina They need to be well commended by the management because they represents the hotel in good light
146543,Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, Security Manager was very rude and was yelling at my 4 year old for touching a Porsche parked outside the hotel I think they should be parked underground if they are concerned about them instead of controlling pedestrians , Most of the Staff where amazing very welcoming Typical of the Four Seasons
