364531,London Elizabeth Hotel, Not sure where to start The Hotel from the outside looked lovely Reception looked nice Staff OK We had heavy luggage and were advised to use the lift You were lucky if you can fit a suitcase in this lift it was the size of a single wardrobe The room was Outdated No Air Con No batteries in remote control no tea bags and one milk for two We have travelled and stayed in many places this has to be by far the worst Very over priced for what was there we certainly did not want to stay for breakfast , location next to Hyde Park 
364532,London Elizabeth Hotel, The Wifi was a bit too slow , We liked our stay the room was big the comfort was great and we could enough rest at the hotel The staff was very friendly and helpful 
364533,London Elizabeth Hotel, Tiny hot room space Only lift was so small 2 of us plus a bag apiece felt like sardines in a tin , Convenient central site close to public transport 
364534,London Elizabeth Hotel, It was cheap Everything was disappointing No lock up area for luggage Lift had room for 2 small people and was very slow My room on the first floor was poorly furnished had no hot water and was directly over a bus stop Aircon was broken Just don t bother Life is too short One of the worst I have ever stayed in , It was cheap
364535,London Elizabeth Hotel, Entered room to find tv on loud with no remote to switch it off Also noticed that despite 30 degrees outside the towel rail was on full heat in the bathroom and could not be turned off Lady on reception was helpful in bring a remote control and trying to contact the maintenance guy but he was apparently ignoring her calls and hung up when she contacted him on her own mobile Were there two days and did not get it fixed Suggest hotel re considers who is doing the maintenance Despite the fancy box of teas in the room the two milk cartons and the breakfast tea bag we used on the first night were not replaced so reception had to come up with a small jug of milk and my partner and I shared the remaining tea bag on the following morning Would have preferred this instead of the fancy handy mobile phone available for guests to use although this was obviously aimed at the international visitor Get the basics right first , Location across from Hyde Park is ideal should be close to Lancaster Gate tube station but this was closed during our stay Lady on reception tried to be helpful 
364536,London Elizabeth Hotel, Decor and breakfast, Breakfast was terrible room was okay but dated needs a desperate makeover Staff at reception were friendly but breakfast staff were as miserable as sin We only stayed one night for BST Hyde park as the location was good 
364537,London Elizabeth Hotel, Was great no probs, Breakfast was excellent this hotel had a lovely outdoor sitting patio very close to Lancaster Rd tube and easy tube into west end Hyde park etc hotel also has private car park available
364538,London Elizabeth Hotel, No welcome drink Frosty welcome from receptionist who was complaining about another customer unprofessional Lift not working No room service at night reception call for takeaway that took over an hour Peeling paint in room Expensive in room snacks out of date Limited expensive bar drinks Neglected facilities Noisy cleaners in corridor early in morning , Location 
364539,London Elizabeth Hotel, Scruffy public areas Bathroom tatty Tiny lift inevitable in old building or long staircase to 4th floor Fairly chaotic check in out Small breakfast area , There was no air con so fan was useful
364540,London Elizabeth Hotel, The Room was uncomfortably hot and we were not able to sleep all night I had expected an air conditioned room in a four star hotel in fact there was a small ceiling fan providing some air to the feet of the bed beds were too small The carpets were old and seem unclean The breakfast was the worst I have seen from all the hotels booked to booking com The continental breakfast offered some cereals apples boiled egg and cold toasts I will write to you separately requesting for refund because the hotel was not in my opinion a four star accommodation There were at least two guests I met who very upset about the poor the quality of service I requested a table fan during the night because I was unable to sleep but there were none available It appears that even for the guests who have air conditioned rooms the air conditioning has malfunctioned I believe that considering that this was rated as four star it should have been made clear to the guests that in the heat of the summer no air conditioned rooms will be available I would rate our stay at this hotel is the worst experience ever, Nothing
364541,London Elizabeth Hotel, First gripe the TINY lift My daughter refused point blank to get in it with me and our two suitcases to be fair it would have been a tight squeeze We actually only ever used it going up to our room on the third floor with shopping we always came down on the stairs BUT it is vital for those checking out for bringing heavy luggage down to reception I found that in the mornings it was often blocked with individual guests using it to go down for breakfast while other guests were left waiting on landings with luggage Second gripe breakfast Breakfast was included in the deal I got for our stay so this gripe is NOT personal and to be honest we decided beforehand to have breakfast each day on our way to whatever attraction we had planned most in London open at 10 00 The hotel breakfast is a continental one and this is advertised as such the dining area is small and there is an obvious rush hour at peak times so I would be very annoyed if I actually had to pay for it I would go down between 07 30 and 08 00 and just take an orange juice and coffee to the bar to read the news online many times there were people complaining about the wait to get tables or the lack of food when they got there When in London you are never far away from a proper English breakfast for a very reasonable price Location was what sold this hotel to me , Fantastic location 5 out of 5 so close by foot or by public transport to many London attractions Across the road from Hyde Park 30 min walk nice relaxed pace to Oxford Street or Harrods 30 min walk at a slightly faster pace to Madame Tussauds Bus to London Zoo right outside the door Tube and bus station Lancaster Gate across the road Rooms are in need of refurbishing for sure but the beds were comfortable and the bath towels were so big and fluffy I have had worse in some 5 star hotels The outdoor terrace is beautiful really nice and sunny The bar is small but well set out big screen TV and a wide choice of drinks The staff were for the most part very polite and helpful it can get a bit manic around 10 00 11 00 when load of people are trying to check out at the same time and also around 15 00 with check ins We stayed for three nights so I witnessed this on arrival and on leaving but that is to be expected Otherwise the staff were excellent providing help with directions maps tips and tricks and they are very accommodating for holding baggage for arriving before the room is ready guests and those who have checked out but want a last minute shopping spree without dragging large suitcases with them 
364542,London Elizabeth Hotel, The elevator is tiny max two people or one with a piece of luggage So for a family with three bags they will need to do it on 3 4 rounds The cleanliness of the room was not up to my expectations They don t refill shampoos and toiletries when used There is no don t disturb sign to post on your door The breakfast is very poor On some corn flakes and coffee , Very good location just a stone away from nice scenery
364543,London Elizabeth Hotel, The room was very out dated Shower barely worked Room just about fitted the double bed in it Could have got the same in a B B Bed for one night at budget price for gig at Hyde Park Anything more and there would have been a complaint for sure , Location is excellent for Hyde Park and Oxford Street 
364544,London Elizabeth Hotel, Everything was perfect Basic continental breakfast only , Booked a suite and what an intro to old english grandeur Seperate bed area lounge area and outdoor area Location is great for London Everything close by trains buses underground parks shopping hop on bus stops outside Staff Maria and Norberto were excellent hosts Loved it everything worked well but don t expect ultra modern facilities 
364545,London Elizabeth Hotel, The breakfast was pretty poor hard bread and very little choice Complimentary tea and coffee was minimum 3 of us in the room with only 2 Breakfast Teas and 2 milks and one packet of biscuits trivial point I know, The location was ideal pretty central for everywhere Hotel was clean though our room was a bit dated
364546,London Elizabeth Hotel, Poor staff relations at reception and at breakfast Room dull dated floor not level particularly in bathroom Complimentary tea coffee making items not adequate nor replaced on second day Breakfast very basic eg basket of cold toast fresh fruit wrinkled and some showing rot Tea in a large thermos tasted of coffee Overall no value for money Sentiment shared by many guests We were very disappointed with our choice of this property for our last two nights of a wonderful 46 day UK holiday , Location to Paddington Railway Station Hyde Park
364547,London Elizabeth Hotel,No Negative, Even if the Lancaste Underground Station just nearby the hotel is in reparation the hotel is near the Paddington Train Station and the Undergroung so it is very easy to go everywhere in London from the Paddington Station The hotel is just beside the nice Hyde Parck and for whom love to walk it is easy to walk to many attractions in London Central And the hotel is excellent old fashion with and atmosphere but really practical 
364548,London Elizabeth Hotel, They did not inform about a major renovation of the roads just outside of the hotel with a number of heavy machines starting unnecessary early their work and making it impossible to sleep any longer and certainly difficult to work from the room during daytime On top of this they did not inform that the TUBE station Lancaster gate very close to the hotel and the main reason for me to choose the hotel was closed for renovation and had been since January Booking com and the hotel could easily have informed of these important facts and thereby avoided dissatiesfied customers Trust in the booking com service build up over years of positive use is easily eroded in such instances I asked for a rebate but was denied they did change my room to the back side though I asked for them to cancel and refund the second of two nights but was denied this as well , Ok atmosphere inside and helpful staff
364549,London Elizabeth Hotel, Extremely uncaring and conceited staff apart from one girl The receptionist meeting us kept measuring us up and we didn t feel welcome at all Once we d entered the hotel corridors we realized they ve put all their money into the lobby The hotel corridors where extremely narrow the lift only fitted one normal size person and one suitcase or two normal sized people The further we went into the hotel the shabbier it got A damp smell of mold caused headaches and it wasn t exactly inviting to a good night sleep Some paint might have covered up some of the worst parts but again they d probably just repaint the lobby instead though I doubt it would cover up dodgy and badly kept corridors floors and walls We ve booked a room with one double bed and a single bed family of 3 but received a room with two single beds and an extra bed We decided to stay after all as we where very tired In the middle of the night we were woken up by a dripping sound and saw water coming down from the ceiling This would explain the very bumpy and uneven floor I suspect the bathroom above us had a leak and probably not for the first time My husband but a bin under it and rushed down to the reception to let them know it was a leak and all they did was to hand him the key to the room next door No assistance in getting us there no rushing to fix the room and no staff coming to ask if we were installed alright in the new room Even worse the snotty receptionist didn t mention this when checking out no apology or even acknowledgment when we told her that we would check out from a different room than the one we checked out from and we told her kindly why Oh OK was all we got The breakfast is a different story Simple continental breakfast with more cakes than food bad coffee and the self service bar was put in a narrow hallway not big enough for two to serve themselves at the time DO NOT GET FOOLED BY THE PICTURES , The location right next to Hyde Park was good Also the lobby reception area was pretty I did appreciate one friendly face which seemed to be the odd one out among the staff 
364550,London Elizabeth Hotel, Continental breakfast poor local tube not working shame as was using as a base not hotels fault I know but wish had known about it pleasant but not outstanding have some nice pictures of rooms on their site shame wasn t in one ok for stop over some good restaurants nearby,No Positive
364551,London Elizabeth Hotel, The interior is a bit run down cracked bathroom tiles very old and worn carpets scratched woodwork but functional The room was crammed with furniture so I could hardly move but that is common in central London , The hotel is in a great central location on the edge of Hyde Park Very friendly staff 
364552,London Elizabeth Hotel, The interiors were a little old but staff were so friendly and the food very tasty from, The staff were very kind and tried hard to help also they had home made cookies to help yourself
364553,London Elizabeth Hotel, The ceiling fan didn t work so the room was quite hot at times the receptionist didn t seem that bothered when I mentioned this to her Some of the breakfast pastries didn t seem very fresh Very small lift , The room was small and dated but it had everything we needed and was nice and clean so was a comfortable stay There was an acceptable range of choices for breakfast Strong free Wifi connection 
364554,London Elizabeth Hotel, The bath tub was deeper than customary in USA It did not have grab bars or or anything else to hang on to when getting on or out for showering , Well staffed all helpful
364555,London Elizabeth Hotel, 4 Maybe 20 years ago It was verry cold in the room I think colder than outside Breakfast A good joke Maybe ok for 1 , The only good thing was location Friendly staff especially waiters 
364556,London Elizabeth Hotel, Wifi was very slow both in room and reception BREAKFAST WAS A JOKE No variety at all no charcuterie at all lowest quality croissants to laugh at Hotel promots a la carte breakfast although regular included which was poor also Staff not always very polite There is an allegedly persian restaurant in the same place didn t dare it because of the breakfast frustration , Excellent location though Lancaster Gate station currently not in service clean hotel spacy room Renovation needed but it s ok 
364557,London Elizabeth Hotel, Due to the age of the building the sound insulation was appalling and we were woken by an adjacent room s occupant s alarm clock at a ridiculous hour , Location excellent
364558,London Elizabeth Hotel, Apart from the bathroom I personally like this quaint little room My husband did not because it was too dark It had a sofa that needed a good clean or new covers but otherwise it was fine Reception staff were under pressure and we had to wait to book in even though our room was ready Others who arrived were not so lucky , I understand this is an old property but the bath and taps in room 007 were seriously outdated I personally would not use the bath but I was only staying one night so not a problem this time The plumbing still needs some attention 
364559,London Elizabeth Hotel, The tube station opposite the hotel was closed for renovation Not a big issue since there were excellent buses just outside the hotell instead , Very nice suite with a wiev of Hyde Park Very close to bus station Easy to get to and from the hotel The room was extremely big and nicely furnitured Excellent bathroom and all the books were a cool feature 
364560,London Elizabeth Hotel, Rooms were very noisy we could loudly hear the traffic outside our neighbors and when someone was walking upstairs The first family room we had 340 was very run down the next room we got 339 was slightly better but still very dated The shower barely worked in our first room The carpets were dirty The outside of the hotel as well as the reception looks very nice But once inside the corridors and the rooms everything is very run downed and dated This hotel is in dire need of a complete makeover I guess this is a very typical Victorian London Hotel , Clean sheets good location and good price 
364561,London Elizabeth Hotel, The wifi was very slow and the hotel furnishings fixtures etc was quite old and a bit shabby Also the window in my room was letting in a bit of a draft and the heat didn t work one night of my stay but they did apologize for this Admittedly I should have reported it as soon as I realized it instead I kept waiting and waiting for it to kick on and it didn t and I just went to sleep The continental breakfast wasn t stellar I ended up just eating a bowl of cereal both mornings but this is par for the course Warning you have to leave your room key when you leave the hotel and when I came back one afternoon I accidentally asked for the wrong room key I was room 335 and I asked for 333 by mistake It was given to me no questions asked no form of ID or checks whatsoever were required to get the room key and I could ve gone into that wrong room and stolen something I realized quite quickly BEFORE going into the wrong room that I didn t have my own key and got the right one but it made me very uncomfortable to think that someone could have done the same thing to my room and stolen my things , The location was amazing right on Hyde Park and just a few minute s walk from Paddington Station Also the staff were incredibly nice and everything was clean The room was quite affordable only about 100 night for such a good location 
364562,London Elizabeth Hotel, Untrained staff water leak from room above into our room Felt as if owner just wanted to make money out of asset without thinking about providing service, Location
364563,London Elizabeth Hotel, If the room had been for 2 people it would have been very squashed , The continental breakfast had a good range of foods available Although the room was small it was very comfortable Staff were extremely polite and friendly Thank you
364564,London Elizabeth Hotel, Continental breakfast was poor The lift is a bit small two people but how they fix that is not obvious , Great location but be warned that Lancaster Gate tube station is out of action from Jan Aug 17 Friendly staff 
364565,London Elizabeth Hotel, Double bed was not a double bed It was a 4ft room floor was slopping Room very small Shower either very very hot or not very warm at all , Good breakfast Good location although no information provided by Booking com or Hotel to say that nearby tube station was closed for 6 months very annoying 
364566,London Elizabeth Hotel, The room desperately needs redecoration The station at Lancaster Gate is closed until July Breakfast totally unimaginative Although advertised in the smokers united site as a hotel with available smoking rooms the staff insisted that all their rooms are non smoking , Looks great from the outside right next to the tube spacious room 
364567,London Elizabeth Hotel, Rooms could be cleaner esp the bathroom with cracked basin and black round the tiles in the shower Curtains sagged from rail and everything was extremely tatty ,No Positive
364568,London Elizabeth Hotel, After upgrading the breakfast did not expect to pay a service charge What was the service charge for Already paid for the service you would have thought when booking hot water only just warm radiator in room didn t work did not fix it when told but put a small heater fan in room , Bed really comfy friendly staff
364569,London Elizabeth Hotel, No hot water for morning shower 3 days in a row No wifi for 3 days and nights Booked a double bed and got a room with three single beds When I spoke to manager said that they were fully booked and that was all they could give me I asked for a refund but they refused to give me one Tube station 100 yards away is being repaited until July 2016 ,No Positive
364570,London Elizabeth Hotel, Bathroom tiles standard of finish could benefit from some attention Continental breakfast selection very limited , Although dated in it s decoration my room was spotlessly clean with crisp white bed linen large fluffy towels in bathroom 
364571,London Elizabeth Hotel, Carpets a little tired not a huge choice at breakfast Very nice bread and of course given location marmelade but no jam Cheese but no ham Porridge was cold A cooked breakfast was available for extra 10 Some refurbishment and a more extensive breakfast selection included in the room price and this would be pretty perfect , Staff friendly easy to get to 5min walk from Paddington bus stop outside entrance Be careful as nearest tube station is currently closed so you need to go via Paddington Lovely placement for Hyde Park Fountain Room with character Victorian mouldings and sash and case windows Modern spotless bathroom Paid 105 B B which was great value for the super room first floor with small balcony Anthony night desk moved heaven and earth to charge my smart phone Staff at breakfast prepared another visitor s gluten free porridge for him Thanks everyone especially Anthony 
364572,London Elizabeth Hotel, Everything else was from bad to strictly ok Breakfast was pathetic stale and wrongly described Staff was largely mid leading Some might have been trying to be helpful but completely contrasting information by others Booking com s lowest score for a review is 2 5 which is highly misleading , The location 
364573,London Elizabeth Hotel, Very Small room Small bed Some lights didn t work Freezing room as the heating didn t work Drafty windows Cold Shower which needs re tiling The corridors are narrow noisy guests banging doors all night Breakfast OK if you like cheese Bar very dark no atmosphere Flat beer and expensive We had a wonderful view of the rear car park Spoilt my trip completely , Nothing
364574,London Elizabeth Hotel, The hotel is quite old style hot water system had an issue for 1 day the breakfast continental is not including a large variety of food it is pretty basic indeed , Very kind personnel excellent location spacious room twin deluxe 
364575,London Elizabeth Hotel, No hot water for the duration of my stay and no form of compensation offered Although the staff were friendly it didn t make up for a freezing shower in the morning The internet provided was horrendously slow and pointless even trying to connect , Very good location from the nearest Underground station and main station Paddington only a 5 minute walk away 
364576,London Elizabeth Hotel, Hotel was dated and didn t look like photos especially bedrooms which were small dirty and in need of some repair , Breakfast was good and staff attentive and helpful 
364577,London Elizabeth Hotel, Everything else Staff very unfriendly and not welcoming Furniture old and damaged Toilet in room did not flush hair in showerhead old and dirty carpet in the room , Location was perfect
364578,London Elizabeth Hotel, The room was very tired with facilities jammed in together that clearly weren t all meant to be together, Location was handy for several things feel of the place was nice downstairs
364579,London Elizabeth Hotel, Breakfast poor compared with previous visits No menus no descriptions Car parking charge has more than doubled in four years , Great position for access to the west end and the parks Staff pleasant and helpful 
364580,London Elizabeth Hotel, My room and shower room needs I refurbishment, Staff were eficient caring and very well turned out So called continental breakfast lncluded cheese and hard boiled eggs Room service was prompt and polite 
364581,London Elizabeth Hotel, elevator very narrow and inconvenient small voices from the floor very old building iteruppted WIFI not nice breakfast no hot water available all time old keys should be dropped to reception the building is overall very old and need expansion with mentainance, only location to Hyde park
364582,London Elizabeth Hotel, Hotel overall temperature is far too uncomfortably hot Continental breakfast is very basic and limited Lift is too small , Location location location good bus service outside the front door tube station 50 m away central line Paddington Train Station is 850 m away 
364583,London Elizabeth Hotel, Furniture tatty no heating in bathroom hot water only look warm Cups for Tea and Coffee in the room dirty Staff arguing with each other at the front desk, Great location room a nice size
364584,London Elizabeth Hotel, The continental breakfast is quite poor althoug the staff is very attentive the choice for breakfast is not big unless you count cake and tarts as breakfast too The bar on the ground floor looks more like a provisional solution and the choice of drinks is quite small some more comfortable sofas would change already the whole ambience The water pressure in the shower on the 4th floor is quite weak , The hotel location is great near beautiful Hyde Park and only a few steps away from the next tube station Besides that there are several bus stops right in front of the hotel The room was spacious and bright the beds very comfy not to soft and not to hard The bathroom was on the bigger side Generally the rooms are clean though some soft renovation would make the whole package very nice The staff is very friendly and helpful 
364585,London Elizabeth Hotel, An unloved hotel Full of character but needs some investment and TLC Elegant reception is not matched by the mediocre rooms Such a waste of potential , Great location and friendly staff 
364586,London Elizabeth Hotel, The room was noisy from an extractor fan or something This went on nearly throughout the night The bathroom was poor with a lot of broken tiles and a huge crack through the incredibly small bath Breakfast simply didn t bother with this on the second morning as it was really limited , Location was great Right opposite a tube station 
364587,London Elizabeth Hotel, Room next to the lift was not ideal but not a major problem , The staff were very helpful which always makes a good impression Continental breakfast was fine Late opening restaurant was useful and meal fine 
364588,London Elizabeth Hotel, Having booked and paid in advance for a deluxe double we were put in a shabby basement room which looked like a 1970 s guest house Stressed and unhelpful reception staff were not prepared able to give us another room and blamed booking com for getting the reservation wrong In our experience this is definitely NOT A 4star hotel ,No Positive
364589,London Elizabeth Hotel, Hotel was dirty and very poorly maintained The staff were rude and the reception was not aware of the details of our booking Nobody helped us with our luggage or offered to at any point Both breakfast and dinner were poor at best We had taken an offer for 20 person for dinner they offered us their ala cart dinner which was advertised at 15 person at the hotel Needless to say I felt cheated Definitely not staying there again , The location
364590,London Elizabeth Hotel, The receptionist was not at all welcoming We were not introduced to the breakfast system simply shown to our seats and left to watch and learn from everyone else Toast was not offered we had to ask and wait quite a while for it to be delivered to our table The room was cold I would have expected the heating to have been on at the end of October, Nothing stands out 
364591,London Elizabeth Hotel, Two single beds were very narrow Smallest elevator in the world 1 person or two suitcases Continental breakfast adaquate no meats, Friendly staff decent size room for two people Large bathroom 
364592,London Elizabeth Hotel, No help with baggage an elevator which is slow used by staff and guests alike and only hods 2 passengers or one with much baggage The bathrooms are tired need paint grout and handles to hold too when getting in or out of deep tubs to have a shower The price differential on the rooms over a 4 day stay was huge , We like the location easy walk to the tube bus stop outside the door and an easy walk to Hyde Park WE have stayed often and enjoyed its funkiness now some of that has been lost with new owners However the staff were pleasant within limits The Iranian them is good but the food not as good as in Iran
364593,London Elizabeth Hotel, The hotel needs shutting and refurbished is in a bad state we were moved rooms when the tiles fell off the wall nearly hitting my wife in the bath Staff were good moved us to the Mayfair suit that was in the same state as the last room , Staff were friendly
364594,London Elizabeth Hotel, small room with very old furniture poor bathroom facility and old only one and very small elevator for 2 persons or one person with one medium luggage scary stairs , I like the location Average breakfast 
364595,London Elizabeth Hotel, There was no effective way to cool the room Just a useless noisy overhead fan that merely pushed warm air around the room The entire hotel is very tired and it feels unclean due to everything being so old and worn out, Convenient location for the function I was attending
364596,London Elizabeth Hotel, Bed not great and shower difficult to use The shower head was in a fixed position and you had to be a contortionist to get wet Sloping floor a bit disconcerting , Very handy location friendly helpful staff Value for money 
364597,London Elizabeth Hotel, Traffic noise in bedroom , Good breakfast great location at the Italian gardens entrance to Hyde park and easy walk from Paddington Terrace garden at rear Very friendly staff 
364598,London Elizabeth Hotel, Don t take room G19 really noisy outside There are lots of buses bikes going near the window all the night plus drunk people speaking loudly No chance to sleep Breakfast included porridge cheese eggs cruasans musli cucumbers and tomatoes that s all , Complimentary drink with very good pistacio cookies was available Rooms were good and comfortable Location across the road from Hyde Park 
364599,London Elizabeth Hotel, The atmosphere of the hotel has changed and lost its charm, Location and Rose Garden bar Breakfast was better 2 years ago All hotel needs a bit of a spruce up
364600,London Elizabeth Hotel, very tired hotel well loved and clean the staff made our visit and they are the engine that powers this ship , The staff were helpful and fairly attentive very busy the food was good although fairly standard overall pretty good not 4 though
364601,London Elizabeth Hotel, no working air conditioner maids had trouble having just a top sheet on bed without the big duvets needs more variety at breakfast shower screen comes only halfway down tub, upgrade to a suite great tube and bus location friendly staff decor outside garden on upper floor
364602,London Elizabeth Hotel, The hotel is in a very bad shape Very old rusted cracks etc this is noticeable from the entrance reception and up to the room , Location is good very close to Lancaster Gate metro station and Hyde Park The bed was ok and confortable 
364603,London Elizabeth Hotel, Very jaded accommodation needs updating carpets needed cleaning hot water was variable in the shower bathrooms need updating too cracked tiles and dated accessories, Location was good
364604,London Elizabeth Hotel, I ve never been so desperate to write a hotel review until after the stay at this hotel The room we were given is on basement level facing the busy street It s so noisy and we can t even sleep after midnight The bathroom seems a million years old and there are cracks on the tile There s basically no ventilation as if you open the window it will be even more noisy and will probably be the same as living on the street There s roof fan but you will not want to use it unless you want to increase the noisy level Choosing this hotel is definitely the worst choice that I ve made since Day 1 when I started using Booking com There s basically nothing to eat at breakfast Should ve stayed in a chain hotel as it won t go very wrong Absolutely hated it ,No Positive
364605,London Elizabeth Hotel, The lift could have been bigger The hairdryer is very outdated and it is most unusual to have it in the bathroom which also needs modernising , It was nice to have toast cooked to order at breakfast There was a good choice of tea in the room which was very warm but there was too much traffic noise to have the windows open 
364606,London Elizabeth Hotel, Some staff not so polite but most nice Very tiny lift but expected in small old style hotel , Small and charming old style hotel with nice breakfast and good location Generous size room 
364607,London Elizabeth Hotel, The food was pretty poor we did not even eat hardly any of it The food did not look appealing The bathroom tiles were cracked and dirty , Nice bed and comfy and location very near tube 
364608,London Elizabeth Hotel, For the amount I paid I expected a room much bigger than the one I got It could have been a bit neater too cracks on the wall etc The bathroom was also extremely small Advertising needs to be clearer next time so that the customer knows exactly what they are getting , Great location looks really good from the outside Good choice of teas and biscuits in the room and liked the hair dryer in the bathroom
364609,London Elizabeth Hotel, Room far too small and breakfast very poor Bananas were soft and poor quality of food Lift could only fit one person at a time Too expensive for what u get, Location not bad 
364610,London Elizabeth Hotel, Tiny lift which in fairness will be difficult to address This did not take anything away from our stay , This was a revisit to this hotel and it did not disappoint There has been some redecorating in keeping with the English hotel which they are maintaining so will be interesting to see what is next So will definitely stay again 
364611,London Elizabeth Hotel, Very tired decor Tiny lift so if you were at the top of the hotel as I was the lift was always full when it arrived After waiting 20 minutes for an empty lift to no avail I hauled a heavy suitcase down 4 flights of stairs in order to check out This wasn t ideal , Friendly staff who were very accommodating Hotel has curb appeal and in a good location 
364612,London Elizabeth Hotel, Whilst there are a few signs of wear and tear in the fabric of the building they did not detract from our enjoyment of the hotel , The friendliness politeness and helpfulness of all the staff we came across was excellent We were upgraded on arrival which was most welcome The provision of parking at the rear of the hotel was very useful 
364613,London Elizabeth Hotel, A bit shabby all the doors chipped And the lift is tiny and very slow indeed , Lovely helpful staff welcoming macaroons nice lobby great location
364614,London Elizabeth Hotel, Breakfast included should be full English and not a optional extra, location and in family room had a single bed and not a pull out bed as in most hotels Tube location very good 
364615,London Elizabeth Hotel, We booked on special offer and were disappointed not to be told beforehand that our room was in need of refurbishment and walls on that floor patched ready for redecoration , Friendly staff clean comfy bed
364616,London Elizabeth Hotel, Nothing, Excellent location If you want quirky and good old fashion service this is for you Great night sleep Lovely breakfast I require a gluten free diet and this hotel is bang on no need to take your own bread they have it for you That gets a gold star from me 
364617,London Elizabeth Hotel, Top floor room and lift slow and small Room compact and little dated Shower lacking any oomph General decor could be improved in room and common areas Crisps in room mini bar were from a multi pack and priced at 2 50, Wi Fi OK 
364618,London Elizabeth Hotel, I got an email to up grade a few days before I arrived so I did thinking we would be getting a great deal Sadly the luxury upgrade promised did not happen Shabby tired decore with torn fabric chairs Continental breakfast a joke Won t stay again and will be dubious of emails promising luxury upgrades from booking com , Nothing
364619,London Elizabeth Hotel, Unfortunately the fact that it s a beautiful listed building means its elevator is tiny so two trips for two people with suitcases are inevitable with a bit of a wait between them We didn t like the breakfast we weren t asked by the waitress what we d like to order so we just helped ourselves to the basic breakfast not a very varied selection You get charged 10 GBP on arrival just in case you use the mini bar I was surprised I was told on check out I d get the money back in a few weeks , We liked the historic listed building the hotel is in It s convenient that it has a Persian restaurant inside The staff in general was quite helpful with several issues Our heating failed on the first night so when they gave us an electric heater the next day it saved us The toilet also broke and the repairman was nice and quick in fixing the flush tap The gentleman from the reception was nice to hail us a cab on departure as we were in a hurry The location is very nice and just across the street from a metro stop and an entry to Hyde Park and around the corner from a convenience store and pretty old pub The Swan 
364620,London Elizabeth Hotel, This is not a 4 star hotel The breakfeast was the poorest one I ever saw From the begining we missed a towel the showercape box was empty The shower was claustrofobical litle No shelf for the showergel bottles , Very good geografically situated with buses and subway in front of the building 
364621,London Elizabeth Hotel, Bath bath taps were in need of replacement No mirror apart from in the bathroom The lift only held two people Their luggage needed a separate trip Continental breakfast was uninspiring , Very comfortable bed The staff were all very helpful Lovely warm hotel 
364622,London Elizabeth Hotel, The ensuite was the size of a broom cupboard and freezing Only a shower which was dated Our room backed onto the lift so sleep was not peaceful We had to move the beds apart to get a twin for my mother and myself and then could barely get out the door The room was tired and dated Paint off the walls and cracks, The location was excellent as two minutes from Lancaster Gate tube Great for returning after a night at the theatre The concierge was knowledgeable and polite 
364623,London Elizabeth Hotel, Broken tiles on the bathroom floor the hotel had placed rubber bath mats over them and the lack of hot water on the last morning although the receptionist did say the boiler had broken down Having said that we could only shower using ONLY the hot water tap , Location and staff
364624,London Elizabeth Hotel, The breakfasts were not as good as our previous stays at the hotel On our second morning there was no Weetabix available The manner and demeanour of the waitress was not very pleasant , The staff at reception were very pleasant and helpful One of the waiters in the restaurant who had been there on our previous visit was very friendly and advised us on our choice of dinner
364625,London Elizabeth Hotel, Sadly the shower put forth a tepid dribble literally insufficient for a functioning shower Discovered too late in the morning to do anything about it And the smell of the still tacky paint was less than perfect , Excellent friendly staff

364627,London Elizabeth Hotel, We payed for a Suite accomodation which was very expensive we expected a cosy spacious place to stay with our baby What we ve got was an old and totally worn out place to stay furniture and seats were dirty mold smell chilly and cold everytime when we came into the room there was only heating with a small electrical heater central heating did not work in the bathroom so no heating last day even no hot water for shower or bath room service was horrible eg asking lukewarm wholemilk for the baby they forgot about it or it was too hot Some of staff were friendly mostly not Reception in 4 days we saw 4 different people only 1 was friendly Full continental breakfast was only 1 hard boiled egg and jam service horrible get your coffee yourself , Location nearby Hide Park

364633,London Elizabeth Hotel, The website said that the room would have a bathtub When we arrived to the hotel we discovered that it was not so , Closeness to Hyde Park and Marble Arch The British style Afternoon tea with Prosecco at the hotel
364634,London Elizabeth Hotel, Lift is tiny Buggy didn t fit inside and not more than two people fit in lift so when having luggage need to go up and down multiple times Room was far too small especially with cot No space to move or even to walk around Horrible Worst choice for breakfast I have ever had Extremely minimal Ended up having bread and butter for breakfast everyday due to a very poor selection , Location was excellent and staff were overall friendly Pretty hotel with nice common areas and clean
