218169,Hotel Montaigne, Lack of services expected in 5 star rated hotels such as 24 7 room service a wider range of breakfast options and lastly and most importantly hospitable and informative staff Informative staff For example Tour de France was taking place one of the days and all roads in central Paris were shut detours he reception never mentioned this to us basically walking back to hotel and getting access back to street where hotel is They also don t know much recommendations specifically when asked about what s new in restos bars etc , Great location and cosy rooms nice layout design 
218170,Hotel Montaigne, Paying Paris tour de France prices , Beds v comfortable No noise heard from street Quiet area for such a close hotel to champs elysee Perfect for our short trip
218171,Hotel Montaigne, Ac wasn t working I had to sleep with windows open They didn t care to fix it They called me twice to ask me when I was leaving the room for maid to clean when I had the do not disturb sign on and I was sleeping I called at night for extra pillow and never received it , Only location
218172,Hotel Montaigne, Not a 5 star service At best 3 5 no turn down service cleanliness isn t up to par understaffed as a hotel not accessible from the room need to call them hotel reception to get any service , Location location location 
218173,Hotel Montaigne, First time ever in hotel there is no decent shower on hand held shower and cord was so short that you were not able to use that for showering Two times cleaning lady left my hotel room open after cleaning the room No idea how long door was open but was luckily nothing was stolen from the room I have never faced this before and will avoid this hotel , Location of the hotel is excellent and lot of things to do within walking distance Room is clean and bed is confortable 
218174,Hotel Montaigne, 10 for a small coffee when you can get a wine for the same , Very helpful countet staff help us when we having issues with Disneyland tickets we purchased 
218175,Hotel Montaigne, THERE WAS ALWAYS A CONSIDERABLE CIGAR OR CIGARETTE SMELL IN THE LOBBY BECAUSE YOU CAN SOMEKE IN THE TABLES OUTSIDE THE PROBLEM IS THE DOORS ARE KEPT OPEN CONSTANTLY SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE BREAKFAST IN THE RESTAURANT YOU FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE SMOKING NEXT TO YOU THEY SHOULD NOT ALLOW SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS ,No Positive
218176,Hotel Montaigne, See above Wrong box Sorry, The breakfast had luttle choice and it ran out of the things that were supposed to be there Like croissants A basic in France one would expect The waiters were reluctant to do anything When I complained at the reception they didnt do much either 
218177,Hotel Montaigne, Too expensive for the type of accommodation and very limited facilities offered Also very limited breakfast options and expensive mini bar items Also beware of the type of room you booked that is the same as the photos , The best thing about this property is its location close to the very expensive and famous shops in Paris The room was elegant and the decorations are great 
218178,Hotel Montaigne, Awful service no soap no toilet paper no service at night for drinks after 12 compounded by charging me extra for items from mini bar which I had paid already,No Positive
218179,Hotel Montaigne, Bathroom without protection for shower causes the whole bathroom to be wet Music from breakfast restaurant woke us up at 7 am , Location excellent and staff very helpful
218180,Hotel Montaigne, Small rooms limited amenities over rated as 5 a bit over priced Many alternatives are there for less price , Great location on the fashion street of Montaigne close to Eiffel tower Champs lys es Avenue etc 
218181,Hotel Montaigne, the breakfast Buffett was very small it s better to call it snack buffett , the staff were very friendly the location of the hotel is perfect 
218182,Hotel Montaigne, Only stayed three nights , Perfect high quality boutique hotel lovely decor and great location within the golden triangle Staff were very helpful and were at pains to make our stay effortless A hotel that will definitely make your stay in Paris memorable 
218183,Hotel Montaigne, The staff had no clue about or didn t find it appropriate to mention what was paid and what wasn t and how much things costed There were 2 wine bottles placed in our room that smaller of them being supposedly complimentary When we were checking out reception had doubt which of the 2 bottles was free The booklet in the room said an iPhone doc would be provided in each room when we asked the reception for it they had no idea what we were talking about We were instead asked to take a UK to EU socket adapter When we got the socket adapter there was no mention of a charge When I went to clear the bills on the last day there were 11 charged for it I asked about it and then I was told that they ll waive it if I return the adapter I had taken the adapter with me to return anyway but a charge being added based on an assumption was shady On the first day there was a glass bottle of still water with 2 glasses in the room We really appreciate that For the first 2 days the bottle was refreshed every day with service but the third day it wasn t and had been removed When my wife called the reception for water they sent a tiny 250ml bottle up with 2 glasses and a bill of 8 I tried to ask the person that we actually wanted the bottle that was supposed to be there and he acted as if the only bottle he had ever seen at the hotel was the one he brought to us Breakfast was included with our room and everyday we would go down to enjoy it at the bar The second day we asked for eggs and we got them no questions asked The fourth day we asked for eggs again and I was handed a bill It was absolutely not clear what would cost you and what wouldn t It seemed like hotel policy or lack of training of staff to not state facts upfront Overall of the hundreds of hotels around the world I ve stayed in Hotel Montaigne was a 3 star hotel at best with the price tag of a 5 star , The staff were really friendly and polite The room was beautiful and the bed was comfortable 
218184,Hotel Montaigne, Door handle not working tap in the bath room not working I have to tighten myself I was given a handicap room where shower room is not enclosed Water splash all over the place Very messy Hotel prvoided a service for manicure at 80 and I asked for it However after the service I was charged 160 without my consent claiming additional service done but without telling me till I checked out I have to argue to get it rejected I feel the hotel has poor service in this area , Lightings Inside the room is pleasant But a little too dark
218185,Hotel Montaigne, There was no shower Literally a bath tub barely big enough for a small adult and a hose It was the worst bathing situation I ve ever had in a hotel and I would rate the bathroom a 0 The toilet even had its own room but the shower didn t Also bad lighting for doing hair and makeup , Big comfy bed and lots of lighting 
218186,Hotel Montaigne, Nothing Everything was great , My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights We arrived on a early morning flight n were at the hotel at 9 30 am and were welcomed with a fantastic junior suite The normal check in time is 2 3pm the staff was extremely gracious kept our room ready for us The location is top notch for people looking to shop All brands r on the same street just a few mins walk away The Eiffel Tower is a 10 min walk The Hotel is small clean and service is very quick The lobby area is more like a lounge with comfortable couches and a cozy fireplace The housekeeping was great They also have a limited room service menu I would recommend the Club sandwich and nothing else really But if ur hungry and it s 2degrees outdoor the food is more than decent We didn t have a coffee machine in our room but we could order coffee as many times a day as we pleased free of charge There are also a few cafe s around the area however these are quite pricy L avenue is a must try remember to reserve before you go For the simpler days we chose to go to a Carrefour express that was a 5 min walk away Fresh yogurt and croissants were available We had a fantastic stay and would definitely come back 
218187,Hotel Montaigne, Breakfastservice guests are not welcome Buffet 9am was empty all very slow not 5 star TV was not working , Good location nice restaurant and service Friendly barkeeper 
218188,Hotel Montaigne, My room number was 25 The shower and the toilet are opened to each other The shower is also opened to the rest of the bathroom without any dividers The drain hole was tight so when I had a quick shower the bathroom flooded and the water almost reached the bedroom I had to use all the towels to stop the water from entering the room Not a smart shower idea Apparently that s how all the bathrooms are , From the moment I stepped foot into the hotel till the moment I left the staff were very welcoming and hospitable The room looks impeccable and quite spacious for a Parisienne room The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is spacious You open the window and have a view of the mini courtyard There are only 5 rooms on the floor I was staying at 2nd floor You feel like you re in a luxury boutique hotel 
218189,Hotel Montaigne, Breakfast offering does not live up to the restaurant quality Service was good but food offering needs improvement , Great restaurant and rooms High Quality Hotel 
218190,Hotel Montaigne, Tv did not work until the last night of my stay Room was not clean dust everywhere Have stayed here many times before but this time the service and facilities not worthy of five star prices Will stay elsewhere next time , Great location
218191,Hotel Montaigne, Room was very small not as advertised Bad value for money This hotel is not worth 500 euros per day The only advantage is location for heavy shoppers Everything else is standard for 3 star hotel ,No Positive
218192,Hotel Montaigne, there was no porridge for breakfast even for a fee , everything was great breakfasts room view staff and restaurant in the hotel is very tasty bedding changed every day beds and pillows very comfy 
218193,Hotel Montaigne,No Negative, The best location for shopping Most designerbrands are in walking distance on the same street of the hotel Also the famouse Champs Elys es is in 5 minutes walk If you stand on Avenue Montaigne you can see the Eiffel Tower The hotel staff are very helpful Although the hotel is not classic french decorations style but it is modern clean and simple The price is very reasonable in this location 
218194,Hotel Montaigne, We could not get the Aircon to drop the room temp to our preferred normal 18C Stuck stubbornly around 23 24 albeit outside temp was 32c on a very hot Paris night Did not say anything as we arrived very late and left very early Perhaps it could have been fixed if our stay had not been so short 7 hours maxi , booked very late 11pm as train journey aborted but night staff charming and could not be more helpful in the circumstances Small boutique modern hotel and very comfortable except air con
218195,Hotel Montaigne, No window or veranda views as expected and the room has strange setting for example the toilet paper positioned where it is easily wet with shower Also strange with closets inside bath room , Location
218196,Hotel Montaigne,No Negative, The location is great this is a main advantage of this hotel We have been guests of this hotel several times already due this reason This time due to our request for the room on the silent side we have been located in very small and dark room When we wanted to open the window all the restaurants smell enter to us In the bathroom we had very noisy wentilator The restaurant recommendation from concierge was a disaster To summary I m not sure if we will back again 
218197,Hotel Montaigne, We needed help to understand the lights and the TV never worked but it was lovely Was the wine left for us complimentary We did not know , Beautiful room and WC 
218198,Hotel Montaigne, 1 I reserved a special parking place by exception in front of the hotel because of my special car Although the morning of my arrival this place was confirmed at arrival there was no place Reason the cars of staff members and the chef are parked in front of the hotel In my understanding they should park their cars somewhere else and create parking space and also leave a proper space for arriving and departing guests to park their cars for a moment properly in this narrow street This has to do with a certain service level 2 No luggage assistance at departure 3 No five star service in the room changing towels at the end of the day opening the beds preparing the room for the night ,No Positive
218199,Hotel Montaigne, This is the first time something is misplaced from our room and we are travelling once in two weeks A cashmire sweater was lost from where it was and hotel manager did nothing but insisted it could be at loundry It was not ofcourse as sweaters do not walk and have dry cleaned and come back on their own They did not check any cameras no investigation and offered no compansation They simply stopped answering and communicating So the cost of the stay was 600 euros more to us Stay somewhere else pay more stay safe and cared , Location
218200,Hotel Montaigne, The people in the room across from ours were so loud I could hear everything l phone calls conversations to the extent that I actually had to knock on their door 3 am to shush them Not surprisingly the reception apologized in the morning and informed us that those guestd were asked to Check out the following morning because the reception received several complaints So while this is not the hotel s fault it might be worth noting that within the hotel itself noise can be easily heard , This is the cutest little hotel in Paris On the outside it has a very French feel to it and inside it seems to have been newly renovated The location is convenient and the best thing about it The staff very helpful and friendly 
218201,Hotel Montaigne, The worst hotel I ve ever stayed in I would never stay there again and would never recommend it The people in charge are very very rude The staff are angry Very noisy you can hear everything from your bed even when people are calling the lift Terrible Was a wast of money I ve stayed in 4 star hotels that were amazing in Paris , location
218202,Hotel Montaigne, The Staff is unfriendly unhelpful and uncooperative there is no one assisting with luggage when we arrive phone in the room does not work , Location
218203,Hotel Montaigne,No Negative, The professionalism exercised by the staff their helpfulness and pleasant attitude The tokens left after each cleaning along with the bedroom slippers 
218204,Hotel Montaigne, Nothing, This is the first time I wrote about any hotel I could not believe how friendly and helpful the staff are I really enjoyed my stay first of all because the wonderful staff that really I did not see something smmiler before I found full support with a big smile from each member of the staff Also the hotel located on great location and safe area 
218205,Hotel Montaigne, The service was really slow we asked 3 times for an adapter and when it finally came the hotel charged us for it even though we left it there The cups of coffee in the morning are really tiny as well as the quantity of the food It s not at all a meal worth 35euros , Only the location
