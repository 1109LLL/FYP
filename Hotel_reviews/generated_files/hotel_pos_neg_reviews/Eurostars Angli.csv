270039,Eurostars Angli,No Negative, The breakfast was great The bathroom was very small but the whole room was very comfortable The bed was very nice and big We had a standard room Perfect cleaning of room The pool was small We saw it but we didn t use it Close to metro station 
270040,Eurostars Angli, It was a longer journey back into Barcelona on the ferrocavil train to then get a metro to the centre , The architecture and tranquility of the hotel 
270041,Eurostars Angli, The only thing I didn t like was the weak wifi but the receptionist gave me another router which was a veeery good solution for that problem , Everything was nice friendly staff clean rooms quiet place
270042,Eurostars Angli, No free water 1 bottle 3 5Euro Pool was full of garbage i anticipated clean swimming pool but it was not ready even tho in the beggining of June , Good location 11 mins from Calatlunya station Sarria is very quiet and peaceful area I loved it Room was cery cozy and clean Breakfast quality was good 
270043,Eurostars Angli, As it was may few parties events going on in Hotel Communion Boda etc so sometimes quite loud in the room and we could not use the pool as there was always some event going on at the pool , We really liked the modern building in the middle of Barcelonas old rich part Sarria Hotel is few meters away from center of Sarria and from public transportation 
270044,Eurostars Angli, The matrimonial bad was in fact two single bads aside quite difficult not to drop down between then , Our room no 310 had a fabulous view to Sarria district and Tbidabo hill 
270045,Eurostars Angli, The facilities need some refurbishing with some lights and other minor things not working , The location in a quiet neighborhood was very comfortable There are good restaurants nearby such as 5 Pino The old Sarria area is a short walk and has a number of places like El Canalla that have traditional Catalan dishes 
270046,Eurostars Angli, There is no restaurant Only breakfast is served which is Good Quality no doubt but there is no good restaurants nearby for any dinner or lunch Its okay to stay for official work in University or hospital Holidaying there no no , The staff are EXCELLENT 5 stars no doubt 
270047,Eurostars Angli, The conditional Air doesn t work In my room the shower head was not has fixed , The place the build and the staff were perfect for my business travel 
270048,Eurostars Angli, No coffee or tea making facilities no food except breakfast or limited selection of sushi which staff order in for you and or pizza lock on the door broken certainly not worth almost 300 Euros for a two night stay whilst staff were extremely helpful facilities lacking and certainly will not be recommending to anyone a shame because rooms comfortable but add in the intermittent wireless signal and it was very very poor value for money, Comfortable clean modern hotel
270049,Eurostars Angli,No Negative, Hotel was OK not a 4 star I go on holiday 4 times per year and I ve stayed in many 4 star hotels and this was no where near the standard I would expect for 4 star hotel Cleanliness was much to be desired in particular the shower area tiles and base of the unit which requires to be stripped back and redone The only good thing was the area which was in a lovely Spanish village and was only 10 min by underground to the hub of Barcelona
270050,Eurostars Angli, Breakfast too expensive there is not room services, The location is away from the busy Barcelona but very well connected by public transport to the city centre Rooms view and quiet swimming pool
270051,Eurostars Angli, Far from anything if you want a quiet hotel to just relax or for bussiness this will be the right hotell for you Room service was mediocre , Qiiet location Nice staff 
270052,Eurostars Angli, The knowledge of some of the staff was poor for example when we checked in we were given no information about the hotel or the surrounding area Also they had trouble getting us a taxi to the airport as they didn t know which company to use Most were quite helpful and one particular lady went out of her way to help us It s a lovely hotel just very quiet , The rooms were finished to a very nice standard as was the decor throughout the hotel The breakfast was good and most of the staff were friendly The location was quiet but 5 7 mins walk to the train which brought you directly to Barcelona in about 4 stops The other direction brought you to beautiful mountain side towns The pool was very nice too 
270053,Eurostars Angli, The pictures make you believe the pool is huge when in reality is quite small Not easy to get to far from the city center but close to the business area of Barcelona, Had the pool to ourselves Great Breakfast clean and modern Room was spacious and with all the amenities 
270054,Eurostars Angli,No Negative, Breakfast was very nice staff were friendly and helpful The pool could of been cleaner as there was a lot of leaves in it The bedroom was very spacious and well air conditioned Really enjoyed my stay here apart from the fact they didn t have a bar Should really think about opening a proper bar restaurant as there wasn t much options for food and you could only get a beer or a glass of wine at reception 
270055,Eurostars Angli, Swimming pool was a disappointment Not very large and also dirty Unfriendly cleaning staff did not respect Do Not Disturb sign Location not ideal if you want to visit center Barcelona Too far off , Front desk staff was very helpful 
270056,Eurostars Angli, We had an issue with water and had to wait for about an hour to shower one morning not great when you re on a schedule , Great view of Tibidabo Very clean and comfortable room
270057,Eurostars Angli, Cleaning could be a bit more neater outdoor pool is seasonal no bar or restaurant and aircon not very controllable, Comfy beds great design very helpful and friendly staff
270058,Eurostars Angli, It was a little costly for what it was when booking the pool attracted us but looked out of use and had lots of leaves Needless to say we didn t swim The air con in the room wasn t powerful either it meant the room never got cool as we were a sun facing room We didn t have any tea or coffee facilities which was disappointing , The staff were very friendly and the room itself was lovely The location was easy to get to 5mins walk from the Sarria metro and took 10mins to get into the centre via metro Breakfast was good though not included and bed was very comfy 
270059,Eurostars Angli, Poor room service hair of a previous guest in the sink mold and dirt in the sink and in bathroom bedding with holes and put inside out limescale on the shower head which resulted in erratic water flow There was also no toilet brush which led to uncomfortable situations The hotel design is ambitious with emphasis on appearance but not very practical For example the sink has a rectangular shape which requires special care so that no mold and dirt accumulates in it We found dirt and mold there Design of the room doors They are difficult to see find especially for first time visitors which may cause guests trying to open a wrong room s door That could explain why someone tried to get in our room in the night and also the condition of the lock in our room The air conditioning temperature cannot be set from the room You have to ask the reception The elevator once stopped and opened the door in the middle of the floors , Location near metro The receptionists were kind The whole outside wall of the room was made of windows so the room was nicely bright Nice big mirror in the room 
270060,Eurostars Angli, The first room they gave us smelled of cigarette smoke We asked to change and the reception did so unfortunately it also was smokey The third room was fine no smoke smell but two beds and no hairdryer in the room , Very friendly and helpful staff 
270061,Eurostars Angli, The wifi signal is weak on the 3rd floor, Very good choice Convenient location very close to the highway exit 3 mins walk from the bus and train station Very comfortable beds and good room cleaning service
270062,Eurostars Angli, There was no hanger for coats and jackets in the room but it s a minor detail , The furniture is amazing and the glass wall allows a wonderful view on the neighborhood The staff is very friendly and helpful The city center is not so close but there are metro and bus stops nearby 
270063,Eurostars Angli, All was fine , The hotel is modern and efficient The location is perfect for us as we were visiting our daughter who lives nearby However we would recommend it to others as it is in a quiet neighborhood near the Metro The breakfast is great All in all a very good deal 
270064,Eurostars Angli,No Negative, The hotel is very modern great rooms with comfortable beds the wifi was very effective fast and very reasonable price and only a E10 ride to the Ramblas Only minor minus was not being able to cool the room sufficiently 
270065,Eurostars Angli, No air con Rooms get very hot Also a lot of heat come from the lighting in the room Reception told us the air con gets turned off out of session We heard another 5 people complain , Love comfortable rooms very clean and tidy 
270066,Eurostars Angli, It s quite far away from most of the cities main attractions public transportation stops are somewhat close though , The room was clean and bright with a full wall window and a nice view it was also decorated really nicely The layout of the room was also impressive and unique Staff was very friendly helpful and available services were good 
270067,Eurostars Angli,No Negative, I had a nice time at the hotel The environment was clean the staff were very welcoming and the breakfast was good The hotel is pretty close to the Center by metro and just about 5 mins walking distance to a metro station They could help place your order for dinner this is cool 
270068,Eurostars Angli, Our shower was a bit of a nightmare Floor would end up soaked everywhere and even ran into the sink area Some may find this an issue but the hotel a 12 minute train journey away from the centre of Barcelona This didn t bother us at all as it allowed us to check out other parts of the city We even walked to camp Nou 30 minute walk , Room was lovely Wifi worked great even though we were on the 3rd floor Room www very bright and loved the unusual bathroom set up 
270069,Eurostars Angli, We could only use the pool till 18 00 We would have prefered until 20 00 considering the beach Is very far 1 h with the bus One day We wanted to use it in the morning they were cleaning it , The room Is very big And very Nice d coration very good quality for the price We had a sp cial attention chocolat s on the bed upon arrival very Nice view also on the hills
270070,Eurostars Angli,No Negative, Staff were excellent We were up graded to a lovely room after we were allocated a room that didn t have the right bed Quiet location Would recommend to all 
270071,Eurostars Angli, We had to pay for parking when the parking was of the hotel, Design of the hotel was really nice Also the private parking was connected directly with the hotel 
270072,Eurostars Angli, WiFi very slow and intermittent The shower s glass side door in the tub didn t close fully flooding the bathroom and making it dangerously wet Shower head fancy but defective and so no pressure Aircon fan made a rattling noise Room service food quality was terrible Dusty in places Mini bar list not same as contents It takes more than interior design to be a boutique hotel , Good views mostly clean decent sized room 
270073,Eurostars Angli, Being kms from anywhere so you have have use their facilities bar 7euro glass of beer food over priced, Staff and breakfast and shute bus was great would have cost a fortune into rome centre and back every day 
270074,Eurostars Angli, The time to pool closed , We asked to change rooms for one double bed instead of two single pushed together and they did it right away
