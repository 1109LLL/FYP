214716,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Mosquitos in the room, I only stayed one night at this location Staff were friendly at check in and out the room was clean The hotel is close to a busy street and that can be noisy at night 
214717,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Some common areas could do with a bit of a facelift The only bad point was that the manager confirmed by email that we would have a taxi reserved for our departure at 7 30am but the desk said there was no reservation They managed to get us one within about 20 minutes but it was a worry because we needed every minute of the three hours we had at CDG airport , We had room 706 with excellent views and it was a double room with a connecting door for privacy for our adult son 
214718,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Just soulless and no one gave a damn, We could have been dead for all they cared no hair shampoo or conditioner no body moisturiser no water in the room tea facility was there but the milk was never replenished Asked for it and it never came
214719,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre,No Negative, welcoming staff Clean comfortable bedroom spotless bathroom Love access to the roof terrace to enjoy a magnificent panoramic view of Paris Breakfast offer a large variety savoury and sweet hot and cold great choice of teas Special mention to the reception very professional with a genuine smile and will to help Will definitely recommend
214720,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Let people know that the hotel is located 200yards from the red light district Being care full as their are many pick pocketers located around 9 10 arr, The female reception staff was amazing she knew her stuff about the local area Room we stayed in was 612
214721,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Overall excellent A few small niggles the d cor in my room was very pink There was a bath but no shower except that extension thing for your hair I didn t like the squeezy soap shampoo dispensers little bottles would look less institutional especially considering this is a 4 hotel In any case since there is no shower the placement of said squeezy bottle should be closer to the bath otherwise its all rather awkward The wifi speed was ok but not as fast as we ve come to expect in modern hotels problem existed both on my IPAD and with my laptop I stress though that these are very small niggles I d happily return to this hotel and would thoroughly recommend it , The hotel was in a fantastic location the staff were incredibly pleasant and helpful The most impressive aspect of the hotel though was the terrace on the 9th floor Take a half bottle of wine up there from the hotel bar and be thrilled by what has to be some of the best views of Paris around Sacre Coeur Eiffel Tower Notre Dame c c are all within sight 
214722,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, This is a 2 stars hotel at its best Room is very small the elevator barely fits 2 people unstable wifi they tried to charged us for breakfast that we did not have also they pre authorized 10 Euro that i still didnt get it back , Location only Close to pigalle metro station

214726,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, The rooms are below my expectations especially having just left a very nice hotel in London with same rating to compare though reasonably clean the rooms needed refurbishment as outdated especially the bathroom desperately in need of upgrading on a positive note the staff I spoke to were very helpful and speak good English which helped a lot with my queries , it s near to everything easy access to transport shops nearby and a very good pub called rendezvous des artists for excellent meals good view of the city on roof terrace

214731,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, no 4 star hotel at all breakfast like a 2 star hotel the tables were not cleaned when we came to the breakfast at 9 15 staff is waiting until 9 30 to clean everything together , the location is good near tube and Moulin Rouge Montmartre view from the room to the Montmartre 15 min fast walk to the Opera Terrace on the 9th floor
214732,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Wifi was really poor but expected that based on other reviews The room was a bit run down Shower was very noisy If you left the windows open which we did there was was a fair bit of noise through the night from the streets , Decent sized room for Paris Good location Decent options for breakfast

214736,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, We got a super small room Barely fits luggage next to bed I think other rooms are little more spacious but ours was very tight , Location is great Terrace view is great bonus 
214737,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, couldn t get up to the rooftop bar either on the Friday or Saturday night, easy to find well located but quiet close to Rue des Martyrs with nice cafes for breakfast
214738,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, the room was depressing 2 singles pushed together to make a double view of brick walls the smell of cooking fat reeking through from the kitchens outside average staff had to pay extra for breakfast design of room was terrible wifi did not work haggard carpets in the hotel really cheap feel to the place door room numbers printed off paper and sellotape to doors its a 1 star hotel than somehow has 4, roof terrace had great views

214740,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Luggage cannot be left in the hotel before check in and after check out but this has to do with the Vigipirate plan , Very helpfull staff day and night quality of breakfast coffee tea facilities in the room roof terrace with a splendid view over Paris value for money compared to other hotels in Paris in the same price category 
214741,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, The hotel was rather old The bed was small and hard and after a few hours Ants where crawling in the empty cola glass on the nightstand In december Breakfast ended at 09 30 and was very basic Not worthy, The location of the Hotel very close to Place Pigal was perfect Near Gare du Nord and Metro a perfect base for visiting the city The view on the roof top is magnificant

214744,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, 1 The breakfast is very bad Nor even the bread is good and being in France it would not be dificult to serve a simple french baguette All the food is artificial and of low quality 2 The staff at the Restaurant is unpolite Hard to welcome you and say good morning Other staff like the cleaning ladies were very polite 3 At night you can intensively hear other guests entering their rooms specially the doors closing , The cleanliness of the facilities

214746,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Checking out was awkward I questioned having thought I prepaid the hotel through a 3rd party service Desk clerk was rude and was like pay the bill and get out of my face didn t want to answer what I thought were valid questions But again it is Paris , It is conveniently located to the metro moulin rouge La Cigale and some great local cafes The location and convenience makes it worth the price Otherwise not really a 4 star hotel 
214747,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Not much anyone can do about the street noise I bought ear plugs after the first night and slept soundly and late after that , The roof top terrace was grand It was the perfect place to end a day of walking and a night of singing along with Jimmy Buffet Wine and cheese on the roof top in Paris Ahhhhhhh 
214748,Hotel Carlton s Montmartre, Almost all the staff were very unfriendly and never greeted you as you walked past not tried to make you feel welcome In the bathroom there was one combined dispenser for shampoo and body wash instead of separate bottles for shampoo conditioner and soap Would still recommend the hotel though , Great location in Montmartre very close to lots of restaurants caf s shops attractions gorgeous rooftop terrace on the 9th floor cosy room and comfy bed
