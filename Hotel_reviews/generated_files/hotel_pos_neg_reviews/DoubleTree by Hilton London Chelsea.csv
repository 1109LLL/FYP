348116,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Parking wasn t the easiest We couldn t find it initially so temporarily parked up to speak with a receptionist luckily there were two of us i e one to speak to staff and the other to stay in the car otherwise it would have been more of a mission The staff member then called a guy who took our car brand and colour The man then let us through the barrier of a private road and led us to the secure car park It costs 20 per night so not the cheapest if you are driving As they only took cash I spent another 10 mins getting cash out Not a difficult process but I m used to easier i e underground parking , Amazing London location walking distance to Fulham Road and and it s eateries pubs etc Plus the area is not too busy Easy to drive to We came from Hampshire and pretty much missed all the London traffic on the way in Very comfy hotel we had 2 double beds in our room and quite a nice view from the room Welcome cookie upon arrival nice touch

348132,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, the location is a challenge necessitating a taxi to visit anywhere although rooms were OK minibar was empty why bother installing A C had a cut off mode timer resulting in waking very hot and stuffy , the property was comfortably specified 
348133,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, We were given a room for disabled people I suppose I could have asked to be moved but didn t I know the hotel wasn t fully booked so don t know why I was given this room I did book a twin room but that s all, Convenient 
348134,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, nothing, the entance to the hotel was very clean and had a freindly atmosphere which was reinforced when we started to talk to reception staff when booking in this feeling a of freindlyness pervade the rest of the hotel and i can not praise highly enough the resteraunt staff they all very very freindly and efficient with nothing being too much trouble for them i was very sorry to have to leave at the end of our stay
348135,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, There were only 2 teabags in our room One of the staff was more concerned with the feed back form rather than attending to our requirements at breakfast , Lovely clean and comfortable bedding Everything we needed was in our bedroom

348137,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Bathroom was tired , Staff were amongst the best I have encountered well done Food was also high quality and the breakfast was wide ranging and tasty 
348138,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Nothing It was spot on , The property was lovely Very Clean The rooms were light and airy The Bathroom facilities were great too The Bath was low to floor I Suffer with M E and sometimes have difficulties stepping Up and the shower was invigorating too The staff are very professional and they made me feel at ease I was welcomed at the property after a very difficult morning by a friendly smile and a Nice Warm chocolate Cookie 
348139,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Restaurant food is a little ordinary Breakfasts and bar drinks are overpriced coffee 4 50 No cookies given when we arrived , Have stayed several times before Great location for us comfortable clean and reasonably priced 
348140,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, The room was small but the bed was very comfortable The room was very quiet considering its busy location The staff were mostly friendly and helpful and the food was excellent 
348141,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, That breakfast cost 17 , Staff good on reception and bar area Good service and friendly Cookies on checkin were a nice touch too Hotel Very close to imperial wharf overground train station Area didn t feel to too crazy busy and the Tesco express is handy opposite the hotel
348142,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, It is a bit far away from the city center and you need to use the overtrain and underground to get there , The staff is the best value of the Hotel The property is fantastic and has got all the amenities Good place to be 
348143,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Room a little small and nowhere to put anything down in the bathroom Food in the restaurant OK but nothing special, Staff very friendly and helpful Bar prices surprisingly reasonable for Chelsea
348144,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, We booked late but still feel the price of 179 room only was expensive The bed is small standard double and we were offered a room in which the previous occupant had smoked Nowhere to drop luggage off at the entrance which is very inconvenient ,No Positive
348145,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, I wouldn t pay the money I paid to stay here again it was my partner birthday and I will not be rushing to return to this hotel due to the fact the room was tiny Hardly no room to walk around for the money it was not worth it at all No value for money in any sense the staff were friendly but always pre occupied too busy to help , It was a nice hotel just simple and th drinks were not too expensive
348146,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, It is a shame there is not a gym on site , Breakfast was excellent a great selection and everything that was required The beds were extremely comfortable Fantastic location for Fulham and Chelsea 
348147,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The bath was very shallow and it would have been nice to open the windows for some fresh air a little more but other than that all was fine , The room was very comfortable staff very friendly and my colleague was super impressed with the warm cookie on check in 
348148,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The shower was really bad no power at all The room was tiny I ve stayed here many times before and this was the smallest room I ve had , Location is perfect for my needs Beds very comfy as always Welcoming staff and when I d forgotten my earrings they kept them aside for me Love they have a 12 00 p m checkout Many hotels are changing it to 11 00 a m 
348149,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Staff were excellent We didn t eat in the hotel but the food looked lovely We were at an event in the Chelsea area but it was easy to get to central London via Clapham Junction in 20mins from the overground behind the hotel 
348150,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, While location was convenient to the overground there was not a lot to do on the immediate vicinity No shops or restaurants were nearby Wifi was slow , Room was clean and comfortable Location was convenient to the overground which facilitated getting around Breakfast was great 
348151,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, TV volume control did not work Breakfast was too expensive so I only went once instead of twice , Very clean bedroom and bathroom Great location for us 
348152,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, We went to the wrong hotel We were directed by different people to another Doubletree You should call it Fulham or Chelsea Harbour Cost us an unnecessary 13 taxi fare ,No Positive
348153,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, There was an issue on arrival as we had booked 2 adults and 1 child but at the hotel they only had information about the adults I had taken the paperwork confirming the numbers so there was no dispute They did not have a pull out bed so we ended up sharing This was fine in the end BUT the duty manager and all her staff were lovely and couldn t have been more helpful we even were given complementary breakfast The booking system between booking com and the hotel needs reviewing to avoid this in the future 
348154,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The bathroom in my room could have done with smartening up a bit The rest of the room was fine , The staff were really friendly and attentive The overall hotel was modern and clean and tidy 
348155,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Reception staff not very communicative and didn t explain use of card to provide lighting Couldn t get Wifi Cost more than had been told on booking, Very comfortable and clean Close to my destination 
348156,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The room was quite hot during the night so slept with the window open You could keep the air conditioning on but I like it quiet for sleep, It is a lovely hotel Has a lovely bar Would definetly stay there again
348157,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, I have been in the hotel several times and I found the restaurant was much worse than before first i ordered a glass of wine which cost 6 Pounds they served me a oxidated and bad wine open some days ago i felt bad but i complained if they know the wine is not good they shouldnt serve it Also the food was not as clean and well cooked as previous ocassions i was in the hotel also waiter mistake several times and I had to wait more than 30 minutes for a burger which to tell the truth was not tasty , Good breakfast buffet and good staff good big rooms very well connected 
348158,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, The room was spotless and much bigger than I expected Although the hotel is only on the overground it didn t take us long to figure out the quickest route to the tube and city centre Would definitely stay here again when visiting London 
348159,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, There was a chilly wind which seemed to enter the lobby to which the bar and restaurant were open We went to our room to gather pullovers There was a knack to making the hairdryer work that we never mastered I overheard another guest reporting a similar issue , Comfortable reasonably priced modern London hotel with good transport links in a niche location It was not like an impersonal airport or central London hotel The staff we met were enthusiastic to help and serve We dined in the restaurant and were not disappointed 
348160,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, staff should try and explain things more to make things easy for a customer all places are different how they operate eg checked in was just given two cards and was directed to lifts and only told the floor where i am going i stood by the lift pressing thinking maybe the lift is coming ended up being shown by the customer to use my card get to the had to figer out that i have to put my card in for the lights and everything else ,No Positive
348161,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, This hotel has the worst pillows They were basically flat When we asked for harder pillows we were told that this is all they have Breakfast was quite expensive for the selection and dinner was quite disappointing , Friendly staff and good location near public transportation 
348162,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The room was a little dingy overall although it was clean and comfortable The hotel could also do more to let you know that although there is parking available it will cost you 20 ,No Positive
348163,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The towels in the bathroom were grey well used These need replacing housekeeping , A very comfortable stay Excellent service from the reception desk upon check in from the night supervisor He was able to assist me with mobile iPad problems which was invaluable The breakfast staff were superb Couldn t have been more efficient caring 
348164,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, My only complaint would be that our room was facing a main street Fine but there were no blinds or thin curtain which meant the thick curtains had to be closed the entire time otherwise everyone could see into our room , Lovely warm cookies on arrival 
348165,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Food For such simple dishes the quality and attention to detail is poor Really a shame, The well thought out layout of rooms and quiet generally very pleasant staff
348166,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Poor lighting in both the hotel room and the bathroom but this seems to be a problem in most hotels Very difficult to see to do makeup and hair properly ,No Positive
348167,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Our only complaint about the property was the service at the lobby lounge I think the manager was training and was stressed out Both the communication from staff and the attitude from the manager wasn t overly positive Hopefully the staff will get their communication issues sorted out because otherwise this is a nice lounge with pretty good nachos , The warm cookie upon arrival after 2 hours of train connections and a 20 minute walk was lovely Our room was tidy comfortable and much larger than other rooms I ve had in London The location was a bit out of the way not on the tube line but right next to the overland and once the construction barriers are removed the walk along the Thames will be lovely 
348168,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Great hotel really enjoyed my stay would highly recommend for a couple to stay Perfect location right beside the train station takes about 15 mins to get into central London
348169,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Sink plug broken Toilet roll holder positioned so it was touching you when sat down Big ball off fluff in the corridor carpet didn t move for three days,No Positive
348170,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, We booked on booking com with the breakfast however they still charged us when we went to have it Kind of confusing as the explanation for it wasnt quite clear , Staff was exceptionally great The kind sir gave us a great suggestion on having a wonderful dinner outside of the hotel 
348171,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Unfortunately the hotel seems to be on a economy drive Orange juice was rationed in the breakfast bar The heating had either been turned off or was broken Breakfast was freezing until the last day when the staff finally let us sit in the main part of the restaurant The bedrooms were also freezing and we have both returned with colds Staff said sorry but did nothing about it , We have used this hotel before we returned because the location is excellent next to a tube station 2 stops from Olympia There are local shops and good restaurants near by 
348172,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Was going to a gig at Under The Bridge Stamford Bridge Chelsea FC and wanted somewhere close Have stayed here before and it is so convenient One stop from Clapham Junction Got it on a booking com genius deal so for me great value for money Second time I ve stayed here Great or shopping on the Kings Road Went with my sister and had a double bed each Comfy room Everything you need hairdryer ironing board tea and coffee facilities Nice warm cookie on arrival Everything you need for hot or cold breakfast Vast array of cereals fruits and enough hot food to make a full English Toast breads pastries juices etc etc Just the job after a late night 
348173,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, A bit out of the way for a London sightseeer as transport links were a bit more tricky than the usual but not a big issue , Good value for London beds and rooms were lovely and comfy had everything you needed including proper iron and the cookie was yummy 
348174,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Some staff had very little English they couldn t understand basic question but all were very friendly, Great hotel clean comfy food was fantastic short walk to Stamford bridge
348175,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The people in the rooms either side of us had small children who were screaming from 5am every morning of our visit Unsure how you allocate rooms depending on customer type maybe this should be reviewed The mattress on the bed was so hard I woke up with back ache every morning I m not sure if this is something in house you control Apart from that, The room was very clean and modern which was great Great location easy to access the city via the underground Had room service food was absolutely amazing service was quick and efficient 
348176,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, On departure I asked for my bill to be e mailed to me and at this moment it hasn t arrived but that isn t a major problem, Staff were very friendly and helpful room was very clean and a good size food was good and a good amount Within 10 to 15 minutes walking you had a good selection of pubs and eating places if you wanted to go out for the evening or at lunchtime
348177,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The hotel is somewhat remote from central London and the sites of cultural and historical interest Depending on the time of day it can take numerous transfers among various above ground and underground rail systems to travel from the hotel to a national gallery palace or cathedral If you re concerned about punctuality a taxi is the only option to get from the hotel to where you need to go , Although small the hotel was very clean and competitively priced with a decidedly customer service oriented staff It is also in a very safe area with a reasonably priced national market chain location Tesco directly across the street The local rail station Imperial Wharf is right around the corner 
348178,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Bed was so comfy Excellent location for where we were going but not a lot to do in area around hotel Links by public transport to North London and West end not that great Breakfast was good plenty of choice 
348179,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Why take 30 from my card when I checked in and processed the payment still waiting for a refund apparently they take the money in case of damages never had this before,No Positive
348180,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Very comfortable all round Especially comfy beds Rooms a good size All staff very pleasant and obliging Very good breakfast buffet with lots of choice 
348181,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The hotel could not have been better but it is a little far from getting places conveniently no tube near by limited bus service but once you get used to it it s fine , Hotel was lovely clean and welcoming staff all of them very helpful 
348182,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Parking a little on the high side 20 for 24 hours and we booked a Queen deluxe room but couldn t see what extra we got for our money, The staff were very friendly and the hotel was conveniently located near a tube station 
348183,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Location far from the center and requires a complexed transportation even to Chelsea main street Good facilities Very close to overground station free wifi clean but do better with that All together good place to stay but far ,No Positive
348184,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Reception staff were indifferent Left bags while I parked the car in the subsidised nearby multi story Came back and they were still in a heap in reception They should have taken them up to the room standard 4 hotel service Forgot to take a swipe of my credit card which meant that every bar purchase had to be made in cash or separate card transaction annoying The restaurant was never mentioned to us and was mostly kept in darkness a taxi ride to the nearest tube and the nearby train station was a fairly long journey into town We stayed 3 more nights in London but at a more central hotel Not a Hilton Doubletree based on this experience , Lovely pillows Coffee available in the bar until late Overall an ok budget hotel but not what we were sold 
348185,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Nothing, The comfort of the bed and peacefulness of the room during the night no banging of doors or people chatting in corridor Breakfast was really lovely and staff very helpful 
348186,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Room was very basic but livable, Staff were very friendly and always helpful Breakfast was excellent and it was close to bus stops and rail lines for easy travel
348187,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, As above We did not get the room we paid for One tiny double when we paid for two separate beds due to bad back and restless sleep Very dissatisfied, We paid for a room with 2 double beds but just got one bed My other half has a bad back so fidgets which is why we booked the room Very dissatisfied as it s a small double so neither of us slept well
348188,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, My room was not cleaned properly carpet had crumbs the cleaners didnt clean the bathroom properly residue streaks, Location is safe and quiet neighbourhood Easy access to bus stop as its literally 3 mins walk 
348189,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Bathroom was a little outdated, Friendly and very accommodating staff especially with twin toddlers Great sized room tasty food selection and large kids menu with very quick room service Internet was free fast and reliable Great transport links as 1 minute walk to Tesco Express 5 minutes to Imperial Wharf overground with 3 stops 5min to Shepherd s Bush Westfield shopping mall or 2 stops to underground central line 5 minutes walk to Thames river and 20 min bus route to Earls Court Will definitely stay again with family as made welcome and girls loved their cookies
348190,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, When we arrived at the hotel it looked lovely but when we went into our room it was like it had been abandoned very dusty even after complaing the staff did offer to clean it straight away but it was late for us so we asked them to clean it for 11am the following morning after coming back from our time out it still seemed the same we also noticed that the duvet was not changed as it had a tear in it we did not complain as we thought it would get done the following morning but No it was the same one which makes me wonder weather it had be changed from the previous customers we were very disappointed in this expected a little better room service just wanted it to be a little cleaner , Loved the location staff were good and helpful
348191,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The view from our room , The Cookies are delicious The breakfast was superb Nice location The staff were extremely nice and helpful to us Especially Ava and Nona
348192,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The bathroom was not very clean I ve been here before and it was in better conditions I also tried to talk to some staff in the corridor and it couldn t speak English at all It was completely unexpected considering the UK is an English speaking country , The hotel is in a very quiet area close to restaurants bars supermarket and public transport 
348193,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The location is a bit far from central London but we managed using the overground and then Uber taxis at night time , The room was clean and welcoming and the 12 o clock checkout was a nice treat so we could relax in the morning instead of rushing
348194,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Really enjoyable stay My 8 year old was thrilled with the free cookie on arrival Breakfast was excellent really fresh and loads of choice Easy to get to from centre of London too 
348195,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Quite a walk 15 20 mins to nearest tube station Fulham Broadway , Hotel and rooms very clean Breakfast was excellent good choice of food and hot food was hot not luke warm Convenient for Imperial Wharf station 
348196,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, None, Initially the room i was alloted had an issue after which our room was upgraded to a very spacious one Everyone look out for room no 401 The hotel was less than a minute away from tube and to reach Central London it was 2 3 stations away Also all the rooms have 2 double beds and one single bed 
348197,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, We were placed in a room with an adjoining door to the next room and our next door neighbours were SO loud we were woken up at 4am There should be better insulation and consideration to the fact that those rooms might be used by people with no connection to each other , Really comfy beds and the room in general There is not really anything in regards to the hotel itself I did not like 
348198,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Price to bring 22 bottle of wine to room 5 00 couldn t believe it then she didn t have a corkscrew and had to return with it bit steep I think , Nice evening meal not cheap for country folk like us 
348199,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, the walls in the rooms were not very sound proof we were woken up on numerous occasions by other guests talking in adjoining rooms, breakfast and location were excellent
348200,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, everything staff fantastic breakfast and other meals excellent our room double supreme was pure luxury with an excellent roomservice and special requests handled promptly 
348201,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Room smelt of smoke and cigarette burns in carpet there was chew gum in the draw and kids running up and down the corridor Was exhausted after early start didn t need that , The breakfast was great but additional cost 
348202,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The location was poor for our needs as we met with friends who wanted to see the sights of London The transport links were close by but these proved tedious to get into central London We lost a lot of time in tube stations and felt that this spoiled the weekend, The hotel staff and facilities were fine and just what you would expect from this chain of hotels
348203,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Bar closed early during our stay there was a problem with the door room number 601 as it did not lock and as you pushed it it would open which meant no security during our stay This only came to light the last day as we were leaving I did report it to front desk but they did not seem to be too concern Would I use Hilton hotels again Remains to be seen as no offer of explanation was made to rectify my concern , I liked the location and easy access
348204,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Although very close to a tube station trains are very irregular compared to other stations trains every 15 mins or so, Great service friendly staff lovely room very clean very comfortable stay
348205,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, No fault of the hotel but I couldn t extend our stay because the hotel was fully booked , Location super friendly staff very comfortable and spotlessly clean rooms Great value for money What was the most impressive though was the fact that our room came with three beds and my other daughter could join us for a night at no extra cost Did I mention that mobiles are charged free of charge at reception 
348206,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Mess up with the parking We ended up in the wrong car park No drop off space at the front meant we were unable to check with reception The car park that has the hotel deal said no entry An electric charge point would have been good , Reception and bar restaurant interior Staff very helpful 
348207,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Not great value for money 143 a night doesn t include breakfast and if you want basic s like shower cap have to phone reception No complimentary water biscuits or bathrobes , Location good views spacious twin room
348208,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Loved the chocolate cookies offered on arrival All the facilities including iron in room great as well as excellent location for our visit to 606 Club 
348209,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, I usually stay nearer the centre This hotel is quite a distance away , I could not fault the hotel staff especially front office Nothing was too much for them 
348210,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Bedroom could be looked into from adjacent flats Expressed concern to staff and was told to close the curtains I did suggest that the room could do with a blind or nets as there was also a mirror placed quite close to the window which I m sure gave the neighbours an excellent view of the bed Also quite a few cobwebs on the ceiling Booked a queen size room anticipating a queen size bed however this was not the case Did not have breakfast in the hotel as prices were extortonet I think it was something like 28 for full English and 18 for continental Madness ,No Positive
348211,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Breakfast absurdly expensive so I went out Admin on the booking and invoicing not very good A bit open plan with restaurant and bar both part of the lobby , Very good room Helpful staff 
348212,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, I noted in my reservation for two queen rooms that I would like two rooms close to each other and away from the street When my son and I checked in we got two rooms to the street one on the 3rd floor the other on the 5th It was obvoious that nobody had read my request and since the hotel was full no change was possible , A rich breakfast selection spacious room 
348213,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, First night we couldn t shut the window and as we were on the front by the roundabout it did get noisy and didn t sleep too good first night This was rectified following morning but it was closed and bolted so unable to open window if we wanted to Thankfully there was air conditioning as it was 34C in London those few days we were there Staff were very helpful though with regards to this matter , Room was lovely Breakfast good good choices and a good variation of time to go to breakfast We didn t get to try the evening meals which was a shame 
348214,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, It was baking hot and there was no water in the room I had to ask for some My room had an adjoining door so I could hear everything next door including their hairdryer at 5 45am Right opposite the staff office to so could hear them talking early too I knew the hotel was full so I knew there was no chance to change my room I had a really poor nights sleep ,No Positive
348215,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Although stating an approximate time I was checking in the room was not ready on arrival I was asked if I would kindly go for a walk for an hour or so This was the only real negative point I would defiantly stay again as the friendly staff more than made up for this The breakfast was outstanding Iverall highly recommended ,No Positive
348216,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, When I came to check in there was no record of the check In under my name Even showed them confirmation on my App and my email all reservation for 11th Sept under my name Eventually worked it out that the booking was somehow under my friends name even thou she was listed under all my info as the 2nd occupant of the room All very confusing , Location was excellent for our needs 
348217,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The HVAC unit turned off by itself every 15 minutes We spoke with the staff and they knew of the problem but neither could fix the problem or shift us to a room that had functioning HVAC They said all the HVAC units operated in this fashion Our room was greater than 25 degrees every night and sleeping was miserable, The hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly
348218,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Hotel is in a great location About 3 minutes walk to train station Bus stops across the road underground station 15 minutes walk away Very cosy rooms and bed and great meals served in the restaurant Really enjoyable stay Would definitely look at returning there next time I m in London 
348219,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Staff were pleasant and helpful Room was small which was adequate for 1 night max 2 in my opinion Breakfast was great Location fantastic and great value for money Overall pleased and will return again the next time we want to see the sights

348221,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Struggling to think of anything didn t dine at hotel or have breakfast so unable to comment on food dining experience, Really comfy beds lovely helpful and friendly staff and really quiet housekeeping staff who didn t clatter and bang their way through the morning room run allowing us a peaceful lie in 
348222,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, We both had a Full English Breakfast and a glass of orange juice each and I had a cup of coffee so found 15 00 each a little expensive , The bed was very comfy and everything was nice and clean The staff were friendly and it was nice to receive a warm cookie on arrival
348223,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Slow service detracted slightly from a delicious evening meal which was otherwise amazing value for money , An excellent hotel in a great location adjacent to Chelsea Harbour development Fantastic value for money Room and hotel in general were immaculate Highly recommended 
348224,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, See above, Big disappointment was the room temperature Air was shut off in the middle of the night both nights and I was awakened to awful heat When I told front desk all they said was it s an automatic system and if I ever visit again request that it be over ridden to remain on For the price I would expect a comfortable night s sleep Very disappointing Room was fine other than that one thing Be sure to ask them to leave on the air They are close to railway and underground and Tesco shopping market 
348225,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and quick assisted us straight away every time we asked for room service We asked for something to put flowers into and they came straight away with a tall glass and scissors to cut the stems As we checked in they recognised us from a previous stay and that just shows how much attention they pay towards their guests And to top it off we got 40 minutes late when checking out and when we came to pay they told us not to worry about it as they would give it complimentary We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others 
348226,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The night Shift grumpy people, The bed really comfy location perfect actually walked to Harrod s from Hotel breakfast superb most of all Staff really friendly almost all greet you every day loved the place

348229,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, 1 Travel by train takes longer waiting time and need transfers to Underground to activity centers, 1 Walking distance to Overground Station 2 Roomy clean and with most facilities provided 3 Staff is friendly and helpful 4 Nice and quiet neighbourhood
348230,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Transport connections to this part of London are not straight forward off the main underground network and so not as efficient or frequent particularly at night , Well run efficient hotel welcome treat was a warm cookie offered by reception staff 
348231,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The location is a little further out that we would have liked but there were advantages to this in that the local area was nice and quiet with local pubs and restaurants for a more relaxed evening , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly Nice touch that the manager went around everyone in the lobby bar to check how their stay was The rooms were spacious and had everything we needed Good breakfast with a lot of choices 
348232,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, No separate lay by to facilitate unloading of a car Shower wasn t sufficiently cleaned after the previous guest vacated , Good location smart hotel convenient for Chelsea and Kings Road 
348233,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Electronic key card function was erratic Tea hot water was tepid , Great close location to a Training Centre I was attending Lots to do in the area so leisure was no problem 
348234,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Distance from kings road A lot further away than thought Ordered room service and the evening reception staff were incredibly rude and food was awful I couldn t even eat the chicken wings , Lovely room Great customer service as reception was so helpful but only in the day 
348235,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The shower wasn t particularly good and one of the main lights was constantly flickering , The staff were extremely polite and efficient The hotel is in a very good location right around the corner from the overground station 
348236,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Lot of aircraft noise but something you can do nothing about Corridors and lifts very hot not so good for the cleaning staff , quiet location close to the river And the choc cookie 
348237,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Location next to the tube was ideal Rooms were very clean and quiet Air con was a blessing as it was very hot outside Didn t take breakfast but the Tescos extra just outside the hotel gave us all we needed Would definitely stay here again 
348238,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Nothing really Rooms small and corridors narrow but this is London after all, Good hotel in quiet London location Near overland connection to tube Tesco across the road riverside bars nearby Nice walk to Chelsea football ground and shops Best buffet breakfast we had in a holiday which included stays in 7 hotels 
348239,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, Dinner was very good and the stuff was very attentive There is an overground around the corner and tesco direct supermarket literally on the other side of the road 
348240,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, I did mention in my notes that it was my mum s 60th birthday and asked if they could do anything special but we didn t have anything I d noticed other travellers on TripAdvisor had received bottles of fizz and it was sad that they didn t acknowledge my mum s special day There was rather a lot of dust too , The hotel was ever so clean and comfortable the air conditioning was amazing on a hot London weekend and what a great location so close to everything but still quiet 
348241,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Hygiene was below par Lots of short black hairs in the bathroom and a film of lint and some dust on surfaces throughout I didn t let it spoil my stay just cleaned it myself I shouldn t have had to as I d paid 140 per night , The staff were great 
348242,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, I thought the bar would be open a lot later I only wanted a lemonade or a cappucino around 12 30 1am and I wasn t going to pay the 5 tray charge for room service It would be nice to have a vending machine or something similar as you could only purchase water from reception , Staff were very welcoming and the warm cookie was a nice welcome Room was comfortable The curtains were a dream and didn t let a single drop of light in 
348243,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, I think the hotel has tried to refurbish the rooms and corridors on a cheap basis and this can be seen The bathroom was not modern Not the usual doubletree by Hilton standard We ordered room service as we got back late from Wimbledon and because we had not been asked for a swipe of a card the front desk called our room at 1am asking us to go to reception and pay We arrived too early to check in so left our bag whilst we went to Wimbledon on return at 11 30pm only one person serving at the desk We only wanted our key and the reception desk was dealing with another lady trying to obtain a room which took 20 mins , The breakfast was delicious
348244,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, n a, just as good as the reviews claimed Great vaue for money Nice residential neighborhood but easy access to underground and overground Just a few steps from the Thames Tesco s store directly across

348248,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, This seems to be just a secure accommodation area with many appartments flats Got to say I am not mad keen on the area It is nice to look at with some reasonable if expensive restaurants but to me it is missing character Unless I missed something there is very little to do there although a walk along the river is enjoyable , The breakfast was lovely and just as I like a good choice of different styles The room was clean and large enough with the necessary facilities including free wifi It is close to the river and a short walk to the marina too 
348249,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Needed to open the window on occasions and this was locked sometimes stuffy and in need of real air though the air conditioning worked fine it s not to everyone s taste , The service at breakfast and facilities were excellent and it was very relaxed well done 
348250,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, They didn t pick up empty drink bottles and other trash when cleaning This happened 2x They cleaned the bathrooms laid the bed but didn t remove any diet on the floor or table I also ordered wings at 11 05pm Saturday 25th June and was told it would take half an hour but it never came , The reception staff were always eager to help and the welcome cookies were lovely 
348251,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, There could have been light covering of the windows as the apartments opposite could look directly in The tv was very old fashioned and so was the bathroom Shower very weak and bath small , Clean room lovely staff They even gave us a bottle of bubbly and card for our wedding anniversary Bar staff very attentive Very nice stay Will defiantly stay again and very soon

348255,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Breakfast seemed rather expensive so we went to the cafe on the corner nearby We would have liked to have been able to open the window a little more at night as the room was a bit stuffy by the morning There is air con but we wanted fresh air and not air con at night , Room was comfortably and stylishly furnished Shower was great Nice to have a bath though we didn t actually use it The room had good lighting which was important when one of wanted to read and the other to sleep

348259,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Disappointed that booking details were not passed through to Hilton and on arrival they had no record of our stay This was researched and a room was found On departure we were asked for payment so we had to go through the same process to confirm that the booking had been confirmed and paid for at booking com , Location
348260,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, 10 minutes wait at check in wasn t ideal after a long day but probably unavoidable, Nice comfy bed meant I slept like a log Not before I d polished off the warm cookie though
348261,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, It s out of the way if you re there to tour the popular parts of London Conveniently located to an overground line and a ferry wharf but be prepared for line changes if you re trying to get to the underground , It was quiet and had an excellent breakfast buffet Great value for the money if you can get a deal 
348262,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, We were very happy but one day room service was not performed and the elevator security device was temperamental , Great location beside the overground rail Easy access to Gatwick Airport thru Clapham junction so no need to go to Victoria station Going into town it was one stop to the district line tube station Two bus stops Close by and we used them several times to get to places like Sloane square and Victoria bus terminal Very short walk to the Thames And water side restaurants Had all our breakfasts at the hotel Full range from continental to full English breakfast Had a dinner in the lounge and very pleased with service and food Finally there is a tesco express right across the street

348268,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, I stayed for 1 night which included breakfast I then booked a second night but was informed by quite an abrupt and rather rude member of staff at reception that breakfast was not included the second night I am returning on the 18 4 16 for a week and I was planning on booking with you again but I doubt I will now , I liked the set out of the room and the bed The bar staff were nice and attentive The hotel itself is in a perfect spot and the parking is easily accessible The cookie on arrival is a nice touch 
348269,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Breakfast is a fortune but there is a Tesco across the street, Walkable to 3 excellent restaurants The Waterside Irish pub on the Thames on the Imperial Wharf excellent
348270,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, The TV was at 90 degrees to the bed so you could not watch television unless you got up and got very close to the tv as small and sat in a chair , The breakfast was fine but not fantastic

348274,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea,No Negative, The reception staff were very friendly and competent The room was comfortable and clean though a little too hot but that s so subjective The location was perfect I was visiting London Design Week at Chelsea Harbour and everything one would expect of a business hotel was provided so for the purpose this hotel was ideal I would certainly go back if visiting this particular part of London on business 
348275,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, Took the staff a long time to solve a problem after our check out, Welcoming cookie was delicious Just two minutes away from the design center and the Imperial Wharf train st

348312,DoubleTree by Hilton London Chelsea, following on from my comments on previous stays the breakfast buffet food should be updated and it s the one thing that let s you down as with other chain hotels buffet hot food very similar to mcdonalds but perhaps that is to satisfy demand would prefer an option of upmarket quality sausages eggs meats cheese bread etc maybe on the a la carte if you don t want need the whole cereal buffet thing Bearing in mind the hotel is based in chelsea opposite the design centre and there are very few options for cooked breakfast in the immediate area I checked there is a missed opportunity here for in coming trade from local residents and visiting interior designers as well as hotel guests it would give the hotel a certain flagship feel to the double tree brand and would fit with the laura ashley styling on the 6th floor , staff fantastic helpful friendly perfect for woman on business travelling alone
