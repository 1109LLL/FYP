378521,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The triple room was small Extra sofa bed was very bad and broken Internet is not free while it is in most of Vienna streets Triple room has no view and the one in the 4th floor was so small so we had to ask to change it with the one in the 3rd floor instead , Clean So close to westbahnhof and mariahilfer street easy access to tram excellent breakfast recommended stay and will repeat it again but in double not in triple room 
378522,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, room very small instant coffee for the breakfast paid wifi I still can t f kin belive it , Good location however good shops are in the other districts
378523,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, We didn t really appreciate the Wi Fi taxing that the hotel has as it costs 7 per day It also suprised us because the rest of the hotels we stayed at during our trip offered Wi Fi connection for free both in the rooms and at the reception , The hotel is separated by equal distances from the Sch nbrum and Hoffburg palaces giving it a great location right next to the city centre There is a very convienient underground garage 
378524,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Hotel room appears to be larger in the photos that in reality however rooms are quite clean and well organized , Hotel is located in a very central location on the Ottakring with public transport and walking shopping areas very near by 
378525,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The breakfast could be a little bit more diverse Pillows are not really comfortable The ceiling in shower cabine is max 2 m high Parking in Vienna streets is free over the weekend no need to pay for the garage , Nice hotel Very friendly staff 
378526,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, There were long lines at reception with one person working at peak times understaffed Elevators are low capacity and slow , Rooms are clean people are friendly
378527,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Less waiting time at the reception desk upon check in not being asked to pay despite the fact that they already received payment in advance and no free wifi for hotel residents, very nice breakfast
378528,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, the hotel parking though said to be available on arrival wasn t and the check in staff was less than helpful in guiding where to find parking the only place I came across during a month long trip through Europe which charges you separately for wifi , the location is about the only thing I found going for this property 
378529,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Needs a renovation Badly sound isolated both inwards and outwards Weird layout of floors room I got lost in the five meters from lift to room a bunch of times Weird empty corners in the room that just don t feel right Plastering falling from the wall No free WiFi , Location near Mariahilferstra e and Westbahnhof is great
378530,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Hotel reception not too helpful but a large coach party had booked in prior to us so I think the stress was starting to show Would have liked a change of towels during stay because they didnt really dry in the room conditions but that was just a small point , Handy for Westbahnhof transport connections We used the airport shuttle bus which was good value and within easy walking distance of hotel Comfortable room but a little on the small side but clean and tidy and air con was a bonus Bar staff were great and the drinks were reasonably priced for a hotel bar 
378531,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, An old hanger corrupted my new t short A chambermaid took used towels but didn t leave fresh ones in the room even after we asked on the reception to give us towels, Location delicious breakfast reasonable price
378532,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The lobby bar served cognac diluted with water and no one apologised after it was pointed out nor did they give money back That was offensive and the attitude spoiled a big part of the whole trip and otherwise nice hotel experience , Very good breakfast options for every taste and need 
378533,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The airconditioning was not working in our room we felt that the filters have not been replaced cleaned Since it is summer and we have kids with us we made it a point to book accomodations with airconditioning It was very hot in our room my children had to take several baths and sleep in their nappies just to endure the night The carpet in the room was dirty We requested the hotel to leave the aircoditioning on in our room when we left in the morning so that it would be cooler by the time that we arrived in the afternoon There was no improvement I had to cancel our booking the following night because the heat was just unbearable The staff was gracious enough to call booking com and facilitate the cancellation at no extra charge and to offer compensation by not letting us pay for parking Still it was the most uncomfortable accomodation our family has ever booked via booking com ,No Positive
378534,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Paid Wifi Internet was poor I was not even able to browse or make voice chat properly, Location is great Near the west bahnoff and very close to maria hilfer strasse which is one the main shopping centres and a good walk 30 minutes to the centre of city
378535,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The location was a bit far from the centre lots of homeless people around and on the way to the centre that s what was upsetting same everywhere I guess but the homeless were living on the benches and in the doorways felt like there was lots of opulence in Vienna but also too many homeless, Bed large very comfortable room small in comparison but really clean new carpets really fresh appeal about the hotel nice modern feel 
378536,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Air conditioning not consistent , Convenient location near trains trams and buses easy to get to airport on CAT Staff were very helpful Good pub across from hotel for meals 
378537,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The air conditioning in our room was broken and it took us a long time after talking to 3 different persons at the reception to change the room apparently personal there do not communicate with each other very well Finally we were given a lux suite with working air conditioning so at more than 35 C outside it was definitely worth complaining , It was a nice and modern hotel with great breakfast and located in very close proximity to the subway and shopping streets Personal was friendly and professional most of the time see above 
378538,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Bad Location of our room so far the end of the hallway and no good view 5 days they did not change the bedfings and one day they did not even clean our room Towel smell bad , Friendly helpful staff named Hussein allowed us to check in very much earlier 
378539,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The wifi is not free it s 7 per 24h The mugs that come with the boiler were not cleaned during our stay the tea bags were not replaced either , Easy to access from the airport direct bus Efficient and silent air conditioning it was 35 outside Clean good bed Good location to visit Vienna 
378540,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, IN 2017 I feel it is unacceptable to have a television within the region of 60 channels and the only channels in ENGLISH are news ones it is so easy now to supply channels for most languages, Breakfast choices very good rooms good as well
378541,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, WiFi could have been free , Beds were comfortable breakfast was delicious and the location right next to the subway station makes it quite easy to get to the city center 
378542,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, I wasnt happy with the paid internet 7 for 24 hrs It is 2017 folks Internet connection is a basic human right , Hotel is neat close to the Mariahilfer strasse and Westbahnhof The staff was nice and the room was very clean 
378543,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Expect to wake up at 7 in the morning in a noisy building yard just in front of your window if it is looking to the inner court , Nice clean hotel Good location and staff 
378544,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Rooms might be a bit bigger not a problem at all just comparison to other places , Great location very friendly staff great facilities underground parking makes a difference if you travel by car as in such a location in Vienna it is hard to get hotel with parking 
378545,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Location and size of room friendly helpful staff except for one of the female staff who seemed very disinterested in helping us to find our way to the hop on hop off buses There was one male staff member who was exceptional sorry didn t take note of his name 
378546,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, WiFi is paid unusual and an unexpected surprise in a hotel these days The hotel caters to some large groups which can make check in check out challenging depending on timing There is no restaurant in the hotel though it is very close to the Mariahilfer Strasse which has a wide choice of restaurants , Located very conveniently to the Wien Westbahnhof for connections by train and bus to the airport Rooms are small but well equipped Breakfast is very good providing a combination of hot and cold food Staff was very friendly and helpful 
378547,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The bathroom doors could have been better but overall it was pretty excellent , I really liked how they offered us a variety of movies on TV rather than giving us the local channels like every other hotel in the world 
378548,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The hotel deposited my card 3 days before arrival but after our check out and payment the deposit is on the card for days even though the actual amount has already been deducted and booked by the bank Hello I would like to use my money , Great location good breakfast nice and clean rooms 
378549,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Since it was a very big hotel the need for more staff was evident You have to wait at the reception at the bar etc in order to have things done Staff sometimes was stressed from having a lot of people around and they could not be very helpful , The hotel was very nice and well located since it was near the metro station Overall it was a nice hotel and comfortable 
378550,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Recently there was slow WLAN for free and a faster one against extra payment Now there was no WLAN at all included for a hotel used by business travellers an absolute no go The bathroom was so small there was no space for your cosmetics etc , Close to subway station
378551,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, I used the parking in the basement at least I tried After receiving the ticket I drove to level P1 and the door closed in front of me there was no Intercom so my wife had to walk to the reception and ask for opening of the door That took several minutes almost 10 ,No Positive
378552,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The WiFi signal was very poor in my room The cleaning refill housekeeping service is less than satisfying , The location is perfect Easy to access to several U bahn lines and very close to the train station The staff in front desk was very friendly and gave me a lot of helpful advice 
378553,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The WiFi signal in the room was very poor I have to use it in the corridor The housekeeping service was less than satisfying The left is too small , The location is good easy to access to several U barn lines and close to the west train station The front desk always gave very quick response and friendly helpful advice 
378554,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, the wi fi connection was bad especially considering it was 5 EUR per 24h We had a room for three but we only got two towels every day even after noting this to the girl at reception , Brilliant breakfast very good accessible location friendly personnel Highly recommended hotel for business trips 
378555,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, located adjacent to a busy road but would not put me off staying here again , The hotel was conveniently located a short walk from the metro station The room was excellent I was lucky enough to stay in a suite which was extremely well appointed clean and comfortable the breakfast offered was excellent with a wide choice of foods on offer at the self service buffet The staff were very helpful The only negative aspect was the noise from traffic on the adjacent busy highway however with the windows closed and aircon on there was no particular issue All in all a very enjoyable stay in a hotel which offers fantastic value for money
378556,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Wanted to open the window but then had noise from people in the street below returning early hours of the morning Would have been nice to have free wifi in the rooms, Great breakfast selection very helpful staff
378557,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No free wifi The entrance and the exit into the garage are very narrow Sanitary items e g shower cup pads available only on request I think because I did not ask for , Stylish friendly hotel Superb breakfast Kettle in the room

378560,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The shower was blocked and did not drain After informing reception staff the repairman came to fix it whilst I was out but unfortunately he just left the shower in a mess with parts of the shower drain lying around and water everywhere The reception staff offered me a change of room which I accepted Wifi router kept kicking my connection or failing to respond , Reception staff friendly and helpful Not expensive compared to other options in this range Conveniently located for public transport 
378561,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, I had to connect to internet several times and it didn t work in some places such as bed and breakfast room , Good breakfast and a good value for money 
378562,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, A bad view for the non street facing rooms some constructions going on B Extending our stay for another night would be so expensive much more expensive than previous nights , Location as the hotel is very close to public transport and shopping district 
378563,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, I don t recommand the hotel We didn t have a room with two single beds as we booked and i had to sleel either in the same bed with my collegue or in a very small and uncomfortable extra bed we both tried this bed and had backpains afterwards When we asked at the reception the reason we didn t get the room we booked they said that a bigger group had booked several rooms after us in the hotel so they were more entitled to rooms with single beds that we were because they were paying more This is not a good reason for me ,No Positive
378564,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The Wi Fi was pretty bad and so much expensive compared to the quality of the signal There wasn t any bath stuf the minibar was empty , The room was fine and the bed was comfortable
378565,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, poor quality WIFI I had to pay for it every day Other hotels of the same category offer high quality WIFI free of charge, Nice room very quiet excellent and most helpful staff excellent breakfast
378566,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, To have to pay for the internet For the price of the room that should have been included and buying internetcoupons is oldfashioned Second the bed was too hard for my taste and the room was small I think the price was too high for what you get also my view over an innercourt was not nice But having said that the location makes up for a lot of that and therefore I would stay again , The location is excellent few minutes to subway tram and train Also nice is the new and modern feel to the hotel The room was clean and a nice size television 
378567,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Excellent breakfast catering for all Location great metro right outside and only 3 or 4 stops to all the main attractions Staff friendly and helpful Would definitely stay at this hotel again 
378568,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, We booked two rooms One was fine for two people The other one was for three people I asked for a bigger room as the first room was totally inadequate for three adults The room I got then was better but still not big enough for three adults The bathroom was way to small for three people , The location of this property was excellent as it was near a metro line that took u anywhere u wanted to go
378569,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Too expensive to the level of service offered Absence of room service no blow dryer in the room no complimentary water internet is at an additional rate , The hotel was very well located beds although very small yet comfortable enough 
378570,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Staff was not very helpful When we just arrived in the hotel at mid night it was very cold almost 0 degree The moment we opened the door to our room it was so cold because the window was open The room was small but it still took a long time to warm the room up after we turned the heating on When I complained to the receptionist he said well I cannot tell you why the window was open All right I didn t expect that , Breakfast is good
378571,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Everything seems a little bit under standard than the pictures which shows in Booking com that makes me a little bit upset , The location is not very far Valued for money 
378572,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, nothing, location is excellent near train station metro station which is easy to get around using public transport Buffet breakfast is nice Clean room 
378573,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The wireless network is free but poor Bad connectivity often low to no bandwidth It was quite busy so the breakfast area was a bit overcrowded , Nice hotel second time for us It offers solid facilities nice environment friendly staff and a good night s sleep Breakfast is surprisingly well stocked 
378574,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, when i arrival hotel our booking is request a 2 single bed but not a 2 single bed room that a woman in counter she very kindness to upgrade to deluxe room to me that very excellent Location of hotel very good to public transportation around the hotel have a shopping street restaurant cafe shop and many more That is very choice in Vienna
378575,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Wifi is not provided free of charge , The location is very convenient to go to all the must see places The breakfast is plentiful The staff is very helpful to provide all the needed information 
378576,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Smell of sewer in the room they didn t change bed sheets not once in four days you have to pay extra for wi fi transparent door on the bathroom, Excellent location comfort bed hotel was easy to find
378577,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The parking is absolutely small and crowded It s incredibly hard to maneuver in and outside the parking If you have an SUV think twice before parking Not to mention it costs an extra 18 eur , The hotel and staff was very nice clean comfortable all good It was nice the fact that they offer extra hygiene products free like toothbrush or toothpaste if you forget yours for some reason 
378578,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, but I and my colleague book a double room with two beds but on arrival we were placed in a single bad room they change it but the only other double bad room was free minutes ago and it floated very bad smell Free parking cost us 8 euros The bathroom door was redicilouse , Convenient location clean and cozy place 
378579,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, You have to pay extra for the WiFi Excuse me This is very backwards and made the difference between Good and Excellent for me I paid in full upon arrival for a one night stay Still the receptionist insisted upon check out that I had to queue up for about 20 minutes for her to double check everything , Rather firm bed which I liked very much I slept very well 
378580,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Paying for wifi and then struggling to get access especially in the bar area We were charged 5 euro and another person was quoted 4 euro We also had a scare when our lift stopped in between floors Not a good experience The reception lady rescued us and was helpful , Location was good lovely clean room Bar attendant very friendly and helped with directions 
378581,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Large amount of so called refugees housed at hotel causing a lot of noise and disturbance Spoils your stay No free internet connection really in these times being charged for internet usage , Clean modern and centrally located
378582,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, We found that body soap shampoo was not refilled adequately upon our check in The room size is enough for us since we are not large bodied people however it if a large bodied person stayed it might be a problem , Location is really good and has direct tram access to main sightseeing spots Staff is nice and understanding on our needs Breakfast is better than I expected but can be improved more if more fresh fruits are included and an oven to warm bread is available Bed and pillows are really comfortable and gave us good sleep 
378583,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The room is very small but not problem for 1 2 day short stays , The room bath towels linens are realy clean It is very easy to reach all destinations in and out of city Breakfast is well enough Only TRT but there are Turkish TV channels 
378584,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Wifi is expensive and barely usable for business purposes or video streaming Bandwidth limited to 256kbit Mobile roaming was fast and cheaper on my company contract Place missed to put my desk address on the invoice even though discussed before Missed out on that myself due complaining on the unclear and very 2006 wifi offers Even though this place is in itself nice except for the dirty carpets in my room not being able to work in my room without roaming overuse is just giving the whole experience an totally unnecessary note Will likely not book Leonardo hotels again , It s a nice looking Hotel in a pretty OK location with nice rooms good design and some extra facilities like a gym on the highest floor With a view Breakfast was ok too and price was really good for what it is if there wouldn t be the wifi issue 
378585,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Watch out for the internet access It costs 5 EUR for 24h and it is close to not being usable The garage is a nightmare especially if you own a bigger car than VW Golf For any sort of limousine or bigger driving in and out turns into a half an hour endeavour I realise one tries to use as much space as possible but it was just too much I managed to scratch my car by driving out and it is not for the lack of experience or due to speed At the end if you look at the wall close to the exit you will see a whole palette of colours Perhaps making one door instead of two and introducing a traffic light system would be a solution , The hotel staff is extremely friendly and ready to help as much as possible The rooms are nice and cosy quite clean and offer everything one needs Location is great 
378586,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The bathroom door was frosted glass and sometimes didn t stay closed which meant that using the bathroom wasn t particularly private Paying extra for internet that I had to update every 24 hours and refresh everytime I used a device was inconvenient If I was traveling for leisure this might not have mattered so much It was also annoying to be restricted to only two devices or pay extra The room was on the small side , I stayed for 5 nights and the hotel was fine The location was good it was easy to get to and from the airport and into the city centre The bed was comfortable and the shower was good I thought the hotel was clean 
378587,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Staff at the reception was not quite nice and helpful made us feel unwelcomed , Breakfast was good room was quiet and comfortable it was really close to metro and railway station 
378588,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, We had no hot water one evening and despite asking reception twice we neither saw nor heard any investigation It was ok the following morning but we had no feedback from staff , Location is excellent very easy to access the underground network 
378589,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The triple room actually is a double bed plus a pull out bed A pull out bed is not comfortable and takes much space in the room Not comfortable and not recommended for 3 adults staying in that room They shouldn t have that option at the first place in my opinion Very small shower glass cubicle The bathroom is ok Driveway to the parking lot is very small Can t accommodate 9 seats van Need to park somewhere else if you drive one , Very nice and clean room for double twin room Variety of breakfast Fast check in process 
378590,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Does not look like a 4 star hotel to me just as a 3 star with high hopes , Location is the most important strong point as it is nearly walking distance to city center Breakfast is diversified
378591,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Lovely room with an extremely comfortable bed and lovely decor too Rooms cleaned daily also Attentive staff who were both friendly and polite especially the cleaners who helped my girlfriend with her case Shame we didn t have time to try out the restaurant and bar but looked nice Fantastic location and location was good for travelling in 
378592,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Underground parking is really tight especially if you have a larger car Make sure that you walk with a friend after dark Security is tight which is great but any movement through the building requires your room card , It is right next to west bahnhof and from there just a short distance to hotel We had a little emergency with lost individual Staff was a terrific help 
378593,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Location was not ideal about 45 mins into the city centre walking but not too expensive to get Uber s , Very comfy bed nice staff and particularly brilliant bar man 
378594,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Wifi should be free of charge, Great location Lovely staff and the bed was so comfortable The bathrooms and bed linen were very clean and the shower was great I will definitely be back to this hotel 
378595,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, WiFi was a bit slow and spotty even though it was not free , Great location a few minutes away from Westbahnhof a main station with trams and U bahns to get you anywhere Close access to Mariahilfer street a nice shopping street with the Museum quarter at the end Nice lounge and breakfast friendly and helpful staff 
378596,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Perhaps some extra food available during the day there is only breakfast then toasted cheese sandwiches available However this encouraged us to go and try all of the delicious food that Vienna has to offer go get yourself a Wienerschnitzel , The hotel Leonardo was easy to find just a small walk from Westbanhof on the U3 one of the main transport links The staff were unbelievably helpful from the start offering advice on places to visit or local knowledge about where to eat Our room was very comfortable the washing facilities were particularly nice and some forgotten toiletries were offered by the hotel on request The hotel bar was a nice last stop after a day out and again staffed by very friendly people look out for Micheal if you visit yourself All in all a very nice place to stay slightly out from the center of Vienna itself 
378597,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The location was a bit to far from the city centre but there are good metro links, The room was very welcoming the bed was king size and just how I like it Not too soft
378598,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Room was very small Couple of drunk hooligans arguing outside hotel around 10pm when I was coming back No fault of the hotel , The location was amazing and the breakfast had a nice variety Staff was very nice 
378599,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The receptionist was very incompetent uncooperative and impolite She was late ordering my taxi despite prior notice and was very rude to me so i arrived late at the airport When i first arrived i was shocked when i entered my room because it had a low slanted ceiling like an attic so i called the recetionist and asked to change the room because this gives me shortness of breath and her response was basically deal with it , The location is good and the breakfast was great as well as the room service staff 
378600,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Expensive wifi Really small bathroom , Very helpful staff Monika at the reception was professional nice and trying to help guest Great location Room was clean and tidy 
378601,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The wi fi which you had to pay for was still a poor connection , Modern hotel very clean and tidy Staff were helpful Good location we took short uber rides into the city centre for a few euros very affordable 
378602,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The fact that you have to pay for WiFi In this day and age it should be included in price of hotel , The staff went out of their way to be helpful The hotel was spotlessly clean Breakfast was great with huge choice 
378603,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Didnt expect so few space in the room The biggest disappointment was Wi Fi You have 2 types of room with and without Wi Fi We got the one with Wi Fi For every 24h you had to insert username and password to use it which was happening frequently because sometimes it logs you off Nevermind that the wi fi was very bad low signal and very low speed for a room with wi fi Jesus , Bed was good for sleeping its location is very good Mariahilfe street is very near and public transport is very accesible Staff is pleasant 
378604,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No free wifi in the room or even in the hotel lobby We need to pay or go to the lobby to use the desktop It s really inconvenient , Good location and wonderful breakfast 
378605,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Our double bedroom was surprisingly smaller than we expected and reminded us of hotels in Japan we had to jump over our luggage to go to the bathroom or to go out of the room no free wifi And this is a small business hotel and not really a 4 star hotel , Clean modern facilities good breakfast I confused the location with the central station Vienna Hauptbanhof but in the end it was ok as the area was quiet at night and the metro linked us to all the major tourist sites There is a direct tram that goes to the central station 
378606,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Nothing, Everything was perfect Clean rooms with everything you need such as clean towels hair dryer television telephone refrigerator safe and much more Reception Staff great professionals ready to help with everything Location Perfect connection with the Vienna Airport and City Center 
378607,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, 7 euro charge per day for wifi , Superb breakfast lots of choice hot and cold lovely fresh breads all good quality Large comfortable room with coffee making Close to station West Bahnhof 15 min walk from centre 
378608,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The rooms were comfortable nice size room we had 704 at the front of the hotel so had quite a nice view Breakfast was very good scrambled eggs cooked to perfection Ideal location metro and station close by we took the train to Salzburg so was perfect Nice burger restaurant around the corner very enjoyable stay the staff were very helpful and friendly
378609,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Wifi wasn t very strong which was frustrating and you could only have 2 devices connected at any time Wifi should be accessible and free to all patrons Breakfast No toasting facility for bread could have had a few more options e g Cooked tomatoes otherwise ok Location was too far from the centre and had less soul though we found good restaurants nearby that were a bit off the beaten track E g Hawider great little burger and beer joint and Mill really good food and nice interior , Clean room and bathroom great shower 
378610,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Wifi disconnect from time to time Then u have to write a very long code , Everything was great Cozy clean and just perfect Breakfast is AmAzInnG
378611,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The beds were not overly soft and mattresses felt old the springs could be felt They were not uncomfortable but not luxurious either There was also a previously filled out comment card over a week old based on the date the writer put left in the room binder and the soap unit in the shower was empty This leads me to think that while the room looked clean the housekeeping may not be as thorough as I would expect , The Staff were absolutely wonderful They safely stored out luggage as we explored the city as we arrived very early in the day When I complained that the bed was two smaller beds put together I fell through it and hurt my knee the front desk person immediately changed my husband and me to another room with a different bed He was very nice about it and we appreciated not having to argue about it They also stored our luggage on the day of our check out until our flight in the evening Every interaction with the staff was met with a smile The location was wonderful too The Westbanhof bus took us right from the airport to across the street from the hotel and the same for the return to the airport We were within walking distance 2 miles for us of most of what we wanted to see and the close proximity to public transport made venturing further easy too The 8th floor relaxation room was lovely Not exactly enough equipment to call it a gym but nice none the less The view from it was great to see the city and the sitting area was a nice touch 
378612,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The room was very very cold We called the reception they brought us a mobile heater It was soo loud that we couldn t sleep If we turned it off we were freezing The bathroom was so tiny that I could not turn around when I stepped in Never again ,No Positive
378613,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Nothing in particular only the fact that the hotel doesn t provide free WiFi service The hotel sign we saw once we got off the metro station is kinda confusing because the hotel entrance is all the way to the other side of the street But again not that hard to find , Good location near metro station Small room but reasonable price It is quiet and have nice TV programs as well 
378614,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, My room was not cleaned every day and I was not happy about it The paid wifi is ridiculous I booked my holiday with a travel agency and I was not aware that there was an extra charge of 5 euros per day I travel a lot and I ve never had this before surely the management could change their internet provider contract , I liked the friendly staff All were fantastic Breakfast was very nice and the bed was comfortable Location wise was great because the centre of Vienna is just 5 stops on the underground 
378615,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The staff was very pleasant and helpful We asked about early check in and they allow us to check in at 12 00 instead of 15 00 They offered us to become Leonardo Hotel Club member and enjoy free wi fi it was very convenient and we saved money Great time we spent and if visit Vienna we ll come back for sure 
378616,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Nothing , The staff were extremely helpful with giving directions and suggestions on site seeing as well as being very warm pleasant and respectful The breakfast was superb The room was comfortable The location of the hotel is a two minute walk from the trams and underground The overall experience was wonderful I will definitely stay again on my next trip to Vienna 
378617,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Lack of information on wifi it was available only pay basis Door of the bathroom would t close Touristic info at the reception was not so accurate , Nice friendly staff very good breakfast clean room Location ok but no many restaurants around 
378618,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Paid WiFi is a nonsense Besides even if you pay you may only connect 2 devices and the speed is drastically low , As many mention good location although we would prefer to closer to old city the price difference is not so high Rooms are clean and tidy 
378619,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Nothing bad to say , location near the shopping street Parking was also a plus it s paid but at least it s one thing to get out of your mind I ve seen others rate the rooms as small but ours was ok 
378620,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Door of bath toilete couldn t be closed well The reason was not that it was broken but it was fixed so that there was a left empty place between door and wall There was no free WiFi in the hotel not just in the rooms but also even in lobby There were 3 computers for guests with internet but it was functioning slow You could pay EUR5 for 24 hours free wifi , Hotel room was clean and location good It s located close to Westbahnhof station and Mariahilferstrasse 
378621,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, They had a big problem with wi fi We paid for it and every code was wrong we had to replace with other codes and sometimes these other codes were also wrong There was a construction site next to the hotel The view was dissapointing , We liked very much the location of the hotel It was next to westbahnhof and mariahilfer strasse The room was nice and the cleaning staff perfect Reception was helpful
378622,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Wifi it has to be paid for and in some rooms it has lousy reception Need to organize rooms with three beds and improve quality of the spare bed, Location it is at the beginning of the shopping street Staff very pleasant staff always available to help you out with the problems you have Breakfast they offer various food Everything was as shown on pictures
378623,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Breakfast was OK but don t be late as tables and buffet cleared dead on 10am WiFi access removed as soon as bill paid which was frustrating, Great location fantastic access to public transport and selection of restaurants nice bar area in hotel
378624,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The base of the shower and around the outside of the screen needs more attention and the seals around the sink need to be changed but this a common problem in even the best hotels and is easily rectified Nothing hindered my stay I will definitely be booking here again , The bed was very comfortable and both the day staff and the night staff couldn t do enough to help with any requests The manager was extremely professional and friendly I was very very happy with the overall attitude of everyone that I met They were actually more polite than most of the 5 star hotels that I would normally reside at I went for a low key and peaceful experience and I got exactly that I would definitely recommend this hotel in the future Perfect location for all forms of transportation The gentleman at the reception was very helpful smart and a credit to the hotel 
378625,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No free Wifi, Great place for a week end in Vienna Breakfast is good Room is clean bed is large and comfortable Good situation to visit Vienna
378626,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, service in the room was very bad the washing soap in the bath and washbaisn were empty for the last day and room service doesn t fill it during regular day service ,No Positive
378627,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, This hotel is rather strange compared to others in Vienna Issue no 1 Leonardo hotel does not have free wifi in the rooms that is absolutely unacceptable in the modern world Issue no 2 even when you buy paid wifi connection for 24 hrs it works very slow In addition their paid connection only works for two devices a day if you log into 2 devices in the morning you cannot use wifi on other devices in the course of the day Issue no 3 the hotel is located rather far from the center of Vienna ,No Positive
378628,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Very small lobby , Room 401was a little smaller than we expected but it was very quiet during the night We enjoyed the complimentary coffee and tea in the room Buffet breakfast was very sumptuous with different choices We also spotted very well the cleanliness of this hotel The location topped it all 
378629,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, bar closed too soon at least until one in the morning would be fine i think in 2016 free wi fi would be normal , great hotel good location super breakfast almost as good as Leonardo in Berlin
378630,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Room was small and dark The corridors were a bit scruffy The lift was very slow and not adequate for a busy hotel waited 7 minutes for a lift one morning Bar in hotel was expensive , Staff were very helpful 
378631,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, I am really surprised that a 4 star hotel doesn t offer free wi fi to its guests We got one hour for free and the wifi connection was slow and disconnected often it almost wasn t worth using I wouldn t bother to pay 5 euros a day to use the suboptimal wifi Another major issue is that the walls are paper thin so we could hear everything from our neighbors on either side of us one neighbor spoke Italian another English We could clearly hear them playing music at night or chatting in the morning There s also noise from the hallway Lastly the toiletries in the hotel are bare bones There is a liquid hand soap next to the sink and a shampoo body soap combo in the stand up shower , The staff is friendly and helpful the hotel is modern and in good shape There are 2 people at the front desk so it s easy to speak to someone The location is not in central Vienna inside the Ringstrasse but the center is easy to reach via the Westbanhopf station that is less than 5 minutes away Breakfast is decent not the worst but not the best I have had It s helpful to have a hot water kettle and small fridge in each room Robes and extra pillows are available on request There are 3 computers in the front lobby and 1 computer on the top floor free of use for Internet and to print things The bed is large and comfy Overall a comfortable stay and good value for money 
378632,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Internet charge nowadays seem nonsense as well as special breakfast charge , I must admit that Leonardo Hotel Vienna is a decent city hotel perfectly suitable for business or solo travelers who would enjoy comfortable bed quiet hallways and simplicity The same very hotel I would probably choose when my business trips are tight and stressful My recent experience showed that this precise choice was not suitable for family travel as simple as it is 
378633,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, We stayed for four days and did not the room nor a day Only two times gave us towels We were inside a dirty room and we had us and baby Disappointed , Good breakfast Good location

378635,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Bad soundproofing very noisy during the morning Insufficient heating the room was quite cold even with the thermostat set to the max Paid AND limited wifi It s almost 2017 and my mobile internet roaming fees are lower than what the hotel charges for wifi there s definitely something wrong here , Nice and welcoming staff Clean Very good location
378636,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Wi Fi is not free and very very slow the room we stayed needs a repair walls looked awful shower equioment worked bad , Good location close to the rail staion 
378637,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No breakfast included the minibar completely empty Not even a bottle of water You must pay for wifi at a 4 star hotel Poor cleaning services in the room TOO MUCH NOISE , The location
378638,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The price for the Wi Fi Also most of the tv channels had no English as an option , The location of the hotel was also amazing undergeound access at 100mNice features were the shoe polishing stations 
378639,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Rooms are pretty small and ceilings are kinda low so it doesn t feel too comfy Also not including free in room WiFi at this day and age should be unforgivable , Location is truly great for shopping and walking around 
378640,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, There were no small personal hygiene stuff like shower cap The bathroom is inserted in the room and there is a glass door separating them it is quite small also All in all the price is really good for a Vienna accommodation , Nice modern and clean place Very close to the subway station and even closer to main shopping street in Vienna Mariastrasse it leads straight to the Museums Quartier and to the Rathauss The breakfast is rich in all the goods stuff I will highly recommended it to everyone Enjoy it 
378641,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, classic Leonardo Hotel rooms are small no free internet it s 5 Euro a day and not fast , perfect location heart of the city staff has been very kind rich and nice breakfast 
378642,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, 2 aspects door of the bathroom is designed from glass and do not close properly the taxi asked for 2 30 pm arrived at 3 pm, Nice quiet friendly environment 
378643,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No toiletries in the bathroom no shampoo conditioner I have asked reception they only had body wash and the quality of the ones on the bathroom wall very poor Breakfast not very good no fresh fruits Staff was friendly good housekeeping thank you,No Positive
378644,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The wi fi should be provided for free Instead you get it for 3 Eur per day or 6 Eur if you need higher speeds, Excellent location at the end of Mariahilferstrase next to tube and train station Confortable bed and helpful staff
378645,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Our room was 20 m2 and it wasn t enough space for us We have 2 small children But everything was ok overall We stayed only 3 nights , The subway is 200 meters away At the reception very nice people 
378646,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Bathroom had no door it had a sliding door which was not ettanch it didnt close properly so we were very uncomfortable when using bathroom no privacy And a very very small room , Bed comfy silent place
378647,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No free WiFi Very expensive if you want to use it Having said that they have three free internet computer terminals for guest use in reception but not very private , Good location nice room lovely breakfast choice quiet and comfortable 
378648,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Wow this was one of the best hotels that I ve stayed at with this price Wonderful location that is very convenient Great large room For 10 euros an hour a private sauna and jacuzzi in the basement Perfect stay for a couple we would go back a hundred times more

378651,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The stuff wasnt very nice rather ok Its unbelievable that there is no free wifi in 2016 The room was very cold They mixed up the rooms what we ordered , The room was ok
378652,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Maybe the elevator i wanted to go from the first floor to the third one But the elevator took me to the garage than to the 6th floor and than to the 3rd, Yes it was pretty good place BTW i did not have to pay for the wifi the receptionist told me that he could give me the password for free
378653,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, when the room was cleaned the tea cups were not cleaned or replaced no free wifi, a walking distance to the main shopping street the metro station the train station and my favourite restaurant Vapiano Excellent breakfast amazing hommos Each food is labelled unlike many 4 star hotels for example pork and turkey are separated and labelled Quick professional staff There is a nice relaxation lounge at the 8th floor offering water coffe apples and internet free of charge AND a beautiful view 
378654,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The bathroom was extremely small but very functional The heating was very hard to turn down the hotel was very hot This is not unusual in europe it all seems to be excessively heated in hotels and shops Fortunately the windows opened for some fresh air , The staff were really helpful with information and bookings We had an early check out before breakfast room was open and they organised a bag with bread rolls fruit and juice to take to the airport I think the lady at reception was called Daniella we found her ever so helpful The room was clean and comfy and the bed and pillows were great The location of the hotel is brilliant a lovely 15 minute walk through a shopping street to the centre or the metro stop is very close to the hotel 
378655,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The choice of movie in the room 12 5 per movie worth it comfortable bed pillow so clean tea coffe water boiler in the room Location was excellent
378656,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No wifi in bedrooms There are 3 computers in reception which are free for guests but not as convenient as having wifi in the room Booked a room for 3 people Extra bed wasn t very comfortable , Great location Few minutes walk from main Westbahnhof train station and subway Also from the main shopping street at Mariahilfer Good choice at breakfast of hot and cold foods
378657,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Breakfast was good room clean view was nice Stuff is friendly esp the reception guy called Khalil Very friendly and nice person Location is good walking distance to the center Alex 
378658,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The hotel is a little far from the city center so it s a bit of a walk and you may need to take a cab , The room was comfortable and nice Some good restaurants around though 
378659,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Room size was too small Even there was no enough space for luggage Toilet carpet slippers were not available , Location and cleanliness Cooperative staff 
378660,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, You have to pay for wifi no free wifi in the lobby , Elegant hotel located very conveniently next to the main train station mariahilfer strasse and underground stations Great breakfast very very clean and the staff is great also 
378661,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Too noisy And if you will have the same considerate neighbours as we had who were slamming with doors all night you won t sleep a minute ,No Positive
378662,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Very poor facilities Was asked to return the glass to the bar in which i had to take ice as there is no room service Breakfast with very limited choice Lucky that i couldnt get booking for 3 nights as originally planned and escaped with a one night stay,No Positive
378663,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Housekeeping staff should close the windows after they finish esp during the summer , Great location very friendly staff and always accommodation to our needs 
378664,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, For three of us they gave a double room with extra bed They should not have done that because the rooms are not big enough for that Everything seemed to have an extra cost from Internet to parking to breakfast All of it too expensive The breakfast was industrial grade not good The room cleaning service was inadequate arriving very late A four star hotel should have done better , The location is decent near the Mariahilferstrasse shopping area and the Westbahnhof metro with easy access into the center 
378665,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, nothing , Location was perfect near to metro station central train station near to Mariahilf street Shopping food street Reception staff was very good when I arrived the checking in procedure took me 5 min only what ever I asked they give to us also the staff smiling all time also when I checked out it took 5 min and they did not charge me more than the price that I got from booking I would stay in the hotel if I visit Vienna again Billa 
378666,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The parking garage is very narrow Hard to get in and out Internet could be given free in such hotel as a base service , Everything concerning the accommodation service and comfort 
378667,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The car park is a slim parking lot which difficult to park a medium size car and easy to scratch The room is small like room size in Tokyo The reception desk staff need training as they show no respect to guests They looks very busy in juggling with different task and show impatience to guest Of course no smile on face at all It may be the workload are over their capability or manpower is inadequate , The hotel apparently refurnished lately Staff in coffee shop of ground floor are helpful and attentive The house keeping is good Good location if you getting around by public transportation Next to shopping district with restaurants and shops There is a relax bar at top floor for free entry for exercise bottle water apples and desktop computer which close at 9pm daily 
378668,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, actually the location for all interesting place is good very near however the westbannhof is a special place if you want to visit more things until night it is a bit dangerous to go back by subway, this hotel is clean and good service
378669,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Plenty of cheap hotels offer free good quality internet The fact that Hotel Leonardo only offers a paid not very fast option is disappointing , Staff was very helpful rooms were very clean and comfy overall it was a pleasant stay 
378670,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Lack of free Wi Fi is annoying feels like step back in time The bathroom design is not great and so would not recommend if this is an early in the relationship weekend away , Good location with about a 10 to 15 minute walk into the old area of the city Useful reading light by bedside 
378671,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Didn t like that I have to pay extra for wifi Very disapointing Refused to do it and won t comeback because of that I just think it s cheap to charge extra for what should be complimentary ,No Positive
378672,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The hotel was a bit crowded A little lack of character, The location is very convenient next to WestBanhof station and Mariahilfe Strasse with a lot of shops The bed very comfortable The room on the small side but has everything including a kettle and safe
378673,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Can t really fault anything a bigger bathroom would have been nice but thats just my personal preference , Breakfast buffet and staff were superb 
378674,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The carpet in the rooms needs cleaning it had stains all over There are no connecting rooms for families It would be nice if wifi was free , Everything was great we always stay at this hotel when we are in Vienna 
378675,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, I opted for an early check in more than a month before my arrival In spite of this I was given the room at 15 10 though we asked for it at 10 00 A group of travellers arrived at 15 00 and were immediately directed to their rooms thus obstructing all the lifts , Location Facilities at the hotel Cleanliness Breakfast 
378676,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, our room in the attic and its bathroom were very small and impractical in usage see photo underground garage with very narrow entrance and exit lane, location choice and quality of breakfast buffet
378677,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The fact that the rooms pictures on Booking com were showing them more spacious than they are The first day I arrived I saw one towel in the bathroom with some dirt on it the supposedly sliding door was not sliding properly Also you could have added some toilet kit and slippers Moreover I didn t have my room cleaned the next morning although I did have the sign on the door , The location and how close it is to 2 stations The helpful receptionists 
378678,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The bathroom had a slide door with which the room was not 100 separated from the sleeping space The path to the parking lot is too narrow because of it parking takes a lot of time , The room is well equipped the TV is impressively big screen the water heater is really convenient for morning coffee The place of the hotel is the best it can be the West Bahnhof is literally on the next corner with all the public transport Shops are nearby as well 
378679,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The reception staff were efficient but not particularly friendly or helpful Our original booking via Booking com was for a twin room I was travelling with my adult son Two weeks before travelling I contacted the hotel direct to confirm that twin room arrangement On arrival we were allocated a double room When I queried this I was advised that the hotel was full and nothing could be done We managed , I was visiting with my 21 year old son The location was excellent for access to Westbahnhof Ubahn travel and return bus travel to the airport 
378680,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Air conditioning not walking during heat wave on first floor and that is where they put us knowing this to be the case Had to change rooms Rooms and bathroom very small , Location near to train station and shopping but fair walk to Museum Quarter Provided fresh apples and doing in lobby and although small nice ambience 
378681,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The air conditioning was broken and we couldn t open the window due to the busy main road We were given fans and it was suggested that everything would be fixed the following day After a hot night the air con was not fixed the following day But luckily the reception staff were very accommodating and found us a new room , The location is great right near the metro The rooms are nicely decorated and clean There are lovely views from the relaxing room on the top floor 
378682,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Free Wifi should be standard in my view, Great place only a few minutes away by subway from the historic centre of Vienna and even closer to Schloss Schoenbrunn
378683,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The red light in the bathroom is not bright enough for inserting contact lenses etc The timer for the bathroom light seems a little pointless and it is annoying , comfortable single mattress double bed central location very clean modern interior
378684,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Paying extra for internet, Easy stay easy checkin Perfect hotel if you need a comfy nice hotel close to the train station and shopping area Very clean 
378685,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The staff although not too unpleasant to myself or my partner were very rude to some guests regarding small scale questions and issues The staff can make or break a stay at a hotel The wifi was also a disappointment first you have to pay 7 for 24 hours and it didn t even work on the second floor this was mentioned to the staff twice and they eventually gave us a new wifi voucher which also did not work It would have been nice to eat at the hotel however we were told the restaurant is only for group tours , The hotel itself was clean and well looked after in a brilliant location with ease of getting around Vienna as it is close to a main train station and metro system The breakfast was an added bonus well worth 13 plenty of options from continental to hot food including dairy and gluten free options 
378686,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, There was mold in bathroom There seemed to be an issue with AC as it randomly shut off after a few minutes leaving the room rather uncomfortable The tv had a similar issue where it would not completely shut off but go to a blue screen leaving us unable to shut it off completely and it would then stay like this for several hours sometimes , The location of the hotel is really great close to Westbahnof making it easy to get around in the city The staff in the lobby were really friendly and provided us with maps and information on how to get around 
378687,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The room was excellent and the hotel was very close to the U Bahn station which made it easy to get to Stephenplatz and also to the airport The staff were also very helpful 
378688,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The staff at breakfast were a bit ridiculous we were in a rush to sit down and eat as we had to check out and leave not long after we ate We told them we wanted to pay for the two of us to have breakfast and the man behind the counter couldn t understand what we were saying even though we were holding money to show him He then called over another staff member and we told her we would like to pay for the breakfast she then called over ANOTHER staff member who finally took our money and let us eat It took about 12 minutes for a 1 minute job to be done and it was all a bit ridiculous , The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly whenever we needed to book a taxi or to ask any questions The rooms were nicely decorated if not a little small The hotel is decorated well and has a nice modern feeling to it 
378689,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The bathroom door did not open well it had a slide system that was broken and opening it from the inside was therefore almost impossible The hotel did not have free wi fi and the charge for breakfast was very high in my opinion , The most important things in the room were in good shape nice bed and bathroom tv etc Room seemed to have been renovated recently Good air conditioning 
378690,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Very close to Mariahilfestrasee for shopping area and the center Big parking with elevator just underground Staff very friendly and helpfull Rooms modern big confortable well fitted for a 4 stars and impecablly clean A big plus for the wonderfull breakfast Difficult to find something missing A great time passed here We would return any time 10 
378691,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, WiFi in rooms is 5eur per day I can t remember that I have stayed lately in some hotel which charges this service There are 3 computers in the lobby with free internet true but so early 2000s We took non refundable offer and the room was small with tiny bathroom and not so nice view We stayed just two nights after our great summer vacation so we didn t want to bother with complaining Not so bad hotel in general but my worst hotel decision , Location was ok near to Westbanhof station metro lines shopping area Clean and decent 
378692,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No free wifi with the rate I booked although I knew this in advance Sliding frosted glass door on bathroom that doesn t give enough privacy when staying with a friend House keeping lady knocked on the door at 11 30am even though I had a do not disturb sign on it told me she needed to clean the room and seemed confused when I told her to come back at 12 when I checked out Air con in room was very weak and didn t seem to go below 19 degrees , Good location Modern clean hotel Reception staff helpful and friendly Decent sized room Very good value for money 
378693,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Our toilet was blocked which housekeeping would have realized had they made up our room but they didn t and we needed to leave our room to use the bathroom, Location
378694,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, We could hear the room above but that s possibly because it was occupied by children who are heavier footed Internet was a bit of a pain We tried to go without but the free access lobby ones were not working so we relented and bought a 24 hour pass You really need it for looking up restaurants and attractions more than anything else It really is strange why they don t include it in the cost of the room , Nice room gym and bar if required
378695,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Breakfast either include in room deal or lower price, Didn t purchase breakfast simply because of the price hotel clean and staff friendly breakfast is overpriced and I thought wasn t really value for money
378696,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Internet was very patchy, Well located easy walking distance to the historical centre Best of all they allowed us to book in early after a flight from australia Which was very much appreciated 
378697,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, very small rooms opaque sliding door on bathroom which slid open when using toilet Air con not great , Good location for use of underground and bus services
378698,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, I will never come back here because of staff attitude It all comes on check in which was disaster firstly they asked me for guarantee I gave them my gold visa card but then it appeared that I have to pay advance they treated us like scam although it was my 5th visit of this hotel Then every time before we got a free internet this time they charged it When I told about my disappointment nobody paid attention At the check out day room service 5 times came in our room in early morning and disturb us so we were tired and exhausted on our way back From every angle it was horrible accommodation , it was the hotel that I often came
378699,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Our room was too small It looks like half size of what we booked Over bed is too low ceiling and it is not possible to come out in bed normally , Hotel is nice and on good location 
378700,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Every thing cost money They do not tell me that smoking not allowed and when i checked out they payed me 250 yoro for smoking Also parking by 18 yoro for one night I booked 2 room near to each other but When i arrived the girls in reception told me because they are too much guests they can not let the rooms next to each other And i had big problem because i have small kids they can not set a lone, No thing
378701,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The bathroom is tin not accessible for large people The Internet is slow and u need to fill a new user and password everyday There is no restaurant in the hotel so if ur hungry at night ur on ur own, The location is perfect you can t ask for better than this The room is comfortable and the A C is really good
378702,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The room facilities were not upto the mark we were made to change the room three times staff was rude If the hotel cannot cope with increased visitors they need to hire more staff , the breakfast was ok
378703,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Not the hotels fault but we were charged 48 for a 10 trip in a taxi People should be aware , Very helpful staff Good breakfast Well placed for using public transport 
378704,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, We stayed for three nights they put some one else s name on the tv screen in the room to welcome the staff was not much cooperative they didn t clean the rooms everyday and the towels were soap tea bags were not refilled breakfast was ok as we were vegetarian the common toilet at ground floor was filled with urine and was smelling a lot our washroom sliding door was not closing and open for all three days , nothing in this hotel 
378705,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, At this class wi if should be free It s free every other hotel that we stayed at along the Doneau And I Like To Connect My Own devIce In orDer To Get Email Etc Breakfast was too expensive so we passed on it , Nice clean hotel near the shops but not the Wien attractions but that didn t bother us Nice touch is the exercise room upstairs with nice views and large screen TV Although wi if is not free they have 3 computers in the lobby so you can get on the Internet 
378706,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, We booked 2 double rooms as we have 2 kids But we were accommodated on different floors The metal cover of the telephone shower was broken and as a result very sharp that cut my neck skin and I had blood on the towels We also had flood from the ceiling in the second room and changed again ,No Positive
378707,Leonardo Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Leonardo Hotel Vienna is a good situated Hotel nearby the Westbahnhof West train station and next to the main shopping street Mariahilferstra e The Hotel is very modern and the rooms are clean It was the 2nd time I stayed in Leonardo Hotel Vienna and it was not the last time 
378708,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The air conditioning system could be better maintained it was a little bit stinky on the corridors from time to time A water in the shower had a little bit unstable temperature sometimes it needed few minutes to stabilize between cold and hot The shower cubicle had small traces of dirt As far as I remember there was no option to turn on off the main light using bed switches it s slightly inconvenient but not a big deal The room was quite small but comfortable , The room was rather silent and dark when curtains were used moreover the bed was big so it was comfortable to sleep in Leonardo Location was great and staff kind and helpful 
378709,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No free wifi but online computer is available in hall Each morning we are disturbed by strange knocking not sure from guest or cleaner , Perfect location 3Min to U bahn clean and comfortable 
378710,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The front desk staff were not helpful at all No tourist info for sightseeing etc the rack where the had city highlight to visit was very poorly stocked and none in English , Breakfast was great and helpful to get us started 
378711,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, None to report , Excellent location for exploring the City Hotel provides a good service all round Staff are polite cheerful and helpful Room was comfortable and clean 
378712,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Glass door to the bathroom which is poor insulation against sound so NOT a good idea Internet was very good but you had to pay a daily rate for this and these days very very few hotels charge so that was a surprise , Room was very good and very nicely decorated and furnished However having a glass door that fitted very badly into the frame was poor Glass doors are not good for bathrooms Breakfast was excellent Staff were helpful and friendly A great location and easy to get anywhere your heart may want you to go 
378713,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, We did not have breakfast We did not want to pay the 13 The hotel caters to groups that use the restaurant but as individual travelers we were not able to take any meals in their restaurant Smoking was not discouraged , Because we were not able to take any meals in the hotel we found a wonderful award winning restaurant just outside the entrance Zum Hagenthaler 
378714,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Too small and complicated way to access to parking Also complications resulted from use of access cards A little bit pricy The deduct some part of the money in advance No Wi fi only pre paid , Flexibility to cancel up to almost same day Good location on a calm and even centric area Good breakfast but pricy Clean and very new 
378715,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The bathroom had a sliding glass door which didn t close completely the internet was very expensive and slow the room felt very small overall with the exception of the location the hotel was disappointing , The location of the hotel
378716,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Room was small Wifi paid which is too cheapskate Did not clean our rooms for both nights We asked for new towels in turn but received floor clothes We had 3 floor clothes and no towel at last Housekeeping next door was very early in the morning and vacuum cleaners and cleaning ladies were super annoying They chatted loudly as hell and woke us up every morning , Good location next to west station Free fitness facilities Breakfast was fine 
378717,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, I always stay there but the last 2 stays I noticed that the service quality is going down Wifi was awful Disconnecting all the time Did not replaced the tea or coffee in the room There was no complimentary water in the room after check in They said they forgot to put it But it was the same on my previous stay Woke up one day with construction noise at 8 15 in the morning Drilling Hammering When I called the reception they said the elevator company has no other time ,No Positive
378718,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, I got the room on first floor with ugly view And no other rooms available to change however to wander and travel around the most beautiful city let me forgot everythings , I stayed the second three nights here altogether six nights It located near west bahnhof and shopping street If you want to go out of town i recommended this hotel Delicious breakfast should hv more soups will be perfect 
378719,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, No toiletry even sleepers unless you asked for it They provided body and hair shampoo only The staffs hardly smile I believe their smile will light up the hotel Anyway I like their service , Good location nice food clean room I stay first three nights on the third floor having nice view and quiet room 
378720,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Very small bathroom very narrow and inconvenient garage I scratched my car Expensive breakfasts 13 euro per person with nothing special to offer better to have breakfast outside in Mariahilfer gasse , Nice location with approx 25 min walk to center of Vienna nice personnel and clean and elegant rooms but standard very small with very small bathroom

378778,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Heat controls in the room were a bit erratic in the living room it would get really cold at times even though the temperature was set to 25C in the bedroom we woke up in the morning with a sauna like temperature It was indeed very challenging to get the car in and out of the private parking without any scratch If needed ask for assistance from a friend or even from a staff member , Very friendly and helpful staff Room was neat and clean modern looking very pleasant Breakfast was buffet style and had everything I needed to start the day Location was perfect a 10 minutes walk from Hofburg through Mariahilferstrasse

378780,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The hotel receives an extra point for having its own parking however the access to it is way too narrow Was a bit nervous before leaving the garage but did feel comfortable knowing that my car is in a safe place Another minus would be the omlette which did not seemed to be made out of fresh eggs but rather from powdered ones Its a pity because overall the food was good including the pancakes , The location is just great and very easy to reach The rooms are clean and the view is awesome 
378781,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, WiFi not included in base price Soooo last decade Also annoying to have all the advertsements everywhere to try to upsell to some club with free WiFi , Good location OK breakfast
378782,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, They charge for internet 6EUR day It might be a deal breaker for someone especially when wifi is free of charge in most European hotels , Location staff dedication facilities
378783,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, They have an underground parking for a 18euro night To be honest is terrible I do not suggest to park there because I personally have scratched my car I m attaching some pictures where you can see that all the walls and doors are damaged because of the small space With a 4 door saloon car you have to be carelful about entering and leaving the parking I told the hotel s stuff what happend and they do not care They told me that they do not have complains and I should fix my car on my ensurance Also they told me that the parking is not theirs is rented and they are not reaponsable for any damages Now my question is why pay 18euro night for a service that a good hotel shoud offer for free in the proce for the room Shirtly said I was dissapointed because there was no manager yo talk to and the ladies from the reception are not helpful at all My personal opinion is that is a pitty that one nice hotel chain like Leonardo having a good image has to suffer because of some small problems that are able to fix My sugestion is please fix and enlarge the entry from each floor of the parking , The hotel is modern the rooms are clean comfortable and nice but a bit small 
378784,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Not too much restaurants in that area but we managed , Excellent hotel and perfect location for shopping train stations Staff were very very helpful and friendly yet professional Breakfast was very good as well Would definetly re visit when in Vienna

378786,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, In the era of developed internet wifi is charged in the rooms It could have been incorporated slightly in the room rate rather than this option , A very clean comfortable hotel very well located Staff more than pleasant and helpful Excellent breakfast offer Very very good value for the product 
378787,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Extra charge for wi fi Parking overload when asked in reception where else to park they directed us to a private parking which would cost appx 20 euros per day it cost 44 4 euros for 26 hours When compained we received complimantery wi fi vouchers They know that people have paid about 75 euros on surrounding private parkings , Location rooms are nice 
378788,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Stuff is not very friendly In the morning we announced that we will leave the car in the garage but when we arrived there was no free space although it was said we don t have to reserve it After us a few more cars came and no one had nowhere to park Totaly chaos And not to mention that garage is awful lack of parking space so narrow that you have to be very careful not to scratch your car , Good price location ok but still 30 40 minutes walking distance to St Stephen s Cathedral 
378789,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, So strange a 4 hotel which asks 6 for wifi It is the first time I see it and I saw alot of similar hotels , Located not in the center but very close to the metro Nice staff they hosted us in the executive lounge even if ee came before check in time

378792,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The only bad thing about it is the underground parking The tight place you have to pass through when you arrive or leave But it is understandable because of the good and central location the hotel has Be careful if you park in front of the hotel till you make the reception Me myself got a ticket from the police for leaving the car for 15 minutes , I booked 2 nights at this hotel and everything was great The breakfast was so good and there was plenty of food to choose from The room was great also and the bathroom big and nice The staff was very glad to help you with anything you demanded or asked 
378793,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Very low quality breakfast inelegant lobby and restaurant small room and bathroom slippers upon request low quality soap in dispensers instead of amenities they charge wi fi 6 24hours for an extremely low speed internet, New and clean rooms good location if you want to use metro and tram very close to the market of Mariahilfer Stra e

378798,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, The superior rooms were so small and the bathroom had sliding glass doors which you can see people sitting on the toilet and showering The glass door didn t fit properly which meant there was a half inch gap between the door and wall when shut you could see quite clearly into the room No proper clothes space We were told there was a restaurant but it was only for breakfast which made Christmas difficult for meals The free Wifi was never working throughout the stay of 5 days and as we had to upgrade to a suite for more space we were supposed to have high speed wifi in the room this was non existence Very disappointed and would have moved straight away to another hotel if we hadn t already paid in full for our stay , Staff were friendly
378799,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Toilet sliding door is made of glass so there is extremely poor privacy More than that this door is narrower than a doorway Wi fi is not included , Friendly and helpful staff room was warm and cosy beds were comfortable free tea coffee are available during the stay Location is hard to beat there s everything you need shops restaurants and westbahnhof railway station City center is about 1 5 km away from the hotel
378800,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, Smallish shower , Excellent location by the train station You don t want to be carrying your luggage all around town and look like a tourist so being across the street was key for us Good size room for the money Breakfast was tasty and had normal food The staff speak very fluent English and were super helpful when we asked about the sights to see and how to get there Definitely great quality for the money I will tell my friends to stay there when they visit 
378801,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, As with most hotels in Vienna breakfast is not included It costs 10 and I found it quite mediocre Fortunately there are plenty of caf s in the neighbourhood The bathroom also felt a bit small for a superior suite The shower was fine but the washbasin and the area around it was a bit cramped But it s a small matter Over all I was very pleased with my stay , This hotel really has the perfect location Right across the street from the subway hub Westbahnhof and at the start of the popular shopping street Mariahilferstrasse The rooms are comfy with a really comfortable bed and a work desk I booked a superior suite The general standard was good and the rooms are clean and tidy

378829,Leonardo Hotel Vienna, When I made the booking booking com said the Wi Fi is free but it turned out otherwise I made a complaint to booking com then they replied that their page didn t said it s free I provided proof that they changed the desciption after I made the complaint and then they apologized and offered to refund the Wi Fi charge Still it s very short sighted for a 4 star hotel to charge EUR 6 per day for the Wi Fi there are plenty of hotels with free Wi Fi in the area not to say in Vienna ,No Positive
