280968,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The ceiling started leaking water at midnight in a decrepit old room with air condition that didn t work and a loud hum They moved us the next day to another decrepit old room with no apology or compensation The new room had two sinks one didn t drain The hair dryer didn t work The air conditioner in the new room didn t work either Zero help from the staff and never an apology for our family of fives trouble Four star hotel I think not It s three stars at best The hotel is on its last legs Dated everything with regards to walls rooms and furniture Save your money and look elsewhere , Nothing Horrible hotel and horrible service

280971,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Closest Metro is 1Km away and the line is not very well connected which means you always had to switch somewhere Some of the buildings we saw from our room look depressing Couldn t turn the AC off , The hotel is close to the beach there is an area full of restaurants It s also quite close to the Zoo a bit further than the nearest Metro station There is a bus line in the front street that can take you directly to the Aquarium Nice breakfast choices ice cava was a novelty Large room The view well if you see the sea it s ok the sunrise was quite orange Restaurant made a cream soup for our kid although it s not on their menu

280979,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Nothing to complain about on our visit , Excellent location for the beach short drive costing approximately 7 euros to the La Ramblas Excellent facilities friendly staff 
280980,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Some minor details like some cracks in the swimming pool The bathroom could be fixed it was functional but the faucet was loose and the ceiling had minor water damages , location is perfect Close to the Port close enough to the metro This area used to be very nice when it was remodeled for the Olympics It is still clean and safe to walk back to the hotel after midnight with the family

280986,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Carpet needs to be replaced at least in first floor hallways Lots of pet stains and even dog fecies , Great breakfast varied options something for everyone
280987,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The wooden furnitures for the tv doors were old and look rather run down Need refurbishing The breakfast was sufficient however not too variety for daily basis same menu every day Shld have different menu on different days and we were there for 5 days so it gets rather repetitive The hot towel rack is not working The chair legs for sitting down in room 408 was somehow loose and sideway The design of the chair legs are not safe friendly as it s jutting out Thus many times accidentally kicked it, The location of the hotel is near the beach and restaurants at beach local cafes Bus stop is also nearby Quiet Friendly staffs and allow for early check in and slightly late check out We managed to get our room early when checked in 
280988,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, I stayed at the hotel for my hen party I was with 13 others ages ranging from 20 s to 70 The hotel catered for us all perfectly The hotel staff were really friendly and got us checked in as fast as possible The hotel is lovely looking very modern and clean We spent most of our time drinking fizz by the pool it was heaven The rooms are spacious we had 3 to a room there was a very large bathroom mirror which enabled us all to get ready together The breakfast in the hotel is amazing well worth the money if you book it for 3 days it s 13 instead of 15 They also serve cava with breakfast The hotel is a very short walk to the gorgeous beach 
280989,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Extremely noisy air conditioning Shouting inebriated British hotel guests around the pool , Spacious family room comfortable beds Nice swimmimg pool and outdoor terrasse but shame the jacuzzi had no bubbles 
280990,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Some of the staff weren t the warmest and the room was cleaned to a basic level with towels not replaced etc , Location is great just by the beach and many restaurants Great little pool too A little dated in places but overall good hotel Breakfast also good 
280991,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, A lads outing over the weekend meant that the swimming pool was taken over by rowdy men that wasn t a good atmosphere for a relaxing family holiday, Location was good
280992,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Bit far out and not much around hotel, 5 mins walk to the beach with a decent sized pool 5 10 mins walk to metro Bit too far from hub of Barcelona to walk it
280993,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Service could have been better not enough waiters during peak hours , Great location only 2 streets away from the beach Great connection with the city centre bus in front of the hotel straight to PLaza Catalunya 
280994,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, beds too small mattress uncomfortable carpets in the hallways dirty stained smelly looks old overall the rating on booking com overrated for this 4 start hotel , personal friendly helpful
280995,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Cheaper price would be nicer We only paid this much as it was a birthday treat Not in our usual price range but worth it as a one off , Ideal location within walking distance to beach bars food shops public transport Excellent secure parking for our car Staff superb Great to have an e tea bed for our young son but still plenty of space in our room Couldn t fault it 
280996,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, I would have liked healthier cereal options with breakfast eg All Bran or muesli, Within walking distance of Hop on hop off by s stop as well as the beach
280997,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Weren t allowed to eat snacks around the pool that had been shop bought Nothing major but little frustrating , Good location only 5 min walk to Marine clean and spacious rooms 
280998,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The rooms were a bit dated and old The bathroom shower leaked a lot and made the floor slippy and dangerous , Location perfect for the beach and local restaurants
280999,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The bed lighting if I recall correctly was a hard over bright study lamp style rather than warm and soft lighting That s all , Being near the beach made for a lovely short walk The neighborhood was clean and quiet The dining area was lovely and service was good I m glad we weren t interested in the pool because a big noisy fun loving crowd dominated the space but it was a small pool The atmosphere was pleasant For a small room it was well designed The bed was comfortable We enjoyed our meals there The jazz music played in the lobby was an extra nice touch We had never been to Barcelona before As African Americans we ve had a variety of experiences abroad generally positive with a sprinkling of stupidity but that can taint a vacation and leave deep impressions We know to check in with people who look like us first but we heard nothing but good things Icaria reinforced that view it was our very first stop and we felt very comfortable there We even felt a little sad that when we returned to Barcelona a week later we were staying elsewhere 
281000,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, A bit far away from main attractions but transport right outside door However the beach is close and gorgeous , Friendly staff Helpful with advice on getting around and good degree of comfort The pool and indoor outdoor dining ideal for weather conditions Like a mini resort 
281001,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The facilities are older The shower was hard to figure out and made a loud noise at times Sometimes the AC worked at times it didn t We could have requested to have this looked at but we didnt because we were either headed out for the day out or tired Being close to the beach loud party animals voices echo through the streets We requested taxis to and from the airport because we needed a car seat Only once did they get our info wrong and we had to take a taxi without a car seat Now I learned about the aero bus and we took that the last trip These are not reasons not to stay here we will definitely stay here again for the breakfast , The staff was friendly and always helpful Large safe in room big enough for our laptops The breakfast was amazing the all you can eat espresso and mimosas was worth the stay You can eat a large breakfast and then not eat tapas until 2or 3 The hotel is right next to the beach but heat and sand can be tough for a toddler so we visited the pool more than the beach The pool is all one deepness Our toddler was the only one everyone else was adults so all the chairs were taken for sunbathers and no one was really in the pool We just waited until a chair became free The pool was quiet so we felt we had to keep our voices down The pool had a bar tender so the whole family enjoyed the pool The hotel is walking distance to the beach and beach restaurants It is also easy to get a taxi or jump on buses I wish there were more cafes around it but we walked down and found some It can be a little ghost town after 10pm but we stayed out until 12am yes with our toddler but it was completely safe We found Barcelona very child friendly with playgrounds almost in every block Instead of requesting expensive taxis to and from the airport because of car seats Take the aerobus It will drop you at the Plaza de Espanya Enjoy some of the cafes in that neighborhood and then get the H16 bus to the hotel Cheap and the busses have AC car seat problem solved 
281002,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Bathroom could have been better Radiator and hand rail not fixed to the wall Very well, Breakfast was really good with hot food And bed was lovely and comfortable
281003,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, 6 days of stay and only 3 or 4 cleanings of the room Bad breakfasts Broken a c because it was turning off when we were entering our room Bad smells in the halls Noisy pool under the window Definitely didn t worth 1100 euros , Close to Nova Ikaria beach 
281004,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Hotel is pretty nice but some spaces could use sprucing for the 200 a night we paid There aren t many restaurants or services like a farmacia nearby Public lobby bathroom wasn t too clean Everything else was spotless , The breakfast was good value The room was nice just smaller than expected Amenities were all there and staff was nice Morning group was very attentive and helpful Evening not so much but I only speak Spanish not Catalan The famous cemetery is only two blocks away Room was climate controlled and comfy beds were great Pool closed a little early for our group 
281005,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, no jacuzzi basic swimming pool basic comfort, Very well located for party beach and foodlife Shopping mall 5 min walk away that stays open till late friendly staff awesome if your planning to spend a lot of time at VIlla Olimpico
281006,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The sun beds are really in need of an upgrade lots really are in a bad way Unfortunately the hotel had several stag parties etc staying the staff cope so well but it makes you hang your head in shame to see some brits abroad , Stayed many times back in September the staff make you feel so welcome and they really value you as a returning guest

281012,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, This Hotel should NOT be a 4 stars The staff was not very helpful or professionnel I would not recommend it or even go back the price vs quality is not good We had a bad experience , The breakfast and its proximity to the public transports 
281013,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The fact that the hotel allows stag and hen parties This spoilt our stay and I wouldn t recommend the hotel for this reason I m disappointed that this isn t mentioned in the hotel details because I wouldn t have booked this hotel , The hotel is very nice the staff are great and the breakfast was excellent 
281014,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, A group of about 30 men in their thirties at the pool drunk and yelling during the afternoon This lasted at least 2 hours after that we left tired of it So we could not use the pool and could not rest in our room either since my room was facing the pool on the 4th floor I ask for the manager but I was told he was in a meeting Later I asked again no more success Therefore I could only address the front desk who told me these guys were also customers so there was nothing they could do Details the carpet in the corridor is dirty the hotel overall does not deserve 4 stars, Room was good
281015,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Had problems with our shower A new hose was installed and it was way too short so we had to hold it above our heads They replaced it the following morning though without any problems I would look out of our window over the pool every morning I thought it was funny that the same English people went shuffling down to throw their towel over their sunbeds They d then go off to breakfast I find this very selfish and unfair to other residents I arrived the same time as a few hen do s They were all well behaved until 4 in the morning when they came back drunk and with no respect for others This is not a reflection on the hotel at all as they have signs up asking people to show respect if they come back late , Good location near to beach Breakfast choice was great Secure parking for motorbikes Staff very friendly 
281016,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, They need to give real soap instead of that foam handwash soap they give you to use as a shower gel and shampoo Its really nonsensical because you cant get a lather to take a proper shower , It was clean and in a very safe and good location to restaurants shopping and beach
281017,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Staff were friendly but when asked reception for a couple of things and neither times we were provided even though they stated they would I e the first night we forgot toothpaste I had emailed the hotel a couple of times prior to my visit as it was a special stay for my partner his 30th birthday but again had no reply , Facilities were nice 
281018,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The hotel is very outdated it really could do with being modernized The pool area however is modern lovely , Very easy to walk to the beach the beach clubs in the evening
281019,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Evening menu was not great quality of food was not reflective in the price Non alcoholic cocktails were very expensive 8 50 per drink Breakfast was very nice though 15 per guest was expensive, The beds were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned well every day

281021,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, less noise from hen parties , The staff were very friendly and helpful with bus and tourist attractions hotel short walk to beach and port olympic for super restaurants
281022,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Everything was ok including food but nothing was fantastic bar man made prices up changing prices doubling at times for same round of drinks really not worth the money as a hotel Lift was annoying if more than one person wanting to use and others calling it before your card registered , Everything was ok including food but nothing was fantastic bar man made prices up changing prices doubling at times for same round of drinks really not worth the money as a hotel Lift was annoying if more than one person wanting to use and others calling it before your card registered 
281023,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, I stayed at this 4 Star Hotel for 3 nights in May 2017 There was 7 of us so we had 4 rooms one being a junior suite My room was 550 for the stay Firstly I d like to say that this is NOT a 4 star hotel It s dated dirty over priced and the service is poor in every area The rooms are OKAY Basic a bit ugly and dated it felt like they were rushed to be finished bad painting jobs wonky canvases etc etc but there is a good size TV a wardrobe with a safe a mini fridge etc The beds are quite comfortable but the air conditioning is AWFUL and the cleaning service was quite poor The bathroom in particular didn t feel clean at all and it smelt a bit funny too one day we were left without towels and toilet paper My parents had the junior suite room which was NOT a suite Any suite room usually provides 2 rooms or areas a bedroom and an area with a sofa and a TV the only difference in the suites is that they are a bit bigger They also had terrible issues with the heat in their room and described it as dirty and uncomfortable Over 700 for 3 nights The reception and restaurant inside is okay Quite dated and a bit cheap worn but the pool area is nice and there s a large and very pleasant seating area for food and drinks outside One night we had some tapas from the restaurant which wasn t great pretty sure it was all bought frozen stuff but the cocktails were pretty yummy 10 each We also had breakfast every day at 15 per person per day it was quite nice but not really what you would expect for 15 Good bread some mini pastries meats eggs bacon yogurts etc but bad coffee from a hospital waiting room kind of machine , The pool and outside sitting was quite nice 
281024,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The air conditioner in our room was not working and the fist night was quite miserable We contacted the staff to assist with turning it on and was told the air would be turned on via computer The following day we phoned the hotel to turn the air on and to lower the temperature for that night We were told the air was broke , The hotel was in a good location The front dest staff helped us to obtain hop on hop off tickets and the pickup was near to the hotel The beach is close to the hotel as well

281026,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The pool was very cold It probably wasn t heated and they wait for the sun to heat it Nevertheless it was so cold that it was not really possible for my children to swim in it It was disappointing because this is the main reason we booked the hotel , Location was great In a quiet part of central Barcelona with little tourists Two blocks from the beach If you want a very central location downtown with tons of touristy bars then this is not the place If you want a relaxed atmosphere close to the beach it is great There are a few restaurants and a shopping mall catering more to locals nearby which is nice to get away from the crowds 35eur taxi from the airport 8 eur taxi to the La Rambla Some very nice restaurants right along the beach Park and zoo and aquarium nearby Excellent breakfast 
281027,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, It was in a very quiet area yet also close to beach and attractions the metro was a 10 15 minute walk away but there was a bus stop pretty much right in front of the hotel 
281028,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The air conditioning was not cooling the room at night I would prefer it if the pool is somewhat heated as my child could not swim , I love that there is room service where food were served more than the reasonable time expected and prices are very economical I also love that staff were very accommodating and friendly

281031,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Way too overpriced for such a generic place Gym is a joke rooms are very basic and stuffy Internet is awful and they said there was a hot tub which there really isn t The location is hit or miss depending on what you want Near the water which is amazing but far away from the action so you have to constantly take transit Depends what you want Overall I do not normally write reviews especially poor ones but I was very dissatisfied with the hotel Especially for the price they charge It s not worth it in my opinion , Nice patio area Especially when it s sunny 
281032,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, One small thing Better coffee in the room, I liked the room very clean and towels changed beds made EVERY day Staff were very helpful throughout our stay
281033,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, When I entered the main clock in the lobby was obviously broken That s not a good sign The hotel is horrible value for money at 200 per day The hallway carpets are filthy I checked into the room to find a broken toilet seat There is a smell of sewage effluence coming from the floor drain Spare pillows have no pillow covers Two nights I was woken up by loud groups in the hall at 3 00 a m And finally the tea pot to heat water did not work It is far from downtown Barcelona Bus 58 goes there but it takes a while Not a lot of great restaurants in the area , The beach walk was okay

281036,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Staff said they would book is a shuttle and provided confirmation The shuttle never arrived forcing us to get a taxi last minute They didn t care and didn t even apologise , It s a standard hotel not worthy of 4 stars 
281037,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The restaurant food was very poor The restaurant staff were untrained and English was very poor service was shocking The gym and sauna room didn t have changing areas access was via outside terrace which was impractical for the use of facilities , The hotel was immaculate the outside terrace was the best part of the hotel

281040,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, All of our party 6 adults all agreed that despite a good selection of food the buffet breakfast was spoiled by virtue of the hot food not being kept warm enough in the respective trays etc Overall the service in the restaurant was poor Upon leaving and settling our accounts payment for the dinner on our first evening was still outstanding despite the fact we had all paid cash This was eventually accepted by the management , Pleasant modern Hotel with excellent location bus stop outside from city centre

281051,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Location is good for the beach and Port Olympic however you ll need to rely on taxis to hit the gothic neighbourhood and Las Ramblas in the evening , Nice modern rooms good buffet breakfast with cava bikes available for rent 
281052,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, There was nothing 4 star about this place When we arrived there wasn t a soul at the reception floor no help was given with the luggage and the floors windows were dirty But that s nothing compared to the family room we were given for us and our 2 children Each time you opened or closed the bathroom door the whole lot of planks on the bathroom ceiling went up fell back down due to the change in the pressure making a huge noise similar to that of a building collapsing To top that up the noisy bathroom fan never went off the whole night There was mould around the shower and you could smell the damp throughout the room There was no duvet instead there was a very old blanket in between the sheets When we asked for the manager a girl whose outfit looked no better than the duvets with creased trousers and worn off shoes no make up came to the room She said we would ve sent the technical team to the room during the night We then spoke to the general manager who offered only to take 40 Euros off the 200 we had paid Breakfast was no different from the rest of the service We can cancelled our second night and left for another hotel with the 2 kids This place should be shut as it s not managed properly at all , Nothing

281055,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The fact that my room was not serviced I returned from meetings at 4pm and I had to ask for my room to be serviced The drunken hen party guests who monopolised the pool I had to adk the manager to quieten them down or I would call the police , Great location good facilities for the price This hitel used to be better value a couple of years ago

281266,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The only thing wrong was that the shower was a little temperamental , The barman was excellent Daniel Pool was clean but a little cool at this time of year The hotel was ideal for the Port Olympic area and was 5 mins from the beach The room was quite spacious for a family of 4 
281267,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Selection of foods were poor breakfast was cold , Room and pool area good but music around the pool too loud needed to be just background music to be able to relax 
281268,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, A very minor thing but it would be better for the tea and coffee facilities in the room to have UHT creamer rather than the powdered creamer which was absolutely awful , we didn t stay for food in the hotel I think the breakfast was over priced
281269,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Bar prices could be lower but it didn t spoil the 5 day break , Great location and great rooms Breakfast was good and plenty to choose from Staff very helpful and great with the kids Free Wi Fi in all areas 
281270,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, Very clean and cosy hotel one of the greatest breakfasts i ever had lots of things to chose from including champagne Good toiletries tea making facilities in the room 
281271,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Have stayed here many times in the past but will think twice in future No air conditioning and had silverfish insects in both bathrooms of both stays this month When i complained that i couldn t sleep because of the heat and lack of air conditioning i was told it was the hotel policy not to have air conditioning on in the winter My recent stay was April 7th that is not winter , Location good as always
281272,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The air conditioning wasnt turned on as it was too early in the season according to reception This meant we had to open the window overlooking a busy road to keep cool The main pool was absolutely freezing but the small pool hot tub was heated so we made do with that The location is a little far from the city centre which isnt necessarily bad however the local metro stop at Ciutadella Villa Olimpica doesnt have a lift so we had to carry the child up and down steps in the buggy Breakfast at 15 per head in the hotel is overpriced Bought fresh food for 3 in the local supermarket for less than 15 Finally at check in we were offered the option of having a cot in the room for our small child We requested same however this never materialised , The staff were very helpful particularly jn the restaurant The hotel is clean and relativey modern with decent facilities The hotel is literally a 5 min walk to the beach also and the metro is also nearby Plenty of small cafes and restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel too 
281273,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The air con wasn t the great and the room was warm even tho it was only 18degrees outside, High standard hotel Staff very nice and very clean hotel Less than a 10 minute walk to all the modern nightclubs like pacha on the sea front
281274,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Thought it was ideal wouldn t have changed anything modern hotel and very well maintained in a fab location, Staff were amazing location was amazing food was great 
281275,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Our room was at the front of the hotel and very noisy the window s needed sound proofing as we heard the traffic and didn t have a good night s sleep, Lovely pool and outdoor spa area big comfy sofa s to chill out on with a cocktail Family room a great size with huge bathroom with spa shower and separate bath
281276,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The rooms are very tired and I saw bugs crawling from the carpet outside the room trying to get into the room , The breakfast was good and the staff was helpful 
281277,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, A long list To start with 1 Family room is horribly designed with the single beds made out of iron and sharp curves hit kids often and not only kids even adults have to be careful see the hardly one leg space gap between the red chair and one single bed and the iron stands of bed ridiculous design 2 just next to the red chair is a table with sharp corners which also is dangerous for kids 3 absolulete non sense lighting system between the two rooms for family rooms This would mean you cannot switch off one room s any lights on its own So if kids want to keep their lights ON or parents need to keep lights ON no option to switch off any room lights on its own only 1 master light switch for both rooms which means if either of one room needs to sleep rest and other room needs lights ON then the one who wants to rest sleep need to do so with full beaming lights ON 4 staff is clueless and have one standard answer they say no one had ever problems till date so they cant help if our kids got hurt with the iron metal legs or sharp tables or hardly any distance between chairs and beds 5 room service attitude and reception staff attitude rude When room service waiter asked to boil baby milk bottle he advises us to do ourselves in bathroom using hot water Reception staff when requested for an hour late check out well in advance says we will be charged 10 euros per hour Reception staff arrogantly says goodnight to end the discussion whilst we are still talking When requested for free complimentary water bottle staff says you booked a room and didnt book a water bottle What a ridiculous answer Room service when asked to get some plates for kids dinner they say we will be charged 4 euros to deliver plain plates bcoz we are using their service else we have to come down and get it own Pathetic ready answers the whole staff needs to be trained in customer service skills for a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
281278,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, We had lunch at the hotel one day it was just a totally tastefull meal and Andrea and Ignasi who served us where both very kind and friendly It s our third stay at the hotel and the breakfast is still very good Good beds friendly staff 
281279,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Pillows not the best , Although a short distance out of town we really enjoyed the location Lovely selection of beach bars and restaurants across the road The number 59 bus route stops right outside the Hotel and takes you down to the Rambla Friendly staff also reception arranged a very good Airport Shuttle 
281280,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, A little noisy on a night with doors slamming could possibly put young people on separate floor to families, Quiet location but easy access for beach and transport staff were very efficient and willing to help breakfast was excellent would definitely stay here again 
281281,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Very few people spoke English which was very difficult for us as it was our first time travelling since we were children and the first time on our own Also the food wasn t very good at the hotel , Rooms were comfortable
281282,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Internet was intermittent No Air conditioning Very noisy outside the hotel, Location was fantastic and close to all modes of Transportation Staff were very friendly Room was comfortable 
281283,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The space in the rooms is too small for three people the sauna and Hamam didn t work well, The place is very clean with very good location and rich breakfast the staff are very kind
281284,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, WIFI in room was very poor with constant disconnections and very low speed when it did connect , Room and bed very comfortable although Aircon did not seem to work particularly well which may have been an issue in warmer months
281285,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Too far from port and centre Very built up area Got double and a put me up bed when requested 3 singles as 3 generations used the room My son me and my Mother , Stayed for a night before meeting our cruise Too far from port to walk after reading otherwise Too far from centre Had pizza in bar Was ok and big enough for 2 Room adequate but not what was requested
281286,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, There was nothing to dislike in my opinion Good location for us out of the centre of the city but easy to get into the busier areas also five minute walk to the beach Staff all very helpful and food in the hotel very good 
281287,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Receptionist staff were not very friendly jacuzzi was cold and breakfast is too expensive for what it is, Very clean comfortable bed good location would recommend and come back again
281288,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, To change the time of the facility that available for example the sauna and the pool time Also there was not much breakfast to eat, I like the staff was polite and help full
281289,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Regret to say the breakfast was cold every morning so could not eat cold eggs Decided to stick to cornflakes Did not have any other meals there so can t comment on that Would return but not include meals , My room was very nice and cleaned every day Bathroom was good size and spotless Close to bus stop close to the beach Staff were very friendly and helpful 
281290,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, For such a high cost breakfast should be included and at 15 Euro I thought the breakfast was overpriced for the selection and quality , The staff were excellent Incredibly responsive and proactive and friendly When I left something behind after checkout they went above and beyond to send it to me at home The room was nice and the hotel is quite close to city center and beach so very well situated 
281291,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, Located 5min walk from beach and a wide variety of restaurants at Port Olympic a shopping centre I d just 3 min walk and transport is easy to get to Hotel also provide shuttle to airport which was very convenient Located away from City centre but not to far out Hotel it self I d clean and spacious and offers you every thing you need Staff are friendly and helpful and spoke very good English which made our stay even easier would recommend to anyone
281292,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Air conditioning wasn t set for cold air we went in February so room was stifling hot Breakfast was overpriced and hot buffet wasn t very hot , Great family room excellent staff great location bus stop outside hotel Close to beach
281293,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, When we booked we believed to have breakfast included when we tried to have breakfast we were told no we didn t have breakfast At the time of booking we were pretty sure we included breakfast This may be a booking com issue rather then the hotel as we didn t feel it was obvious We may have booked elsewhere if we had known Bar mini bar overpriced for a soft drink Quite a walk away from town centre perfect location if going to the beach but not at this time of year Took about 35 40 mins walk to get into centre of town Couldn t get heating air con to work , Comfy bed listened to our requests helpful reception staff when checked in but not that great after clean hotel overall ok but wouldn t stay here again Think it s really a 3 star rather then a 4 star 
281294,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Staff reaction to my complaint , The room and bathroom were surprisingly big We liked breakfast a lot as well as the welcome drink The only drawback yet a serious one was their reaction to my loss I left my ebook Reader under the pillow I called the hotel as soon as I realized it but no luck The hotel staff claimed they found nothing Apart ftom that the hotel is very good 
281295,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Breakfast wasn t to the standard of everything else in the hotel Rooms at the front face the busy road Some nights can be quite noisy a light sleeper should ask for a room at the back of the hotel pool facing ,No Positive
281296,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Bar area could be a little bigger there s enough space Situated in the Restaurant area the focus is on diners left unattended unmanned regularly There s a small comfy lounge adjoining Ideal to relax after a long day touring the city waiter service here would have been ideal, Hotel layout great The outdoor pool area ideal for everyone Rooms were very spacious The staff were helpful courteous No problems with wifi access A great Little Hotel well worth a visit
281297,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, I was a little bit disappointed with this hotel if I m honest I read lots of reviews on the net but when we arrived we had a massive stain facing our room on the carpet which was slowly approaching our room We told reception about this problem but nothing was done until our last day Also a strong smell of cigarette smoke was lingering outside our room for the whole duration of our stay again we spoke to reception about this and they just said ok we travelled with our baby daughter and that was the concern regarding the smoke smell I was also looking forward to using the sauna and steam facilities but they were both out of order I stayed in January I had the feeling because it was out of season the hotel wasn t up to the standards it probably would be in the summer months , I thought this hotel had a fantastic location close to the beach bars cafes and Port Olympic Hotel staff were helpful in advising us which bus to travel to etc The pool area looked really up to date unfortunately because it wasn t hot enough we didn t experience the pool 
281298,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The hotel is located quite far from the city centre Buses drive past the hotel so it s okay The beach is near , The hotel is really nice It s new and tidy The breakfast is delicious There is a swimming pool and a jacuzzi outside you can also use them in the winter 
281299,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Nothing, Great staff Good location Good breakfast Reasonable room price We got a room upgrade from triple room to a junior suite and very much appreciated this gesture from management What to ask more Will definitely stay again 
281300,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Nothing really , Good size and clean room Excellent staff very helpful Breakfast buffet was open until 11am and offered more than enough Despite being away from local attractions the bus stops just outside the hotel provide direct links to most of the city s attractions Will definitely recommend and will visit again 
281301,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The food was a bit expensive for the quality it was , The hotel staff all of them from reception cleaners to the restaurant staff were really nice and helpful The rooms are a good size with a big bathroom and facilities provided were as expected value for money We were able to walk to most of our places such as the beach Citadel Park Cathedral of Barcelona etc Would highly recommend this hotel 
281302,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, everything was not of 4 star quality bed and duvet is particularly poor disastrous ventilaiton in the toilet heating is confusing and we had to leave the windows open all day because it s too hot , has everything a 4 star hotel needed price is reasonable staff is not radiantly welcoming but respond to every request near the beach 
281303,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, AC was not working so room was getting very hot there were no exausts in washroom the hotel resturant didnt have much items to choose from menu was very limited specially they had only 1 or 2 items with chicken ,No Positive
281304,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, building is very noisy you can hear anything from the room next door , Barcelona is great the hotel is close to the beach It is a 10min wallk to two metro stations A backery a supermarket and a bus stop are very close 5min

281308,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The walls are too thin you hear every sound from the next room the corridor and the street I felt under seige from the cleaners even with the no sign displayed Even when I went out early and came back for an afternoon siesta the cleaner was knocking on the door Not keen on the location a busy street in Bogatell was not ideal for me , The bed and chair were comfortable there was tea and coffee in the room and check in was quick 
281309,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The lift needs your room card to be entered to make it go which is a bit of a pain but other than that excellent stay, The Hotel is lovely and clean and well positioned near the beach and local transport or if you are feeling fit you can walk We caught the open top bus which stops just a short walk away We didn t eat at the Hotel but there are a good few cafes and restaurants not far away
281310,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, My room was too hot The aircon seemed to be turned off possibly for the winter so only blew out warm air I had to open the windows to cool the room which was noisy, Hotel had good facilities at a reasonable price and was in a convenient location for me 
281311,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, There were no toiletries in bathroom A few measley sachets of awful cream Hardly enough tea sachets When asked for more I had to go to reception myself and then he only had two tea bags whereas I wanted four I asked for A sewing kit to mend some trousers and they didn t have any How bizarre is that Awful Absolutely awful indeed The air conditioning didn t work when I reported it was told to switch it off and open the window Never been in a hotel which was such poor service I go ro Barca regularly but shall never return to this one ever again ,No Positive
281312,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, So close to everywhere Airport is a 15min taxi ride but I also got the bus from the airport to the hotel and it was so easy A1 bus from T1 takes you to the stop you get the H16 and it drops you outside the hotel By bus you can get everywhere and it was so nice and close to the beach Loved it 
281313,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Staff could be a little more friendly Softer pillows The soaf shampoo is horrible and smells like chemicals expected better , Facilities location quiet out of town but close to metro and nice areas beach Safe well lit v pleasant hotel 
281314,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, It would have been good if we had been able to close the window The pad on the floor in the bathroom to stop the door banging too far back came drift and there is a risk of stepping on it which would be very painful Perhaps staff should have spotted both of these , Comfortable bed Location 
281315,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, The hotel is close to downtown and the next busstop is in front of the door Rooms are spacy and clean The breakfast ist decent in taste and choice I d come back to this Hotel in case of next stay in Barcelona

281318,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Ive never payed my bill at the start of my stay however the attitude of the staff was unpleasant when we booked in and were told we had to settle the bill first before we could receive the keys Requests for eg use of the iron was ignored although we asked several times Noisy guests early hours of the morning disturbed sleep and were not dealt with , Pleasant atmosphere and facilities Good choice for breakfast
281319,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, They had issues with the water and on our first evening kept awake most of the night while they did this repair from midnight to the early hours Would have like for there to be an iron and ironing board in the room , Staff were very pleasant and very helpful in advising where to go and where to get buses etc Room was clean and well presented Hotel located near the beach which was great and if you are into walking easily to walk into the main city areas 
281320,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Requested a twin room and got a double I m female and was travelling with a female friend so no big deal but would ve just been nice to have separate beds , Great food Lovely comfy outside area Overall very nice
281321,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, See above, Nice hotel and once we figured out the bus routes we could get into the central city but it s a long walk from the nearest Metro Neighborhood mostly run down and no good restaurants were found Incredibly loud noise late into the night from the pool area the first night we were there but not the 2nd We stayed at 9 different hotels on this trip and the staff here spoke the least English of any of them 
281322,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, second time staying in this hotel 2 years ago when we changed the room and forgot jeans and next morning ask reception to return we were told that there were nothing this time during cleaning of the room sleeping robe disappeared Reception was informed but nothing happened last but not the list rooms are small despite fact of non smoking the room had smoking smelt,No Positive

281324,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Room was supposed to be quiet 5th floor to the back yard but unfortunately in the evening there was music from the outdoor bar and also noise from people laughing and chatting , Hotel close to the beach For our purpose the location was good 10 min walk to the next subway Bus in front of the hotel Comfortable bed 
281325,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Group of London boys there on Saturday afternoon being noisy and swearing No atmosphere in dining area or in bar Surrounding buildings in nearby streets a bit rundown Not close to metro , Comfort of rooms and hotel reception Facilities including swimming pool and gym Location for beach Quiet room 
281326,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The swimming pool wasn t big enough so i did not go for a swim it gets packed The elevator there was an odd smell it would benefit from an air freshener The room was a bit small for the price per day All in all we like the place , I like the location 2 minutes walk from the seaside The staff were very helpful 
281327,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The shower was not thermostatic so temprature ranged from cold to boiling dangerous and impossible to enjoy Toilet 1 inch from wall so impossible to sit staight on it see picture No power for kettle in kitchen area No mirror in room, Friendly helpfull staff good location clean
281328,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, No complaints really We had rain one afternoon but can t blame Icaria for that , It s location was ideal for visiting the beach and Port Olympic We found it handy to take the bus tours from the beach front and to get back to La Rambla area 
281329,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Nothing, The hotel is spotlessly clean great location a five min stroll to the beach but with easy quick access into the city Although we didn t eat at the hotel the food we saw being brought out looked very appetising very reasonably priced Staff excellent very helpful Will definitely return 
281330,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, One of the main reasons we booked this hotel was to enjoy the outdoor hot tub This was turned off during our stay When we asked about it we were told that was the way it was A big disappointment Also the shower kept changing temperature resulting in the water getting extremely hot for a couple of moments every 2 3 minutes not very relaxing , Bed very comfortable and room spacious Convenient location for beach in Barcelona 
281331,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, No steady hot water Shower is nightmare Facilities are not working most of the time Compensation was bottle of cheap wine which we didn t take , GYM has reletively new equipment 
281332,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The aircon ventilation is not working properly it only worked when the card key was not in the slot which means all power is off Told the reception about it they said they sent someone to fix it but it didn t work anyway ,No Positive
281333,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Water in bathroom can t stay in a normal temperature Either is cold or hot hot And if you have the luck to wake up 4 in the morning to catch your flight you have to wait for 20 minutes for the water to cool down unless you use it for a cup of tea long way to the center 20 30 min with the bus metro need to walk 20 min and if it s night it s a bit scary as its empty streets breakfast was not included 16 extra pp, bus stop right outside the hotel until 11pm after that is either the metro until 2 00am or taxi walking distance to the beach very quiet tea coffee utilities reception 24 7
281334,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Felt like the room needed abit of paint Few marks on the wall , Great staff fantastic location 5 minute walk to the beach and 10 minutes by bus to the city bus stop outside hotel also taxi s available had breakfast at adorable bakery shop 3 minutes from the hotel 
281335,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, However we were disappointed with the spa not working as we booked with such facilities specifically The hotel should have notified the guests who had a booking that some facilities they advertise and guests pay for are no longer available during the booked period We would have found another hotel with the desired facilities , Good location nice breakfast 
281336,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, the website said it was two metro stops from the city centre when we asked they said metro was too far and take the bus which took about 25 mins in traffic also guy at desk was not helpful in directing us to the nearest tourist bus stop also I was overcharged 40 more than what was quoted when I booked , the sun bed 
281337,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The worst hotel I ever stayed First thing i entered on the room I found the mini bar with 3 bottle of water opened and half full Even I told them several time they did not supply the mini bar with all the necessary things We weren t able to have a proper shower as the water was either cold or very hot ,No Positive
281338,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, Group of 10 hotel was brilliant exactly what we wanted and more location was great and staff couldn t do enougth to help you highly recommend no negative features
281339,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, water for shower went hot and cold wifi a bit patchy, Short walk to beach right by bus stop for city centre good breakfast spacious room This was our second stay at this hotel 
281340,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, In a soul less part of the city with nothing much around Star ratings don t seem to mean much in Spain not really a 4 star , If you like the beach it is close 
281341,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Staff could have been friendlier Pool area was underwhelming A long walk to the main gothic la ramblas though 5 mins to a metro , Close to the beach Nice rooms comfy beds with plenty of space Tidy and clean 
281342,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Bed was a little to firm but others might be happy with this Unfortunately pre booked shuttle bus did not turn up for the return journey to airport , Location was great close to the beach but also easy to get into the centre of Barcelona H16 bus stops just outside hotel then only a short ride into the city centre The hotel and room were clean and were lucky on the 5th floor to be able to see the Sagrada Familia in the distance Breakfast was great lots of choice and fresh Bonus are the ice machines located in the stairwell on each floor 
281343,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The water temperature was very hard to set both in the bath and shower One point there was no cold water at all so we couldn t have a shower However they seemed to get it fixed fast The room was a bit noisy as we could hear the rooms being cleaned above and next to us , Nice size room Very comfortable bed Provided kettle and tea and coffee in the room
281344,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, No bad experiences some staff could improve their attitude , good location for a family with young children Away from the buzz of the city but at the same time close to amenities close to bus stop with easy access to tourist attractions beach less than 10 mins walk
281345,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, Stayed several times post cruise and pre cruise Staff always very helpful and we like we re hotel is The only minus is no help to room for wheelchair guest who had luggage The breakfast was very good warm and plenty to chose from 
281346,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Transport links a bit to far away but managable if you like walking as we do, We liked location to beach We also liked to pool area and the relaxing lounge near pool area 
281347,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Went for breakfast at 10 am paid 14 euros and all the choices for hot breakfast were empty eggs were COLD And by cold i do not mean that it was not fresh out of cooking they left them on the counter for 15 minutes before putting them in the heater and the heater was off Very pricy for what we had Dont get the break fast or go there super early They did have a lot of choice fruits coffee bread dry sausages etc , Close to the beach not too far from the metro also Barcelona hotels are usually very pricy but this one was OK 
281348,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Was not as nice as photos underwhelming when you first arrive Room key didn t work and then electrics didn t work Not a good first impression Glad I booked a junior suite as more spacious , Location Spacious room junior suite with nice bathroom Breakfast food was good 
281349,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Our toilet didn t always flush and we rang reception every day to report this It was very inconvenient having to go to bar area for the toilet, Bar area in evening had great ambience
281350,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Condition of ladies toilet on ground floor was poor at one point in our visit On occasions the service on the ground floor was slow, Closeness to beach and ease of getting in to thecity
281351,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The room suite had a smell which oblidged me to sleep with open windows Too much music voices and footsteps noise in the 3rd floor Even with closed windows you could hear the noise from the street Staff in the bar didn t understand good English Check in after 15 00 , The rooms design 
281352,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, None , Just far enough out of town to be quiet but not too far away from anything Efficient staff very friendly Rooms very clean not huge but more than adequate and quiet It s not pretending to be five star but no complaints from us
281353,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, Everyday you had to make a decision between surfing on the internet via wifi or lying on your bed to relax The only way to combine these two things together is to move the bed to the gate of the door the wifi signal was terrible in the room From the outside the hotel looked quite morden but the indoor facilities were very old The room was far away from my expectation based on what I have paid and my travel experince in such big cities What experienced was not worth what paid , This hotel locates in the olympic villa area and is only 5 min walk to the beach 
281354,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, The lunch and evening food quality was not restaurant standard They were more like snacks and I would recommend visitors eating outside of the hotel , The facilities in the rooms were very good All areas of the hotel were clean and the overall d cor was smart and modern We really enjoyed the outdoor terrace and comfy seating 
281355,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona, I have stayed already in this hotel this is why I had made a reservation for 11 nights Unfortunatelly this time they gave us a room extremely warm the air condition was not functioning properly Wifi also was not OK the door from the bath was difficult to open We change the room next day but this new room was very small also the bed the doors were shut all the night was impossible to sleep I would like leave this hotel the next day but I had to pay for all the nights at the check in I believe the staff could be much more careful when you are staying such a long period , The location of the hotel is excellent her the sea and also close to the town centre 
281356,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,No Negative, Quiet safe location but with the beach a very easy walking distance Lots of bars and restaurants close by too Only stayed one night as going on a cruise but would go back again
