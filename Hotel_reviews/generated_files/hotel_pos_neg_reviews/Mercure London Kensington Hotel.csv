83852,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, It was pointed out I had been upgraded from single to double Good in theory yet room was well compact OK for me but not sure where a second person would have squeezed in , Wide selection on breakfast buffet with taste Good value for quality hotel in London All staff had a smile 
83853,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, TV was terrible remote didn t work properly I had problems with the internet when phoned down to the night staff he said I had to wait till the technical team were available in the morning when I spoke to daytime staff they explained the problem and it was a quick fix probably should have been informed when checking in Parking was an issue I informed them prior to arrival I will need a parking space when I arrived there was no parking spaces so I had to park out the from of the hotel I done all that was asked of me to get a ticket through phone which cost over 18 to find I still got a parking ticket this all would have been avoided if they accepted my request prior to booking In the elevator there is a sign for 24 hour food service when I phoned down for this service around 1am the guy on the desk said no its not available was very rude about it as well , Daytime staff very friendly I went for one of the smaller rooms as I was traveling alone it is very small but comfortable had everything needed 
83854,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, One of the male check in staff on the night shift was not welcoming and a bit rude The bathroom needs some renovations as the toilet water takes ages to fill up again after a single flush The TV was outdated , Comfortable hotel with nice little touches such as bathrobes slippers free drinks and water on the mini bar Nespresso and tea options One of the best hotel breakfasts in the city The female staff are nice and friendly 
83855,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Room could have been a bit bigger while I do acknowledge that the average rooms in London are bit small , Staff at the reception were extremely helpful polite courteous and professional Excellent location
83856,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, This is my second time staying at this hotel During my first stay there was a long wait to check in this time there was a long wait to check out The staff are very nice but there should be more front desk employees present to reduce the wait , Convenient location very good breakfast comfortable and clean room 
83857,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Lots of homeless and beggars outside hotel Staff didn t speak good English and bar was never manned and poorly stocked Sockets in room didn t work and when reported to staff were not attended to Back of drawers was coming away and had nails sticking out Cost of drinks was excessive even for London , The bed was comfortable and bathroom good 
83858,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Having seen other reviews it seems that issues I can across do not seem to be actioned Such a toilet roll holder in a very awkward place in the small double handle on window so loose it may of come off which meant i could not lock it securely This meant due to being on the side of extractor fans it was rather noisy so even paying over 100 for a room where you cannot sleep is rather counter productive Two pairs of ear plugs provided but I cannot sleep with them in and fo not expect to wear them I should not have to The doors are heavy and heard people in and out of room all night and could hear the lift go PING all night It would be a great hotel if these things for comfort reasons were addressed as other Mecures have a higher comfort level and you can sleep soundly , The cleaners do an excellent job 
83859,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, To change breakfast menu for some days to add variety , The room was clean and tidy The staff was very pleasant efficient and helpful Breakfast was delicious though changing of menu for some days of the week will be a nice change Location is very convenient 
83860,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The shower was terrible merely warm the first 2 days The carpet underneath the air conditioner was soaked Very noisy Unfortunately would not stay there again nor would I recommend it , Staff were friendly 
83861,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The lighting in our room could have been a bit brighter The quality of the breakfast orange juice could have been a bit better , We had a good sized and attractive room There was a wide variety of breakfast options The hotel is in an attractive area of London with easy to access by tube 
83862,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Me and my friend stayed in a double room which has a weird shape which is difficult if you have 2 big luggages , The neigborhood is very nice with lots of restaurants It is near Earl s Court station which has the Picadilly Line direct access to the airport and the District Line Both lines are accessible to most of London s tourist spots 
83863,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The size of the room difficult to squeeze between the foot of the bed and the wall the noise of doors slamming as fellow guests left their rooms the placement of the glass shelf magnifying mirror and toilet paper holder in the bathroom the designer was surely having a lend having to stand on a chair to access the safe and the inedible and cold bacon and hash browns , Bed was comfortable the window opened so you could get fresh air and the staff in the breakfast room were efficient 
83864,Mercure London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, From arriving at the hotel the staff were friendly and helpful The guy behind the bar Mickayl i think was brilliant and helped with best directions to where we wanted to go The breakfast was good and plentiful and the staff in here were pleasant The hotel itself was in a good location 5 mins from Earls Court Tube station which was great for getting around London We were on the 5th floor of the hotel and it was very quiet the bathroom could have done with some tlc on the paintwork but nothing major the bar prices were reasonable with a pint of lager around 4 50 so not bad for London There is a Sainsburys just down the road which was great when we were unpacking on the Friday to find we had no toothpaste with us 
83865,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The lift was not working and we had to use the staff lift which was very inconvenient There is only one lift in the whole hotel which is ridiculous considering there are 6 floors , Breakfast was very good
83866,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Leaking toilet crumbling bathroom tiles carpet coming up and was wet in places Tiny room Forced to upgrade to king suite after booking on booking com , Great bed and amenities such as espresso maker tea kettle fridge hairdryer iPod music player tv 
83867,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The lift was small anyway and could hold no more than 3 people however 4 of the cleaning staff jumped in it with me which made me worry Then the lift broke Considering I have recently had knee surgery no lift and the 6th floor did not mix well We couldn t get into our room when we arrived despite having the keys redone The maid had to let us in When we did get in we found the toilet didn t flush The lady at reception did move out room which was better If you re staying at the weekend don t book to park at the hotel it s not actually at the hotel and it s cheaper to park on the street as Sundays most of Saturday is free , The staff were nice and helpful with problems we had They did their best in the circumstances 
83868,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Most staff were wonderful and the hotel was fantastic overall However that one member of staff really did spur the taste of mecure , There were a couple of issues that were solved apologetically The lady who brought our breakfast was fantastically attentive However the reception lady when we checked out was not despite me passing on feedback that her colleague was so helpful her response was I m sorry about that Please listen to your customers when they are giving you feedback you arrogant woman 
83869,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Bar was shut when we returned at 12am even though it was supposed to be 24 hours they wouldn t serve us in the room Room was very hot AC wasn t very effective, Breakfast was amazing and check in staff really helpful
83870,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room cleaning needs improvement They should not be leaving used plastic glasses when they make up the room each day which they did several times We even had to ask for new glasses because none were left , All staff at check in and in the bar and breakfast room were excellent and made for an enjoyable stay
83871,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Double room and bathroom we were allocated was a corner room so was incredibly small and slightly uncomfortable Also TV was pretty old Facilities in hotel were very limited with a very small lounge bar area ,No Positive
83872,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, We stayed in a small double room and paid 308 for 2 nights The bedroom was ridiculously small and was not fit for 2 people My husband had to lie on the bed while I got ready and vice versa as there was not enough space for 2 people to stand anywhere in the bedroom or bathroom at the same time Most uncomfortable stay in a hotel I have experienced Breakfast was included and there was plenty of choice however both mornings we had to ask for bowls as they d run out and the bacon was non existent on the 2nd morning There were hardly any tables for 4 people so we had to sit separately from our friends All in all after this experience I would not stay in the mecure Kensington again , Location and that was it 
83873,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I couldn t sleep as there was a air conditioning unit which rattled and also had a dripping water sound The tv did not work The room desperately needed a paint The room was tiny even by London standards I did email my concerns re the air conditioning as it kept me awake all night but had no response I would not stay there again, Breakfast was ok and the bar area was really nice The late night bar man was also lovely
83874,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was so cold I thought I would slip into a coma Luckily the duvet was OK The hot water seemed to run out in the evening luke warm showers are not my thing ,No Positive
83875,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was a bit too compact but adequate for what I needed The tea coffee were not replenished each day but the front desk handed out extra supplies without a problem , Excellent front desk staff always helpful We were offered an alternative extra early breakfast as we had to leave early on one day very helpful and unexpected The breakfast was good and the rooms were clean It was a quiet hotel which was good 
83876,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Checking in was a nightmare as I was demanded a credit card which was blocked my bank s issue also I was required to pay for breakfasts that was included in booking and all these things happened due to the system failure My attempts to contact booking com were not successful So these issues really damaged my impessions of this particular stay , It is conveniently located
83877,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, We didn t like that the price on booking com had been reduced by the time we arrived dramatically , The view was adequate we were on the first floor The bed and pillows was fantastic slept really well Great location Friendly staff Excellent choice at breakfast and quick tea coffee service 
83878,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Not central enough my fault Very close to the main road Bedrooms showing signs of wear , The staff were all polite and helpful We were allowed to check in early 
83879,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room size was too small for two who were not a couple There was too much confusement with change of staff I was always having to explain an error with my access to booking online , The bed was comfortable
83880,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, We sent a email regarding our room to be in a quiet location in the hotel away from lifts ect before we arrived as we had to travel from abroad When we got to our room it was opposite the lift We paid for a upgrade on our room and the extras were not in our room when we arrived Also there must have been a school party at the hotel And they were on our floor and in the next room to us So they were very loud banging on doors screaming shouting ect So we complained and was able to move eventually to a different part of the hotel and we got the extras that we paid for in our room Plus the manager gave us a bowl of fruit two little bottles of wine and chocolate Also we had a bit of a refund as we were staying three nights Plus the pictures on the Internet look lovely of the hotel but a bit deceiving As the rooms and hotel are a lot smaller than what they look on the Internet , The breakfast was really good with pleanty of chose from 
83881,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, There were several rooms of disruptive guests school children on my floor Each day sometimes multiple times I had to call the front desk to report door slamming running back and forth in the hall loud noise this happened on Sat night until 11 45 pm and began Sunday morning at 7 30 am The hotel staff person on Sunday night said I have asked the children to be quiet but they haven t done it so there is nothing we can do I could not believe this Finally I asked her to meet me on my floor in the hallway and we were going to have a conversation with the children and their teacher adult accompanying them and get this resolved So we did just that The teacher was very attentive and he did stop the noise I just wonder why the hotel staff did not take such initiative on Friday Saturday and Sunday So frustrating and disruptive I mentioned that I was certain there was a hotel policy on unnecessary noise and disruption but she didn t respond only saying that they had asked them to be quiet and they hadn t done it so they could do nothing This Saturday night staff person said she would have the manager contact me I have received no word from the manager I also told this staff person that I would have to go on social media and state what happened as I wouldn t want this to happen to anyone else and she said go ahead I don t care I think this might be the bottom line SHE DIDN T CARE NOR DID THE HOTEL ,No Positive
83882,Mercure London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, My first room was so small and cold because of the window but the lady in the reception changed my room with the bigger and very comfortable one immediately and also helped me to move my luggages gave me an other room card to keep fun open when I was out After a long business trip she really helped me to stay comfortable All staff are very smiley and helpful all ladies in the reception are very energetic to welcome you Thank you

83884,Mercure London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Despite making a very late last minute booking and checking in after midnight front desk very helpful Room very comfortable too Near to main railway stations
83885,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, It didn t look like the pictures and wifi was unstable, The hotel was clean and the bathroom was spotless It is an old hotel but adds to the charm The double room I stayed in so really tiny so it s good if you don t plan on spending much time in there An added attraction they give you a smartphone that you can use during your stay with free data and calls I ended up using that in my room as the wifi was hard to connect to 
83886,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was very small and had not been properly cleaned The fittings were all old and scratched The room was far too hot and the aircon didn t work , The bed was reasonably comfortable 
83887,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The bed turns lumpy after a few hours The windows cannot be opened even though we were on the 3rd floor only so the room sometimes felt stuffy Also the noise from other rooms and the corridors can easily be heard inside the room However the noise from the street is minimized due to the double glass installed , The staff were great and the hotel offers a free of charge mobile phone with Internet access and free international phone calls 
83888,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I miss some type of leisute as a swimming pool or sauna to relax a bit , Walking distance to restaurants shops subway and to the Hyde park Very good breakfast Nice space room Nespresso machine with 4 caps included and a mobile phone free UK National calls and internet surprises me a lot

83891,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The wifi wasn t great when I last stayed and i hadn t used it on my previous stays but maybe this was a one off , I stay here all the time for business and always get a great price for a great area The staff are always very helpful and even the smallest rooms are still lovely Onsite starbucks too Please don t put the prices up 
83892,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, We didn t have any tea provided in the room and did ask reception but it never appeared Fortunately we found the maid and managed to get some from her , In general very good Breakfast excellent and room very comfortable 
83893,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, 1 The room had a bad smell like the carpet was wet and did not dry properly And the room could not be changed as hotel was fully booked 2 I order an extra large bed which I expected to come in a bigger room 3 Breakfast was not enjoyable Eggs were bitty Pancakes were hard and tasted doughy The only good thing I had on that menu was the Green tea and Orange juice 4 The fact that my partner had to witness a person throw up at the bar area was unacceptable 5 No free parking and the cost off the parking on the street was ridiculous Right now I am currently looking for a hotel for this weekend coming as well and if I was happy Mercure could have had my business, I liked that the hotel has a modern look 
83894,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Noise from the corridors was far to loud especially the cleaners who started really early Air conditioning was so noisy you had to turn it off Room size was very small it was expected However not being able to walk past the end of the bed wasnt, Location Breakfast
83895,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was tiny not enough room to walk around the bed Could not sit comfortably on the toilet because of the location of the toilet roll holder The hotel failed to confirm my car parking space despite requesting it through Booking com As it turned out it was reserved for me which was very lucky as they only have 3 available The parking charge was 29 for 12 hours , The staff were very friendly The breakfast options were excellent Clean and comfortable bed 
83896,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, From the room that I stayed I could listen people speaking in the other room The elevator a bit small But no impact for me since I had only one small suitcase , The hotel offer a mobile handy which allows you to make free calls and several other resources In case you don t want to pay roaming and has no 3G is very useful Staff VERY FRIENDLY and helpful Wonderful and inexpensive breakfast 
83897,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Nothing, The location was ideal to visit the various museums in the area while the staff were welcoming and courteous I enjoyed the very generous breakfast a great way to begin each busy day 
83898,Mercure London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, When I check in mercure london Kensington hotel they asked me my credit card to block 60 pounds as a security When I check out by 5th February they give me slip to get back 60 pounds in my account I stayed their 30 minutes to get message from my bank but not I argue with them they 60 pounds will b return back to my account with in a weak but still today it s one month now I didn t get back 60 pounds in my account I am shocked from your service and plaining to make a complaint to against to booking com I hope u will take action and get me back my 60 pounds which was only security deposit to the mercure London 
83899,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The water pressure in the shower is rubbish glad I didn t wash my hair since I m not sure I would have been able to rinse the shampoo out The sink was clogged Could hear the people in the other room talking Clean over all BUT found a pair of glasses on the floor beside the bed so they couldn t have hovered that part at least , Stayed one night and the the room it self were nice and the beds were absolutely amazing Very welcoming staff Close to tube 5 min walk Very happy with our stay over all since we just paid 74 but wouldn t have been satisfied with the standard if we had paid 155 as the original price was 
83900,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was TINY You have to turn sideways against the wall to get round to the other side of the bed Acceptable for a one night stay but no longer there s no space for a suitcase The switch on my bedside lamp was broken so could only operate it by plugging unplugging it The bar didn t have the wine that we wanted on the wine list and the draft lager was awful smelled really bad Serving us drinks at 11 15pm seemed to be a bit of an inconvenience for the staff member who told us that it wasn t her job as she was the receptionist It was adequate but I wouldn t stay here again , It s a decent location in an area I know quite well Close to Earls Court tube and High Street Kensington Despite being near Cromwell Road it wasn t noisy 
83901,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was really small also the double bed with one blanket 3 people behind the counter only one was helping clients 3 other clients had to wait Bar was simple ordered beer not really cold friendly bartender though View from the window really poor noise from the hospital as well Taxi ordered to the airport was beautiful but 80 GBP Uber would have costed 30 GBP , Location was great hotel was kind of clean breakfast was okay
83902,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Not very well isolated I could hear my neighbours talk in their room next door , Very comfortable although the room was quite small but that was indicated in the booking description so it was no surprise

83911,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The bed was a little too soft but thats personal preference, The hotel location is great the upgraded room had some lovely extras thank you for a fantastic stay
83912,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Air conditioning was not working and room was 30c at night Windows sealed and so uncomfortable so sleep was very disturbed Hotel staff were aware within 3 hours of arrival and it was never addressed even though i complained 5 times in total I have a dispute with their invoice for that reason as i do not feel their services were accurately described in their remit I cannot sleep in a temp of 30c with no air and suspect many others are the same They did advise they would move us to another room but thought a fan would suffice unfortunately blowing hot air noisily overnight was not an acceptable resolution No one responded at front desk on our final night to arrange a change of rooms The manager although we did not speak with her did offer 50 off the final night this was not accepted as every night was affected , locations was brilliant

83915,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Breakfast was not a relaxing experience at all Seemed like the staff was overwhelmed , The hotel provided a free smartphone that was locally connected preventing the traveler from having to obtain a local sim card or burner phone This was such a great perk since we always use our smartphone for GPS etc but rather not have to spend time locating a place to purchase local sim card The front desk staff was very helpful and accommodating 
83916,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Couldn t fault anything really though they didn t stock up the tea and coffee for us in the room, Very close for underground and lots of shops cafes and restaurants all round about Staff all very helpful and rooms very clean

83918,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I had to ask to change room because the room I was given was small dirty dusty tatty and the bathroom smelled I was given a small double even though I booked a standard double Skirting board was chipped and flaking duvet cover was very old the bed was tiny and there was a stain on the throw and visible dust that had clearly been gathering for some time The room was also cold The room I changed to was cleaner with better quality bed lined and of an expected size Slightly better standard but not great for a 4 hotel in Kensington paying over 100 for one night ,No Positive
83919,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Everything to old worst bed Shower over bath always dangerous Here particularly so because the shower curtain yes really is to long so you risk standing on it and slipping Breakfast canned fruit is so close to the toaster it s hot Coffee terrible but that s a British thing Interesting no English staff made me wonder what they will do after Brexit closes the door cause it appears the Brits not interested in hospitality , Nothing
83920,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Expensive drinks at the bar , We had a free upgrade to a room with a king size bed with a coffee machine and a mini fridge with complimentary drinks So comfortable The front of house staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast was a nice mixture of continental and full English 
83921,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Our room was extremely small we had to side step to get around the bed our room was in very poor condition The room needs major updating Our room was next to the laundry cupboard which was open and sheets all over the floor The hotel stay spoilt our visit to London Our stay was not value for money , Staff were friendly and helpful

83928,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Heating system was not functioning well We asked to move to another room which was smaller Bathroom needs renovation The faucets and toilet very old There was dust on the bedside tables , Mercure Kensington is well located Nice area close to Metro Piccadilly line Walking distance to V A Museum Science Museum Good choice for breakfast Nice and polite people at the reception very helpfull Windows well isolated no traffic noise Good restaurants not far away from the Hotel

83933,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Room and bed are very small to the point of being uncomfortable Not great air ventilation and the room got very hot during the night Walls ceiling and bathroom run down and could be cleaner Lift was slow Worst part was the noise during the night walls are paper thin and you could hear room service at 8am knocking on doors, Great location in Kensington

83941,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, We were changed on check in from the Mercure Kensington to Mercure Paddington without prior notice by email or phone Even though we had an Executive room it was very small we were joking on how cramped it was The train noise from the Paddington station was mildly annoying The last thing was that my wife asked for a hairdryer as the built in one didn t work and had to wait more than an hour with wet hair to have it delivered All that the reception staff was able to say was We re sorry Not good enough if I m paying a hefty rate to have good time in London , The bed was comfortable and the wifi was fast The bonus smartphone was a cool touch although we didn t use it 
83942,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Wifi in room not good Bed is small and uncomfortable No minibar No bathrobes , The hotel is located 6 minutes walk away from Earl s Court Station I would not rate this hotel as 4 stars but a high level 3 star The standard room was very small and the bed very uncomfortable The staff were nice and very helpful Booking com states that the standard room has a mini bar and provides bathrobes This was not true I spoke to reception and the lady confirmed that there were no minibars in standard rooms When I asked if this was a small room and not the standard she confirmed that it was the standard and that the small room was smaller But the reception provided me with a few soft drinks free of charge 
83943,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Heating was too noisy impossible to sleep Room was very small impossible to move Elevator broke twice during 3 night stay When someone was closing its room door on our floor walls ware shaking,No Positive
83944,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, One of the night concierges was very rude and refused to bring room service even though it was in the specified time scale that room service was available,No Positive
83945,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, room extremely small bathroom even more so even for single occupation way to small noisy hallway housekeeping very early on sunday morning through the surrounding rooms all night sounds caused by nearby elevator really do not book this hotel , location is ok 25 min walking from Harrods 5 min from underground earls court picadilly line breakfast was ok
83946,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Nothing as we waited well over an hour for our room to be prepared then we got to the room to see a dirty bathroom and it was freezing cold so we asked for the twin room instead which was very uncomfortable, Nothing as we waited well over an hour for our room to be prepared then we got to the room to see a dirty bathroom and it was freezing cold so we asked for the twin room instead which was very uncomfortable
83947,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, First of all during my 4 days stay 3 times a keycard did not work and i needed to go down to reprogram it Also for me the pictures in the internet looked much nicer than actually the hotel was I have stayed in many of the 4 star hotels in London and that was so far the worst of it the room was so tight that i couldnt even lay all my bags on the floor nor move freely beside the bed and the wall This is not a 4 star but more 3 star hotel and i expected way more from well known hotel chain I also cant understand that if there is a tv in the room why it isnt on the wall so you can watch it straight from the bed but the tv is on a table what is on the left near the up side of bed so the only option to watch the tv is to stand aside the bed but you cant watch it while being in bed Also the wind blew in from window and i couldnt close it correctly and the air heater either gave too much heat or no heat at all i assume the tunable swich did not work correctly Also the bathroom was so tiny that you cant sit in a tolilet and use the facility correctly I had great expectations on that hotel an took a lot of time of booking but to be honest the room was rather disappointing, I liked the location and staff was friendly and professional
83948,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Our room was very small we had a standard double room which had about 30cm on one side of the double bed and only enough room at the foot of the bed to shuffle sideways around The small desk table against the wall had the tea tray and other items so not really any space to put anything down We considered asking about the possibility of an upgrade to a larger room but decided we could cope for the 4 nights we were there We didn t spend much time in the room as we had planned a busy trip and the one evening we returned early we enjoyed some time in the bar lounge area so the room was adequate for our needs Do check the hotel website if you are concerned about room size as there is very detailed information available before booking Our main concern was the size of the bed as we re used to a big bed Despite being smaller than we re used to the bed was very comfortable with the most comfortable pillows A real bonus in a small room was to have a bath shower in a very decent sized bathroom If the size of the room matters to you then certainly consider the information but please don t be put off as this is a great hotel , The Mercure Hotel is in a great location within easy reach of many attractions especially the Natural History Museum and the V A The hotel reception bar area are clean modern and inviting Nothing was any trouble for the really friendly helpful staff Take advantage of their offer to book a cab if you need one as the company they use is great Very pleasant breakfast room with a good selection of food options on offer A very comfortable bed with great pillows and the hotel even supplies ear plugs in case you aren t used to traffic noise although we were barely aware of the nearby road One of us doesn t like using the tube but we were able to get buses easily from Cromwell Road or Kensington High Street and really enjoyed seeing the sights on route to our destinations Very good value hotel and we would definitely stay again 
83949,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Check in was quick Check out took a while they were busy with a group and only had one person on reception Polite about the wait though Space was smaller than most four star hotels night times were cold because the windows aren t double glazed and hot air con stops working in the night Did not enquire about changing room because I only had one night left Location is good but not great It s next to the Bupa Cromwell hospital a bit dreary and not generally a good vibe Gloucester Rd tube is about 7 minute walk away Sainsbury s is very close and a few good restaurants hit miss with the quality of service , Friendly happy and helpful staff night time porters not as enthusiastic clean Gets you all the basics 
83950,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Chose a small room cheaper but regretted it Came down for breakfast at 8 45 on the Sat finding early risers had large breakfasts which meant there was little left We had to wait a while till the staff got more food ready , Staff was friendly Room was ready quickly although it was lunch time when we arrived Quite a good selection for breakfast 
83951,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I booked this hotel as it said it came with parking To be doubly sure I would get parking I made it a special request when I booked Upon arrival in the hotel I was informed the hotel only had two spaces neither of which was available The receptionist informed us we could park on the street outside she didn t tell us that in order to do this we had to have a sack load of coins as the machine only accepted coins and at 4 60 an hour this was well nigh impossible and VERY inconvenient especially as we had to get up earlier than intended the next morning to feed the meter I would most certainly NOT have booked this hotel if I knew about the parking situation and feel aggrieved that parking was advertised as a selling point when it wasn t available , Facilities in the room were great Lovely coffee machine bathrobes etc
83952,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Worst hotel I have ever stayed in my entire life it has the standard of a low class Hostel Rooms are tiny there is no even space where to put the suitcase the walls are dirty the floor old and uncleared it s really cold all the time and no insonorisation so there is no privacy whatsoever if you want to stay in your room during the day it s even worst cause you can hear the housekeepers talking and the doors being slapped so if you want to relax or work on your laptop forget about it the TV is on the side of the bed so I don t understand how you wan use you don t been have space to use the chair they have put so you can face the TV so what was the point of putting TV anyway the worst is that they ask you a prepaid 50 pounds and when you get into the room there is no minibar when I asked for what reason they said it is in the case I damage the room but the room is already damaged and in a terrible state the sink in the bathroom get stuck whenever you wash your hands there are plenty of hotels nearby and even Ibis is far better so avoid as you can especially for the price you are paying , Breakfeast and the area where the hotel is based
83953,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Breakfast is very poor and does not qualify for 4 hotel cleanliness of rooms is on a low level housekeeping on the daily basis is quiteis not sufficient hotel has no gym the bathrooms are quite old and shabby, Location and the taxi service they use 
83954,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The bed in room 315 needs a new mattress It s a bit like a water bed So didn t sleep to well The room is a bit small but ideal if you are only staying for the 1 night , The staff at the hotel are very friendly The room and bathroom were very clean Everything you needed in the room 
83955,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, There was an annoying background noise in the room that I couldn t locate that doesn t help those of us who are light sleepers That was the only reason to mark down comfort , Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Breakfast was very good Room was spacious and the bed one of the more comfortable I have had in an hotel Check in and out very simple 
83956,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Bed very soft but that just personal preference, Room was perfect space and bathroom Walking distance from Earl s Court station and Hyde park is just a 20min straight walk The hotel is small but has everything you need for a stay apart from a restaurant they offer light snack but there are plenty of restaurant down the road pub restaurants chains 
83957,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Booking for small double room not in system and given a King room as only other room available was a twin Booked around 11pm and arrived around 11 30pm Check out is 11am and not 12pm as stated in our email Room was disturbed Bedding was out of place Toilet had been used seat down lid up Pret a manger coffee cups still in bin Ear plugs packet opened and one left on bedside table Door wasn t locked when we arrived as it needs a push to shut properly Did someone else wonder in Requested change of bedding instead of moving room but replacement duvet wasn t fresh Eventually settled for two duvet sheets as it was already past midnight at this point We were given an extra mattress topper which was mistaken for a duvet ,No Positive
83958,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Some confusion over the check out time 12 noon According to booking com Hotel said 11am Also they said breakfast was not included although booking com said it was Parking was two spaces on a driveway some distance away, Very helpful staff
83959,Mercure London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Everything This is my second time in Mercure previous was in Bristol and this hotel never disappoints me Our room was clean location was fantastic staff is friendly earls court station is 5 minute walk and lots of restaurants nearby 
83960,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Breakfast was average Room size is good for solo travelers because t may get cramped for more Bathroom curtains were not very clean, I stayed in king size bed room Bed was comfortable Location is good Location is near to earl court well connected with most of the places in central London Room came with a handy an android phone free international calls to India as well local calls and data
83961,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, There should be the option for natural ventilation system That would be less expensive for the hotel costs more healthy for the guests and surely more confortable, Very nice good quality breakfast and very confortable bed
83962,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, When they say a small double room I wasn t expecting to have to side shuffle round the bottom of the bed Also not the cleanest room I have ever stayed in and bathroom could do with updating , Checking out was quick
83963,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Nothing to dislike, The room was very compact and bijou however could not fault any of the visit experience and the towels were extra fluffy too 
83964,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Breakfast, Stay was amazing the staff was great just a bit disappointed with the breakfast for it being 4 star I would have expected a lot more as they didn t have much to offer
83965,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I honestly can t think of any thing I didn t like , I was tired and grumpy from an extended period of travel From the moment I entered the hotei until I left after an overnight stay the friendly and professional attitude and service from all staff was exemplary The front desk staff and the bar and food service staff were teriffic the room was small but very comfortable and clean Great double bed thank you
83966,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I booked executive king room 20 sq meter When I chicked in I was given a room hardly 10 sq meter in size and I was told by Maria at the reception that this was their largest room The next day when I complained Prosciva gladly moved me to a larger room and was very helpful about it In the new room the air conditioning was leaking during my entire stay despite several attempts at fixing it The building in general need major renovation This is not the standard I am used to from a hotel if the Accor group , The location is good The bed is comfortable Proscova and Carmin at the reception were very helpful and friendly 
83967,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The price of the room was too expensive for what it was The small room are too small you could not walk around the room without hurting yourself Two people in a bed is uncomfortable because the bed was tiny and the bathroom was also small No space to really put your suitcase It was dated It needs to get refurbished with a modern look like downstairs is , The staff where very friendly Helped us with our luggage and gave the information we needed Really helpful 
83968,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was a little small and straight opposite the lifts so a little noisy The staff at breakfast seemed uninterested and were slow to replenish buffet , The bed was comfy
83969,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The state of the rooms is horrendous They pretend to be a 4 star hotel but it is more like a hostel You can barely get changed in the standard room as it is tiny and they charge 200 Pounds for it The rooms are noisy badly equipped with old stuff Lamp was held together with Tape To top it off Incredibly small and uncomfortable beds I am 5 11 and my feet were hanging out The pictures they use are decepting, Place is a rip off The only nice thing are the pictures they use on Booking com and the entry of the hotel The rest is outdated badly 
83970,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Hotel location close to Underground station 350m Handy device which gives you free mobile internet maps tourist information s calls etc was found very useful for tourist visit , Congested room corridors and elevator breakfast not as great as expected for 4 star Hotel 
83971,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The breakfast was average and it was more of a vegetarian meal for me which is not what i usually have in the morning , I loved the staff as they were so helpful the rooms the beds 
83972,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Expensive and breakfast very basic For example only enough coffee for one cup and only one piece of toast , Comfortable bed Very welcoming and friendly staff Excellent location 
83973,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Definitely not 4 star Four single beds in a family room hardly big enough to swing a cat I was upgraded to this room and travelled solo still not much room for luggage I couldn t imagine a family staying here The mattresses on the single beds were the most uncomfortable I ve ever slept or sat on Way too soft Still I only stayed one night and checked out the next day to a more comfortable hotel , Location
83974,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Absolutely no room in the standard sized rooms Also the receptionist who checked us in expected 4 of us to sleep in 1 small double bed She argued with us when we said we had booked 2 rooms Very rude , good breakfast
83975,Mercure London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The staff are a real standout for genuine friendliness and the professionalism that makes for a most enjoyable stay This is especially so in the case of Danielle Imed Mariagrazia and Carmen at the front desk 
83976,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I never found the iPod docking station like in my reservation The internet corner for clients was not working but the receptionist help me with the check in and boarding pass printed , Best location The receptionist Carmen Dambu very helpful and very nice and made me feel like home and welcome The breakfast was good but not like in other location of Mercure in the world I liked better the breakfast at Mercure City Salzburg and also the room and bathroom larger and more modern and new in Salzburg than in London 
83977,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, My room was little too small but that was not an issue since I was traveling solo , What a cozy hotel close to bus and tube stations as well as many attractions restaurants and just everything is few steps away Starbucks lovers you will enjoy your stay there cause they make starbucks in their bar WiFi was good also 
83978,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, TV was disconnected maintenance apparently told reception it was working but was still disconnected go figure , the location was excellent for our purpose 
83979,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room and bathroom was really small and no hanger in the bathroom for towels still moist the next day , We were lucky we got a Carpark in front of the Hotel weekend s free parking The breakfast was fine and enough A few minutes only to Earls Court underground Piccadilly Line 
83980,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, One tiny thing was no full length mirror in our room but as I said it was a tiny thing , Bed was fantastic room great sizes and the breakfast was brilliant Everything you could have wished for 
83981,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Room size in VERY small bed is not for two people me and my wife normal size people and we could hardly fit on it was not comfortable sleep , Easy access to airport and train station
83982,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Would have liked the option of dining at night in the hotel only had limited choice at the bar, Close to the underground and within walking distance to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park Worth adding breakfast to my stay
83983,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, the room was on the sixth floor we had a constant loud noise of water running day and night very difficult to block it out Room Bathroom very small, Location Staff at reception excellent breakfast very good
83984,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Wireless wasn t working House keeping knocked and opened the door 4 times from 8 11 am on our check out day We didnt find any do not disturb tags , Room are nice and the size is good compared to other hotel rooms in London 
83985,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Room was very small If staying again would get larger room as double felt more suited for one person , Great location Plenty of tea coffee and water in room Hairdryer iron and iron board all in room
83986,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The building next door just outside my bedroom window had a noisy air con system, The Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful They all went beyond the expected service level 
83987,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, When arriging my bedroom was flooded leak from the ceiling I had to pack all of my belonging again before getting the key to a new room The staff was not apologetic ,No Positive
83988,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, For starters the lift was too small for me to enter with my luggage which was nothing but a small hand carry and shoulder bag The floor rooms are quite tight and all doors are quite close to each other At times I could not make out if the door that just got shut was the next door neighbor one s or did somebody just balk into my room The room at best was very basic Barely enough room to move around only a one side tabled bed and bare minimum lighting which I think is normal for London hotels however there were other things which made my life miserable Starting from TV and its remote which weren t operational to attending calls I asked the staff to send some one across to my room for checking why TV wasn t working The guy who came by could not speak proper English resulting in difficulty during communication Following which we found out that the remote was in operational and had to be changed It was the first time in my life that a hotel did not activate my wake up alarm despite calling them to inform about it in advance The wake up call came after 20 minutes of the set time Another first for me was that the room service personnel did not bother picking up used towels from my room after getting the room cleaned up Unfortunately the air conditioning stayed very low to keep me sweating at many times Upon checking the temperature it was set at 5 degree with maximum cooling but I was mostly uncomfortable throughout the night, I chose Mercure hotel as it was the first time I was travelling to London and I wanted to stay in a central location This would turn out to be helpful in my commute and enable me to get my work done easily as well Upon entering the hotel the reception made the check in process quite easy but after getting into the lift things were quite messy Some good things about the facility is that it has a good lobby where you can sit and spend some time The tables outside on the road also makes for a good view The hotel is located close by Gloucester road tube station with a 5 minute walk Also it is close to favorite tourist destinations like Natural History museum Victoria and Albert gallery Harrods and some other famous places 
83989,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The rooms are so incredibly small My sister and I had to share a room and it was hard to move around the room without hitting something , The staff members were very friendly and hospitable The English breakfast was very tasty too Their croissants were so good 
83990,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The air con might need some work it didn t really cool the room enough and you can t open windows , The staff was super friendly and went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible They did it with a very calm kind and professional demeanour and we felt very well looked after Also breakfast was filled up quicker than you could blink top 
83991,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, It was one of the hottest weekends of the year and unfortunately our room was really hot You can t open the windows which is common in hotels in London and sadly our air con didn t really work , The staff were incredible So kind patient and helpful always with a smile on their face yet calm and not over the top It felt like they genuinely enjoy their jobs and there is a good atmosphere among the team 
83992,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, We prebooked parking but when we arrived all the spaces had been taken up by their maintenance staff s van and kit so we were unable to use it and had to make our own arrangements, Friendly helpful reception staff
83993,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, there was nothing to dislike We knew that the rooms were small b4 we booked, Breakfast was good value with good availability until late into the session staff were helpful elevator worked everytime we will use Mercure again next time we are in London
83994,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Room was poor too small bedside light was broken and the remote on the tv didn t work On request the light was fixed but not the tv , Breakfast was good
83995,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Category room the Small Double Room Check in date 2016 07 08 and check out date 2016 07 17 On Saturday 8th of July 2016 we came to the hotel and noticed that our room is not like on the photo of the web site very small 7 9 q meters instead of 13 q m as mentioned in the official cite of Mercure Hotel and booking com as well At the toilet was smell sewage systems that make impossible to stay at this room We asked the reception to change the room but at the hotel weren t available free rooms The hotel did not try to solve our problem since 8th of July till the departure The reception did not help us anyway , Location 
83996,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, single rooms are very small but is OK to stay for one two nights, Good location 5 minutes walk from Earl s Court tube station and 10 min travel from the centre of London close to the restaurants friendly staff good WIFI 
83997,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, We had booked bed and breakfast through Booking com but the hotel s system had us down as room only I had to produce an email confirming this but it was still not communicated to the breakfast team , Extra large bed was very comfortable Breakfast was lovely Room was cool and quiet
83998,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Rooms are small however adequate , Staff very friendly and efficient nice breakfast and was able to leave luggage there while at work on the last day 
83999,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The windows were broken it was cold in the room It took two days to get it fixed Meanwhile AC was continuously blowing cold air We had to put extra layers on to survive through the night The housekeeping starts knocking on the doors at 8am and it is impossible to sleep with all the noise Housekeeping bucket and vacuum cleaner is kept in the alleys like installation pieces The cozy double feels like a tiny single The space between the bed and the wall is 7 cm I wonder how the hotel got 4 stars felt like a hostel , Location is good
84000,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Room was small but we knew that and it was ok for us But if you have bigger luggage international travellers it could be a problem , Room was very clean smelled nice amazing location between two metro stations Front desk was nice we were a few minutes late for the checkout but they were nice about it 
84001,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room safe was broken They were inflexible in either offering a room change or a practical solution One of the purpose to get a hotel was to leave my valuables in the room The entire purpose was lost and I had the stress of carrying my passport jewelry etc all over London Also the room was very small , Location
84002,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Washbasin clogged and slow to drain , Room wes supposed to be superior Maybe it was compared to standard offering But very small If 2 0people would be cramped moving around Check in staff very friendly Irish papers a great bonus Pricey for a basic chain hotel experience 
84003,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, A massive thing we didn t like was that out room was next to the lift and we could hear it all night Walls are thin Also the cleaners need to be told to keep their voices down as from early on well before 8 on a Sunday morning they woke us up and we couldn t sleep , The staff were fantastic and the location was great 
84004,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Our room itself although quite small despite paying extra for a spacious Privilege Room was nice It was however badly let down by the bathroom The worst of the problems were a shower that wouldn t stay in position I had to fix it with a business card and a supposedly clean towel that was put in our room with stains and what appeared to be chewing gum stuck to it With these major flaws in mind you start to notice smaller things that maybe wouldn t bother you otherwise The bathroom looked a bit rundown in general with 2 spotlights loose in the roof and the taps for the shower broken away from the wall at one side though still functional Given that the rest of the hotel was nice I m a bit puzzled that Mercure are satisfied with poor quality bathrooms in a hotel they class as 4 star Noise inside the hotel was also an issue room doors would slam shut hard and people moving around in the hallway could be clearly heard in the room , Great location just 5 minutes walk from Earl s Court Tube Station with Earl s Court itself just a little further Very convenient for getting around on the district or Picadilly lines short tube trips for Paddington Station and the Leicester Square area Lot s of bars and restaurants along Earl s Court Road and surrounding area Breakfast was excellent though the breakfast room is a little small so could be quite busy The bedroom was quite well protected from noise outside the hotel though noisy inside see negatives and the curtains were pretty effective at keeping out morning sunlight too Staff were all great with us 
84005,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, It is a bit soulless but hey it was good for the price , I loved the location the friendly staff there were parking meters out front for my car staff were very friendly but not in my face Bed was super comfortable and room was very clean Shower and bath were lovely and also clean 
84006,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Quite small room but it s what I expected Small things like only 1 out of 3 light bulbs working in bathroom could ve been better , Good location good staff 
84007,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Noise from the corridors other rooms not the cleaners other guests fault just poor soundproofing The mini croissants were not flakey at all in fact stodgy and cold according to my wife luckily I am not that bothered with croissants otherwise breakfast was fine , The room was comfortable staff helpful and friendly Location was good being between Earls Court and Gloucester Road tube stops Also buses run past the hotel Hotel was near to many restaurants bars museums and close to Harrods if you want to splash the cash 
84008,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, only a short one night stay and we did not eat in the hotel we liked everything, lovely large comfortable beds only short one night stay and we did not eat in the hotel everything was clean comfortable and staff very helpful and friendly would stay again
84009,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The rooms were very average the small rooms are tiny and the executive rooms were ok For the price of the hotel it probably wasn t up to scratch for a 4 star hotel For that price it should include a gym pool and include breakfast We arrived 2 hours early also and were made pay an extra 20 pounds on top of the few hundred already spent which I though was a kick in the teeth , The bed was very comfortable and the location of the hotel was great 
84010,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I booked a double room for myself but it is too small I think it is just a single room with double bed not worthy the money at all , The location is OK breakfast is good staff arenice
84011,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Rooms very small I booked specifically as it said there was free parking on site there are only two spaces directly in front of the hotel on a single yellow line ok at weekends if you are lucky enough to get one If not add a further 30 to your stay purely for parking , Good location
84012,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Space Too small even for one person Difficult to move around, Quality of furnishings and excellence of staff Gabriel and Lisa at Reception were outstanding examples of what hospitality can mean Further they were resourceful in helping me with difficulties that impacted my activities while in London and certainly went a long way in compensating for the too small size of the room 
84013,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The Elevator does not work for the 6th floor and was out of service from 9th May onwards till I check out 14th May still as its , Location Staff
84014,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Cleaner trolley parked outside our room dirty marks on wall coffee and milk not replenished kettle dangerous did not switch off making the handle very hot No maps or tourist info of London , Closeness to Royal Albert hall
84015,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Although the room was a standard double it was smaller than I expected We were on the second floor and the windows could not be opened There was air conditioning but this really dried the air , Friendly staff good breakfast
84016,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Reception staff have tried to preauthorise 20 on my account for things I may or may not use during my stay I literally just spent the night Also tried to preauthorise my room charge so then I can pay the next day urrm I don t think so , The location was good near the tube station 
84017,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Air Conditioning didn t work despite numerous reports which made it almost impossible to sleep Our room remained unserviced on one day even though we were out all day , Good location and comfortable bed Breakfast was very good soft eggs would have been a bonus 
84018,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Air conditioning did not work and heating did not turn off so very hot fridge was broken bathrobe was dirty dried snot on it t v didn t work very well either prob battery was dead And only water in mini bar when mini bar soft drinks were meant to be include in description you gave on the website , Bed was comfortable and room was very clean 
84019,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was extremely small We went down to breakfast at about 8 40 there were very few pastries left no glasses ready to use and had to wait to be asked if we wanted tea coffee , Staff friendly and polite 
84020,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, We took one small double room and that is really a small room I believe these small double rooms should not be allowed and do not fit a 4stars hotel because at the end is just a single room with the smallest possible double bed in the market Also to walk from one side of the room to the other I had to lean on the bed because the clearance was only 30 cms from the bed to the wall Of course we called booking com and they solved the problem and upgraded us to a proper double room , Breakfast is very good location is quite nice you can easily walk to the hyde part or the natural history museum Personal is quite friendly and except the fact that the small double room should not be allowed everything was perfect 
84021,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Room was tiny and too hot despite the efforts of the airconditioning We chose this hotel primarily because it offered parking To our dismay the parking was on another street and was no more than a tiny piece of what looked like wasteland accessed by going over the pavement which could just about manage 3 cars providing one is a noddy car AND we were charged 29 day for the privilege , Nice and clean good breakfast 
84022,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The double bed was a bit small glad I was on my own , The staff were nice but Kevin was a real gem and a great asset to the Hotel People like Kevin make me want to book this Hotel on my next visit 
84023,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The hallways were a little shabby but the hotel is clearly going through refurbishment so I m sure this shall be addressed soon, Staff were very friendly helpful
84024,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Choice on the menu was rather limited, Staff were particularly sympathetic and helpful as I was visiting someone in the hospital next door Bed was very comfy bath was larger than normal especially as I had a small double room
84025,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Hotel was great however our room was situated beside a generator therefore got a lack of sleep on the first night however hotel reception were great and moved us rooms in the morning , Breakfast was great and hotel bar staff were very friendly 
84026,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was smaller than expected we did know this was a small room when booking but it looked like a room for a single bed with a double bed put in The TV was beside the bed not at the end along with the room light controls , The room was very quiet breakfast was good and it was within easy walking distance of the museums and Royal Albert Hall 
84027,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The housekeeping staff were fairly rude in the morning almost ordering us out of the room barely past check out time Room size not the greatest, Room bed and facilities amenities
84028,Mercure London Kensington Hotel,No Negative, After having stayed one night in another quite horrible Hotel I changed to the Mercure Hotel and it was like heaven Staff was incredibly nice and I even could get the room a bit earlier than officially possible 
84029,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Staff were rude and unhelpful They gave us our key then started doing something else not telling us where to go or what level to go to , Great location tasty breakfast
84030,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The lift is not working some of the times The noises from the other rooms can be heard, The staff are very nice and welcome the cleaning of the rooms is good
84031,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I had the first trouble to check in because the hotel misspelled my name in their reservation system The receptionist could not find my booking Even though I gave the booking number I had to wait for long time The second trouble occurred at the breakfast Breakfast was included in my room rate however the room number and my name were not shown in the list I was asked to go to the reception and solve the problem by myself It would be better if one of breakfast staff handled it Also the hotel address is pretty tricky It would be helpful if they say Cromwell Road instead of Lexham Gardens ,No Positive
84032,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The size of my room was very small It was a corner room that seem to be shoe horned into the hotel Compared to my colleagues room which was much bigger and I paid the same rate , The bed was comfortable and breakfast had a good selection
84033,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Windows did not open they said due to health and safety but it s made the room stuffy AC was there but made no difference Hot water was Luke warm all the time we was there , Room was lovely bed was very comfortable and the location was good 
84034,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was far too small even for a small double bed had to squeeze between foot of the bed and wall to get round Window is poor and lets in draught and noise and also had zero view worth looking at, Staff very pleasant and helpful Excellent location for food drinks and underground 
84035,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Room was comfortable but tiny and not classed as a small double so dread to think how cramped they are It was too hot even with aircon on Very overpriced but that is typical of London , A nice hotel with friendly staff Room was clean and comfortable A few minutes walk to tube stations 
84036,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, For the night I was there could not fault it as I had no issues arise in my stay there really Only minor point for anyone staying there is they do not have a main full restaurant there so would need to take a five to ten minute walk either way to find food establishments but does serve food like a selection of fresh made sandwiches during the day or a pizza which is their limit but what they did offer did taste nice and was quite fair for the money considering London prices can be , Hotel felt quite quaint and not overcrowded for a city hotel and staff were very friendly professional and efficient at their roles within the hotel made it a hassle free stay for the night They even looked after my bags on the second day when I checked out to go to a exhibition and picked them up on the way through at the end of the day Also as standard they have a mini bar fridge which comes with complimentary soft drinks two bottles of water but has no sensors so you can stock up on cold beverages of your own from round the corner at the local Sainsbury s without fear of being charged when you take a drink out was quite nice to have in a standard room It seemed nothing was to much of an effort for them no matter what you asked for or needed In short with my one nights stay I was impressed with the Mercure as the standard rooms are a normal size affair not to small but not yet massive with a nice bath shower set up and comfortable beds with nice pillows Could not fault the cleanliness through out my stay either 
84037,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, People in room next to mine loudly talking till 430am So bad even earplugs didn t drown it out Not hotels fault but ruined my stay , Delicious breakfast warm welcome at reception Speedy resolve of stay issues 
84038,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, It was a bit of a walk from the tube not too bad about 10 mins They allowed me to leave my bags there after I checked out however when I returned to collect them they had problems finding it although they were all labelled It made me panic a little bit but it all ended well , The bed was extremely comfy although the room was a little bit smaller than expected The bathroom was spotless and filled up with complimentary products The staff was friendly and helpful I went down to the bar around midnight when they were closed already but they opened it for me and allowed me to take all my drinks up to the room Would highly recommend 
84039,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Didn t like the coffee at breakfast it was too strong Also didn t like the fact that in spite of paying for breakfast as part of the room booking with booking com we were told 3 or 4 times at breakfast by several different staff that we hadn t paid for breakfast and then after showing them the booking details and confirmation on my phone and still not being believed we had to leave the breakfast room to go and speak to the lady at reception Kind of spoilt what would have been a very nice breakfast , Was comfortable and clean The ladies at the reception desk were also very helpful 
84040,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Position of the tv in the room would be my only grudge For one night it was no big deal but for a longer stay that would bother me , Hair dryer and ironing board in the room Super comfy bed 5 minutes walk from earls Court station and a saintsburys across the road What more to ask 
84041,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, This hotel is by far the worst Accor experience we have ever had It is certainly not up to any standard suggested by the Mercure category First and foremost we checked in with a booking for a standard double room not the small room and were introduced to a tiny cramped space where one can barely move to the other side of the bed Nothing close to the advertised 16 square metres neither close in comfort to what is shown on the hotel photos Upon complaining at the reception we were informed by the clerk that it was normal that all hotels cheat on their websites and only as a special treatment we would be granted an upgrade to a bigger room The bigger room was closer in size to what had been advertised which does not help the fact it felt very worn out extremely noisy we literally heard every single sound from the hall or the adjacent rooms and the bathroom was cramped and seriously lacking in cleanliness The room service kept bothering us from 9am in the morning once even entering the room abrubtly after 2 seconds from knocking The breakfast was O K although at 30 minutes prior to its end the food wasn t replenished anymore which we believe is a breach of some most basic guest service rules We kept wondering how it was possible that Mercure inspectors visit this hotel and still allow it to operate under the brand , The location is great nice neighbourhood very close to the Earl s Court tube Most of the staff were kind and helpful 
84042,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The mattress was very soft too soft for both me and my partner unfortunately The traffic being London was obviously very busy but earplugs were provided , The very friendly and helpful staff were fabulous From bringing up different sized bathrobes and more teabags to helping us plan our days in London Breakfast was brilliant with lots of variety on offer and very unhurried 
84043,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The lift wasn t working so we had to go in a tiny lift with the staff , The room was nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable The staff were friendly and the location was great 
84044,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The cleaning service is annoying and starts too early I was unpleasantly surprised to find my tooth brush lying at the drain of the basin after one of the cleanings , Nice location friendly personnel at reception
84045,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was cold although the room temperature was set to 30 C , The room was the right size for the length of our stay Complimentary refreshments 
84046,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The actual room heater was more like air conditioning because it was cooling the room both ways But they got me a stand alone heater immediately I complained problem solved , The room was very comfortable location of the hotel is great staff very polite and the lady receptionists were super friendly Love the free wifi throughout the hotel 
84047,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Front desk staff did not appear knowledgeable on procedures for checking in I had to make two reservations for consecutive days and it seemed to confuse the staff that the info on check in name address credit card would be the same for both reservations , Excellent location access to Earl s Court and Gloucester tube stations great restaurants nearby comfortable room clean 
84048,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Staff extremely poor english understaffed Parking there are only 2 two parking slots that s 1 1 2 parking places for the whole 82 bed hotel that there are away from the hotel they charge 35 day but you park on your own risk To summarize this hotel does not have a hotel parking Room tiny we booked the executive king because we had read that the standard ones were small It is barely 12 square meters Bed mattress ultra soft felt like a water matrress not pleasant for your back , Location central Kensington excellent access to tube stations Breakfast above average
84049,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, I have booked a king size room but they gave me only small double size room The receptionist was very rude and unhelpful at all The room was very small and the bathroom too,No Positive
84050,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Size of the room very small Bathroom was old bathtub was very used and had impacts Disappointing for a Mercure , Well located few minutes walk from the underground station 
84051,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Tiny room broken shower and light and water was only warm in shower after 9pm Only 1 plug out of 4 in the room worked Needs a lot of work , Comfy bed and good location 
84052,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The room was a little smaller than anticipated, the atmosphere was amazing we were provided with all the facilities necessary and it even had its very own starbucks 
84053,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The size of the rooms Old elevator Windows were leaking air so it was cold in the room bed and bathroom were alright, The location and ease of check in and out
84054,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Booked a small double room which was adequate but was quite small approx 1 foot space between end of the bed and the wall In saying that room was equipped with all you would need tv tea coffee hairdryer iron ironing board ensuite Hotel seemed to only have 1 small lift for guests so certainly in the morning time there can be a wait for it , Nice hotel friendly staff located in nice area 10 min walk to Gloucester Road Tube Station Easily accessed from Heathrow Some restaurants and shops a short walk away 
84055,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Room and bathroom a bit small Could hear other guests talking in their rooms and their TV , Staff were very helpful and friendly Location was good also in between two metro stations Lots of restuarants nearby Right next door to Bupa Cromwell hospital 
84056,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, It was advertised restaurant and there was no lunch or dinner services we had to go to another hotel l would not stay there again , Location was brilliant but l stayed at mercure greenwich and that was brilliant that is why l booked mercure kensington which was much more expensive 
84057,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, The executive king room was very small the elevator was not working for 10 days the nespresso machine and the minibar were inside the cuberd which was not easy to use ,No Positive
84058,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Way too much noise You could hear people closing doors anywhere on the same floor and I suspect even on different floors Room was tiny normal for London though The 1 one lift was broken , The location was convenient for us It is a short walk from Earl s Court station All in all I would have enjoyed the stay if it weren t for the all the NOISE that prevented any sleep 
84059,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, We ordered room service on our last evening the staff member at the bar was a bit rude and there weren t many main meals left so had to have an appetiser for dinner which didn t taste very good , Friendly reception staff and very close to the underground Lovely sized room and very clean Will definitely stay again 
84060,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, It was unfortunate the lift was not working atthe time we were there although the staff tried to be accommodating as possible by using the goods lift Also for elderly guests rooms with a walk in shower would be appreciated , The hotel was quite central with regard to the Underground Also good supermarket close by Staff very helpful 
84061,Mercure London Kensington Hotel, Everything are bad They put me in small smallest room in the world even though I reserved standard and when I explain to them they told me we will change it in the next day depend on the availability The elevator is not working and others customers told me been it has been like this for more than 3 weeks Did you believe four star hotel with no elevator for more than 3 weeks and you have to go walking upstairs every time you came and in my case I was in the 6 floor I think this hotel can get maximum 2 stars with the facilities available It s Shame on Mercure upper management to have like this hotel in London, Nothing
