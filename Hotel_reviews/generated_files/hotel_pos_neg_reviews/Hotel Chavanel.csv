111276,Hotel Chavanel, Nothing , Often travelling to Paris for business trips I was impressed by the quality of the Chavanel hotel 210 without breakfast during the Fashion Week in March 2017 Everything was perfect from the reception staff to the modern and refined decoration the confortable bed the room size for Paris etc The hotel is super close from the Madeleine which is very practical for tourists too Would definitely recommend it and come back 
111277,Hotel Chavanel, The breakfast is definitely not worth the 20 euros and it s located in the dark basement of the hotel They claim that it is all organic but a stale croissant is just not acceptable in Paris organic or not There is breakfast available at 2 cafes right in front of the hotel Cheaper and better Room cleaning was never done but the front desk clerk admitted of their mistake The room was not reported as used to the cleaning crew Those negative points will not stop me from going back to this hotel , The location at the Madeleine is very central The staff were VERY kind and helpful and even upgraded me to a better room The room was very nice modern and on the quieter side of the hotel
