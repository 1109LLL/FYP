239981,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Room is really small For a discounted price of 210 euros you d expect a slightly bigger room You basically have the space for the bed and not much more Breakfast was not included and again I was put off by the asking price of 18 per person so we had our coffee and croissant outside Somehow was expecting to see the Eiffel Tower from the room given hotel name but no room has a view over the Eiffel Tower , Clean Well located welcoming and friendly staff The bathroom goodies are from Herm s which is a nice touch

239985,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, The service of the staff was excellent and very personal The hotel offers everything you need for a relaxed stay and is very conveniently located near the Eiffel Tower and the main underground lines Restaurants and brasseries are nearby and they provide access to a health club Can absolutely recommend a stay 
239986,Hotel Ares Eiffel, It was quite expensive and the room was very small However we understand that all hotel rooms in Paris are small It was well appointed however so very adequate , The staff was very helpful and the breakfasts were awesome We enjoyed having a bathtub as it was cold and rainey while we were there

239992,Hotel Ares Eiffel, The size of the room was really small for four people We booked through TripAdvisor and got a discount which made the room 260 euros and the city tax was 94 euros so beware , Location value cleanliness
239993,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, In a quiet street within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower we really enjoyed exploring a new area of Paris for us and staying at this welcoming boutique hotel We loved the residential feel to the area local food shops and smaller resturants We walked along the seine and through parks and back streets we have only seen from a tour bus in the past The room was small but comfortable and well equipped and staff were helpful and attentive We will definitely use the hotel again 
239994,Hotel Ares Eiffel, I couldn t find anything wrong or have a bad word to say about this hotel I stay at a lot of hotels and the staff here were one of the best I ve stayed in , The reception staff were very welcoming and the room was clean to the highest standard Amazing location close to the metro to get around the city and 5 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower
239995,Hotel Ares Eiffel, I love feather pillows and duvet s the hotel does not provide these , Very easy to get to and less than 10 minutes walk to the Eiffel tower Lots of lovely bars within less than 2 minutes walk and also local shops Metro line less than 2 mins away Rooms very nicely furnished super clean and toiletries included are lovely The balconies make the hotel feel very Parisian

239997,Hotel Ares Eiffel, On the rare occasion the warm breakfast options were cold not always nice eating a cold chicken sausage and scrambled eggs However the choice and quality of all on offer was of a high standard generally and the lady providing breakfast is always warm and welcoming , I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions I love the location and the staff who are always willing to help There is nothing better than arriving at the hotel after a busy day and being able to relax in comfort within the heart of Paris 
239998,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms were clean and really nice Continental breakfast sets you up for the day Also revived a nice gift from reception when we left I would recommend the hotel to anyone , Location is perfect 10 mins walk to the Eiffel Tower 5 min walk to the Metro Off the main road and it is nice and quite 
239999,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Nothing to dislike if you like boutique hotels with charm rather than big impersonal chains , A definite favourite in Paris charming rooms nice staff good location excellent breakfast 
240000,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Georges was the only reason I cannot give this place 10 out of 10 He didn t want to renew our wifi for us after the 3rd day when we were checking out the following day That day was the most essential looking for flight times taxis check ins etc He made it very difficult for us to get all our departure needs straightened out We had to ask 4 times and he only gave us one for 3 people to share We paid for this night as well so why was he being so difficult To add to the insult he failed to call me a taxi at 4 30 am After I asked twice When I came down he said I didn t need to leave this early I explained I wanted to be early and he continued to argue with me Finally he told me to stand outside near the metro for at the taxi stand I am a 33 yr old woman alone who didn t want to be outside by myself at 4 30 am Another concierge from another hotel helped me and called a taxi He was the most pleasant person and helped me when I was afraid and nervous about my flight The taxi he provided charged me 30 to Orly when Georges told me 60 Was he trying to rip me off Why was this man so awful He truly destroyed our end experience in Paris , The location was great and the bathrooms were big and very clean The free wifi for each guest was an added bonus The hotel itself is pretty and a great place to stay Dean was amazing and the most accommodating concierge He put the standard or expectation so high it was difficult to expect any less 
240001,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, I checked in early in the morning on Christmas Day no problem Room was ready way before regular check in hours Very very friendly staff evidenced from check in to check out everyone was so friendly helpful and accommodating even it is over the Christmas period Breakfast was excellent Love the bread from Kayser Little present on my way out left a lasting impression and thank you Great value if you compare to other Parisian hotels Highly recommended 
240002,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Nothing, Id give this place a 10 except for the fact that the windows were single paned and let the cold creep in But they provided a space heater so it was ok Staff was excellent
240003,Hotel Ares Eiffel, The rooms were a little smaller than expected compared to the photographs The lift was broken and we were in the 6th floor but that was beyond the hotels control due to he holiday period , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly We were there for New Years and they invited us for a drink in the breakfast room which was lovely Offered a wifi dongle for use around the city for 5 per day which was really useful to help us get around Good breakfast which consisted of a contenental spread with eggs and sausages Amazing location with just a small walk away from the Eiffel Tower and Military museum with everything easy to get to and a great selection of restaurants in the area in particular Cafe Carmine which was recommended to us from the hotel 
240004,Hotel Ares Eiffel, At 300 Euros per night including breakfast our Executive Suite was too pricy for the few sq meters of size the room provided which included a pull out ottoman chair Parking was three blocks away small under a grocery store don t bring a large vehicle Pet Friendly means no place for pooch to pee and don t leave Fido in the room unattended despite us having a perfumed bark collar Hard to bring your pet inside Paris museums events Internet was free but probably dial up speeds in 2017 Elevator broke lucky we were only one level up Despite an elegant building the walls floor didn t prevent noise spillage into our quarters , Location of Hotel within walking to cafes Metro Eiffel Tower and owner very friendly to chat with His lady manager was very helpful friendly too Breakfast was sub standard but crescent rolls the best We spent a cold New Yrs Eve and heating system worked medium well but the modern bath shower room rocked 
240005,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Little noisy Every morning room keepers knocking at your door although they could coordinate this with reception they ask to leave the key when you leave So don t expect non disturbed long sleep in the morning Shelf for clothes is so tiny that you can t fit a normal size coat in it Actually dont understand the function of this size shelf at all to be honest Night time reception man speaks English very bad and is VERY slow Prepare for that Look for space on the street for parking and pay 5EUR till 11AM instead of 20EUR night parking at the parking they offer 200 meters away , Nice location but there was a construction on the site which was starting their loud work at 9AM or earlier Good breakfast though could be a more cozy room for having it Very nice and helpful lady in breakfast room 
240006,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, This hotel is absolutely stunning Location is perfect and I really can t praise the staff enough As soon as we arrived the lady on reception was so warm and welcoming I really didn t want to leave If you re looking for something special with a loved one I would highly recommend this hotel Thank you for creating such a wonderful experience We will be back soon 
240007,Hotel Ares Eiffel, breakfast it may be good if there is a slight change in the breakfast menu instead of having the same items everyday specially if someone is spending several days, The staff were friendly and helpful and the location is perfect
240008,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Would have been nice to have tea and coffee in the rooms and maybe more selection of drinks available in the lounge area , Stylish hotel with good quality fixtures and fittings Small rooms but well appointed Comfortable beds Good breakfast with nespresso coffee Staff very friendly and helpful Very close to metro to many of the most visited places 
240009,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Didn t get the goodbye gift everyone talks about The lady that checked us in was quite abrupt There was an odd smell to the hotel when you arrived Also put us in a room by the building works which is right outside hotel and very noisy Woke us up at 7 each morning, Clean rooms Comfortable bed Nice bathroom
240010,Hotel Ares Eiffel, it can get really noisy because there is a construction site just opposite the hotel the rooms are little bit small and they come without water kettle or free drinking water, very friendly staff and nice location with proximity to effiel tower and metro and bus stations it is also not very far from Paris expo porte de versailles around 15 mnts drive and ordering a taxi through the reception was always quick

240014,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Overall is the room is nice but it very small and squeezy for four person would be better to show the actual room look like when the time we do booking , The Hotel is very clean and the staffs are very friendly and helpful 
240015,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Noisy in the early hours of the morning with garage trucks etc Otherwise great stay , Hotel Ares Eiffel was a great choice and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Paris Lots of restaurants and cafes in the area 2 minute walk to the monoprix 
240016,Hotel Ares Eiffel, I really can t think of anything , Really quiet location with nearby access to the metro Very clean rooms and bathrooms with heated towel racks which would be nice in cool weather The staff was very helpful in directions and arranging transportation for a last minute drive into the countryside The breakfast was included and was excellent

240019,Hotel Ares Eiffel, The room was small but we really did not need any extra space We did not have a view of the Eiffel Tower from the room as some of the pictures may suggest , The bed was very comfortable and the staff was very helpful They provided Hermes soap shampoo and lotion The amenities were all nice and the location was excellent The staff recommended a great restaurant and when we mentioned the hotel we got free drinks at the restaurant 
240020,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Shower is very difficult to get in and out of and it has a half glass door that soaks the floor when you shower , Excellent staff great location comfortable bed great neighborhood 
240021,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, We just loved this hotel The room was beautifully decorated beds were comfortable and very clean and airy The staff was excellent so friendly and helpful going above and beyond what we needed The location was perfect about a 4 block walk from the Eiffel Tower and around the corner were very nice cafes a pharmacy grocery store but it was tucked on a quiet little side street 
240022,Hotel Ares Eiffel, There is no big choice at breakfast Small room no facilities bed was like single Definitely not a 4 star hotel , The location is perfect 10 minutes from Tower of Eiffel big balcony with amazing view 
240023,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Wish I could have stayed longer, The moment we stepped thru the door we were greeted with a warm and friendly smile an easy check in process and access to local advice for directions and what to see Our twin room was spotless and comfy A vintage bldg located in a safe area with oodles of charm and yet had every modern comfort Bonus There was a Starbucks within walking distance I would stay here again And again 
240024,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Nothing This hotel was a dream , This hotel is AMAZING I don t even know where to begin The bed was soft and perfect for sleeping The bathroom was large and had wonderful amenities The room was spacious and clean I also want to compliment the staff WOW I have never received such amazing service from such friendly people I hope the staff never changes The woman at the front desk deserves 5 stars I will absolutely stay here again just because of the service but the rooms were fantastic 
240025,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, Nice Hotel in a quiet part of town about 10 15min walk from the Eiffel Tower 5min walk to Metro train station Delis diners and shopping very close by 
240026,Hotel Ares Eiffel, The breakfast wasn t all that maybe because French food is abit different but the scrambled egg was runny and watery , The rooms were lovely and the staff were very happy and helpful 
240027,Hotel Ares Eiffel, I wish some one had told me there was a fan heater in the wardrobe , The rooms seemed newly decorated and were really clean Very close to the Eiffel Tower

240029,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, A charming hotel with gorgeous staircase decorations of giant plaster flowers which gives it an Alice in Wonderland charm Good service and great location 
240030,Hotel Ares Eiffel, My travel coincided with EuroUEFA Championship in France Some roads around the hotel in Paris were closed so access was not very easy Unload drop off luggage was possible at hotel Parking place was 10 minutes walk away from hotel in the basement garage was very clean though of a supermarket which seemingly was an overnight place for illegal immigrants and gave us some scary seconds on our way out of the basement , When we wanted to change to a different room in the hotel our wish was immediately granted by reception staff Mini bar we could empty for a daily 5 Euro This was a great deal This property is in walking distance to the Eiffel Tower Restaurants bars brasseries nearby My wife received a Hermes farewell present upon check out Next time we ll go there again 
240031,Hotel Ares Eiffel, We were there during soccer tournaments and the streets were closed down and too many loud fans Not the hotel s fault but would have been good to know , The front desk service Breakfast included Nice bathrooms for Paris 
240032,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Due to the fact that We made our booking online It was unnerving to find out that we could get similar accommodation at almost a third of the price paid through the online agent Although we upgraded our room to a delux room there was barely enough room for our luggage to stand So I was disappointed with the price and size of the hotel room The staff more than made up in friendliness , The staff were exstremely friendly and helpfull
240033,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Our taxi could not get through the streets to take us to our hotel and we had to walk several blocks with our luggage because the streets were blocked for the soccer fans , The desk clerk was very friendly and helpful on Sat And Sunday morning Sat Night we were recommended to a great dinner restaurant by the male clerk 
240034,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Wifi very very weak such a expensive hotel should provide proper wifi speed for business people like me , Hotel staffs are very friendly and willing offer extra mile help One good example on counter staff all the way to come near Le Palaise Maharaja restaurant to communicate my shuttle driver arrived for me to pick me up It is a kind gesture and politeness of Ares Eiffel Thanks
240035,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Nothing but if must say the shower tap was stuck , Nice welcome by staff attention to details chocolate on pillow quiet room lovely decoration good size room 
240036,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Nothing , Breakfast was quite good and very tasty Can add a little more variety But overall a very cosy place to stay Very near to the Eiffel Tower As it was slightly drizzling they offered umbrellas to walk down 
240037,Hotel Ares Eiffel, No hot water one night 8 euros for two tea bags a bit much even for Paris especially as tea was not brought to room , Helpful staff quiet room location excellent
240038,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, I loved everything about Ares The staff are so customer caring Ask them anything they will assist you In addition Ares Eiffel is two steps from the famous Champs de Mars Eiffel Tower the metro station

240040,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Have no complaints , The hotel location is wonderful easy 10 minute walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and shops The staff was wonderful and help us with every request Breakfast was great eggs cooked perfectly and fresh bread and pastries Definitely would stay again and recommend to family and friends 
240041,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, The location was perfect a stones throw away from the Eiffel Tower and there is a great road round the corner with plenty of bars and restaurants that are all reasonably priced I recommend caf primrose The staff are wonderful who cannot do enough to help wether its recommendations for restaurants booking taxis etc All in all a wonderful hotel 
240042,Hotel Ares Eiffel, We felt a more detailed map of how to find you would have helped It took us twenty minutes to find from where we got the bus to , We didn t eat in hotel but the room was comfy
240043,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Breakfast was too expensive according to what you get Sausages were cooked in the microwave as well as the scrambled eggs Not good , Bed and room was good 
240044,Hotel Ares Eiffel, No room service or bar Could have offered more assistance with navigating city , The bathroom was spacious and updated Decor modern and stylish Location convenient but not too touristy 
240045,Hotel Ares Eiffel, No kettle in room to make a cup of tea , Excellent quiet location close to the Metro and easy walking of Eiffel tower Very pleasant and courteous staff who gave a warm and helpful welcome Nice to get a free upgrade Free maps helpful Staff were more than happy to look after luggage on last day until our train left Excellent room with very large bed and sitting area Excellent bathroom with bath and separate shower and two basins Given a small gift on leaving Very good breakfast in very pleasant breakfast room never rushed 
240046,Hotel Ares Eiffel, the room was a little smaller than we are used to but certainly comfortable clean modern , the beds were great the staff were always helpful and available I would stay here again
240047,Hotel Ares Eiffel, The air conditioning was a little flakey and in the end I just opened the large door the balcony Since the street outside was very quiet this wasn t a problem In addition I had problems connecting to the internet but since I didn t really need it this was not an issue for me If I had raised both little issues with the front desk I am sure that it would have been solved, The room was very well decortated it appeared to be recently renovated with modern facilities except for the very good but slightly antiquated TV Even so everything worked OK The room was quiet and I had a view of the top of the Eiffel Tower which was something I didn t expect There was plently of light in the room The lobby of the hotel is very pretty and the staff are exceptionally friendly very keen to help in all situations 
240048,Hotel Ares Eiffel,No Negative, The Staff was very helpful and very professional A short walk from the Eiffel Tower and countless restaurants The staff gave their recommendation for a great restaurant around the corner and was one of the best dinners my wife and I ever had Would definitely recommend this hotel for couples who need to get away 
240049,Hotel Ares Eiffel, The room was a bit small and cramped for 4 adults Perfect for 2 people and the price is on a bit pricey side An additional price for breakfast , After our horrible Airbnb experience we shifted to this Hotel Ares Eiffel which was opposite to it The checkin was pretty smooth and the rooms were pretty good We booked a room for 4 people which had a double bed and 2 sofa bed The sleep was really comfortable 
240050,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Nothing I didn t like have seen that some reviews criticise small public areas but if you read the hotel details it is a boutique hotel and therefore one doesn t expect large public areas It may not be in the very heart of the city but it is so close to a metro station and hotels in popular areas are all twice as expensive as this It is just a ten minute walk to Eiffel Tower and the army museum both major attractions , The hotel was conveniently situated near to a metro station was extremely comfortable and had good quality luxury fittings and extras Hermes toiletries bang and Oluufsen tv etc All the decor in hotel was very tasteful and the breakfast room was lovely as was the breakfast Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and happy to speak in English or French when I addressed them in French 
240051,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Don t take the bus trip Learn the train before you go better bang for your buck, Awesome stay Staff was great and helpful 10 minute walk to Eiffel Tower and the hotel parking is best in Paris if you choose to drive Would love to stay again 
240052,Hotel Ares Eiffel, The airco noise level and not sure it worked well Would be nice to have a spa on premise You need a PHD to use the remote control of the TV, Great location The view on the Eiffel Tower from the bedroom windows The interior exquisitely decorated The giant headboard Hermes toiletries

240056,Hotel Ares Eiffel, The bed was a bit too hard for our personal taste , The hotel was fantastic We arrived the evening before the horrific events last Friday and after the attack we were extremely grateful to learn the owner had decided to stay the night to ensure the safety of all the guests Even without that unfortunate circumstance the staff and facilities are quite amazing Service was that of a luxury or five star resort We will definitely return 
240057,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Well the price is very high even if Paris is expensive , Perfect location very nice district with lots of choice to shop dine and drink Close to Tour Eiffel of course not to forget Calm for Paris very good windows very clean Super friendly staff
240058,Hotel Ares Eiffel, Wifi did not work in the room or only very poorly Not well sound proofed to the next room , Friendly small hotel the owner appears and talks to guests which gives a good and personal impression Breakfast for once value for money usually hotel breakfasts that are not included are never worth the money

240064,Hotel Ares Eiffel, The location is on the side of the Eiffel Tower opposite most of the main touristy things in Paris so it s a bit of a walk to get to see them The doors to the rooms are close together so we often heard people in the hallway as they re going to their room , Great small boutique hotel Staff was very friendly and spoke English
