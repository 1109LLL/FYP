473815,Admiral Hotel, A bit noisy when staying in the room facing the crossroad, Very convinient location next to the metro and train Nice green residential district Staff was helpful
473816,Admiral Hotel, Air conditioning was being updated with major delays did not work at all while the temp outside went to 30C , Good location and services with very helpful and friendly staff
473817,Admiral Hotel, air conditioner didn t work airport service confirmed the money but driver charged more seemed not reliable , air conditioner didn t work airport service confirmed the money but driver charged more seemed not reliable 
473818,Admiral Hotel, NO aircon in room had to keep windows closed when trying to get to sleep due to lots of traffic noise even with windows closed , bed room was clean tidy
473819,Admiral Hotel, The rooms aren t that soundproofed and you can here the cleaning personel pretty early in the hallway , The staff were really helpful This hotel has a really lovely atmosphere The room where i stayed was big and clean Breakfast was nice as well 
473820,Admiral Hotel, They need to mix the old with new like for example changing the electrical sockets to modern ones , The guys who were at the reception were very helpful and made my stay fun 
473821,Admiral Hotel, The mix of Admiral style trying to show Old tradition and Agent 007 what is the connection No carpets toilettes are ugly cheap decorations Breakfast that was brought in the room was a catastrophe cheap tea uneatable croissant and awful cookies Very bad impression , The location was OK Though on the site it is written Gare Central and no it is 3 stations away Pretty clean 
473822,Admiral Hotel, The room is poor condition and old Not value for money at all , Very closed to MiCo Milano Congressi That s the only good thing about this place And perhaps if you James Bond s fan you might like it more 
473823,Admiral Hotel, All floors are made of hard surfaces so that designs the acoustics in the building Anyone walking past your room outside of the door at night you wake up thinking they walk right through your bed , Breakfast is italian guests are mainly italians so that seems to be fine for everyone there I personally would have liked something else than a desk full of cakes and sweets but thats just my personal opinion The tea was very good though The hotel has a very old fashion style some would say elegant and others find it dusty but was really clean staff was very very friendly and helpful Two supermarkets right next door good connection to tram and underground Not far from city center just a nice walk away My stay was fine would go again The photo shwos a single room small but neat with a balcony at the back of the hotel 
473824,Admiral Hotel, It s an old hotel and it seems like they didn t invest in it for very long time It s 4 stars hotel but i would give poor 3 Also the breakfast wasn t good small choice of food I wouldn t recommend it ,No Positive
473825,Admiral Hotel, it is more a 3 star hotel once it was a 4 star in 1976 but nothing really changed since then it got the minimum maintenance which is needed but definitely cries for a huge refurbish if you are looking for a real 4 star look elsewhere , wifi was good
473826,Admiral Hotel, It is not probably a 4 stars hotel The rooms are a bit dated but large and sunny and even if clean floor cleaning could be more accurate Towels and sheets are perfectly clean My bathroom was with the bath tube and a glass to allow a shower but due to a bad sealant the water drips on the floor part of it generously Furthermore the windows are very new but there are no curtains and the glass is transparent in the bathroom so you can either close the external shutter or perform exhibits for the people living in the building on the opposide side of the street This should be corrected because it is not so good having to do everything with the artificial light on This problem is not present in the room Overall I rate these problems as minor issues that the property will surely periodically address so overall I think it s ok Last Largo Domodossola is quite noisy in some hours of the day mainly because of the trams , The position is close to the Domodossola metro and railway station It is very easy to reach the city center the Milano central station etc At the same time it is the closest hotel to MiCo Milano Congressi business centre and then it is very good if you as me re in Milan for a conference there Furthermore the surrunding area is safe and you re not so far away from Corso Sempione arco della pace is about 10 minutes walking and there you can find several places to have happy hours dinner and so on The staff in the hotel is very helpful In particular the youngest guy at the reception is very friendly even though very professional in everything regarding your stay It was more or less as staying at home Nice My room at the 6th floor had a good view from the balcony Very easy to reach the EXPO by public transportation Breakfast is ok and in front of the hotel there is a very good restaurant I would come back
