129782,The Tophams Hotel, On arrival my friend and I thought that the lady on the reception at that time rushed us and did not explain matters to us very well Before we had got really into the reception she was asking for my credit card for the purposes of the mini bar I said that we did not require this but she said that this 25 would be credited to us at the end of our visit I feel that we should have been given the choice and not just told that we had to pay this 25 up front , The reception area and dining room were very pleasant 
129783,The Tophams Hotel, I booked two rooms with twin beds On arrival only rooms available with double bed and a camping bed Rooms were small and filled with too much furniture Beds were uncomfortable One of the camping beds was broken and I had it replaced There were more customers complaining at the reception Lift was out of order temporarily The Hotel didn t want to give the booking com extras such as late checkout , Located quite near Victoria station 
129784,The Tophams Hotel, The elevator is broken and the room is soooo hot as the aircon is not getting cold , The location is very good and there are plenty of great restos and pubs around

129787,The Tophams Hotel, The hotel is in dire need of decoration and updating Lift not working rubbish bags in corridor Air con not working All plumbing needs sorting as no hot water then no cold water Carpets filthy and pictures missing off the walls so just holes in the plaster and that was the bar area We paid 185 for a room with no breakfast worth 50 at most , The manager was very accommodating and friendly The location perfect for the palace

129790,The Tophams Hotel, Please do not book this hotel Photos are not accurate made with filter or photoshop reality is different Room bathroom filthy Day staff horrible not much to choose from for breakfast I paid a lot for full english breakfast and if I didn t ask for it we wouldn t even get it Organisation skills 0 Also you get woken up by squeaky floor Book hotel 15 minutes by train from city center and get a nice hotel for this amount of money I didn t know that I would have the option to add photos so you would believe all I have to say , Only the location 
129791,The Tophams Hotel, The day receptionist could ve smiled more He does not seem accommodating I asked for an ironing facilities as there was none in the room and I have to chase it up after 1 1 2 hours , Location The kitchen staff were wonderful I did not have toiletries in the room and the hair dryer was not working and it was sorted ASAP 
129792,The Tophams Hotel, Nothing at all the hotel is very poor and over priced when we got to the room we were shocked they sent us to unprepared room and there was no bedding no sheets or covers consequently the matters was revealing so dirty lamps were broken no DND sign safe is not working unless if we request a key from reception no lock for bathroom door moreover the lift was not working finally they have charged me twice, The only fine thing was just the location
129793,The Tophams Hotel, Space and distribution of the room staff is nice but take a long time to check in and the cost is super high comparing to the conditions of the room , Location
129794,The Tophams Hotel, The room was poorly laid out The temperature of the hot water in the shower was hard to control When it seemed to be right it would go cold for short periods ,No Positive
129795,The Tophams Hotel, Very small room not unexpected for London incredibly hot despite no obvious radiator in the room the bath had recently been sealed but there is orange mould on the blind in the bathroom yuk , Good location Staff were very helpful when I realised I d left my phone charger and I returned later in the day to collect it 
129796,The Tophams Hotel, The bed was awful the most uncortable thing I ve ever slept it The bathroom didn t have a lightbulb I asked to have it changed three times and still wasn t done , Handy location 
129797,The Tophams Hotel, The receptionist is not really friendly to me Every day i saw guests argue with the receptionist over things They just don t seem to be helpful at all The lift was broken the entire time i was there so have to climb floors everyday The room is spacious but not very clean The floor is so thin that you can basically hear everything your neighbors do especially at night The mattress is the worst and you can actually feel the springs inside in Won t recommend for a long stay , Location is prime Very close to the Victoria Station 
129798,The Tophams Hotel, Not cleaned well burned through holes in bed covered with a pillow the tv remote control was covered in stains and dirt I accidently got some crumbles on the floor next to bed on my first night and throughout 5 nights of my stay they didn t get cleaned vacuumed away imagine what else is on that carpet from previous guests , Great location plus I was lucky to get a spacious room on the first floor The night concierge is very kind unlike his other colleagues unfortunately 
129799,The Tophams Hotel, I have used this hotel on and off since 1997 It used to be privately owned and was very nice but a little run down 8 or 10 year ago it was closed for 2 years and totally refurbished It is now getting ready to be done again as the degree of footfall is starting to show door to wardrobe broken dirty tile grout in bathroom table tops scratched and devoid of paint tea coffee not replenished for second night etc This is a nice hotel in a great location with a bit more thought on the part of the management it could be one of the best and best value in that area , We got a good rate for 2 nights and the location is great for Belgravia 
129800,The Tophams Hotel, The WiFi did not work that well in the room , The room is quite small but it is well thought out and everything that you want is there Great value for money 
129801,The Tophams Hotel, The room was not cleaned as well as it could have been skirting boards and light fittings need dusting too And just a regular coat of emulsion would make so much difference to what should be a lovely cosy hotel , The foyer was welcoming and nicely designed some time ago 
129802,The Tophams Hotel, Had booked a double room at the hotel and was told on arrival there was only a singe bed room in a different location Was left with no choice I was told double rooms were fully booked Room and standard of property was very poor Shower room was terrible Would not recommend anybody to stay here unless you are given a room in the hotel They compensated me with full breakfast ,No Positive
129803,The Tophams Hotel, Stayed in Mews 3 No heating in bathroom area and paint was flaking off of ceiling and walls Only stayed one night so no opportunity to complain at time Would not stay again , 5 minute walk from Victoria station and Apollo theatre Plenty of hot water and water pressure 
129804,The Tophams Hotel, The beds could be more comfortable you could feel the springs in them , Great service very clean great location just a few steps from Victoria Station The wifi worked perfectly and the mini bar was a good bonus The shower and toilets are modern and well equipped including soft towels 
129805,The Tophams Hotel, The room was dirty the headboard was peeling and there were some stains on the walls The bath had no plug there was no iron in the room when there was meant to be and the blind in the bathroom was mouldy and disgusting The mattress was absolutely horrendous it was so old and soft that we both had to climb out of it in the morning , Staff were pleasant and helpful and the hotel is in a great location 
129806,The Tophams Hotel, This was supposed to be a 4 star hotel but this was one of my worst experiences ever The room appliances shower etc were totally outdated smelly some things not working The room I was assigned was missing a TV A hanger for the TV was there but the TV was missing I changed then to another room The room had not even place for a chair and was missing basics that even a hostel has as a hook to hang something or a lights switch near bed or a light close to the bed The shared shower had only cold water the tap was falling down and this had nothing to do with me not knowing how to use it rude excuse from the reception Internet too slow to check even and email Very bad breakfast for a 4 start hotel no real juice very few choices I was offered to pay an extra on top of the extra breakfast cost to get something warm The plugs are old and unlike other international hotels do not fit EU plugs without an UK adapter Personal at the reception has bad manners and is not trained Avoid this place by all means ,No Positive
129807,The Tophams Hotel, it was very cold as we were on the bottom floor and the room took a long time to even heat up a little there were heaters provided but it still took a while, the bathroom was nice and spacious and had a very big bath the hotel was cute and small but just what we needed 
129808,The Tophams Hotel, Have to say that the water pressure for the shower was non existent and that was a particularly cold little cave , Location near Victoria was great for a quick overnighter before heading out from Gatwick

129810,The Tophams Hotel, The fact I was told given my booking there was no more rooms then suddenly pay extra 150 and one was found The whole experience left me feeling mislead and ripped off I will not recommend or return as a customer , Booked on line and arrived to find had to pay additional 150 for my wife as I had a single room with shared bathing facilities which was unclear from my original booking I was very disappointed as I had been a previous customer with my wife and never had this problem before 
129811,The Tophams Hotel, staff didn t really want to help when we asked for an extra pillow it seemed like a big deal and they did not believe I was British at first and demanded to see my passport which I didn t have , bed was very comfy modern room easy to get to from Victoria
129812,The Tophams Hotel, The room was dated dirty and tiny It wasn t what I had booked A member of staff unlocked my door with guests with them at midnight and tried to enter my room whilst I was sleeping I complained and they haven t done a thing about it disgusted Will never stay here again ,No Positive
129813,The Tophams Hotel, Hotel was run down and reception was medieval Receptionist was slow and they wanted the money for the room when we arrived before we had time to see the room Walls were dirty and shower was peeling away at the ceiling Headboards were scratched Not a wide selection of teas for tea and coffee and room was cold I don t think the room or the stay was worth 205 for one night , It was close to the theatre which is what we wanted
129814,The Tophams Hotel, When you first walk into the lobby it looks nice and cozy but once you get into the room that s were you get very disappointed The rooms are way over due for renovation The walls have nasty staines and scratches The comfortater looked like it hasn t been washed in ages Blanket had red stains on it gross I should have taken pictures to post it here But you ll see for yourself if you happen to stay there Shower was all rusty and splashed water all over the place TV remote was broken and TV itself had very poor signal almost impossible to watch But the most disturbing part was the mini bar It had the bottle of sparkling water with broken seal on it refilled with tap water They claim to be the 4 star hotel It s a lie I would barely give them 2 , Location 
129815,The Tophams Hotel, The English cooked breakfast was probably the worst I have had I asked to cancel the breakfast for the rest of the week and they said they could not do this I wouldn t call this a four star hotel , the location was great
