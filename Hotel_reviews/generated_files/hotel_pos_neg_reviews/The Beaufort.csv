151493,The Beaufort,No Negative, There is an elevator in the building to get to the upper floors This lift is very old and it is very very difficult to open the gate to get in It also takes a long time to go from floor to floor There is always coffee tea or soft drinks available from a lovely staff delivered to your room The same is true for tea in the late afternoon 
151494,The Beaufort, My room was very small but as I asked a ground floor room I don t know if The others are bigger I can only be grateful for being at a ground floor room as I asked , The hotel Staff is very Nice In spite of being a 4 stars hotel e feel like being special guest in a lovely house At kinighsbridge Breakfast could be better But having tea And coffee Allianz The time as well as The Open bar is very pleasant
151495,The Beaufort, They could refresh the decor It looks d mod and newer carpets would do wonders The internet was very slow , Small hotel in the center of London Staff were friendly and gave us an upgrading to a bigger and more comfortable room without even asking for it very generous with extras like water tea coffee and drinks in general 
151496,The Beaufort, I would have loved a little fridge in the room and the air conditioning did not get very cool , The location was great and the room was superior The breakfast in our room each morning was perfect 
151497,The Beaufort, I thought I booked a room for two at an agreed upon price When I arrived I was told I booked a single room and was charged 40 pounds a day more for a room for two Also there was no elevator direct to our third floor room We had to ride an elevator that accommodates only two people or one with luggage and exit on the fourth floor Then we walked through two corridors and finally down a flight of stairs to the third floor The other option was climbing three flights of stairs I would not have booked the room st the price we were charged My friends booked a better accommodation in the same area that was less expensive had two beds while we had one and provided complementary breakfast which we didn t get Their facilities had a much better layout , Scones
151498,The Beaufort, The Lounge really isn t a Lounge and it is just a pity there isn t more space available for this but I understand that it is the best that can be made out of what limited space is available, The breakfast served in the room to order was of the highest quality The bed was particularly comfortable
151499,The Beaufort, Piano music in the reception , Friendly helpful staff Lovely breakfast brought to our room Complementary coffee scones in the afternoon Great quite location
151500,The Beaufort, The staff was very accommodating and the room was very spacious and well appointed, I would prefer that breakfast be included and a breakfast room provided
151501,The Beaufort, Your lightly stiff stairs down to the bathroom the stairs down to the bathroom is a hazard, Room Size like a overpriced flat for students yet bead its BIG twin down pillow sheets etc are top quality Take 5 6 down the stairs you have a roomy bathroom shower bathtub towers robes etc Bright lighting for make up NEEDED to be installed asap Full body mirror should be place btw the door and the closet
151502,The Beaufort,No Negative, I loved it here I was stuck with two bad ankles and was really unwell the staff were so helpful and kind to me and went above and beyond to ensure I was ok One staff member found me crutches the other offered to book me in the single room for another night at a reduced rate so I could recover I literally couldn t move they also asked me how I was feeling the next day and brought me up some scones and tea It s really heartening to know that great service and genuine kindness exists and thrives here 
151503,The Beaufort, Breakfast included was Continental not Full English There s no Dining room so breakfast has to be taken in the reception area or delivered to your room which we didn t mind , Pretty much everything Very friendly and helpful staff Complimentary Afternoon tea with freshly baked scones every day which was a lovely touch Very comfortable rooms Great location close to underground 
151504,The Beaufort, The room was small BUT perfectly adaquate as a single guest and all in all was a very lovely room , I stayed in a single room although it was very small it was beautifully decorated spotlessly clean with a very comfy bed good sized bathroom and very friendly staff And all in a great Knightsbridge location Ordering breakfast in bed was an added bonus Would thoroughly recommend 
151505,The Beaufort, More channels on tv would be nice, Excellent location Highly recommend this is exceptional place for the value and the staff goes out of its way to accommodate We will be back often 
151506,The Beaufort, My friend dropped some nail polish on their carpet they told us to get it professionally cleaned which we paid an outside firm 55 pounds to come and do The stain faded to barely anything to match all the other stains from previous guests Without my authorization or agreement they charged my card with 1171 pounds for what they call damages I was appalled and I am disputing this payment with my cc company The manager did not know nor share the terms and conditions and handled it rudely and without any customer handling competence Stay here if you want to get ripped off Never again , Location 
151507,The Beaufort, Room was quite small , The hotel is in an excellent location the staff are very good On arrival guests are offered a free cream tea with home made scones A nice gesture The food was very good 
151508,The Beaufort, We were in a basement room at the front of the hotel and it was quite noisy in the morning with the slamming doors etc but it was fine for a night , It was a warm and friendly boutique hotel with very pleasant staff We didn t end up eating there so can t comment on that but it was a great stay 
151509,The Beaufort, They didn t have a lift so I was glad I requested a room on a lower floor , The staff were all so friendly and had complete information or got it quickly They went out of their way to make us feel at home 
151510,The Beaufort, too small a double bed and that we had to put down a 20 deposit despite we were not going to have anything apart from the nights stay, Clean and good location for our business
151511,The Beaufort, The bathroom in room 11 really needs a make over lots of water damage and too many bad patches on former tile grout issues , Complimentary breakfast delivered to the room was a bonus 
151512,The Beaufort, The tenant next floor was very clearly heard It cracked very much at every step he she took Thought he would come trough the ceiling , Staff very serviceminded 
151513,The Beaufort,No Negative, A very elegant and tastefully decorated comfortable room The staff were welcoming and very helpful superb customer service Freshly made tea to order especially lovely after a long journey 
151514,The Beaufort, Wallpaper was marked windows needed to be cleaned paintwork was poor and the doors especially the bathroom door needed to be replaced The sink was too low Towel rail was airlocked and only provided 1 hand towel for two people The balcony was very untidy and had air conditioning units outside could have benefitted from some planters to make it more respectable and a good clean Attention to detail would not go a miss, Service could not fault the staff were amazing friendly and would do anything for you Room service was spot on Location was fantastic The scones in the afternoon were hot and delicious and free each day The drinks in the bar were not free as someone else has suggested it was an honesty bar so people should have paid for it really soft drinks were free of charge We were celebrating our 25th Silver wedding anniversary and the staff went out of their way to decorate our room with banners balloons which I thought was really nice of them
151515,The Beaufort, the common parts are a little shabby but the reception was nice , Great location staff very friendly free upgrade to junior suite and the afternoon tea was excellent they even had gluten free scones and a good breakfast 
151516,The Beaufort, I had no hot water to have my shower which was really inconvenient I needed to be at appointment for 10 30 so could not wait any longer and I was very disappointed that this was not reflected in a reduction in my final bill as I feel this was a major facility that was lacking during my stay and it did inconvenience both myself and my daughter greatly not to be able to have a shower in the morning especially as she was going for wedding dress fitting I understand this was a one off fault with the water heating system and not the usual experience for guests however I do feel we should have received a reduced invoice to reflect the inconvenience , croissants were indeed delicious coffee and Tea available when required
151517,The Beaufort, Extremely small room no room to put anything on a bedside table Tiny desk But the bed made up for this , The bed was very comfortable Extremely convenient location to Knightsbridge tube station 
151518,The Beaufort, A firmer mattress I have no complaints and will most likely return this summer , There was no restaurant but they did offer breakfast room service as an extra and at no charge a daily tea service with freshly baked scones clotted cream and jams 
151519,The Beaufort, I stayed in basement floor single room The view was not great I recommend requesting a top floor room , Location is great The hotel is cute and petite They offer extra services such as free open bar at lounge area and reception area in addition to free scones and tea all day until 17 00 
151520,The Beaufort,No Negative, Excellent location beautiful hotel stylish and fresh interior in the room very good breakfast served to the room complimentary soft drinks tea coffee very friendly personnel Simply perfect 
151521,The Beaufort, ROOM TOO SMALL SHOWER CABINE VERY TIGHT TOILET UNCOMFORTABLE STEP DOWN AND VERY COLD NO LIFT TO THE ROOM HEATING DIDN T WORK, LOCATION DECORATION OF THE ROOM CLEANLINESS
151522,The Beaufort, Very weak hair blower which shouldn t be the case when paying this amount for a small room No defined set up to blow dry hair I had to sit on the carpet open the cupboard for a mirror and plug the dryer in behind a sofa chair Simple mirror on the wall near socket would suffice where I could turn the chair around A little thought is needed here not money well except I would say it s worth investing in decent blow dryers for the impression made considering the lovely quality and care in the rest of the furnishings However this would not stop me from staying agian , The free cream tea was just wonderful bed lovely and I am picky Staff great Cozy front room Just really easy gorgeous street and the best location for the museums And appreciate the well working climate control that was very quiet 
151523,The Beaufort, Nothing, Although in a revamped old house all modern conveniences were present and working Very clean high quality linen soaps etc Fab afternoon tea and great to have an honesty bar Staff all very polite and attentive 
151524,The Beaufort, Our room was very small and adjacent to reception so if you fancy a little lie in you might be dissapointed , Set back off a side street this hotel is in an excellent location only a few minutes walk to Harrods If you are interested in Winter Wonderland that too is a short walk Free Tea and coffee is available all day open bar for beers soft drinks etc and an honesty pot for spirits and wines Comfortable beds warm room and a great shower with lovely complimentary toiletries 
151525,The Beaufort, 1 their is no hot watar 2 poor room service 3 how they clean the room they just change the bed sheet and they ignore the bin and the dirty things on the floor and table 4 how rude the speak with the costumers , The location is very nice but the hotel is very bad
151526,The Beaufort, The hotel did not have its own restaurant and the room service food was not great However the breakfast prepared in their kitchen was good, The staff were very friendly and helpful and the rroms very comfortable and clean Location very convenient to transport and many attractions
151527,The Beaufort, In my room 4 was very noisy woken a number of times during the early hours of the morning and very late at night from above I don t know what was above me but too consistent to be someone s room Like a working area for staff hard to tell Banging and walking all the time only down part of stay Would just get a different room next time Rooms vary so much it s a good idea to see exactly what you are getting Saying that all rooms seem to be beautifully decorated , Breakfast was perfect Position great Staff so helpful they couldn t do enough for you Would not want to stay any where else Open bar with nibbles was apprespciated as well 
151528,The Beaufort, Nothing, Really couldn t fault the hotel in anyway Staff couldn t have done more for us We got a bargain on the booking but wouldn t have an issue in paying full price 
151529,The Beaufort, The room was too warm for me and I was not able to change the air con, The professionalism and attentiveness of the staff were exemplary Breakfast of omelette tea and toast was delicious
151530,The Beaufort, Absolutely nothing to dislike, Top location Clean Lovely staff Many restaurants and cafes around the harrods and the lovely shops in nightsbridgs is just a few minutes walk
151531,The Beaufort, Nothing , Unlike large hotels this place feels very personal It may not have a proper bar or restaurant but everything is made available to you Lovely touches that you don t get elsewhere such as complimentary coffee brought to you mr room in the morning if you want it Just lovely all round 
151532,The Beaufort, the elevator got stuck between floors as its an old style cage door one and w head to walk up 3 flights of stairs They need to fix their elevator issue , The bed was great room small but well appointed the free drinks soft and water plus complimentary coffee and tea and cream tea in afternoons is a great idea And very welcome The staff are very helpful and courteous 
151533,The Beaufort, There was no elevator our room was in the lower ground floor the sofa bed was horrible one of the porter men was acting in a very awkward ans unprofessional way The price was overrated for the quality of this hotel In addition they don t have a sign out the cab was lost many times, The room we were in was big and fine
151534,The Beaufort, Nothing , I m quite well travelled but have never stayed at a place in the centre of a city that offers complementary drinks 3 11pm and afternoon tea Staff were very friendly and polite pretty much nothing to fault for the price Discounted on Booking great location too 
151535,The Beaufort,No Negative, We were very happy with the hotel The location is excellent The staff are very friendly and helpful The breakfast was very good and we appreciated the idea that we could chose what to have for breakfast the evening before 
151536,The Beaufort, Only the mattress on the bed was uncomfortable for me Requested a topper pad and extra pillow absolutely no trouble to the staff , We requested a spacious quiet room and got exactly that Generous space and well presented The complimentary water soft drinks and alcohol were a bonus Freshly made excellent cappuccino free and served on a tray in the reception lounge best in London 
151537,The Beaufort, Elevator only holds 1 person with bag Too many stairs Need safety mats within tub Air conditioning not in service , Staff location comfortable bedding complimentary breakfast afternoon tea and open bar in late afternoon evening 
151538,The Beaufort, I made a mistake booking in this hotel thinking that it was the Beaufort Apartments which came highly recommended to me In this facility I did not like the fact that the elevator only goes up to the fourth floor and you have to climb up to the fifth floor The elevator is very small and very slow Beds were too soft and uncomfortable House keeping will not remove any left over food from the rooms I realised that the empty pizza box is not going to be taken out and on the second day I put it outside the room Your can hear sounds from other rooms because the soundproofing is either not done or not good I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends , Friendly staff and the location close to shopping in Knightsbridge is good and the room size was decent It appears that the hotel has some renovation done recently 
151539,The Beaufort, I enjoyed coming back to hotel and having tea in lounge However I would also have liked to have tea making option in room , What are Genius perks Enjoyed stay very much 
151540,The Beaufort, The lift is very old and small a couple with two large bags won t fit into it which means five flights of stairs for someone or a bit of a wait for the lift to return It s ok for a young couple but worth keeping in mind for anyone less able , Complimentary drinks served in the evening Our room was upgraded from a deluxe room and was very spacious clean and comfortable The bedding was well above the average standard you d expect for the price Breakfast delivery to the room was prompt
151541,The Beaufort, Nothing , A beautiful property set back from the hustle and bustle of Brompton road Fantastic location 2mins walk from harrods and 10 15m walk from the museums Lovely staff with impeccable service Complimentary cream tea and little bar who would ever complain about that These guys know how to run a boutique hotel 
151542,The Beaufort, Bath didn t run away and I reported it and they didn t mend it so had cold water in the bath the following morning Dressing cupboard couldn t open door and see the mirror as door to room fire hinge got in the way No air and window into well so heard all the air conditioning plants for all the other rooms Terrible left at 5 00 in the morning as it was so bad ,No Positive
151543,The Beaufort, Grubby carpets workmen and rubbish men going up and down outside our window The bath drain was partially blocked and the noise from next doors shower was very loud , Friendly staff free drinks 
151544,The Beaufort, The lift is teensie Do not come with many suitcases The air conditioning didn t work in the room, Loved the location Very quiet street but only 200m from the hustle bustle of Old Brompton Rd
151545,The Beaufort, Since I m allergic from dust I believe the room could have been better cleaned , Great hidden location 2 min walking distance to harrods dept store Quite area Comfortable bed Very helpful Staff
151546,The Beaufort, The taps in the shower bath were confusing to operate, My experience of staying one night at The Beaufort was very good indeed excellent I found the taps In the shower bath a bit difficult to work out But everything else was good and the staff were especially responsive in a gentle efficient pleasing manner that was a delightful 
151547,The Beaufort, Pillows too squishy for me not firm enough Everything else was first class, It is in a perfect location for tourists Nothing was too much trouble for staff Nice room good wifi connection which for me is important as apart from seeing a show I am not in too late at night so I can use I pad with no trouble 
151548,The Beaufort, Having stayed at the bottom floor it was very evident that the walls were not very thick as we could hear footsteps quite loudly That is the only criticism I have of the place , The location is wonderful the staff are always smiling friendly and helpful The hotel is quaint and personable It was also very clean and neat Has a good energy about it 
151549,The Beaufort, The elevator is pretty basic and slow, Best location ever in the most beautiful right next to Harrods Free drinks wonderful employees great service 
151550,The Beaufort,No Negative, There was a 50 discount on the room The room costs us 150 only This price is impossible to find in any other hotel in the same area 4 mins walking to Harrods and 2 mins walking to the middle of the Knightbridge with this price made this short 2 night journey amazing The staff were very friendly and the room was nice Unlike many other big hotels in the area Beaufort is very quiet and calming This was my 7th visit to London but the best one of them and some of the favour goes to this hotel and its hospitality 
151551,The Beaufort, Difficult to find anything at all to complain about but in the morning I did miss easily being able to make a coffee and get back in bed instead of needing to get dressed and wait for room service , Complimentary cream tea was a lovely welcome tea coffee cold drinks 24hr and alcoholic beverages from 3 00 all complimentary also Room was lovely and staff always happy and helpful 
151552,The Beaufort, Room key is too big, Staff are so nice they helped me to put my food into fridge and microwave and sent them to my room twice Drinks in the reception are free The location is near harrods about 8 minutes walk I will book this hotel if I visit London next time 
151553,The Beaufort, Coffee and tea making facilities in the room would have topped off the stay quite nicely , The staff at the Beaufort were fabulous They were friendly and just all round lovely It had a very relaxed yet upmarket feel 
151554,The Beaufort, Nothing, The atmosphere is wonderful Staff are cery cooperative Especial thanks to receptionist cloudia and her colleagues Big rhank you from my little boy to Paulo who helped us truely during out stay 
151555,The Beaufort, The hotel door was hard to open , Location was very good all drinks were complimentary staff were very nice What else would u expect from a city hotel 
151556,The Beaufort,No Negative, Fabulous hotel in a quiet location Liked that whilst the staff were there if you needed them they weren t in your face which I liked as it gave us privacy My only comment would be get that coffee throughout the night left on as being a terrible sleeper it would have been greatly welcomed at 4 in the morning when there s not much else to do 
151557,The Beaufort, Room on 5th floor needs a bit physical exercise while the lift doesn t go up to that floor Ventilation could be better , Small nice hotel to stay in a good location so pleasant atmosphere
151558,The Beaufort, No bad experience but plumbing was excessively noisy and the lack of a true morning room restaurant was a miss but overall a lovely Boutique hotel, The staff were outstanding Place was spotless Superb location
151559,The Beaufort, No everything was just perfect, Quiet area near to Harrods only few minutes walking distance very friendly staff and they upgraded us to one of their Suite 
151560,The Beaufort, Offering but not delivering not considering customers needs just plain strange I booked room only but was offered a complimentary cream tea then it never arrived despite calling to chase I didn t even want it but they insisted on check in so I waited around for it Frustrating Any kind of tea never arrived and none in room Offered to have cream tea on my return from dinner at 11pm Asked twice to have breakfast as a substitute When I accepted I was told there was a 40 minute window on delivery Who has that time in the morning when on business to wait around for breakfast Also they do not notify when taxis turn up so you pay for the idling cost outside better to flag on the street , Clean and nicely furnished room 
151561,The Beaufort, The only thing that bothered me a bit was the poor acoustic protection of the place as I could clearly hear everything from the brekfast delivery to the rooms next to mine as well as the steps of the person in the room above mine ,No Positive
151562,The Beaufort,No Negative, One of the best hotels in London to stay either with your own or with family and friends The staff are great and friendly not to mention the location next to Harrods and all fine places in Nightsbridge
