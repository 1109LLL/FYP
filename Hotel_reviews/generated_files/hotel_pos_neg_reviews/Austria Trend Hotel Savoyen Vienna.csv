428224,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, The lack of a small provision of English breakfast Tea and coffee to accompany the kettle which was provided in the room , Being able to step out of the hotel and walk just a few yards round the corner to the Botanical Gardens was fantastic and then to open a gate directly into the grounds of the Schloss Belvedere was just amazing

428227,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, No tea coffee facilities in the room Apart from cups and kettle so we purchased our own tea in local shop come on Savoyen this is the 21st Century , Location good for us a good walk in the morning for breakfast at a local caf We thought the breakfast at the hotel sounded expensive and we were right the cost for two at the local caf 18 euros was les than the cost for one at the hotel 23euros 
428228,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, At such rate the breakfast and patking should have been included No discount was made when in the second doyblw room were accommodated one 16 year old and a second 4 years old kid At least the second room had to be charged as a single occupancy ,No Positive

428235,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, We had breakfast in the Executive Lounge and would have preferred the buzz of the breakfast room on the first floor The hot dishes looked as though they had been kept warm for too long Our keys failed twice during a 3 night stay Apparently this is quite common I did not enjoy travelling down to the ground floor each time it happened having just travelled up , Lovely spacious room with fantastic views We were on the 7th floor Staff were friendly and efficient and were keen to answer any queries we had 
428236,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, a previous guest drank a bit of the coca cola and topped the bottle with water and put the cap back on Other than that i was very happy, The check in staff was excellent I have stayed in hotels round the world This was the best However It would be nice if you supplied at least two bottles of complimentary drinking water
428237,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, It was a little awkward to get into the hotel sometimes we had to wait a few moments for the front doors to open automatically It would also be good if tea and coffee were provided for free in the rooms instead of for purchase at reception , Very comfortable room of generous proportions Good sized bathroom with tub shower and separate inner room with loo and bidet Kettle bathrobe and slippers provided The location was a ten minute walk from the old city and very convenient for the Belvedere 
428238,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, The reservation process through Bookings com This was the first time I have had trouble with a reservation There were mixed up charges and rooms that took a few weeks to straighten out but the hotel worked with us and corrected everything before we arrived The lounge dinner menu is not kid friendly We had hoped to eat in the hotel restaurant after a day of touring but the fine dining menu left us looking for something else If you re traveling over Easter a lot of places are closed , The front desk and breakfast room staff were outstanding They were pleasant and always ready with a quick recommendation or answer to our questions The rooms were fantastic and breakfast buffet was graciously appointed and a wonderful start to our day 
428239,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, They asked for a 50 eur guarantee for the mini bar and to deposit an amount for the price of the whole trip on my credit card First time that this happened and I was really disappointed by the fact that we were not alerted by this at time of booking , A very good breakfast I loved the spacious rooms

428245,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Very little If pushed maybe its sheer size and obvious use as a conference centre for visiting businesses made it a little more corporate and impersonal than we had initially hoped for There were no instructions for the espresso machine anywhere and no sealed pods of milk available to add to it only cream However these are VERY slight niggles and were easily dealt with , On arrival we were upgraded to a suite with 2 separate loos separate bath and shower and neighbouring wash basins way higher spec than we paid for Breakfast was generous with everything you could possibly need and more 
428246,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Kettle provided in room but no coffee or tea which seems a bit pointless Did not try expensive 23 breakfast , Very spacious room and conveniently near Rennweg S Bahn 
428247,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Breakfast was very expensive so we opted to get breakfast each morning at places near the tram stop at the entrance to the train station , We were very happy with the location and the ease of getting into the city center via the tram which you picked up just outside the hotel We were very pleased with the size of our room the bathroom and the amount of closet space allowing us to easily unpack We found the room very well appointed with everything we needed The staff was friendly and helpful We wouldn t hesitate to stay here again

428250,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, There was nothing we didn t like but it would have been nice if they could vary the restaurant menu through the week , Although the hotel was very busy you always felt that it was you that was most important They should have hotels like this everywhere 
428251,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Hotels wifi dropped a lot There were a kettle and cups in the room but no tea or coffee When we asked reception we were told we had to buy ourselves which is not good for a 4 star hotel , Large rooms

428256,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Although front desk help were friendly they were not always knowledgable or helpful for the tourist For example we asked about bus transportation and were told we could buy a ticket on the bus This is not true but the bus driver was very kind and gave us the ride to the metro anyway We were also not told that a good option would be to purchase a 24 hour ticket for a full day of travel which they knew were our plans This would have been helpful Also the modern decor was a little bland and lacked character , Wonderful breakfast selection and many healthy options So many selections of breads cheeses smoked salmon and vegan options too Something for everyone Beautiful restaurant seating area as well Such an enjoyable start to the day Also Belvedere is a short walking distance and so lovely Loved the bathrobes and heated bathrooms too 
428257,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna,No Negative, The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful which was a ray of sunshine on the rainy day we arrived there Our room was wonderful and very clean The hotel is right opposite the train station and next to the Belvedere castle and you can really get to everywhere in Vienna from there

428261,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, There was nothing not to like , Amazing room and bathroom size our standard room felt like a suite and was very tastefully furnished We loved the bathrobes and slippers that were provided and it was great that a hair conditioner was part of the toiletries set We were impressed by the large number of TV channels available The bed was extra large and super comfy

428265,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, We have had a special offer which included breakfast Otherwise it d be an issue because it s too expensive for what you can get normal good quality continental breakfast And all the dishes are really small making you going several times for drinks 100 ml glasses coffee espresso cups and food , Large and bright rooms a lot of space in a hotel s public area Very friendly staff good bar in a lobby Location is near Belvedere 10 minutes walk from Stephanplatz Tram and local train s stop is one minute walk frim the entrance
428266,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, The breakfast fruit had a funny strange artificial taste so I could not eat it Breakfast could be improved since it is expensive and not included in the price The rooms are large and nice but stained carpets make them look older , The large lobby and rooms are truly a bonus I appreciated a nice gym and polite and helpful staff 
428267,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, No tea coffee in the bedroom only the possibility to boil water Breakfast limited Receptionist could be more friendly, good bed and nice location 20min walking from the center fitness center

428274,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, One day they did not clean the room but it was a minor thing The only really bad thing in the hotel is the low quality Wi Fi connection And it is really bad breaks down each 5 10 seconds So no videos or Skype during the stay , A very good 4 hotel I would not mind coming back

428277,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, We asked for a kettle to the room and a male member of staff came to the room with it but was very annoyed when I requested cups and some milk which he did bring and we were grateful but I was taken back by his manner and that he was so annoyed as this was not his job he was very annoyed which made me chuckle his response was very over the top One night we had a beautiful meal in the bar and the following night I ordered the same meal the chicken was not cooked enough for me so asked the bar tender could he ask the kitchen to cook it more and again he was annoyed at this request and when the meal was returned to me they sent it back with the bite I had taken still missing so they literally sent back the same food which still tasted terrible so I just left it This is a 4 star hotel to me there was not 4 star service from SOME of the staff The reception area is large and spacious but lacks warmth or character nto a problem just a note all in all great value great location I would return, Location was fantastic nice spacious warm room Great Shower and lots of hot water great sauna minibar large tv comfy beds and free fast wifi Lovely meal in the restaurant and the bar was good food also

428282,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, No Ubahn very close by but a tram service and a train station are literally 2 minutes walk away Closest Ubahn is either 3 tram stops and a 5 min walk away or a walk through the Belvedere Park which the hotel is right beside to get to another stop , We stayed in an executive room which gave us access to the executive suite which was amazing It s brilliant to have all day snacks coffee and soft drinks plus we had our breakfast there in more comfort every morning Room was immaculate too Really great hotel

428396,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna,No Negative, The rooms at the hotel were large and very clean The staff were marvellous and nothing was too much trouble for them We really appreciated the lovely breakfasts We were a group of 24 friends travelling together and found the large reception area a lovely place to meet that is if we weren t in the friendly bar The proximity to the station for the S7 to the airport was a real bonus as it was only 4 40 euros to travel there Altogether a lovely stay thank you

428497,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Free Wi fi did not work at all in my room 714 minibar contained drinks only at room temp Without ac on 25c 3 interventions in reception didnt help Coffee machine was out of order as well Executive lounge didnt stay up to standards poor or non exsistent service very few snacks not served 24h as promised Only non alc drinks which was suposed to be compensated by free mini bar at the room it means 1 botlle of warm bear person and 0 375 white warm as well and red wine 24h 2persons My advice do not take executive option V poor value for money , Spacious room and bath location clean executive standard 
428498,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, We were offered parking in garage which we agreed to Our car was supposed to be parked there by member of the staff however it didn t happened and we got fined with 36 fee Hotel accepted to pay the fee but if we didn t ask where is the car we probably wouldn t found out till leaving Anyway spent 40min on reception trying to sort it all out Not something i would expect from 4 stars, Nice and clean hotel reasonably friendly staff would go there again but would definitely sort out parking by ourselves
428499,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, The worst was the internet connection which didn t work so we had to be given a wire to connect directly I also found it disappointing that there was no equipment in the room to make tea coffea Other details included the fact that after 2h the water dispenser had still not been topped up in the fitness room after asking twice and the fact that the sauna left yellow marks on the towels and smelt bad when water was added , Definitely a beautiful hotel Very modern inside and has all the facilities you need The room was very big and comfortable The wellness area was very enjoyable I also really liked that you could get food at the bar at a reasonable price at any time of day 
428500,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, WiFi did not worked from the suite but it worked from reception area , the suite in which we ve stayed was very big and very nice with a nice view of Vienna 
428501,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Nothing was bad This is a quality hotel, Comfort from the first step into the hotel room was amazing breakfast is a must Defiantly worth the extra money Even the lobby music was great 
428502,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, The weather in Vienna was extremely hot when we were there and there was no A C in the lobby areas and the room wasn t that cool The minibar refrigerator never really got cold either , The hotel staff was lovely and the room was spacious It was a good location for the Belvedere Palace but a bit outside the main city attractions
428503,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, there is no options of early check in 4 5 station far from the center I did change the room kay 4 times in 3 days the price is the same like 4 star hotel at the center ther is no value to the money, Clean and big room quite hotel comfort bed very good restaurant clam baru beside the hotel near to belvedere palace tram station 2 minutes buy walk from the hotel
428504,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Traffic could be noisy in room facing the main road , Clean comfortable beds very close to station for connection to the airport and tram stop to the city centre or 15 walk Breakfast had a wide choice 
428505,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Every thing is baaaaaaad , Very bad help after request from my side to them bacause of a misuderstanding btween and and i tried to explain the reason why i did not show the date of intened reservation day But they did not accept it 
428506,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, The soap dispensers were awkward and a nuisance They don t do little bars of soap , We liked everything about this hotel The staff are super friendly super efficient The rooms are spacious and likewise the bathroom It is a really peaceful and calm hotel The breakfast which we had included in our price was excellent The tram stop is on the same street just up a bit The journey into the centre is short though longer obviously if you walk but trams are frequent and we just took them There is a brewery called Salm on same street and it is not far down from hotel and I can thoroughly recommend it for eating and my husband says the beer is the best and that is praise indeed It is an enormous place with outdoor seating and different levels downstairs We ended up eating there 3 nights out of four Do not hesitate in choosing this hotel You will not regret it Guaranteed
428507,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna,No Negative, Excellent location to go for a walk to the center but tram and metro just a step away Good communication also to the airport by train 20 minutes Very quiet and comfortable and very large rooms All staff very friendly to give tourist signs 
428508,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Restaurant expensive however food was nice and staff were very good Not out of the ordinary for Vienna which was generally pretty expensive Queu at checkout when I had a train to catch , Location and spacious room
428509,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, 5 minutes before 10 30 staff starts to look at watch to close door to breakfast buffet exactly at 10 29 59 feels like staff has to catch a train Furthermore breakfast cleaning of tables etc is excellent, Nice room good beds clean good breakfast good location
428510,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Although this is a not exactly a bad thing more on like a bit of cribbing on my part and would not change my opinion about the hotel or my experience but the AC in our room didn t actually work all that great The summer this year in Vienna was quite high for Europe so we felt it and it wasn t fun when we came back to our hotel room to find that the temp we had set never actually even reached what we had set it to for the entire stay Also again though really not important it would be nice to get some other TV channels in English other than just your regular news channels , Everything the location the fact that the Belvidere Palace is just 5 minute walk down the road that there is an excellent brewery cum pub right next to it down the road and most importantly the staff amazing people who deserve an incentive bonus in my opinion for being so nice Definitely will stay again at the Austria Trend Savoy again on our next trip to Vienna and highly recommend it to our friends 
428511,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Had some parking difficulties Finally i used the Park and Ride further down the street , Location is good a short walk from city center overlooking the Belvedere and botanical gardens but quiet The property is in excellent shape and value for money is great

428515,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, The staff responsible for replenishing the mini bar in the executive room section was completely useless No effect of complaints made Their services should be terminated , The reception staff and the restaurant staff were excellent very polite and helpful Liked the manner in which the reception staff efficiently planned and booked our trip to three countries without any problems 
428516,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Somehow front desk employees during night shift grave yard shift are not of the same quality as day staff Everywhere you stay Same here Uninterested just doing their thing , Received upgrade to suite

428518,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Disappointed by the lack of tea coffee facilities in the room and the health suite contained only one resistance machine The maid also kept forgetting to leave clean cups towels or toiletries Nothing that would spoil a holiday but could all easily be fixed , Friendly smart staff a beautifully large bedroom and bathroom attractive building and good location 
428519,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Wifi was very bad and didn t reach our room There was construction at the hotel front Tiiletters were not regularly replaced Airconditioning not easy to handle but once tought then becomes better Bed was really bad as it was two single beds put beside each other instead of a kind or queen bed , Room space including toilet location and some of the reception staff were helpful Gym was ok 
428520,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, Wifi was weak connection it has cut off during the late night , perfect location 20min from airport by S7 train 2min from the station Tram toward the city centre is also convenient two three stops away from Opera area the hotel is also near from Belvedere palace where is the best place for morning walk 
428521,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, The room had no tea coffee facilities The door did not close spontaneously and was difficult to close The breakfast area was small and was crowded and with little choice, The room was good and had enough space and toilet facilities were good

428524,Austria Trend Hotel Savoyen Vienna, They asked for the passport of everyone We where 18 person with little kids I think it would be more comfortable to ask only for the father or mother They took extra amount for ensurance 200 , Every thing I only stayed for one night we were a group of 18 person although we booked at the last minute the staff managed to find us rooms next to each other they even upgrade us to ensure we are next to each other I found that very satisfying We had a lot of luggage they helped taking our luggage to our rooms overall I wished we stayed longer and I would recommend it to any one though it s not central
