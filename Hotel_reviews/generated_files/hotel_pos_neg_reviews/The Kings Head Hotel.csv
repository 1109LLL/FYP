106134,The Kings Head Hotel, The location might not be ideal if you re in London for tourism or want to be in Central London But the hotel is accessable through public transport and it takes about 45 minutes to Central London , Spacey and luxuorios room for a reasonable price in London Very comfortable bed and you have everything you need The staff were all very service minded and helpful Nice pub on the ground floor of the hotel 
106135,The Kings Head Hotel, The district itself isn t exciting but there is a good public transport service also few parks nearby to walk The tap water isn t suitable to drink at all don t try to make a tea or coffee with it But this is London not a hotel fault The price for a night was expensive for us we usually stay at the places twice cheaper But at least we got a beautiful shelter after the hole we had to run away , We had to book this place when we found out that the other place we had booked in advance was a hell hole It was 6pm July 1st Saturday only a few offers left available we didn t have a choice so we booked this one The location wasnt t perfect but we found it easily 15 20 min walk from Acton Town tube station it s good for travelling via Heathrow Airport The building looks lovely outside and fresh inside everything was new it was a pleasure to stay in shame just for a night Comfy bed high tech lighting huge flatscreen tea coffee facilities mini fridge with 2 bottles of water blinders and curtains good soundproof no bad smells and no little animals And the highlight was the bathroom with spacious area full toilette facilities including modern hairdryer and a perfect shower The pub on the ground floor was lovely we spent some time there too didn t have a breakfast though but I believe it would be nice and not expensive due to the menue we looked through You can also use Morrisons just few steps to the right or other local pubs and mini shops to get some food and drinks I definitely recommend this hotel to people who can afford it or if there are special deals 
106136,The Kings Head Hotel, Nothing , Newly renovated 24 hour reception Elevator modern decor very clean rooms friendly Bar Restaurant Staff especially Monica who served us breakfast every morning Would definitely stay again Good transport museum by Acton Town Station Morrison s Supermarket nearby No E3 bus to Acton Town Stn 
106137,The Kings Head Hotel, It was a little hard to regulate the room temperature at first It was more expensive that we had hoped to pay but we realize it is an exclusive hotel which was also surprising for the area We chose it because it was safe and well situated clean and well serviced and there were no viable alternatives It would be nice if such services were more affordable for people on our kind of budget , It was fun to feel right in the centre of things in Acton The room was bright and clean and very classy The food was amazing and the service friendly and prompt It was great to have a safe in the room and to feel secure with staff on all night Staying in a historic building in the midst of a busy town corner was stimulating 
106138,The Kings Head Hotel,No Negative, A beautiful boutique hotel that absolutely ticked every box The staff were all very polite and helpful the room was lovely I asked for a quiet room and my 1st floor deluxe double was extremely well appointed with a luxury feel and a great modern bathroom My room size was compact but it really wasn t an issue The bedroom had a large LED television and there was also a screen over the bath very swish The lighting in the bathroom was very good and made applying my makeup a breeze often a problem in other hotels There was no parking on site nor any street parking locally However I used JustPark and managed to park off road nearby in a residential area overnight for 10 70 and it was a 6 minute walk away I had a Chicken Caesar Salad for dinner and it was excellent best I ve had for years Breakfast was truly superb the best English Breakfast I ve had bar none sorry mum Lovely morning staff too really made the start to the day a pleasure The bed was excellent and I had a terrific night s sleep with no noise from the street or other guests I found this hotel by chance and I wasn t too sure if Acton was perhaps too far out from the City but the location was actually really good with swift access to and from the M4 So it s without any hesitation I wholeheartedly recommend this lovely hotel to business users looking for high standards without any stuffiness I know you won t be disappointed 
106139,The Kings Head Hotel, It was a bit of a trek from the tube a good 10 minutes If you have cases it s not ideal Also it s not in the nicest area Up coming I m sure but at the moment if you are arriving on foot you have to walk through a run down high street to reach the Hotel , The Hotel had great decor and the room well well appointed Good value for money in London We didn t have breakfast but regretted it as when we walked through the restaurant it looked delicious and great value for money 
106140,The Kings Head Hotel, The Air conditioning didn t work It kept defaulting to 28 degrees whatever you set it at so the room was too hot I object to being asked for another 10 as a refundable security deposit when I arrived There was no mention of this in the pre booking particulars and it is completely unacceptable The bed was a fine size for a single occupant but too small for two , Clean good bathroom attractive room helpful reception staff 
106141,The Kings Head Hotel, Day evening bar staff, Evening staff behind bar had no knowledge of area so where unable to direct us to amenities and were not as friendly as hotel consiege or staff during breakfast they where great

106143,The Kings Head Hotel, Difficult for my taxi to pick me up or drop me cause no parking space and entrance of hotel on a busy main road The male receptionist could not be bothered Never greeted you unless i said hello He was most unhelpful when i was leaving He watched me struggle with my suitcase hand luggage It was raining the taxi was worried about getting a ticket when he stopped to pick me up The receptionist pointed to me going out the pub door on a red line when it would have been easier using the other front entrance for the taxi and i , It was clean Pub next door Choices of others close by Easy access to buses The female receptionist was very friendly and helpful So were the staff in the pub 
106144,The Kings Head Hotel, A bit far away from the centre streets of London , Very modern clean and beautifully decorated room Even had a TV in the bathtub Great breakfast 9 minutes walk from Acton Town underground Station which takes you to Picadilly

106146,The Kings Head Hotel, Bed was length was short I m tall so my legs went slightly over The room was very small and we had luggages and not much storage so it was hard to move around Also the sheets were discolored by a brown stain , I liked the breakfast and lunch Delicious and filling Liked the TV in the bathroom and the little gadgets Staff were very friendly and helpful 
106147,The Kings Head Hotel, I used booking com and applied filters for free cancellation pay on arrival breakfast included but money was taken within a few days of booking and weeks before my arrival Was told upon arrival that breakfast wasn t included and that they required an extra 10 as deposit for the room On checking out i wad informed that the 10 deposit would only be refunded in the next 10 15 working days Im just incredulous at this , Very modern easy to find latest technology Reasonably priced food and drink for London

106152,The Kings Head Hotel, Room cramped with tv on awkward viewing angle Staff completely ignore everyone at breakfast its completely self service and have to ask for tea coffee no one comes to your table or even welcomes you upon arrival as if you are invisible Bread stale Tiny bowl of Browning fruit salad no cereal poor experience, Clean and well equipped with chilled milk and complimentary chilled water
106153,The Kings Head Hotel, Could have had a choice of cooked breakfast or continental and not just continental no parking facilities we would have come down by car if they had , The room was very comfy very near to our son who the visit was for staff helpful and friendly 
106154,The Kings Head Hotel, The reception staff in the morning Very unhelpful didn t understand him and he didn t understand me using his mobile phone while I was speaking to him Taxi was so late because it was ordered late , Everything was perfect I think no more milk in the room on request would be nice as traveling early and breakfast didn t start till 8 I will be back again Thank you evening staff much nicer then morning staff on reception Bar stafff excellent very polite and helpful 8 03 was the day I stayed
