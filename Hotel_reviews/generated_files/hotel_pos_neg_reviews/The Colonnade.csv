94181,The Colonnade, Our room was very musty either a drain or damp problem All the windows were open when we arrived and we soon found out why when we shut them Given our short stay we didn t make an issue of this but I did mention it when checking out , We were only staying one night with an early start the next morning and had stayed at the Colonnade before It s in a nice area and on street parking is easy The general areas in the hotel are welcoming We were greeted with a welcome drink which was nice after a long drive 
94182,The Colonnade, The bedroom is in need of a refurb Nowhere dedicated for work in the hotel or the bedroom the tv took up the whole desk Hotel ok for leisure not for business Understaffed on front desk, The staff were very helpful and polite 
94183,The Colonnade, I felt the rooms we were shown were a little dark, The position of the hotel was excellent and the staff helpful after we asked if we could look at other rooms as the one allocated on the ground floor the window didn t lock
94184,The Colonnade, They don t reduce de price and seriously I want my money back Worst hotel and politic for booking ever see , I book a double bed bedroom and they don t have it The solution is get me in a little bed in a 2 or 3 square meters Horrible experience I book for the next day and do the same operation so they fill the Hotel that way 
94185,The Colonnade, The bedsheets are dirty the cushions are dirty The tissues has not been refilled even though I have requested several times during my stay for 8 days There are two bathrooms in the apartment but the water pressure is extremely low and not strong enough for using both of them in the same time The cooking utensils in kitchen are dirty The balcony is dirty with a lot of cigarette butts on the ground and plant pot The cleaning staff always forgets to clear all the rubbish bins for each floors , I don t like it at all 
94186,The Colonnade, Our room was very small We only had two small windows which didn t let much daylight come through The room itself could be more renovated There was one overhead light which hang from the ceiling and wasn t adjusted correctly The ceiling was painted sporadically One day there was no room service , Very comfy bed bathroom has a shower as well as a bathtub we could leave our luggage before check in and after check out for free staff was nice very cute hotel cat Price acceptable for that London area Tea and coffee facilities were good great choice 
94187,The Colonnade, Shoebox of a room When booking I tapped the room the room description and got a photo of a room with space to move and two armchairs On arrival we found a room so small that when our luggage was put down there was no room for our feet No armchair because there was no room to fit one in So crowded that dressing was awkward I paid for something which I didn t get This must be a management problem as staff were excellent Room description was false , Staff were excellent willing to help with any request even those outside their duties 
94188,The Colonnade, Waited an hour to check in as room not ready Room in the basement so musty and dark Immediately underneath the Underground so shook every time a train came through Very tired bathroom with poor grouting The whole hotel is in need of investment and up dating Not good value for money , Great location and nice outside terrace for drinks 
94189,The Colonnade, En suite facilities were disappointing no toilet roll holder soiled toilet roll took several attempts to flush the loo and broken bin Noise from underground trains our room was below ground level so we could here each train pass beneath the hotel Staff were friendly enough but didn t always understand English that well, Good sized room with classic decor Good selection of tea coffee in room Proximity to nearest underground
94190,The Colonnade, Hotel Miles away from where we wanted thanks to booking com The oppwrsite side to London that I wanted Are booking Com only offering certain hotels as they get more money First room cramped twin beds small no bedside cabnets on one bed damp showing on celling Cord too short on kettle Spot lights on wall outside Second bedroom stairs upto bathroom not ideal bed extremely poor very uncomfortable Parking is for only two cars in a back yard I only have a medium size car and was hard to get in and out only 1 inch either side trip items like hovers left in a tight hall way Lift only to floor 3 Had better facilities in a travelodge Not what I would expect in a four star hotel, Staff were great very helpful and friendly 10 out of 10 for that No charge for blue badge parking great 
94191,The Colonnade, We would have liked to stay longer, This is a great boutique London hotel If you are looking for a Marriott Hyatt Hilton type of hotel you are at the wrong place If you are looking for the London experience of staying in a neighborhood environment with all the small shops GREAT Pub and great small boutique restaurants then this place is perfect The area is called Little Venice where British Royalty resides not the queen and the royals but Londons famous royalty You will have to find out for yourself who but it s very enlightening eating somewhere and next to you are people who helped made Britain famous Within walking distance is the Warwick Street Station actually you can see it from the hotel 2 minutes if you walk slow Just hop on the Bakerloo Line and it will take you to all the stops that are important Paddington Station Baker Street Buckingham Palace Picadilly Circus Trafalgar Square and the River Thames plus other great stops The other lines are very easy to get on to go elsewhere The staff are great and very friendly and will assist in any way they can Take a picture with the knight in shining armor to help remember your stay Other sites to walk to is Abbey Road studios and BBC Maida Vale studios The BBC studio has free tickets for events there but you have to sign up for the tickets There are plenty of other shops and restaurants to visit too in the neighborhood Great hotel great neighborhood great people and great city You can t go wrong 
94192,The Colonnade, The room and particularly the en suite were really small We were disappointed that teabags used toilet paper and some toiletries were not replaced until we requested this , The bed was comfortable with good quality bedding 
94193,The Colonnade, the shower was poor the room had no view room needs updating on our booking it stated English breakfast for 10 we only noticed this after stay we payed 17 50, the lounge staff breakfast outside seating area
94194,The Colonnade, Don t stay at the downstairs room every 3 4 minutes in the room you can hear underground train voice I think its not good , close to warwick avenue underground station and little venice
94195,The Colonnade, The room service food was terrible but costly The soup was just blended leftovers from the taste and I asked for bread wjith my soup but got pitta with no butter The room service wasn t 24 hours and was just very disappointing the receptionist when I arrived at 11 30am was quite abrupt A concierge also opened and walked right into my room with a couple just after I arrived I could have been stark naked , I loved the balcony outside my room
94196,The Colonnade,No Negative, I love the hotel decor Staying in London I wanted to stay in a hotel that had the antique style and feel to it and this hotel does was perfect for that It is in a beautiful suburb with little local shops near by and a 1 min walk to the Warwick Street tube station So after sightseeing all day you just get of the tube and you are at the hotel The best thing of all was the phone they provide in all the rooms You can make local calls book tickets and tours etc and best of all use google maps to get around We never got lost once It was free and we took it everywhere with us Overall really liked the hotel 
94197,The Colonnade, On our second night some neighbours across the road from the hotel had a party until 5am with people out in the street and loud music literally all night The police came but no one stopped the party I don t know if this happens often but sure didn t get any sleep It s mind blowing to think the police couldn t stop the party The behaviour didn t fit in with the look of the area , I loved the decor and the location Express train from the airport to Paddington Station then change lines to the Barkerloo Line and it s only one stop away to Warrick Avenue Station When you come up from the underground it s about 50m meters away So after a long day of sightseeing it s great to get on a train then not have to walk far A beautiful suburb with lovely looking houses all around 
94198,The Colonnade, Everything else Booking com promised a 4 star hotel for a huge discount on what we had assumed was the standard rate The hotel is old tired the staff are poor and the facilities and rooms the beds especially would deserve no more than 2 stars , The location and the hotels colourful history
94199,The Colonnade, The room was very musty and smelt of damp the bathroom was not as clean as it could have been with a light bulb out and the sink not draining at all well If it had been the normal price of 300 it would have been completely unacceptable ,No Positive
94200,The Colonnade, The sheets were yellowed and not very clean The room and particularly the bathroom were very small The room was on the last floor fourth floor and the elevator was stopping at the third floor The price is far too expensive for this room , The breakfast room was great with a beautiful glass canopy offering a view of the sky The staff was kind and attentive The underground is just across the road so it is very convenient and the hotel is just one stop away from places to eat Situated in a nice neighbourhood 
94201,The Colonnade, Felt like the building and the room could do with a refresh, Got upgraded into the massive Garden Suite very traditional quintessentially British design Could be modernised 
94202,The Colonnade, Our room was very small and there was a funny smell in the bathroom when we arrived like drains We reported the smell and this was fixed quite quickly although it did keep coming back during our stay Our room was incredibly hot but we were unable to turn the radiator down On the second day of our stay there was no hot water so we had to keep boiling the kettle to fill up the bath with hot water The carpet along the side of the dressing table wasn t clean there was even a hair band on the floor left by a previous guest and the area behind the curtain was quite dirty as well ,No Positive
94203,The Colonnade, Advertised as having free newspaper each day and complimentary apples didn t get either Bath robe was really hard and scratchy , Beautiful traditional decor very cozy Close to tube bus and shops Lovely walks along the canals Tea coffee and mineral water provided 
94204,The Colonnade, Room decor was tired in need of a makeover bathroom update Would have been very unhappy paying the full price for my cramped shabby room,No Positive
94205,The Colonnade, The whole hotel s management and organization Due to an incident some sort of an emergency case of some other guests there was no room for me In the beginning the hotel tried to find me another hotel but I disagreed because that would have been too far away from my parents The other option was to put me in a very very tine cabin maybe 3 4xm2 cabin with a bunk bed which was a blatant joke for the first night also without a refund After I ve protested hard against those conditions they finally agreed to find me a solution What outraged me most was that 4 people couples got a double bed room AFTER my arrival and my check in 1 hour before That was totally in my opinion not ok and not a correct way how to deal with clients In the end I had to stay for one night in some sort of submarine room and for my 2nd night they finally upgraded me to a junior suite room It was in total overprized especially after we had to deal with so many issues 2 incident After my parents had arrived the hotel staff gave them a room somewhere in the basement It was very dark smelly and the balcony view was facing directly to some sort of backyard outward flow full of rats Do NOT get this room if you have booked a double bed room I d highly recommend you NOT to stay there My dad had explicitly called booking com and the hotel in advance in order not to get a room in the basement because he already read some bad reviews about that certain room from other hotel guests And yet they gave them exactly that room The whole situation was already very tense and we became more and more angry combined with disappointment We were very close to file a legal complaint to either booking com or some other sort of legal actions In the end one receptionist italian guy agreed to upgrade me to a junior suite room a change for my parent s room and one free breakfast for all of us , After I ve been told that there was no room for me double bed room even though I ve made the booking approx 2 months before one certain receptionist Italian guy put all his effort to find a solution for that issue In the end we agreed to get me a junior suit room for my 2nd night during my stay the 1st night I had to stay in some sort of cabin room It was very little space very narrow with a bunk bed 2 very tiny windows in total like being in a submarine and a total joke for a 4 star hotel and one free breakfast since the hotel didn t want to give me a refund read the whole story up But that receptionist tried in the end his best to help me out Very good location The staff was in general nice and friendly Comfortable beds even the one in my cabin room Breakfast was ok english breakfast is not really famous but the quality was ok Very lovely lobby british style Internet worked unusually fine for a hotel
94206,The Colonnade, The Hotel Room was very small and hot everything in the room was old and tiered we had one duvet on our twin bed but the other one was very old and thin The building has lot of potential but needs to be renovated , The staff where very professional friendly and helpful Breakfast was a little limited for a 4 star hotel but the omelette was very tasteful and freshly cooked 
94207,The Colonnade, The room wasn t like it showed in the pictures The rest of the hotel was very nice besides the actual room, Temperature in room was great Lobby and staircases are gorgeous Very relaxing
94208,The Colonnade,No Negative, We stayed in a room with a four poster bed which was very comfortable The staff were excellent very friendly and helpful Although the hotel is not centrally situated the Warwick Avenue U G station is less than 200 metres away 
94209,The Colonnade, The bathroom was so hot from the heat produced by the towel rail I was told by reception that someone would come to my room to have a look at it but was asked in the meantime to turn the fan on but it was noisy and didn t reduce the heat that much Likewise the temperature of the water was very hot even on the lowest setting The bathroom itself was clean and there were clean towels every day , Great location for the the tube Friendly staff Room was clean and comfortable although bathroom very hot The full English breakfast was really good you needed to get a voucher from reception the day before to get it at the reduced price of 10 50 per person We booked the room when it was on a half price offer so good value for the price we paid 
94210,The Colonnade, Room in the basement with funny smell in the lower floors Hot and cold water Shower that was difficult to regulate Bits missing of the bath tap Not impressive for a 4star hotel ,No Positive
94211,The Colonnade, We were meant to have a free drink upon arrival but nobody offered it and we did not ask for it as it was late and we were tired , Friendly and helpful staff Good location Clean quite and comfortable rooms Quick check in and check out 
94212,The Colonnade, Bathtub was a bit shabby They could have cleaned more They didn t fill up shampoo , Lovely retro hotel Close to the tube station and the bus stops 
94213,The Colonnade, Couldn t use the bath as the plug was missing Was told wifi would be available but could rarely access it in our room due to poor connection , Nice and cosy room 2 minutes walk to the tube 
94214,The Colonnade, The hot water in the morning was cold i e Not able to shower therefore I am in dispute with management over a rebate I have asked my card co About the matter,No Positive
94215,The Colonnade, The public areas eg hallways were very hot , The location was very convenient the room very comfortable but it did get very hot The bed was very comfortable
94216,The Colonnade, The first day we were put up on the 4the floor club room which didn t meet the expectations at all Later on the 2nd day on our request we were shifted to the 2nd floor which was a better room however coffee tea machine wasn t provided in the room as mentioned on the website they ran out of slippers and hot water wasn t coming in the toilets for 2 days and heating was not working in the toilet But the staff is very friendly and goes out of the way to accommodate their guests requirements , We liked d location and proximity to the tube etc 
94217,The Colonnade, The breakfast was very sub par Not worth 10 50 , Bed was comfy if a little inconvenient very high up and short feet stuck out the end Very well located with the Bakerloo line just 2 minutes walk away 
94218,The Colonnade, Unfortunately I was in a basement bedroom with the underground trains going past frequently, Lovely hotel very friendly staff Attractive area of London
94219,The Colonnade, Creaking floorboards everywhere no gym or sauna facilities no parking Also could not control the temperature in the bedroom, Very homley feel and a very comfortable and cosey stay in an excellent location The building also looks really nice from the outside and a very welcoming lounge 
94220,The Colonnade, Hotel and rooms slightly overheated but the weather had just become springlike so probably no time to turn down the heating , Lovely traditional hotel with comfortable four poster beds classic fabrics and furnishings coffee making facilities and great breakfast And a very nice resident cat 
94221,The Colonnade, Heating in bedroom was impossible to control and turn down It was like a sauna Although in fairness we did not tackle the staff on this to give them a chance to correct as it was so late each night Smells emanated from the bath overflow drain , Location was excellent Staff were friendly and helpful Building was attractive 
94222,The Colonnade, No hot water for two and a half days with promise it was going to be fixed Room not made up until I returned late afternoon and requested it at 3 45, Breakfast mediocre
94223,The Colonnade, Room was in need of some decorating but was fit for purpose and clean , Location is right by tube station so convenient Staff very accommodating and friendly 
94224,The Colonnade,No Negative, A junior suite room I stayed was quite large and the bed was comfy The staff were really friendly and kind Only a few minute from the underground station and the bus stop I definitely recommend this hotel 
94225,The Colonnade, Out of date milk dirty towels filthy fabrics unfriendly staff the bland food blocked sinks dirty toilets blocked drainage in the bath, The pet cat and the hairdryer
94226,The Colonnade, Let s say that the hotel and the rooms really need some TLC and to be refreshed The hotel have a great potential to be a proper 4 star hotel , Nice hotel Very atmosphere Helpful staff Very good location 2 min walk to the tube station Close to central London Lovely welcome drink Huge room 
94227,The Colonnade, Not very much natural light in the room Be warned the snacks nuts crisps left out are from the mini bar this isn t obvious , Very close to the tube and in a lovely quiet area just one stop away from Paddington Station Have to love a hotel that has its own cat Friendly staff and good value for money 
94228,The Colonnade, Check rooms before you put guests in make sure tea and coffee making facilities are actually available , The first room we were put in smelt like death no exaggeration It was coming from the bathroom We were eventually moved to a supposedly upgraded room Tired decor paper thin walls and celings ment we could hear every movement The the bed was so small there were no tea or coffee making facilties in the room although the welcome book staTed there was There was 1 pug socket in the whole room which proved fun with 2 phones requiring overnight charging Hotel is run down and outdated I have no idea where they got 4 stars from staff were lovely however if there was a travel lodge free nearby I woukd have rather stayed there 
94229,The Colonnade, I found the hotel a little too warm for my tastes, Lovely evening meal in restaurant with a charming attentive waiter Large comfortable bed I was pleased to see a friendly resident cat I so miss my cats when I m away 
94230,The Colonnade, We booked a deluxe room for some extra comfort The matresse seemed old and at least of a bad quality The room was sloping and thus was the bed altogether very uncomfortable Even more uncomfortable was the lack of isolation thus we frequently woke up during the night from people taking the stairs next to our room and from the upstairs neighbours kicking of their shoes seriously you can hear this and doing we don t know what , The looks are good but deceiving People are nice 
94231,The Colonnade, Room temperature hard to control Room frequently filled with kichen smells not good Barely adequate hot water temperature never needed to even turn on on cold water during showers Worn carpet and furnishings Fair bit of road noise through large old glass windows , Service staff quite friendly Breakfast ok Not likely to return 
94232,The Colonnade, General state of cleanliness very poor bed was old and broken and there was a bad drain smell in the bathroom Classic double room really tiny The hotel itself was quite nice we were just especially disappointed with our room A lot of 4 touches such as bath robes and branded water but without the underlying quality of a 4 hotel , Staff were very friendly location was perfect very close to little Venice and a few mins to Bakerloo line
94233,The Colonnade, Try NOT to get A room on the 4 th Floor Small rooms and NO lift Especially try NOT to get room 46 because of a very annoying Sound approx every hour like the Sound of A doorphone, Very comfertable bed Nice breakfast
94234,The Colonnade, Bathroom could have been a little cleaner , Comfortable home with all the touches to make you feel at home rather than in a hotel Friendly and helpful staff 
94235,The Colonnade, The free Wi Fi did not work properly in our room it often dropped off or couldn t find the network , The room was amazing Turing suite and the hotel has a nice vibe It s a great experience and the staff was very helpful 
94236,The Colonnade, Being picky room could have been cleaner around windows in corners etc Supply of towels and coffee milk in room was erratic Aircon unit was broken Stayed there before but a little bit disappointed this time, Food in the restaurant was excellent the lady in charge was wonderful Lovely location love the area
94237,The Colonnade, Service at Breakfast needs to be better managed as had to ask repeatedly for things to be brought to the table, Lovely comfortable bed hotel had unique character charm
94238,The Colonnade, The noise of the train every 10 minutes The first room we were allocated was in the basement was noisy beside cleaner s cupboard Expensive for what we got There was a hairband underneath the sink in the bathroom which suggested it hadn t been cleaned very well Shower was poor There was no watyer in the room so I had to try and find a member of staff to get one , Bed was confortable Good location 
94239,The Colonnade, Bathroom was cramped with no shelving in shower stall to put items bedroom no cabinet for clothing never unpacked closet was small we were on a two week vacation , Location was great close to metro
94240,The Colonnade, Towels were thick enough but frayed Music VERY loud from nearby bar meant I went to sleep with ear plugs Room had limited clothing storage but to be expected in a room this size Size of room should be emphasized in your online information Lack of ability to book a suite WITH COSTS for future dates on website disappointing , Food in restaurant was good enough but menue is limited On three consecutive days no fish was available This is actually of limited concern as the area nearby abounds with good cafes brasseries etc Room and bed and bathroom quite comfortable Temperature control fairly easy to use and kept room comfortable Reception personnel very friendly professional and responsive 
94241,The Colonnade, 1 Internet 2 Small leak on wash basin, 1 Wonderful staff excellent hospitality 2 2 min to station with direct lines to Oxford circus Piccadilly Circus etc Extremely convenient 3 Spacious room with great toiletries complete with mini fridge in the room
94242,The Colonnade, Breakfast waited service understaffed paid extra for it as a treat but the slowness and rather dull food meant it was all a bit stressful as a business traveller with appointments ahead , Beautiful hotel Very comfortable room
94243,The Colonnade, The bar is not very comfy and was really hot Please renovate the bar and restaurant area and give it some character and air con like the reception room , Room was ok Bathroom a little dated 
94244,The Colonnade, Size of room way too small for the price of the room and bathroom poor , Fantast location Nice pub and restaurants right next to the hotel Subway 2 minutes away Pretty and friendly neighbourhood Very safe 
94245,The Colonnade, Lift didn t service top floor but exquisite room made the walk up just one flight from floor below well worth it , Old English charm and classic lift Gorgeous fresh flowers every where Glass roof restaurant with access via staircase to pavement dining Staff very pleasant Lunch menu great value for fine dining Extended dining hours 
94246,The Colonnade, Our room least expensive was located on the lower ground floor via stairs Fortunately the staff were very helpful in offering to take our cases to our room , The Colonnade Hotel is in a beautiful residential area and five minutes walk to Warwick Underground Station and great restaurants and convenience shop a block away Air conditioning in our room 
94247,The Colonnade, Tired rooms Bathrooms Hot water very slow to arrive Like 3 of 4 minutes Bsin does not drain fan broken etc Room tired Balcony door see daylight through Spotlight on balcony shining st window Needs an update badly Just not good enough for the money, Quiet location with character
94248,The Colonnade, Mini bar was untouched expensive as you d expect Not a criticism just good to know , I booked way in advance and got a great deal and the cancellation option The room was small but looked lovely Room3 next to reception and the lounge area I know some of the other rooms would be bigger but unless you are paying for a suite this was as expected They kept our bags safe for us when we went off for the day Nice touches included offering us iced water Nothing much you may think but more than larger chain hotels Comfy bed Good nights sleep Didn t eat in the restaurant but it looked lovely and matched the standard of the hotel appearance overall The staff were friendly and helpful not pretentious 
94249,The Colonnade, The rooms were cramped and there is much better value in other hotels I have stayed at near Paddington, The atmosphere of staying in an older building was lovely
94250,The Colonnade,No Negative, I booked a room at The Colonnade as a gift for my friends to stay there on their wedding night Not only were they upgraded but the staff also gave them a complimentary bottle of prosecco and some chocolate covered strawberries upon arrival I m also informed their first night as newlyweds was spent in a very comfortable four poster bed The staff have gone above and beyond to make my friend s stay pleasurable and memorable Thank you 
94251,The Colonnade, Front desk service seemed a bit amateurish didn t know local restaurants well concierge who showed me to my room was great No welcome drink offered not as advertised , Old school British boutique hotel Funky elevator Close to tube station and Paddington station 
94252,The Colonnade, I would have preferred a buffet style breakfast , The for poster bed was very impressive the balcony attached to the room afforded a lovely view the staff at check in were most professional and the resident cat added to the character of the place 
94253,The Colonnade, The only let down in our entire stay was with the breakfast service It was disorganised and every morning we were missing a number of things from the table such as cups spoons forks we d to call the waitress numerous times We always like to have some fruit withe our hot breakfast and when ordered everything came together which made the table very full and uncomfortable The breakfast was great when it came , We loved the hotel we asked for a quiet room and we got a lovely quiet cozy double The hotel is located in agree at area 2 minutes from the Warwick Avenue Tube The bed was very comfortable and we d no trouble sleeping or resting Free wifi throughout the hotel The hotel has a very quant old elevator which is great to see We d definitely recommend this hotel Ps make sure you pay a visit to the resident cat 
94254,The Colonnade, The restaurant staff was inefficient slow and untrained Order pancakes for breakfast and they were microwave reheated and over cooked Asked the reception to find us a taxi after waiting for 20 minutes and asking 3 times of the eta of the car finally arrived a car that charged us 11GBP to go 1 mile When I told the driver that we have paid 5 GBP for the same trip he told me that it was a special service working for the hotel I was not informed when I asked them to book that it was nothing else than a black cab Very disappointing , The cozy feeling of an intimate hotel The resident cat was very cute but beware if you are allergic Towels fluffy good bed and good pillows 
94255,The Colonnade, Parking can be difficult and expensive , Good room everything you need and good value for money but I have been upgraded twice If you have to stay in London this is a very pleasant little hotel in a quiet part of the city right by a tube station and with a few local shops and cafes nearby 
94256,The Colonnade, really slow wifi hotel is kind of old with weird smell and cleanliness is not perfect you can hear everything through doors and walls, good breakfast nice staff
94257,The Colonnade, the breakfast was not up to standard considering the price I would definitely stay again but unless changes were made would not opt for the breakfast , I thought this was a wonderfully nostalgic hotel staff was very welcoming lovely atmosphere and quirky The oldest working lift in London and the birthplace of Alan Turing he who helped crack the infamous German code during the war 
94258,The Colonnade,No Negative, Staff are extremely friendly and helpful Great location Have stayed there numerous times and always had good experiences Would definitely recommend a stay

94263,The Colonnade, I don t mind small rooms But these are just too small I would like to see a bar , I like the location I like the staff Breakfast is good but I d like to see fresh butter 
94264,The Colonnade, 1 The room was in the basement 2 The view through the window was awful air conditioning boxes and a brick wall 3 There was a strong fusty smell suggesting there was a damp problem 4 I googled the hotel on the first night of the visit Monday 16th November and discovered that there were deals for 72 per night which really annoyed me 5 I expect someone to contact me about this because I am very dissatisfied, The staff were pleasant and friendly and it was nice to meet the resident cat Minnie 
94265,The Colonnade, The room was very small and at the price we were paying I expected at bit more , A lovely boutique hotel situated within 150m of Warwick Tube station and close to the Little Venice precinct Extremely helpful and friendly staff complimented our stay there 
94266,The Colonnade,No Negative, The beds are so good Underground just few steps away and only 5 min ride to oxford circus so close to center but in so quiet and nice neighborhood 
94267,The Colonnade, Would have preferred a room at or above ground level noise of underground was intermittent however a small point over a very pleasing time , Clean elegant rooms professional staff nice welcome and overall enjoyable experience 
94268,The Colonnade, Restaurant was rather expensive not really value for money and the staff at the restaurant left much to be desired, Love the hotel itself the room great value for money and although its not central the nearby underground means this is not really an issue

94270,The Colonnade, Service very slow The person on check in didn t even know how to check if we had paid resulted in a very slow check in as we waited for another staff member to arrive , Location Great spot right by little Venice

94272,The Colonnade,No Negative, As soon as I walked into the hotel foyer I was greeted with a big hug smiles and a warm welcome back as a return guest and they remembered my name Super comfortable beds and a chilled organic bottle of sparkling water by my bed and daily newspaper to my room without asking
