249324,The Laslett,No Negative, The staff were friendly attentive and extremely helpful as I had not stayed in this part of London before 
249325,The Laslett, Kettle in the room would have made it a perfect stay , Really comfortable with a great mix of modern cool but true to its local roots and history Great book selection in the lounge library Perfect location for Notting Hill Portobello Market shopping at Westbourne Grove walking to Kensington and Hyde Park and only 2 tube stops to Bond Street Oxford St 4 tube stops for Sloane St 
249326,The Laslett,No Negative, The location is fantastic in the heart of one of London s most charming neighborhoods you feel like a resident The hotel is decorated with great taste and they have paid careful attention to the details My room was on the smaller side but definitely suitable for one person I am a particularly light sleeper and found it to be very quiet and the bed is very comfortable The bathroom features modern fixtures and is decorated just the way I would decorate the bathroom in my own home The atmosphere of the common areas is very pleasant and the staff is welcoming and friendly There is a generous breakfast offering that includes a wide range of options I highly recommend this hotel I felt especially comfortable as a solo traveler I will definitely return during my future visits to London 
249327,The Laslett, Breakfast service extremely poor It took 30 min to get freshwater I had to as 3 times Coffee took 40 min to get and the hot food 50 min and when I got it scrambled eggs it was poor cooked Obviously they have challenges with the kitchen and restaurant service The hotel is clean and crew is nice and polite but the hotel need to organise the work 1st June,No Positive
249328,The Laslett, Very pretentious and over rated Some of the staff had a bad attitude Do not stay in room N12 it was on the ground floor without much natural light and the grey walks didn t help The check out is at 11 which I think is bad All in all for 350 400 per night for a standard room you could do a lot better , Beautiful building and great location
249329,The Laslett, There were a number of problems with my room My room was in the basement and there were water pipes from other rooms which made quite a loud noise throughout the night which was disturbing I noticed there were earplugs in the bathroom and see there have been other reviews eg on Tripadvisor complaining about this There was urine in the toilet when I arrived which was disgusting the rest of the room was spotlessly clean I suspect someone had checked in and been moved to another room Although the room did have a window and natural light but it was immediately below the pavement on the street above Not great but main problem was they didn t inform me this would be the case when I booked My room was definitely not 5 star and not worth the high price I paid for it when I politely discussed all the above with the manager in the morning he offered to upgrade me on my next stay but I don t think that was a sufficient response to the above problems , Hotel seems fine but my room in the basement was not up to standard see comments below 
249330,The Laslett, The water in the bath from bath or shower took a very long time to drain away, Cheery welcome large bright room not a huge choice at breakfast but plenty both cold hot freshly cooked no tea tray in room but provided on request with fresh milk very close to Notting Hill Tube but not noisy
249331,The Laslett, a bit expensive for the facilities offered , Location is perfect close by when coming from LHR next to a main metro line walking distance from Portobello and from High Street Kensington Very helpful staff 
249332,The Laslett, Nothing all was great, Beautiful property comfy beds But most of all the staff are in another level I have never felt so welcoming and special Thank you to all and we will be returning
249333,The Laslett, Breakfast service was disorganised , Beautifully decorated property very tasteful Warm welcome by reception team Quality breakfast food Complimentary drinks for birthday celebration 
249334,The Laslett, Everything was lovely BUT the staff which made me feel like I was bothering them all the time They would hardly look up when you walk in from street No greetings hardly a salutation and the same thing going out It felt a bit like all the staff was down and unaccessible to clients Hardly any eye contact or human connection which at the end of the day is so cheap but most comforting in a foreign city Small boutique hotel with quirky design but I doubt I d come back due to the unfriendly greetings I also had the terrible surprise that there was no shower tray in the bathroom just a simple shower curtain in one corner of bathroom Awful , The decor and ambiance totally off the charts Lovely personalized rooms
249335,The Laslett, They haven t maintained the overall experience It was very clunky Compared to our first visit which was fab this one was disappointing Having booked 2 rooms and one with an extra bed same as our last trip and been in communication with the hotel during this time to arrive late with tired children and with staff with no knowledge of this was annoying 2 rooms 1 was ok with light the other was dingey at the back noisy at night No interconnecting rooms For 500 gbp a night for the triple and 400 for the double I won t go back On top of this I ordered breakfast 6 dishes of the a la carte They delivered it to me and charged me for 3 breakfasts total cost gbp91 I asked them to recalculate it according to the menu it came to gbp45 The TV and aircon were problematic didn t work dodgey dial Also when I enquired about a babysitter the cost was gbp30 per hour normal rates are 8gbp plus Overall didn t meet my needs I have recommended the place over the last year to several friends but they need to work on their seamless customer experience and I need to manage my friends expectations The staff were kind friendly and attentive but still couldn t pull out the X factor nor overcome these problems Disappointing stay For gbp3000 for 3 nights we can do much better , Design and decor
249336,The Laslett, The night team seemed a little less expert Didn t know how to get certain places Also might be good to stock some basic medicines at the front desk And more cups in the rooms , Personalized attention of staff Really knew the area Recommended dining that was consistent w style of the place Very helpful They just got it 
249337,The Laslett, Free bottled water would have been nice from a 5 star hotel and also tea making facilities that you didnt have to pay for , The breakfast was fantastic lots of variety Loved the layout of the room the wet room being upstairs The bed was super comfy 
249338,The Laslett, Breakfast area small felt rather odd Disappointed that for that amount of money no free tea and coffee facilities or water in the room very poor , Lovely decor loved the artwork 
249339,The Laslett, There was nothing I disliked about the Laslett It s definitely my kind of place , Just loved everything about the Laslett The staff are great friendly helpful and charming The interior is beautifully designed with so many artistic features gorgeous Loved my room with so many little thoughtful things everywhere Wetroom blissful etc etc 
249340,The Laslett, That we only stayed one night we will make sure to book longer next time, We absolutely loved The Laslett the hotel is in a perfect location beautifully designed and comfortable Attentive staff and great breakfast complemented the wonderful experience of staying at The Laslett 
249341,The Laslett, Overall stay was excellent , Overall our stay was excellent Staff gave us a very good list of restaurants to check out Staff were all young spirited and cheerful The decor is amazing Location is perfect as it s right next to the notting hill station and a lot of good restaurants nearby 
249342,The Laslett,No Negative, It is situated in an amazing location in notting hill very near Portobello road and Notting Hill Gate station Staff are very welcoming and room was beautifully decorated Very comfortable and highly satisfactory
249343,The Laslett,No Negative, Boutique size great location very nicely decorated lovely staff One of the best things were that Breakfast was included Outstanding minibar Quiet in our room on the 3rd floor Actually nothing to complain about at all 
249344,The Laslett,No Negative, The hotel is amazing It s on the beautiful street close to Portobello market and just next to the tube station Rooms are really nice and bed is super comfy There is also a huge mini bar with a lot of drinks and snack plus with the whole set to prepare your own drinks The staff at the reception is really helpful In the morning you can sip your coffee on the ground floor with the view over a nice Notting Hill street 
249345,The Laslett, Would have liked tea or coffee making things in the room but other than that our stay was faultless , The location and style of The Laslett are exceptional We loved out stay there we would have loved it even more with a coffe maker or kettle in the room Breakfast was divine and the staff were super friendly I would highly recommend this hotel 
249346,The Laslett,No Negative, Great bathtub perfect location helpful staff made it feel personal and welcoming Well designed rooms and nice feel to the space close to many things comfortable bar and lounge where it was perfect to work for a couple hours Nice bed and rooms with good lighting Loved staying there 
249347,The Laslett, Desk in the room was on the small side and could use coffeemaker in the room But only minor issues , Really good location 30 secs walk from the Central Line very close to the bars cafes and restaurants of Notting Hill Stylish communal rooms friendly staff and great breakfast and coffee Room had a comfy bed and excellent bathroom
249348,The Laslett,No Negative, Loved the hotel its clean and the beds were so comfy and the staff were friendly and caring and they went the extra mile aswell when the duty manager rung to check we were happy with our room Would deffently come back 
249349,The Laslett,No Negative, Service was excellent After escorting me to my room and showing me around front desk called back 10 15 minutes later to make sure everything was all right Room was just like the photos Very comfy bed Spotless Nice bath products from Neil s Yard A free smart phone to use with maps and city guide All the details were perfect 
249350,The Laslett, A mistake was made on my bar bill I thought I had cleared it up on departure only to find that I was emailed the next day asking for payment Perhaps guests should be asked to sign for drinks charged to their rooms to avoid such confusion, Very comfortable room extremely well equipped great bathroom Top marks for attention to detail
249351,The Laslett, Bar was not that busy at 11pm , A hidden classy gem of a hotel One minute walk from the tube station A great bar and breakfast area Hotel staff genuinely could not have been more helpful The room was large clean and functional Modern in all aspects but with style Loved it Will become my new home away from home in London 
249352,The Laslett, no free bottle of water in the room upon arrival no coffee nor tea facility in the room breakfast service took 1 full hour in the breakfast room, room was spacious 
249353,The Laslett, shower door that prevented water spillage, good breakfast excellent bedroom preffered a little more buzz around the bar staff very at tentative
249354,The Laslett, No heating in the bathroom No bathtub only showen Only rooms on 1 no view, Very Nice library with design furniture very tastefull friendly personnel
249355,The Laslett, room was not really cosy more industrial than I had imagined Furniture in room not great more like a business hotel room no cosi chairs or sofa seat Good for sleeping but not spending time in Also for the price compared to similar hotels in the area wasn t that thrilled, staff very friendly and helpful bathroom was very nice room always clean location great
249356,The Laslett,No Negative, Great location and stunning hotel with all aspects of discreet luxury The entire Laslett Team delivers superb service throughout Great breakfast next morning complemented my wonderful stay at The Laslett Definitely one to come back to 
249357,The Laslett, WLAN system is a bit complicated compared to most other hotels Several screeens to go through to get access and need to provide email address although fake email address works fine , Good location Nice decoration 
249358,The Laslett,No Negative, Breakfast was great we added smashed avo and poached eggs no need for lunch The room was light and airy and spotless and its only 3 minutes from the main road and tube 
249359,The Laslett, The food was basic and overpriced and the restaurant area tiny dark and uncomfortable In the room automatic lights follow you around which is amusing to begin with and then irritating The door rattled so I had to wedge paper in the gap The bathroom fan would not turn off at night and had a persistent hum Heating aircon was difficult to get right Checkout was slow All in all not really worth the price , Very close to Notting Hill Gate it is a predictable boutique type hotel and very clean Bed comfy although pillows too bulky The minibar was fabulous and made me sorry I had to get up for work in the morning Staff were generally helpful but not charming as they had to double up for reception bar and food service 
249360,The Laslett, Room was not ready for an hour and a half after the check in time Additional deposit request made at the check in time Breakfast lacking any variety Some of the staff indifference towards the issues not the manager , Clean room Location
249361,The Laslett, Check out is a bit slow and cumbersome I also get there once or twice a month but the staff does not seem to recognize me other hotels are much more attentive to this , Nice atmosphere and room
249362,The Laslett, Some Staff were a little offhand and casual during breakfast service and reception lacked some genuine warmth and interest which one hopes for at a boutique hotel in a major city like London Others were superb Room was a little noisy with guests entering and exiting earplugs provided and lacked seating If you have to stay in don t rely on the in house entertainment , Staff struck that nice balance of informal and professional Location close to Notting Hill Gate station and key attractions is great for exploring Great bed and lots of room in the room Public areas are attractively styled and food was good Wifi was good 
249363,The Laslett,No Negative, Modern chic and comfy accommodation with nice location and helpful staff Loved the minimalistic feel of the interior the little well thought touches and the natural luxurious cosmetic brand 
249364,The Laslett, We had a room in the basement so we had no view and there was a very slight damp smell in the bathroom The tap in the bathroom was lose and the shower drained away very slowly We also thought the big bar costs in our room were rather pricy Apart from this absolutely no complaints and I would definitely highly recommend the hotel , On the plus side this hotel has lots going for it Great location and the hotel comprises of two well converted Notting Hill town houses The decor is simple but effective and the staff very friendly and helpful The room was a good size our bed was very comfy with nice linen etc And the room was surprisingly quiet There is good free Wi Fi and nice details like Neals Yard soaps etc and an umbrella in the room 
249365,The Laslett, Difficult to find fault Perhaps tea coffee in the room would be nice but minor element as lovely coffee can be delivered to the room without a tray charge , A lovely hotel fantastic attentive staff rooms are tastefully decorated very comfortable beds and the food in the hotel is superb Very nice ambiance perfect location for Notting Hill Would definitely stay again 
249366,The Laslett,No Negative, The hotel had a great location and the staff was very helpful We opted to get the smallest room and it was a little snug but the immaculate bathroom made up for it Excellent selection with regards to the toiletries Neal s Yard a unique mini bar offering and a wonderful hooded bathrobe that is available for purchase at the lobby Walking distance to the market and other excellent restos very close to the tube station It s the little details that make this boutique hotel a great find coupled with the super friendly staff A different London experience 
249367,The Laslett, No iron and ironing board in room however they were provided within 10 minutes of asking reception for them , All staff were fantastic Polite and prompt at all times and made me feel welcome Was going to leave bag as I was running early but luckily room was ready Was given tour of facilities as this was first visit 
249368,The Laslett, Complicated login procedure for WIFI provide name bogus email password Need to make sure that one does not get a basement room Staff service is often a bit slow check in out etc , Nice location just next to Notting Hill tube and nicely decorated Modern not over the top enough space in the room 
249369,The Laslett, Well it was a bit Ikea ish in terms of decor and furniture there was no full length mirror which is bad dark as you are in almost a basement Also there is nothing free in room mainly water you would expect a bottle but no all had to be paid for which we thought was poor Shower gels etc are Neals Yard but non to take away , Yes it was in a good location Outside is very nice looking very clean and welcoming Tables and chairs outside which was nice as it was very hot when we stayed Nice approach and main areas although small are very nice Staff friendly linens and bed all good bathroom nice all clean I would stay again if the price was right 155 with no breakfast included is high but if price was right would stay 
249370,The Laslett, The continental breakfast was tasty but the choice was minimal , The location of the hotel is amazing and the staff are extremely helpful and efficient The room 27 was beautiful with a super luxurious modern bathroom The bed and the pillows I wanted to put in a van and take home 
249371,The Laslett, Nothing , From start to finish the experience was lovely Fantastic staff very cool rooms in terms of decor fantastic location I was on the LG floor and it was very quite Could not fault the experience 
249372,The Laslett, Rooms are very small to what I was expecting I know rooms tend to be smaller in London but not this small My child s buggy won t fit inside so I had to leave it at the concierge Also a bit of an issue with accessibility Blinds not to dark Sun rises at 5 30 am these days and so did we My toddler was having trouble sleeping because of that You don t want to be up at 5 30 am on a Sunday , Location excellent You are 30 mins away from Marble Arch and Oxford Street from your one side Few mins away from one side of the Hyde Park From the other side you are 50 mins away from Westfield London Shopping Centre S Bush Many cafes and restaurants around as well as 3 underground stations 
249373,The Laslett, There is clearly an ongoing issue with the plumbing in some of the rooms the showers were very slow to drain , Perfect location for access to public transport and Kensington Park Friendly staff Ease of short term parking outside hotel Stylish but small public areas 
249374,The Laslett, Welcome at the reception was not exactly enthusiastic or warm We were given two rooms in the basement so view consisted of a wall Next to our room was a house keeping office which was busy and noisy , Very nice and stylish hotel in perfect area restaurants boutiques Great detail guests get a cell phone for free use around the city Rooms are really nice size for London and the bathrooms spacious and beautifully maintained 
249375,The Laslett, I couldn t turn off the air conditioner The natural temp was mild and I would have preferred no AC I did not like my initial room below ground no view but the staff were happy to change my room when I asked , Staff were friendly personal helpful room oozed style fabulous location great suburb to walk round walking distance to portobello market 
249376,The Laslett, The staff was completely hands off and not interested could care less very relax staff, The location was very good the room was very comfortable and well designed
249377,The Laslett, The staff is disorganized has not idea how a 5 star hotel is Room service bad No coffee maker or tea kettle or iron in the room Sheets are made of polyester A fantastic hotel is all about details and attentive staff that The Laslett is so much in need, The Lasslett has a perfect location in Notting Hill area and is designed with a urban modern yet comfortable feel 
249378,The Laslett, Our shower drain wasn t working well which made the shower overflow a bit but as I said we were offered complementary drinks in apology since the maintenance manager had gone home for the day , Wonderfully friendly staff superb ambience and lovely minimalist decor in a quiet setting complementary drinks for an inconvenience and an absolutely tremendous fresh continental breakfast the best orange juice I ve ever had and very good espresso 
249379,The Laslett,No Negative, Great breakfast and location Wonderful neighbourhood to explore on foot Noisy group of neighbours in the corridor at night but the night manager handled it well 
249380,The Laslett, As a frequent international business traveller I get to spend around 80 nights per year in hotels I prefer boutique hotels as I like the look and feel of it plus prefer to sponsor SMEs rather than big multinational hotel chains Looking on booking I was quite excited about staying at the Laslett When arriving to the place the room however was a disaster even my dorm room at university back in the 90ies was more luxurious First of all it was 30 celsius when I arrived in London and got a tiny south facing room WITH NO AIRCO It was around 30 in my room I mean which 5 star hotel does not have airco Afterwards I checked my booking and indeed there was no mentioning of airco But seriously when booking a 4 or 5 star it s logic that there are some basics like airco WIFI etc I mean we are 2016 people plus you pay around 200 euro for a room without breakfast Besides the airco my dorm room was not that boutique at all some cheap grey carpet IKEA style furniture a SINGLE bed bathroom of 1 5 m with the shower right next to the toilet without any separation quite disgusting if you ask me see pics attached Also service wise this place also has NOTHING TO DO WITH A 5 STAR very young and unexperienced staff had to wait 20 minutes to get 2 slices of bread at breakfast embarrassingly too informal conversation with the guy bringing up my luggage the guy delivering room service to some people standing with me in the elevator telling that he would like to eat the meal etc etc Student style service Therefore again youth hostel 5 star hotel Duhhh, Location
249381,The Laslett,No Negative, It was a quiet room in a nice friendly and familiar area Enjoyed it Although the room was not air conditioned it was 30degrees outside Orherwise it was fine nice place There are parks tubes portobello market and quite a few good restaurants close to the Lesley 
249382,The Laslett, Ourselves and one member of staff didn t realise we had breakfast included who recommended us to have breakfast round the corner at extra cost when we called up the lady played a repeat message to me saying the breakfast wasn t charged to the room up until the point I said forget it it would had been nice to be offered a complimentary breakfast we re not asking to stay there for the night free we just wanted an excuse tocome back But the breakfast hasn t been charged to your room , Everything apart from next comment
249383,The Laslett, Being in the basement in small room, I booke a Suoerior Double but it was MUCH smaller than anticipated and no view in the basement a bit disappointed by deceptive photographs 
249384,The Laslett, some drawer space for clothes would have been useful , Modern hotel in classic building Fresh tasteful modern d cor Location Breakfast both options and quality Great shower Very friendly and helpful staff Loved the music in the lobby dining area 
249385,The Laslett, There is no facility to play music in the room other than the TV A bluetooth speaker which can connect to a smartphone would be great , The very friendly and helpful staff the delicious canap s which were in our room at check in as arranged and the beautifully decorated room Breakfast was also superb 
249386,The Laslett, No floor heating in the bathroom Small breakfast selection , Staff very friendly Location great close to underground station Notting Hill still very quiet Nice common areas 
249387,The Laslett, Bar drinks are pricy and the room was too hot The room was West facing and could do with blinds on the window and the air conditioning ineffectual , Location and general standard of the hotel
249388,The Laslett, Room size a bit small , Comfortable bed and bathroom Hot water shower just right Staff front helpful Great service Few steps to subway and easy access to Portobello market 
249389,The Laslett, No armchair or tea or coffee making facilities in room You could have drink in room service but there was a 3 tray charge Room was in basement still lovely but view was a brick wall which was disappointing for the price paid , Stylish Comfy bed and quality bedding Great shower and bathroom Room and bathroom look exactly like promo pictures Full size Neal s Yard products were a treat Room service food was good though choice was very limited Staff were adorable and happy doing their jobs 
249390,The Laslett, The breakfast room only seats about 16 people It took over 40 mins after ordering to receive poached eggs on toast Compared to the quality of everything else in the hotel room the bathrobes were pretty cheap and tired , A big room Super clean and very cool decor more personal less hotel like Brilliant minibar and snacks in the room Gorgeous bathroom Comfy bed and pillows with crisp linen What s not to love Friendly and helpful staff A stone s throw from Notting Hill Gate tube 
249391,The Laslett, The doors in the hotel are not designed for a hospitality environment The bedroom doors and fire doors are heavy and slam shut With other guests and staff there working the doors are slamming constantly through the night Really terrible for such a new hotel and made for a poor nights sleep The hotel is aesthetically beautiful but there has just not been enough consideration of the functional things that make a 5 star hotel it could be so easily sorted , The location is great and the hotel is so new that everything is clean contemporary and tasteful
249392,The Laslett, Very poor room layout and general quality of installation e g Our balcony door was broken and wouldn t close all the way so there was a cold breeze the toilet flush kept sticking towel warmer not working some peeling signage artwork hung unevenly poor soundproofing room layout cramped and illogical made even more so by an unnecessary wall that takes up limited space and separates the bed from the window If there must be a wall it should separate the bed from the door not the other way around Some of this is no doubt corrected in the larger suite rooms Disappointed in the food dinner essentially amounted to pieces of toast have never had bread for dipping in olive oil actually be just pieces of toast and I was surprised that the pastries the next morning were dry and a bit stale especially since they were supposed to be from Sally Clarke who is always unfailingly excellent so it did make me wonder if they were from the day before , Fantastic location especially for the price and great collaboration with respected art galleries and local businesses like Sally Clarke for baked goods coffees etc Thoughtful touches including varied minibar and quirky details Great bathroom and toiletries Reception area and public rooms small but very well done with decor and architectural details sympathetic to the historical building Appreciated healthy menu options 
249393,The Laslett, Polyester sheets and cheap bedding in a hotel of this quality are a big NO The staff could do with more training they are all friendly but it feels disorganised The catering is disappointing, the staff are friendly the furnishing is stylish and functional the mini bar is excellent
249394,The Laslett, The Only negative thing i could say is that the cleaning staff is very persistent and would keep on knocking on room , The place is wonderful all around
249395,The Laslett, room as pretty small but that seems to be a standard for london , very friendly and helpful staff great service fantastic hip and cool location with easy access to the tube
249396,The Laslett,No Negative, A place to be New hotel nice and friendly staff very nice structure Location perfect just few steps from hide park Perfect for business and leisure
249397,The Laslett, No tea coffee or kettle in room hate that Slightly overpriced mini bar Breakfast expensive although very nice , Very close to tube and other local resources lovely modern but cosy feel very nicely done throughout and clean Staff were all so friendly and helpful bed comfy and room shower extras all lovely 
249398,The Laslett, the size of the room was quite a shock for someone that is used to a spacious hotel room , location is impeccable directly at the subway entrance of Notthinghill gate And the stylish interior decoration as well as friendly staff made an impression 
249399,The Laslett, Ny room was situated under ground level Constant footstep noise from the floor up above reception area Guess they have their spartan booking com rooms in the basement and cosy furshnished rooms up on the higher floors Nothing wrong with that but would have liked to have known , Very friendly staff Vibe
249400,The Laslett, availability of hot drinks facility for free in the room , Bed very comfy

249413,The Laslett, breakfast service was very slow, the bed
249414,The Laslett, Why can t I get that 125 rate every day , Perfect Hotel Unique for London Hidden gem 
249415,The Laslett, Cold room Didn t ready when I arrived more than 3pm Poor breakfast with high price, Staff and location

249438,The Laslett, absolutely nothing, The staff here was amazing really AMAZING Totally friendly and willing to help with anything Above the ordinary for sure
249439,The Laslett, I was looking to treat myself at the Laslett after a tiring work trip I was in for a big disappointment I was first given a room with no air conditioning that was unacceptably hot and stuffy Room 49 At first the staff proposed to move me to a new room however I would have had to pay an additional 60 pound per night fee After an amount of awkward negotiation they agreed to provide an airconditioned room at no extra charge Room 4 Unfortunately this room was on the basement level so I could hear every footstep from the floor above breakfast room reception etc I was really looking forward to my stay at the Laslett given other reviews but I found the service and quality of the rooms I stayed in wanting While there were some staff were lovely there were others who were inexplicably snobby , Location was convenient 
249440,The Laslett, Appalling stench of drains in the bathroom Having specified NOT a ground floor or basement room we were moved to the basement Very very unhappy with the room and the offer of a free breakfast was poor compensation I don t believe the staff were over concerned about the situation or our displeasure with the dark depressing room we were bundled into A great shame as there were was the potential for a great place in a great location that I would have considered for all my frequent visits to London Poor attitude has ensured I will not be returning and nor will my colleagues Thankfully there is no shortage of alternatives , Comfy bed good breakfast
249441,The Laslett,No Negative, The design of the hotel is so beautiful Very cool yet comfortable Art for sale on the walls A library to check out art and culture reads The bar was stellar as well and the breakfast was lovely Best part was the location Stones throw from Holland Park Hyde Park and Portabello Road When we left they gave us a voucher for age off our next stay Would absolutely book here again 
249442,The Laslett, The room was in the basement so no view out of the window and the blinds had to stay down to prevent anyone seeing in The booking com price was more than 100 more than the hotel would have charged , Bathroom
249443,The Laslett, The bottled water I had to purchase in the room was CRAZY expensive and wish they offered at least some purified water in the room but maybe that is asking too much , The decor is so unique and beautiful It really captures the spirit of the area 
249444,The Laslett, We did not sleep well in this hotel The doors are not good very well insulated so you woke up every time an other room slammed the door when leaving They have to change the doors so that you can get a good sleep , Staff is very nice and helped all they can and everything on the first floor was great Restaurant breakfast and bar and coffee was all great 
249445,The Laslett,No Negative, Location decor food bed the phone you can use to take with you and call overseas that they provide Very very nice boutique hotel loved it Highly recommend Hire bikes out front tube at end of street Great cofee and muesli

249493,The Laslett, There is clearly an ongoing issue with the plumbing ie showers v slow to drain , Central location with access to public transport 
249494,The Laslett, Public areas fairly small , So close to the tube 
249495,The Laslett, They tried to give us a room in the basement next to a noisy staff room with a low ceiling even though we had requested to be on the upper floors I asked to be moved and the staff were helpful enough to allocate a much more suitable room on the ground floor it s a pity we had to ask for it though ,No Positive
249496,The Laslett,No Negative, Boutique feel Incredibly friendly staff Quiet room with excellent space and large bathroom for a London hotel Unique mini bar amenities Prime position in Notting Hill Very convenient for central London and easy access to Heathrow airport 
249497,The Laslett,No Negative, recently opened very clean cosy a townhouse with a contemporary feel great with all the fashion art literature books in the rooms and in the bar lounge areas having a book on the nottinghill carnival in each room was also a nice touch also had a nice cocktail

249499,The Laslett, Missed little goodie like free water in my room Room was quite light at night good investment would be proper blinds , Loved the room and the bed was really comfy Neighbourhood was awesome 
249500,The Laslett,No Negative, Amazing location quirky room amazing bathroom well thought out room and facilities quick room service friendly and not pretentious The most comfortable bed and pillows 
249501,The Laslett,No Negative, Great layout spread over 5 townhouses just minutes from the underground and Kensington Gardens Wonderful collection of books and art Staff were amazing so helpful I was given Stanley s room beautiful 
249502,The Laslett, Only a slightly picky point but would have preferred to be able to make a coffee in the room in a morning instead of ordering Would still give it an 15 out of 10 though , Brilliant location close to thw tube shops restaurants and bars Portobello market just down the road 
249503,The Laslett, A basic breakfast should really be included for the price paid The heating should have been turned on before we entered the room , A well proportioned room with excellent bed though it could use something else to sit on not just the dresser chair Bathroom is well appointed good shower Ask to stay in one of the upper floors rather than lower ground or basement 
249504,The Laslett, My card was used to charge another guests costs which typifies the lackasadaisical poorly trained staff After all the stress they caused using my card no letter of apology was sent They seemed to think returning money to my card was sufficient apology Also the cost of stay there is not justified by littering the rooms with pseudo art and discontinued Neal s yard toiletries The only knowledgeable and professional staff was the doorman Every one else seemed to be so filled with their own self importance Was glad after 2 night to go back to my fave Hilton around the corner clean efficient and honest staff who are like old friends Would recommend other hotels or even b b to the laslett Much ado about nothing ,No Positive
249505,The Laslett, 1 Cleanliness of basins in the room after service could be improved a bit more to meet a 5 hotel standard 2 Cleanliness of washroom at ground floor needs improvement, 1 Staff is welcoming friendly helpful 2 Comfortable room 3 Location is great
249506,The Laslett,No Negative, We stayed at The Laslett for 6 days a young couple with a 5 month old baby We could not recommend this hotel enough The staff was very friendly and personal everything we needed was done for us immediately and nothing was a problem The location is amazing and the rooms are very stylish 
249507,The Laslett, I found the staff seemed badly trained Unable to deal with the simplest request Booked the hotel for 3 nights and every breakfast was a nightmare The first day it took nearly 40 min to be served and the waiter kept on making mistakes on my order Another think I didn t like is the reception area and restaurant They are so small it feels like a waiting room The aisle to the rooms is very narrow , I picked this hotel because of the location and because it s only been open for 6 weeks I booked the suite which was nice although I found the decoration a bit cold and impersonal I think the location and the cleanliness are the two best things of this hotel Also is quiet which is good 
249508,The Laslett,No Negative, A very beautiful hotel right next to Notting Hill underground station Spacious room which was nicely designed The staff were brilliant as well A very pleasant stay and will certainly return 
249509,The Laslett, Everything was marvelous except no warm food, There was no war food served I was looking for eggs for breakfast but unfortunately they don t serve 
249510,The Laslett, Breakfast you must buy every item separately but although the hotel is not able to offer normal things like sliced cheese and eggs not even boiled Not a proper room for breakfast Service incredible slow Impression that they don t want guest having breakfast there Staff very keen to pay everything right now F e had to pay for full stay one week at arrival plus deposit minibar Was kind of funny situation Not very friendly and not service orientated Seemed to be not good organized , very nice and new room
249511,The Laslett, Room was a little on the small side Similarly the communal spaces lobby reception library and restaurant area could charitably be described as cosy Small complaint there is only one elevator and it s a bit slow , Hotel was brand new so obviously very clean and well appointed It s conveniently located right next to Notting Hill Gate tube The staff were helpful and clearly very proud of their hotel Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very classy with an excellent shower 
249512,The Laslett, I booked the hotel for an artist who flew overnight from Canada On her arrival she found out that the hotel was semi finished and opened only 2 weeks ago Many things were not working at all or properly like wi fi which was vital for her at this time the sockets in the room the lifts and a few other things It was very wrong fro a hotel to open its doors to clients unfinished and particularly not let clients know in advance that that was the case ,No Positive
249513,The Laslett, slow service at breakfast I waited 10 min for cup of coffee and 20 min for food to arrive At the cost of hotel and extra cost for breakfast this is bad, very nice hotel
249514,The Laslett, I have nothing to fault other than that the room is somewhat expensive but even that can be justified , The staff were exceptionally welcoming the location was ideallic as its a 30 second walk to the high street but in an undisturbed location the room is pristine and a pleasantly minimalistic clean and without clutter 
249515,The Laslett,No Negative, It s modern arty comfortable and the staff are very friendly and helpful The Laslett has the best bathroom in any hotel I have ever stayed in and I loved the design 
249516,The Laslett,No Negative, VERY stylish hotel seconds from tube very friendly and relaxed Staff couldn t be more helpful Just opened so my first stay but i would definately go back 
249517,The Laslett, Room in the basement is not something I can recommend,No Positive
249518,The Laslett, The weather We had a bit of rain on the Saturday , Posh hotel but with friendly approachable staff who make your stay relaxed and comfortable
249519,The Laslett, Air conditioning needs updating, Good breakfast
249520,The Laslett, Nothing, Sleak clean atmosphere and excellent location 
249521,The Laslett,No Negative, Upgraded on arrival with a complementary glass of wine Staff very friendly Very classy deco and room super spacious and well equipped Top location next to nothing hill tube station holland park and hide park Just fantastic
249522,The Laslett, The lift can be a bit slow it s a pity there is no parking Bar is lacking in atmosphere but doesn t really matter as lots to do within a short walk or taxi ride, Comfy beds friendly efficient staff very clean and lovely decor throughout Views aren t great but this is London 1 minute from Central Line tube 5 minute walk to the lovely Westbourne Grove Ledbury Road shops and restaurants and Portobello 
249523,The Laslett, Pretty designless corridors but that s nothing , Fantastic location three tube lines to choose from including Central that takes you to the City and Soho An elegant plance great food And I loved the Belgravia bathroom fixtures 
249524,The Laslett, No tea and coffee making facilities in my room , The bed was extra comfy and the staff very friendly and efficient Relaxed atmosphere Great decor artwork books bathroom products Nice finishing touches for instance the old shoes in the wall 
249525,The Laslett, The play list , This is probably the best hotel I ever stayed in Though not the most lavish it is everything a city hotel should be Beautiful welcoming esthetic and as close as a hotel could be to a home away from home 
249526,The Laslett, Not a 5 star hotel Reception breakfast area is what you d expect to find in a hostel Breakfast pricing is a little mystifying , Bathroom Price was pretty competitive Manager was courteous responsive and helpful 
249527,The Laslett,No Negative, Staff was so friendly we ended up arriving late and the welcomed us to use their coffee bar to relax and enjoy the take out we brought in We loved the lounge area and attention to detail Art in the rooms were tasteful great spot we will recommend to anyone 
249528,The Laslett, I did wish I could have made a cup of tea in my room instead of having to order room service or go downstairs to the cosy tastefully designed bar area , I think the overall design of the hotel was excellent It highly appealed to my sense of aesthetics The service was excellent and very friendly We could walk to all our favorite spots in Westbourne grove Notting hill and the Kensington area
249529,The Laslett, Fo9r 152 a night disappointed not to be able to make a coffee in the morning had to pay for one by calling room service Mini bar was incredibly expensive , Location and nice room Portobello Road not far 
249530,The Laslett, we prefer a breakfast buffet but realise that there is limited space missed tea making facility in room hair dryer difficult to operate , Perfect location in quiet road yet really close to tube nice and helpful staff room had almost everything one requires
249531,The Laslett, We would have liked a jug to make tea in the room , The location at Notting Hill Gate was excellent close to the tube many restaurants cafes and the Portobello Road markets The bed was the best bed we ve slept on whilst travelling The staff were attentive and personable 
249532,The Laslett, Next time we will get a bigger room we reserved a double Spare bed for our son took up most of the walking space in room , Very friendly staff super cool lobby library filled with art books chic dining room and comfortable stylish rooms with good reading lights and unbelievably large bathrooms 1 min from NH tube station 
249533,The Laslett, No parking which is understandable given the location but I feel you should offer free parking for customers at the recommended NCP down the road Also everyone loves a little freebie from a hotel mini toiletries spoils the fun to sell the same products at reception I don t go to a hotel to shop , I love the decor It s a really awesome looking place 
249534,The Laslett, The resteraunt has lots of room for improvement service a little slow BUT food quality poor and overly priced , The staff were generally friendly and the hotel was excellent in terms of facilities 
249535,The Laslett,No Negative, Great location for exploring london both business and pleasure Very high spec rooms 
249536,The Laslett, Wrong billing including items I did not use from mini bar, Room design and complimentary gym though 10 mins away
249537,The Laslett,No Negative, Location style
249538,The Laslett,No Negative, Great location trendy modern and personalised deco great wifi and AC big bathroom with good water power comfy bed
249539,The Laslett, Wonderful team beautiful hotel love it so much, Wonderful team beautiful hotel love it so much
249540,The Laslett, the bathroom size, I liked the croissants
