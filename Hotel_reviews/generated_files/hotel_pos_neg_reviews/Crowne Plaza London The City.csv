81259,Crowne Plaza London The City, When we arrived we were given a room which was already occupied This was quickly rectified however As an apology we were offered a free meal in one of the hotel s restaurants the next night We made our choice of restaurant and made a reservation only to find that when we arrived at the restaurant it was closed that night something the staff should have told us when we tried make our reservation,No Positive
81260,Crowne Plaza London The City, I requested early check in as my trans atlantic flight landed at 9 am Got to hotel and no record of request and told to wait until 2pm to check in Took first available room which was not the room I booked Need to accommodate travelers who arrive early esp when NY LHR flights usually land at 8 or 9am ,No Positive
81261,Crowne Plaza London The City, NOTHING EVERYTHING WAS FABULOUS, THE BED WAS SO COMFORTABLE BREAKFAST WAS EXCELLENT EVERY MEMBER OF STAFF WE MET WAS SO FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL WOULD DEFINITELY STAY AGAIN 
81262,Crowne Plaza London The City, Difficult to find on foot , The concierge was particularly helpful I had forgotten my tie for a blacktie event and he went out to get me one Later he printed off my speech 
81263,Crowne Plaza London The City, Our upgraded room was average to say the least, Good location for us and helpful reception staff in particular Pece but we were told we had been upgraded to a superior room due to the fact that this was a special occasion visit for four nights in London for my husband s birthday and I can only describe our room as very average 
81264,Crowne Plaza London The City, There was nothing I didn t like , Super reception Clean room and bathroom Easy to use effective strong shower not spraying the floor We got the Club Lounge for afternoon tea snacks and breakfast alcohol was available in there Luggage stored after checkout while in meeting Taxi called for us the location of the hotel seemed to make vehicle access pretty good and quick We walked to our supper restaurant and our meeting so it was an excellent location for our needs 
81265,Crowne Plaza London The City, Coffee was cheaper via room service than in the bars , The fact there was a smoking bedroom bar and covered area took away a lot of stress for me as a smoker The concierge staff were very good and extremely helpful The room service was fast 
81266,Crowne Plaza London The City, Room was hot and air conditioning didn t really get very cool, Staff were very friendly and attentive they made a real effort even on small details which was really lovely
81267,Crowne Plaza London The City, cook preparing the eggs was always busy and didn t have time to prepare eggs my way , Bed was super comfy like sleeping in the clouds breakfast was good and the location was amazing 
81268,Crowne Plaza London The City, We arrived back at the hotel at 11 30pm and the bars were shut Sunday night close early that was disappointing , Lovely room friendly staff great breakfast 
81269,Crowne Plaza London The City, No answer when I called front desk repeatedly after 9pm to ask for location of ice machine Had to call room service the only number that answered Ice machine was one floor away , Very comfortable room and free water and wifi good value
81270,Crowne Plaza London The City, Bathroom facilities mainly the bathtub is little small at the Standard room in which I lived , The location of the property is excellent General appearance of room and the facilities available in property are good Very friendly pleasant and helpful staffs Chinese Cricket Club restaurant is excellent The Italian restaurant also OK 
81271,Crowne Plaza London The City, The spray for pillows to help you sleep was not in the room I called reception to ask for it and they promised to send to my room It never arrived Such a small thing but having stayed at hotel before and used this spray had been looking forward to the great sleep that followed Most unimpressed with the staff member at reception at around 10 30pm on Friday 3rd March saying she would send requested item but didn t bother doing so I expect staff to follow through on their assurances to guests most disappointing has tainted my opinion of this hotel and makes me wonder whether other requests would also have been ignored, Have stayed here before and chose it specifically based on my prior experience Hotel is in a good location it is close to Blackfriars train tube St Pauls Is also walking distance to the west end Beds are comfortable and room size is reasonable Staff member when I checked out was very helpful apologetic for poor service I had received from reception staff the prior evening offering his card for the next time I am staying to ensure I have what I need a lovely gesture 
81272,Crowne Plaza London The City, The bedside table was stained and weird looked like 2 pieces from a car boot sale not in a vintage distressed way , Good size room and gigantic beds Loved the aromatherapy sleep kit and plenty of milk 
81273,Crowne Plaza London The City, I was surprised to see that preauthorisation was not released on my checkout date when the payment was executed but 5 days later I contacted by phone the guest relations manager who blamed the bank for the delay but the truth was that the hotel had given the release order 5 days after the checkout date as being informed by the bank If this is the policy of the hotel it would be better for the client to be aware of it and not be misleaded I sent an urgent email to the manager about this issue and he replied after 8 days Very disappointed by their professionalism, Very good location comfortable rooms nice restaurant and friendly staff 
81274,Crowne Plaza London The City, The beds were very small but comfortable never the less Both bars were closed at 10 30pm on Sunday night , The staff were all very helpful and friendly the breakfast room was nice 
81275,Crowne Plaza London The City, Given two double beds instead of one even though stated it was our anniversary Moved to a room with one bed and in the room there were no tea bags with the tea making kit no tissues in the room and the maid came into our room at 11am when we werent due to check out until 12 Although we didn t complain as the stay overall was good , Location great for south bank Very welcoming front desk and lovely looking foyer 
81276,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, we stayed for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary and the staff could not be more helpfully and pleasant the Concierge organised us some bubbles and a card for our room our stay was excellent we will be back soon
81277,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful they were always happy to help us out with what we needed Room service was also good and topped up our tea free water and free snacks The location is quite good walking distance to many attractions and across the street from Blackfriars station for any longer trips Bed was comfy Also so helpful to be provided with a mobile phone to use while out and about in London that has free data text and call usage free 
81278,Crowne Plaza London The City, Pillows were highly uncomfortable for me and my girlfriend The bed itself was comfortable but the top pillow was far too puffy and soft the bottom pillow didn t compliment the top pillow, Staff approachable yet professional location was great room was clean
81279,Crowne Plaza London The City, All facilities outside the main areas are a bit run down Water does not flow down garderobe doors broken minibar door broken fitness area rather minimalistic and aged , Excellent breakfast perfect location and helpful staff
81280,Crowne Plaza London The City, We were woken up and 5 30 by the man in the room next to us who was obviously drunk banging around and throwing up and talking very loudly Which obviously impacted our stay as we were very tired the next day Obviously not the hotels fault, I really enjoyed the stay to room was Lovley and the location was great Would definitely recommend it to others 
81281,Crowne Plaza London The City, The cost of mini bar facilities is as at all hotels ridiculously high The mark up could be less and surely still make a good profit I think when it s so expensive it surely deters guests from using it , Staff are always available to help guests and cheery about doing it Although we didn t eat at the hotel it is great that there are two restaurant facilities available The location is excellent and cuts down on tube costs Very thoughtful that daily bottled water in the room was included and the housekeeping is excellent 
81282,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful They do their best to exceed the visitors expectations They work really a lot Breakfast is exceptional Very very well done We are really positively surprised with the plate we found in our room as a wedding anniversary commemoration 
81283,Crowne Plaza London The City, I could not eat at the hotel restaurant at Christmas holidays Room service main menu could not be ordered due to time limit The price of the minibar in the room was unknown , I was able to fully enjoy walking through Central London City I was fortunate to park in front of the hotel Christmas gifts were delightful 
81284,Crowne Plaza London The City, Unfortunately although the staff were very friendly and professional I found them difficult to understand as they were Eastern European Rooms were not quite of the same standard as the public areas although comfortable Didn t have breakfast as price is extortionate , Good location nice and clean Handy location for access to underground I booked this on a special offer but would have been really disappointed had I paid full price 
81285,Crowne Plaza London The City, Didn t like the fact you had to pay for wifi even when member of loyalty club , Location fantastic as walking distance from Embankment Station and literally across the road from Blackfriars Station
81286,Crowne Plaza London The City, The hairdryer in the room was a really old fashioned one with no heat or power variation possible , Good situation Really good breakfast buffet The two restaurants in the hotel are each of a high standard The room itself was very comfortable 
81287,Crowne Plaza London The City, The toilet bowl is yellowish There is no conditioner no cotton shower cap etc , The location is excellent and the room size is big for London city
81288,Crowne Plaza London The City, Got charged before getting to hotel number of times without knowing then charge room rate paid for trip 5 times and wouldn t give money back never had trouble with any other crown plaza just this one would NOT advise going ,No Positive
81289,Crowne Plaza London The City, The breakfast is too highly priced considering the fact that the same breakfast option is available at half the price in walking distance hotel properties and also accessible , The staff was very hospitable ideal location and very prompt service 
81290,Crowne Plaza London The City, The prices of everything just seems excessive even accounting for it being in London Neraly 50 for two portions of burger and chips in the room actually made me laugh until i came to pay for it , The room was fairly large the bed very comfortable The location was perfect for us because of Blackfriars being just across the road 
81291,Crowne Plaza London The City, The air con isn t too powerful Even in October we were very warm in the room , We have stayed here before when visiting London great location large spotlessly clean rooms with all facilities you could need 
81292,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, Really comfortable beds had the best night sleep Hotel is in a great location it s right across the road from blackfriars tube station only a short walk to St Pauls and approx 15mins to Covent Garden
81293,Crowne Plaza London The City, Room service a little expensive and not great after 11pm Can t think of anything else , Good size room comfy bed and free shortbread Very clean and the staff were all lovely 
81294,Crowne Plaza London The City, Ok stay however I requested something from reception twice with an hour between the requests I was told no problem they would bring it right up and it never arrived The staff were a bit slack The food in the cricket club Chinese in the hotel arrived to the table cold and the white wine was warm not chilled ,No Positive
81295,Crowne Plaza London The City, There were not many plugs however we were quickly provided with an extension wire which solved this , I mentioned it was my birthday and when i came back to my room in the evening i found a birthday card and a box of chocolates lovely little touch 
81296,Crowne Plaza London The City, The bed and especially the pillows were too soft but thats just my opinion , The hotel was so near to everything we wanted the breakfast was out of this world and the staff couldnt do enough to help 
81297,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, really nice big room with comfy bed you get a free 3G mobile phone in you room with free internet access and free calls to enjoy your trip found this really nice room service 24 hours nice hamburgers really great location you get quickly in the center or anywhere really good breakfast
81298,Crowne Plaza London The City, nothing, location next to under and over ground station Close to the city of London and numerous tourist attractions Huge rooms Comfy bed Friendly accommodating staff 
81299,Crowne Plaza London The City, Only had one robe in the room which wasn t soft and comfy as you d expect Would of been good to have an explanation of the club and lounge bar areas Bar voltaire was very quiet to empty at night and not many bars in the area , Staff were very helpful and friendly Looked after our bags before check in and after check out so we could do some sightseeing When booking I mentioned it was my girlfriends birthday they sent up a card and some chocolates as a treat very nice thought Hotel was positioned well for visiting theatreland and for visiting the London Eye and Tower of London areas Across the road from the tube station was convenient 
81300,Crowne Plaza London The City, As petty as it sounds there are not enough plug sockets in the room this is my only negative comment about this hotel , The hotel was extremely clean staff were polite and helpful meet the standard of a hotel that is above average great location
81301,Crowne Plaza London The City, Room as a bit dated and worn and could do with a bit of a revamp Also there was only 1 plug socket needed one you could get to near the bedside table to charge my phone and had to put the kettle on the floor as there wasn t a socket near a table , Staff were very friendly and really made our stay special 
81302,Crowne Plaza London The City, After the recent change of the staff at breakfast area the service level decreased and sometimes it went to pure chaos , The location of the hotel is great Close to Blackfriars station close to Soho close to St Paul Also the hotel itself is really nice and staff is usually very helpful Perfect place to stay both for work and leisure 
81303,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, All of the staff were amazing We even sent a thank you card to management to say what a fantastic stay we had for my mums birthday Breakfast was fantastic great selection of hot and cold food We will definitely be visiting again
81304,Crowne Plaza London The City, Everything was top notch, I had previously reviewed this hotel on trip advisor and stated breakfast looked mediocre I am happy to say I had breakfast and it was delicious Top brand food well cooked and presented Plenty of options and the waiting staff very good
81305,Crowne Plaza London The City, I couldn t get connected to the free wifi everytime I tried there was options to which I had to pay The room was lovely and clean but only 1 bath robe I did request a higher floor which they catered for Thank you but a river view was requested but unfortunately we didn t get one I know Everyone is different and I know there unable to cater for every single person the bed for unbelievably comfortable but I couldn t get comfy on the pillows ,No Positive
81306,Crowne Plaza London The City, It would be nice if they offered complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby especially since the shops don t open until later on the weekend There is coffee tea available in the room but it goes quickly , Beds fitness center were great and the location too 
81307,Crowne Plaza London The City, They could have told me that they will make a reservation on my credit card for 200 pounds if I would like to buy something on the hotel That was really bad ,No Positive
81308,Crowne Plaza London The City, Really uncomfortable entrance from the main street you have to go through really small rotating door with your bag Moreover as the windows cannot be open due to the secutiry reasons room is getting very hot inside when the one uses hairdryer or iron and super smelly when smoking , Very good location just in front of the train and tube station a lot of bars and good restaurants around beautiful bridge and the biggest cathedral are 1 min walking
81309,Crowne Plaza London The City, Only one flaw was the serious lack of plug points in the suite, Service was great was out wedding night stay so we where kindly upgraded from a deluxe room to a suite Suit lovely as was all service and assistance 
81310,Crowne Plaza London The City, The hair dryer in the bathroom was very low powered I hadn t brought my own as proper hairdryers are usually provided , The room was very comfortable and quiet despite being in a central location and there was an excellent choice of good quality food in comfortable surroundings for breakfas 
81311,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, Booked this hotel as part of my engagement plans my now fianc was thrilled with the room and especially the service by the reception staff I believe it was Nikolette Bed very comfy bathroom beautiful very clean Will book again 
81312,Crowne Plaza London The City, Room was too hot and didn t have an external window Air con needed to be able to go higher , Breakfast was delicious Staff were extremely helpful nothing was too much trouble 
81313,Crowne Plaza London The City, Beds where only a small double size and only 1 dressing gown in the room , Hotel is very well presented We ate at the Italian resturant which was on site Although a pricey menu we had a 50 off voucher which brought the overall total to a reasonable price Breakfast was amazing 
81314,Crowne Plaza London The City, Nothing everything was perfect, The staff made such a good effort for my boyfriends birthday as this was a surprise for his 30th It made the weekend even better
81315,Crowne Plaza London The City, no plug sockets by the bed so we could charge our phones and a lack of plug sockets in the room all together really, amazing staff clean and new looking hotel breakfast was lovely and situated in the exact spot where we were sight seeing excellent
81316,Crowne Plaza London The City, realy every thing kindly reception and conserge staff the hole week that i have been in yiur hotel you where great with a smile on your face realy THANK YOU , coldn t be better I will reccomend the hotel to every visitor to london and when i come back to london your hotel will be my best place to stay THANK YOU
81317,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, From the moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly helpful staff We had a problem with our bathroom toilet not flushing and no sooner had we reported it we were immediately transferred to another room We would like to say an extra big thank you to Guest Relations Manager Mr Pece Naumoski who couldn t do enough to help The hotel is modern and comfortable and is in a great location 
81318,Crowne Plaza London The City, I only spent the night and didn t have the time to go around Nothing went wrong or noticed to be reported , The first impression was being very well received greeted and served by the guest relations officer forgot his name This alone made my short stay worth it 
81319,Crowne Plaza London The City, The hotel was a bit dated and you could see some wear and tear here and there Bad coffee for breakfast but starbucks across the street , The room was large enough for two persons Breakfast was good with enough choice Location was close to Sint Pauls Cathedral and the tube station 
81320,Crowne Plaza London The City, First room stank of smoke and so I needed to be moved Second room had faulty air conditioning which was not fixed despite a request to do so , Location great Staff very friendly and helpful particularly in the restaurant at breakfast
81321,Crowne Plaza London The City, The lift didn t know we had to put our card in , Great breakfast Room clean spacious and central venue Staff let us check in early before the matinee too little gesture but really enhanced our experience Also appreciated the birthday treats for the 2 members of our party 
81322,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, I had told the hotel it was my husbands birthday and to our pleasant surprise they had gone above and beyond the call of duty with balloons and a fabulous dessert complete with a chocolate happy birthday message The room was perfect and the breakfast was delicious I particularly liked my omelette made from scratch Thank you so much for a wonderful stay 
81323,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, Staff are so welcoming and helpful at all times Would highly recommend London City Crowne Plaza and hope to return Location is excellent with easy access to all the sights shows lovely restaurants etc 
81324,Crowne Plaza London The City, The bed was not comfortable at all dipped in the middle which is fine if you re a single person but for 2 it felt like sleeping on a very steep hill ,No Positive
81325,Crowne Plaza London The City, Your rooms are looking shabby Chipped paintwork broken telephone charging units The public areas are good but the rooms are poor , Location next door to UNILEVER
81326,Crowne Plaza London The City, The staff is really one of the worst crowne plaza I have visited I came in carrying 2 large suitcase and a bunch of staff just watching me without single one of them offering any help The checkin was slow and they even assigned me to a wrong room at first The staff didnot seem friendly at all and next morning at 9 30 am there r people trying to get into my room I supposed they r staff from the hotel hopefully if not then it is very scary Why do they wanna enter the room at 9 30 am while the check out time was 11 , Location is great quite near the tube station view is not bad
81327,Crowne Plaza London The City, We would have preferred a room with daylight had we been staying for a longer time , The welcome was very pleasant Georgia was the young lady on the check in desk The breakfast choice was excellent and again the staff were pleasant and polite 
81328,Crowne Plaza London The City, Not much difference in the rooms from a Holiday Inn and certainly not worth the amount of money we paid however it was after all in London and very convenient for what we wanted , The Breakfast was excellent and the staff were extremely helpful and kind 
81329,Crowne Plaza London The City, Only one small problem The english climate did not help as it was very warm and the room was therefore difficult to cool down , Excellent location and easy transport links Used for an overnight stay while visiting St Pauks cathedral and was very convenient with many good eating places in the vicinity Good breakfast set us up for the next day 
81330,Crowne Plaza London The City, I liked everything about the hotel and my only suggestion for improvement would be diet light tonic water be available in the executive lounge together with either raspberry or strawberry jam as an alternative to black currant at breakfast , The general location of the hotel together with being so close to Blackfriars tube station meant that we were central to or had really easy access all the main tourist attractions Perfect for everything bar perhaps main line shopping Ie the big department stores Which pleased my husband The executive club room with lounge access was certainly worth the extra cost offering a delicious breakfast and a good range of evening drinks and pickies in pleasant surroundings before going out for the evening whilst being looked after by very pleasant and helpful staff Definitely will return 
81331,Crowne Plaza London The City, Mattress on bed needs replacing very saggy and not comfortable Well known budget hotels beds are more comfortable Also room not serviced until late afternoon which may suggest not enough staff , Very convenient location Choice on breakfast buffet was very good great array of fruit and always able to get a table without waiting stayed 4 nights Given a quiet room as requested 
81332,Crowne Plaza London The City, No bad experience but the restaurant was very busy at breakfast the staff worked very hard to keep the buffet topped up and clearing tables but could have done with more on duty to maintain the generally high standard of the rest of our stay , On a direct bus route from St Pancras and within walking distance of The South Bank to attend a concert Very quiet in the room despite overlooking a busy road Good size comfortable room and bathroom Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice from the buffet 
81333,Crowne Plaza London The City, You have to pay to access the wifi For the money you pay this should be free as it is in most other hotels b bs which charge less per night , Great central location Staff very helpful and friendly Lovely decor and surroundings Room was spacious and comfortable 
81334,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, Superb location quick smooth check in Lovely clean room and batroom complimentary toiletries were lovely even provided pillow scent spray for aid sleep Really couldn t fault anything about this hotel and will definitely stay again 
81335,Crowne Plaza London The City, Breakfast is totally overpriced and unexceptional , The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was extremely comfortable The location is superb 
81336,Crowne Plaza London The City,No Negative, Perfect location if you arrive at luton airport just in front of the blackfriars train station Very helpful and gentle staff Wonderful and confortable lounge where we could meet friends and have drinks from the bar 
81337,Crowne Plaza London The City, Thought the breakfast quality could have been slightly higher , Lovely rooms and hotel modern and well kept Great location opposite the tube station to get around London
81338,Crowne Plaza London The City, We could only linked one device to the wifi and it is NOT free 5 for 1 hour high speed and 9 for 24 hours If my husband did not notice in time he could ve received a terrible electric shock the plug of the iron was missing the cover all wires exposed ,No Positive
81339,Crowne Plaza London The City, Personally I feel the decor is a little tired the bathrooms are fine but not luxurious , the club suite was spacious and clean with Bose docking smart TV comfortable lounge area and comfortable bed The little touches like this works sleep pillow spray and good quality toiletries make a difference 
81340,Crowne Plaza London The City, Not having breakfast included in the price Although it was offered for 14 95 that is a lot for a bowl of cereal and some toast , Stayed as a wedding guest with reception at the Chinese Cricket Club All staff very friendly and helpful and lovely room Brilliant location
