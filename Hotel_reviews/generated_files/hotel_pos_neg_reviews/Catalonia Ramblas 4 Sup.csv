402360,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Can t think of anything we didn t like, The staff was very friendly our room was beautiful my 10 year old son enjoyed the pool and our all around experience was wonderful 
402361,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Babycot was not provided while it was ordered during bookinsg Hotel desk said they cannot as max people allowed are 3 while the 1yr baby slept with the mother in the same bed , Proximit du centre de barcelone A 200m de la fameuse passage la Rambla etplaza catalunya 
402362,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Our daughters teddy bear big panda got lost in the luggage storage She was very very sad but the staff did not help or took it seriously how can a bear get lost , Very pleasant hotel in a central area The room pool was great for our kids 
402363,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We didn t have breakfast as too expensive great little inexpensive cafes nearby , The hotel was lovely The pool was great to relax after sight seeing and our 12 year old loved it There was a bar selling drinks and snacks and a shaded chill out area I would highly recommend this hotel as great location to get about the city staff very friendly we had a triple room and room was spacious with very comfortable beds and a lovely bathroom with bath and separate shower 
402364,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Room service was not easy to have Also there was no refrigerator in the room which was a big turn off The bar downstairs was always a little difficult to get staff to support , Staff was excellent 
402365,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Room was not like the advertisement It had a large wall that narrowed the space considerably and it had little light The internals of the hotel have odd angles that impact on the rooms I asked for another room and they showed me one that had very little space around the bed with no window Seriously after spending that much money you are expecting a reasonable room They need to photograph these other rooms with no window and small spaces and let people decide False advertising I ask to get light fixed 3 times with no response Room lighting is poor The pool looks like it s deep in the picture but it is only up to your waist , Comfy bed Good location
402366,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The rooms are not well distributed in general Nowhere to really put your clothes no place to hang your towels there is an obvious lack of practicality that makes your everyday stay a bit more difficult It s an ok hotel for a day but if you stay for a few days and arrive with a suitcase it is not the place to choose The swimming pool is very small and full of kids screaming playing and jumping Not a place for couples at all , The location obviously this is the strongest point of this hotel 
402367,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, A bit pricey but comparable to other hotels in the area Busy shopping district , Very comfortable clean room Not very specious once we added the extra bed we booked for 3 people Great location just off Rambles Easy to get to metro and tourist spots 
402368,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Breakfast should have been included for the cost per night Hotel was a bit musty and rooms were not as clean as i would like , The staff was very helpful Good Location modern 
402369,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The whole experience began on a negative note The check in process was awful with the staff being extremely unhelpful We arrived an hour before check in and were told not asked to wait At check in time after queuing for 15 minutes we were again told to wait as the room was not ready We were only given our room an hour after the official check in The room was clean but hot and muggy as the air conditioning had not been switched on for reasons of economy I presume While waiting in the lobby we ordered a pizza which turned out to be a burnt and dry piece of dough with remnants of tomato sauce and burnt cheese The next morning the room service breakfast we ordered was not much better During the night the sink in the toilet leaked and all the towels were soaking wet The hotel gets very noisy in the morning and even though there is no noise from the street the sounds from the corridors are very annoying To end it all when we requested a late check out we were told that to remain in the room an extra charge of 20 Euros would be incurred needless to say they quickly changed their tune after they were reminded of the check in debacle I understand that the hotel is very busy but surely staff at the front desk should be trained to handle things better , There was not much to like apart from the location and the fact that the housekeeping staff were very efficient albeit being very overworked 
402370,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The room was dark and you needed to put the light on even during the day I think that the window would have benefited from a voile so that light could be let into the room but not that people could see in rather than just black out curtains Also there were three people in the room and only a very small space for clothes and no hangers , The staff were extremely helpful and the beds are really comfy Excellent nights sleep and a good location 
402371,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I as to use their Iron never have one called the front desk and they say they got stole who know from who if you stay there please bring you own Iron they don t use it in this hotel , Location Great Hotel great friendly staff ask then for help and help you with smile 
402372,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Room with view for nothing View for next window Air condition not effective They has all the time adverb that we can upgrade room but it was not possible , Location
402373,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We have booked a junior sweet with a private pool however we have been given our request but was on the 7th floor and the elevator just reach the 6th floor so we had to go to the stairs to reach our room imagine with a trolley how it would look like Once I had to call the reception to clean the room while we are going out we came back and found that nothing has been cleaned No free water is offered to us The pool is a joke 4m square Very small one and not worth it to be called a pool I strongly don t recommend this hotel to any one , The location
402374,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We re 3 adults but we took an extra bed for 50 night because there were not 3 single beds as the reciptionest told us it was two twin beds attached together which is not suitable for three people to sleep together because there is no mattress filling the gap inbetween the the beds Unfriendly receptionists, Pool location ATM and friendly bellboy and room cleaners
402375,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, My room didn t have an iron but luckily my friends room did so it wasn t an issue But I m sure they would of supplied one if I asked, The beds where big and comfortable the room very very modern and clean
402376,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, A hotel worthy of a 5 star Absolutely faultless Central location so step out the door straight into the town shops restaurants and sights fabulous rooms family and twin wifi superb Facilities great Worth every penny Service great and staff extremely polite Now clearly this is a very well managed hotel so hats off to the management They also stored all our luggage after check out at Midday until we went to the airport at 6 Nothing was too much trouble Love love love this place For a trip to Barcelona if you can get a room there it is a fabulous place to stay 
402377,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Cleaning wasn t so great had to call multiple times to get my room re serviced because it wasn t clean Once a dirty pillowcase had been put back on pillow after room service The excuse every time was that bed linen only gets changed every 2 days in a 4 star hotel I ve been to other 4 star hotels where that hasn t been the case If something is dirty it should be changed If a room is serviced nothing should be left there if its not clean Room furniture was outdated too , Amazing location few steps away from Placa de Catalunya and Ramblas St which is the main strip with stores and tourist shops and lots of great shopping 
402378,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, No tea coffee etc in our room Small detail but for the price it should be included, Parking was a nightmare The parking lot is hidden and could only be found when a member of staff found my wife and showed her the entrance hidden by a shutter door I had asked 3 separate times how to get there 
402379,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Did not try the hotel food not able to comment Nothing that we did not like, Excellent central location Staff were very friendly and helpful thank you Dafne on the desk Rooms were very clean and beds were really comfortable Pool area was very welcome in the heat Hop on bus stopped in the square round the corner as did the airport bus
402380,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, ROOM SERVICE I phoned to order a cappuccino and was told but you have coffee in your room Told them not to worry I went to starbucks and got my coffee there If ever I end up there again I will not be using room service they have no people skills and don t know how to speak to customers , didn t have breakfast
402381,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We booked 5 rooms for 3 nights and the experience was mixed at best 2 rooms had terrible wifi signal while the rest enjoyed wifi of decent speed Also one of the rooms 1st floor the windows facing the Main Street had terrible street noise and the cigarette smoke was always in the room One last thing checking in and out should be faster , Breakfast was decent staff in general was courteous the location was excellent 
402382,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We had a broken window in our room and the staff acted like it was normal Not very nice or helpful Not what you would expect from this type of hotel ,No Positive
402383,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, Room was generous size even for a family of 4 Fantastic bathroom shower area with modern finishings Just one block from Plaza de Catalunya Tons of restaurants nearby The room itself was quiet The staff was extremely helpful While the pool was smaller than expected it was still nice to have a pool to cool off in after a long day of sightseeing I would definitely stay here again 
402384,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, When I booked the room the hotel said their was private parking and a reservation was not necessary However when I arrived I was told the parking was full and I would have to park at one of the nearby public parking facilities which cost 35 euros per day Another catch is that a lot of establishments in europe now offer you the option to pay in dollars or euros I went for the dollars thinking that I wouldn t have to pay the foreign exchange fee on my credit card However when I saw the total for the bill I ended up paying almost twice as much on the exchange rate as I would have if I used my card When you are offered this option at any establishment in Europe don t fall for it its a rip off , The Catalonia Ramblas is a well situated hotel very close to La Ramblas The room was well appointed and there was a very nice lounge bar area with a swimming pool on the roof of the hotel Bed was comfortable and linens were top notch 
402385,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Too small rooms Like really very small rooms For that price you can have much better hotel rooms , The equipmpent in The rooms was good Toothbrush fan shampoo Hightech design 
402386,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, 1 Swimming pool is very poor in my opinion The area is small and many guests were there 2 Air conditioning in the room was shut down during the midnight I was not sure if hotel wants to save the energy or to be Green in this case However the temperature was super high in Barcelona it was unacceptable We did not call FD coz we were very tired during the trip Before we checked out around 11am the air co was still shut down 3 To save a luggage before check in the reception told us to wait for housekeeper Then we were standing and waiting in lobby for 15 mins OMG , The location is great Bathroom is nice shower and bathtub are complete separated 
402387,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Nothing, We arrived following a cruise and just wanted a few hours and to freshen up before our flight home We were expecting to check into a standard room at 3pm but on early arrival they said there was an alternate superior room available there and then which was a bonus The room was large and spacious with a large double walk in shower cubicle and bath There was tea and coffee facilities and also a well stocked mini bar The pool was visible from our room and was clean with a well kept bar area On check out a few hours later the staff were extremely helpful and went to kerbside to flag a taxi to take us to the airport Both my husband and I said on our return to Barcelona this would be where we would stay without question 
402388,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Had to call to get access to the car park each time Not a big deal but something to be aware of , Staff very friendly and helpful child friendly nice pool on the roof Excellent breakfast Super location 
402389,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Staff are unprofessional and its not a four star hotel service which you will expect During check in I was asking to check the room size as we are a family and if the size is small since they are advertising the room sizes on the reception in case you want to upgrade I will upgrade for a suite room and will pay the difference the answer was for the receptionist Sabrina that you can t check the room and there is no availabity and I have to pay the whole stay in advance I informed her that in this case I will cancel if I can t check it and according to booking com free cancellation policy I will cancel the other nights and I will be charged first night She was arguing that I can t cancel in arugent way until I showed her the policy she checked with the manager and the reply was that the room is large no need to upgrade and left other staff was hearing and informed that it s ok if he check the room and sorted this out but she was totally unhappy and after accepting the room and doing the check in she didn t explain anything about the hotel as other staff were explaining regarding the outlets discounts for other guests and put the keys and left i was waiting my bags from the concierge room and same receptionist were arguing with couple booked dbl room and they got twin bed and she was arguing with them that that s what available only I traveled all around the world and first time I see a hotel who only place amenties shampoo soaps only on check in and won t replace or add new on second day as per the housekeeping which I asked for shampoo and her reply is we can t give as per the policy sorry but even toilet papers I have to go out in the corridor and get from the housekeeping staff who were cleaning other room as it s was over and was not refil second day even after cleaning the room , Only the location
402390,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Staff very unhelpful dirty around the pool with glass on the floor bedrooms poor design no drawers sliding doors that kept getting stuck complete waste of money will not stay there again and would not recommend, Comfy beds
402391,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We were served a raw chicken sandwich on the rooftop bar They didn t seem very concerned but did take it off the bill Most the meat was served undercooked in our experience , Location was excellent We could literally walk everywhere Rita the hotel manager went above and beyond to accommodate us when we arrived early before checkin time The front desk staff was great and many of the bartenders were great 
402392,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, an inappropiate guest party at the bar but the waitress moved us to another table to avoid any issue, Great staff they upgraded our room in order to be in the same floor all family members Thanks Marc
402393,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Room outlook onto air conditioning units opposite Looked at alternate rooms but not as nice in decor or outlook either Also situated next to lift Water would not drain quickly from bathroom sink Advised reception but was not fixed , No croissants heavy but in general breakfasts had a wide range of food and ok Bedding comfortable and front desk helpful 
402394,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, The rooms with twin beds were overbooked but we were kindly upgraded to a room with private pool It was very nice of the staff The location cannot be better close to all attractions and connections to the airport or train station 
402395,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, When you book a 4 star hotel you have certain expectations which this hotel fulfilled with ease My grand daughter especially enjoyed the pool area From Cymru Wales gwych great 
402396,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, We needed a hotel quickly as this was the day that the whole of BA went down and we were advised that rooms in Barcelona were running out fast They were Booking com came to our rescue not sure that others were so lucky and had to sleep in the terminal

402400,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Bed too soft but comfy pillows hotel thus pool between buildings and was noisy as one of the buildings was under renovation not relaxing , Excellent location The room was great big bathroom small balcony very clean Pool area was nice staff very friendly and helpful great variety at breakfast 
402401,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Unless you need an enormous breakfast the hotel s breakfast buffet is too expensive We preferred to go to a small cafe for coffee and croissants at a fraction of the price , The hotel is in an excellent location in central Barcelona and within walking distance to most of the sights The side streets near the hotel are filled with little cafes a number of which we patronized Our room which was in the rear of the hotel looked out on a pedestrian street so we didn t have any noise The staff were very pleasant and accommodating We stayed 10 nights and could have stayed longer because the hotel is comfortable 
402402,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Nothing , Location was excellent and also the hotel was lovely We didn t have a view at all our room looked into a inside area which backed a wall But it didn t bother us the comfort of the beds was fantastic 
402403,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We were disappointed in the booking com advertising as it lead us to believe that breakfast was included in the advertised price meanwhile 40 euros more Not good ,No Positive

402406,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Can t think of one , The location is perfect it s not too far from everywhere Really in the middle of the city Staff was really helpful we arrived earlier than check in time and he helped us to arrange everything so check in later will be faster and easier He is friendly and made small talks during check in process we arrived on a public holiday and he told us story about it We had to check out early in the morning and the staff assisted us to get a taxi Big comfortable bed
402407,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We were very kindly offered an upgraded room which was fantastic only for reception to ring us the next morning saying a mistake was made and our room had since been sold and that we would have to move with 10 minutes noticed this involved us having to repack and move all of our stuff to rub salt in the wounds we were then told our new room would not be ready till after lunch we then missed our pickup time for an day trip due to the time it took us to repack and move our luggage to the reception Far from happy from this experience,No Positive
402408,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The staff at the poolside bar were very very slow and kept forgetting orders then getting order wrong , Bed was very comfy pool area was a little small but lovely 
402409,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Electric noise in the room Dark interior dark brown wood looks like a hotel room from 80 s , Excellent breakfast great location very large room 
402410,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We booked a triple room and we paid 760 for three nights They also took a 50 deposit out of my account on the first day without telling me I thought this was very expensive especially seeing as this did not even include breakfast We were told that if we wanted breakfast it would cost 20 per person per day 60 for breakfast for three people each day I don t think so One thing that really bothered me was the fact that one of our beds was an extremely uncomfortable pull out couch This was not mentioned to us when booking I had asked for three single beds and not once was it mentioned that one of these beds would be a couch As well as this there was no tourist information in the foyer so we had to guess where to go to eat sight see The biggest issue was the price and the pullout bed Too expensive for a average hotel , The hotel is big and spacious with modern decor The pool area is nice although a little small The bathroom in the hotel room was beautiful with a bath on one side and a large walk in waterfall shower on the other side There was a turn down service every evening where chocolates were left beside the bed this was a nice touch 
402411,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Stayed in room 148 overlooked a side street very noisy at night repeatedly woken up Bathroom although large and spacious had no shower curtain water went everywhere Gym is literally three machines running cycling walking , Great location very central for seeing Barcelona Good mix of cafes bars and restaurants in the area Main area is very clean bright and comfortable 
402412,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Nothing really but if I was being picky although it was great to have a bar fridge in the room it was a bit small Also 60 euros for breakfast 2 adults 2 children is too much so we ended up going elsewhere , Bed was huge and very comfortable Drinks and food was reasonably priced Although fairly small the Pool was warm and my kids loved playing in it There was also an ATM in the hotel so safe and convenient to withdraw money 
402413,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, No comment everything was amazing , The breakfast was incredible Something for everybody including children Champagne and Bloody Mary s much appreciated I requested a quiet room and windows it was perfect The bed was so comfortable we didnt want to go home 
402414,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Staff need to check terraces more a lot of litter from rooms above The picture of the pool is the largest of the 3 by far Very expensive even taking into account location , A brilliant central location great to relax in 
402415,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The extra bed wasn t comfortable at all though , Everything was great especially that the room was spacious The location was amazing 2min walking away from Pla a Catalunya 
402416,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The room was smaller than appeared in the picture SPA was under construction Device at the pool very slow, The staff wS friendly location is very good Everywhere was clean
402417,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The spa wasn t working on the busiest time of the year The private pool wasn t heated A bit too expensive for what was offering on the junior suite, Very comfy bed The staff allowed us for a late check out for an extra hour 
402418,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The drinks and food in the bar are quite expensive in comparison to drinks and food in bars and restaurants around the area , The bed was huge and very comfortable In general the room was gorgeous and super clean The terrace is fabulous it has a pool with sun loungers a bar which serves food also and bigger wicker chairs which you can lie on The staff were very friendly and very helpful The hotel is in a central location within walking distance of passaig de Garcia train station which made it easy to get to from the airport We also travelled outside the city and this made that possible All in all we would definitely stay here again when we revisit Barcelona 
402419,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The BED Too shaky and you can feel the mattress springs under you There is no parking close by or suggestions on where to find parking when booking the hotel , Excellent location to move around popular parts of the city The staff were very friendly and helpful 
402420,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Nothing to complain about at all , Great hotel very friendly staff you feel very welcome from the time you arrive to the time you leave Happy to assist with any questions or assistance you require Good size rooms and very large comfy beds Great location right near Las Ramblas very easy to get around Always felt safe Did not want to leave thoroughly enjoyed our stay can t wait to go back

402422,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Almost everything else the service was very poor and this ruined my holiday My rubbish from the bins in my room and bathroom were not cleared for 4 days my children s bed was never made room service would just roll the sofa bed up with an unmade bed with previous days crumbs and dirty sheets I called room service and no response in the end I had to go to the reception The management of this hotel is of a low standard they didn t even seem concerned that I didn t enjoy my stay and that I had a bad stay , The pool facilities
402423,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Our first room had the toilet behind a glass door next to the shower which had an open floor plan to the bedroom I preferred the privacy of our second room where the bathroom was down a hallway and separated from the bedroom by a door , Friendly staff Hotel just 2 blocks from Las Rambles the heart of the city 
402424,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Food was over priced and shower head could ve been better also spa was closed for refurbishment , The staff were very welcoming and polite they upgraded us to a room with a king size bed and pool view as was my boyfriends 21st which was great it s very posh and the staff make you feel special leading you to your room and explaining everything you need to Very central and near shops restaurants and various public transport Always a guard at the front of hotel making you feel safe Cleaners also come in twice a day It also said check in at 2 but they let us check in at midday
402425,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Although the choice was very plentiful for Breakfast it was only on our third day that they pointed out that they had got bacon They also had not liaised well with the desk as they told us we had not booked for breakfast even though we had paid for it on arrival it was very quickly rectified , The staff were exceptional pleasant the position of hotel is superb so close to all amenities had to leave the windows closed at night because of noise but did not expect anything else in centre of city so more than satisfied would recommend this hotel without hesitation

402428,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The spa steam was not working and the water cooler was empty and there were no cups Our children were not allowed in the indoor pool despite there being no age limit in the literature Even so there was another little girl around 6 years old in the pool when we questioned the staff they shrugged and said they hadn t seen her get in and so she could stay there , The restaurant was good

402436,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The gym only had 4 pieces of equipment the spa facilities difficult to locate and not available until 11am, The hotel was in a great location with excellent sized comfortable well equipped rooms The employees could not do enough to make our stay great 
402437,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The noise from the adjacent rooms the hallway the lower main street and the loud water system toilet flushing from next door and taps from next door could be heard VERY CLEARLY kept me awake all night It got so bad the second night I checked out early and slept on a couch in reception, Staff facilities cleanliness
402438,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Wasn t too sure about my guests room as it may not have been the double superior as I asked for Also the the overhead shower did not work Only set back otherwise excellent, The staff were most excellent n and very accommodating They clearly maintain a high standard of care n professionalism It is a hotel I will come to again n suggest to famy n friends Keep up the smiles n care 
402439,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I think they require gowns and slip on slippers If order room service in mornings have to get dressed or wrap a towel around oneself which isn t that great either No much cupboard space for a couple Too few hangers too No porter to help you into hotel with bags from taxi Only once inside do they only take your bags up to the room , Stayed there often Position superb 
402440,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Breakfast was too expensive did not have it Spar was really good apart from 3 young kids playing in the swimming pool unattended spoilt the relaxation No chillled water after steam or sauna There was no information leaflets on local entertainment or things to do, We loved everything The rooms are outstanding loved it and the bed was so comfortable The staff are really helpful and friendly 
402441,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, Excellent customers service It was my girlfriends birthday I arrived to a bottle of champagne and received a fruit plate and fresh water the next day 
402442,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Heated pool was not heated body temperature is 37 and the pool is 30 spent a lot of money to have a heated pool only to look at it cause it was absolutely freezing Weather may have been poor but if it is heated like the advertisement says that shouldn t be a problem Staff weren t too helpful when I tried to bring this up with them I work in a 4 hotel and we would have done more to reimburse a custom for their dissatisfaction over a mistake we made in advertising It s false advertising and I expected more to compensate, The location
402443,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The room was comfortable but had a sewer smell that was very offending The tiles on the walls of the bathroom had old soap scum and they don t even try to clean that The tile is black and it is noticeable Parking space is very limited, Staff
402444,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, No comment, The staff were so friendly and helpful We were upgraded to a room with a terrace at no extra cost The room included free access to the spa that had a Turkish bath sauna and jacuzzi which were all amazing They also offer treatments at a cost The location was great lots to do and see Easy access from and to airport for 5 90 each way Loved so much will definitely be returning 
402445,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We ordered a room for three adults and I specifically asked for three beds Yet one of the beds was an uncomfortable folding sofa , Location is amazing staff is super friendly Breakfast is very expensive yet worth it a lot of very good food 
402446,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, When booking my search was specifically for a central hotel with parking provided The booking said parking is possible on site reservation is not needed and costs Euro24 per day However when we arrived having to leave the car in a loading bay the receptionist seemed surprised we wanted parking and could only direct us to nearby public parking buildings costing either 30 or 50 euros per day , Beautiful large room great looking modern feel incredibly good location and very friendly staff 
402447,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Although we paid 800 there was no breakfast included The hotel was very hot all the time and aircon was required which meant I couldn t sleep due to the noise not what I expected in Spsin in Winter, The rooms were comfortable
402448,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Only criticism is there was now shower curtain for a bath shower so bathroom got very wet , Excellent location within a stones throw from main Canalunia Sq and La Rambles Staff were very friendly and most helpful Bed was extremely comfortable and very quiet room 
402449,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The spa facilities were a little outdated and children unsupervised but it was later in the day staff had obviously clocked off However we didn t book this for the the spa but the location , The position was excellent and staff really friendly
402450,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The house keepers made very loud noises and slammed door at 9am when they cleaned up the other rooms , Excellent location very friendly and helpful people working there Room is adequate for 3 people in triple room Bathroom is large and clean

402453,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Position of mirror for making up in bathroom made it difficult to get ready Staff seemed jaded Heated discussion from management whilst we and other guests were eating Not particularly customer focused Didn t feel like the hotel had a heart More suited to business Would not think to return Hotel was a bit of a rabbits warren , Best nights sleep in a long while Bed superior to other hotels 5 included Shower brilliant Location good Breakfast was extremely good and coffee superb 
402454,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Quieter room due to large parties of young people making lots of noise during the night s , Great location attentive helpful staff family room very good 
402455,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, Amazing rooms with excellent views Friendly helpful staff nothing too much trouble little luxuries like robes and slippers and a coffee machine that made the stay even more enjoyable 
402456,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Lack of basic things should be in the room Slippers ear buds complimentary water at least were all missing Things you find in a less rated hotels for free , Location staff excellent Wifi was great

402458,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The service was poor and slow both at reception and the lobby bar , The position was perfect being a short walk to La Ramblas Our room was large and comfortable 
402459,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Not the quietest of hotels You could here every movement inside the hotel We was a staying on the first floor and you could here everything above us even when somebody was having a shower it felt like heavy rainfall , Great location staff were very friendly and helpful 
402460,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Very disappointed that the pool was closed Breakfast choice great apart from the cooked items these were cold and the plates were cold Quite pricey for the breakfast too, Lovely hotel great room very handy for walking around Barcelona
402461,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Pool area was out of service due to repair work however weather was cool and not swimming conditions We were offered a roof top pool with the hotel across the road if required This information was given when checking in which was very positive by the hotel staff team This was not an issue for us and not a dislike , The staff team were very friendly and helpful on arrival and through out the stay All staff team were able to assist with all enquires and sights to visit and best ways to travel around Breakfast was great 
402462,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Breakfast and hotel bar was too expensive and not good value for money Swimming pool and spa did not open till 11 00 AM which is too late as we wanted to have a swim in the morning We booked this hotel with swimming in mind , Location
402463,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I emailed a few weeks before my trip an asked for an earlier check in as we were landing in Barcelona at 10am I couldn t get the early check in and had to wait until 3pm Although the hotel did take our bags until we checked in This did not take away from our love of the hotel, Very friendly staff clean great location and room serviced every day 
402464,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, As we realised on check in we had no breakfast pre booked thought the hotel rate of 19 per person a bit steep There are however lots of good options nearby Thought receptionists could have been a bit more helpful on what to do and see in Barcelona, Room was comfortable Hotel is exceptionally well positioned
402465,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Terrace bar closed not warned about this Private heated pool could have been warmer Room 112 was starting to look shabby, Hotel very nice generally staff were excellent location was brilliant 
402466,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, The location was excellent and the staff gave us good recommendations for restaurants Easy to get a taxi and the lobby was very nice We walked to the restaurants nearby and many places were just a ten minute walk 
402467,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Dissapounting and disgusting Booking com is not notifying you that you have to make full prepayment For almost 2k per week no bath robes or sleepers were includede Cleaning ladies do nothing t speak English and not cleaning rooms and changing beds We had a tea pot that stayed in the room for the whole week and no one ever removed it it is not a four star hotel Dont use it , Nothing 
402468,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Finding the hotel s name was difficult as one can only see the name once one is across the road only , The receptionist Natalia was very helpful and extremely pleasant Very welcoming reception staff Towels were changed regularly Nice that I could walk across to get the bus from and to the airport 
402469,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I should have liked the spa to be open before 11am and a little heat in the outdoor pool would have been appreciated , Everything was excellent All requests were met twin room high floor quiet room etc Breakfast was brilliant and staff were very helpful and friendly Spa was great Wonderful location 
402470,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, Comfortable well appointed and spacious room Extensive breakfast options of hot and cold choices fresh fruit juices and pastries Staff knowledgeable and helpful with local information Central convenient location for maximizing your Barcelona experience on a short stay Perhaps not the hotel for those traveling on a budget 
402471,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Allocated family room small despite paying GBP 350 per night w o breakfast Given a room with twin beds no view Requested a double bed Reluctantly changed to a similar sized room air con not working very uncomfortable Eventually day 3 put in a size of family room the 350 per night justified , Clean modern hotel Reasonable location just off The Ramblas 
402472,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The basement part of the house was complicated The fitness room was a disappointment , Breakfast was excellent and the bed was quite good The festival of the giants was an unexpected extra just outside the window 
402473,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Little things like only having two cups for coffee in a triple room our son is 14 and wants his coffee too A tiny amount of milk too hardly enough for one let alone three For a very expensive hotel it seemed unnecessarily stingy Paying around 300 euros for our room per night we also felt that breakfast should be free or much more reasonable , We loved the location right in the heart of Barcelona with bustling streets right outside the window Our triple room was a great size and beds very comfortable Lovely bathroom too A little chilly to make use of the pool unfortunately Great wi fi which was important to us and especially our teenage son 
402474,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, The amenities prime location breakfast included with the booking of our room Loved this hotel hope to be back soon to your wonderful city Barcelona Had way too much fun love the people food culture Thanks for making our stay so welcoming 
402475,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, It s a shame that the pool isn t heated as it made it less pleasant to use even in early October I hope they can address this in the future D, You can t get a better location to stay in Bacrelona so central to everything and close to shops The hotel is perfect for families offering 5 person room pool with bar spa terrific breakfast and importantly good wifi Staff are very helpful 
402476,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The breakfast was too expensive and therefore we didn t eat it Also the dinner menu was limited for choices Overall the hotel was a bit expensive so I probably won t return which is too bad because the hotel was nice , The staff were very friendly and the location was excellent 
402477,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, fantastic location quality rooms and sensational service from check in to check out Big thank you to Nare Jessica Stefan the wonderful breakfast host and one of the best cocktail bartenders we have every encountered Christian Definitely the place to stay when you are in Barcelona
402478,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I had hoped to charge the meal I had in the restaurant to my room but this did not appear possible Although it provides a number to ring to reserve a table in the restaurant again when I tried to do this it was not possible However the food in the restaurant was excellent , The staff were great helpful and friendly The room was comfy
402479,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Restaurant not very good mostly empty Breakfast room ok Reception staff very helpful Excellent central position so could eat out , Rooms very good sun deck pool good Very good housekeeping
402480,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Breakfast was good and the waiters are very friendly but the variety of the breakfast could be better , Nice room and clean room Comfortable bed Friendly staff
402481,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, One of the beds was very stiff and each elevator reaches only certain floors and that is frustrating, Breakfast was great location is amazing close to everything 
402482,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, our toilet broke wouldnt flush but only on the last couple of days , The staff were great and very helpful Location was excellent and not far to get to anything 
402483,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Set up of the floor and how to get there is a bit difficult Lifts dont go to all rooms Although we were very late arrivals I asked them to set out the room keys in alphabetical order with the welcome drinks at the dinner venue but this was not done When I arrived all the room keys were handed to me and it was chaos in the small foyer with the luggage and 33 people and me trying to give room keys to people Otherwise it was ok Gracias , Rooms were lovely and big Food was good very expensive for a buffet for South Africans Burger patties were undercooked But otherwise it was good for a quick one night stop Location was excellent for Las Ramblas 
402484,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Breakfest price is high , Great location nice SPA Very nice rooms The room was cleaned twice a day The suff are very freindly and helpfull It was my second visit in this hotel Very recomnded hotel 
402485,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Lovely roof pool although not a lot of sun beds around pool if busy , Lovely staff location and hotel Room terrace with pool ideal Great relaxation area for girls trip for a few drinks by the dip pool 
402486,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Toilets a little dirty by the pool Slow service by barman at the pool expensive drinks at the hotel bar , Gluten free options at breakfast friendly staff cleanliness of room Facilities were perfect for our needs 
402487,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The food in the bars and restaurants outside of the hotel my friend has got a nut allergy so even harder to find good food , The beds were very comfortable and the room was spacious and all very clean hotel couldn t do enough to make sure that you were happy and it was an excellent location in the heart of everything Almost forgot the breakfast in the hotel was very lovely 
402488,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The price was a bit high for the original single room that we booked Although we were upgraded to a suite I felt the price point we paid was more in alignment for a suite This could also be because of location or that fact the we where staying for one night prior to cruise ship sailing , The staff was exceptional and very friendly They made every effort to assure that my room arrangements were comfortable enough to sleep 4 people by upgrading us to a suite at no additional charge We forgot that the hotel only accepts Euro and not USA currency for payments They waited patiently while my husband went to the exchange window to convert dollars While we waited a lovely gentleman brought us expresso and tea while we relaxed in the comfortable lounge area The suite was nicely appointed and the best surprise was the private pool accessible from each bedroom Prime location just minutes from Las Ramblas by foot 
402489,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Late check in after 3 pm and we arrived early morning and we request before that The really bad air conditioning even after fixing Delay in receiving our luggage No ironing availability with daily request Adding to the bill items from the mini par that we didn t use it Breakfast with no changes all the days, The size of the room was great for family Tawels availability
402490,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, When I booked I selected a twin room and thought because I d searched for 2 people that this was what I got It said 1080 for twin room so I booked Then on checking it said that I could only have one person It would cost extra 220 for the second person I felt this was not required as the room was a twin room We paid it but would ve preferred not to pay the 2nd person supplement Maybe this was my mistake but it was frustrating dealing with the hotel directly trying to resolve it by email Sangria jugs by the pool are nice but we both thought they weren t very strong so a bit of a waste of money go for the cocktails instead , Quite big room x lge King single beds lovely pool area pool bar excellent location 2min walk from La Ramblas 20 min to Casa Battlo and La Pedrera 4min walk to metro 
402491,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Check in time 3pm wasn t too bad as they have luggage storage so you can explore No iron in the room Not enough sun beds around the pool area , Best location to be central in the heart of las Ramblas Perfect for shopping bars restaurants etc Right next to plaza catalunya and other main attractions close by Swimming pool is an okay size plus the spa facilities Will definitely stay here again when coming back to Barcelona 
402492,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Bad air conditions and bad room service The hotel doesn t have an qualified air condition also the staf specially christen v bad She doesn t have us an iron device she told us the device subjected to availability we requested iron device since 3 day and we don t revived it Bad hotel bad staff,No Positive
402493,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Consider the living cost of Barcelona the price of this hotel is somwwhat expensive The size of the swimming pool cannot really let you swim Other than that we would definately recommend to others and stay with them again , The location breakfast and staff are all very good 
402494,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, Stayed with parents in a Triple Room The rooms are not very spacious the bathroom is big and nice and includes all amenities but are clean with comfy beds and linens It is also well equipped with tea coffee facilities in room Air con works very good The staff are very friendly and helpful and the hotel is clean Location is excellent as its just a stones throw away from La Ramblas Hop on Hop off bus and the metro Around the area there are wide variety of restaurants bars shops within walking distance There is a Starbucks right opposite the hotel and there is a Vodaphone just about 2 mins walk from the hotel It is a short distance from the airport and should not cost more than 30 euros Spa gym and pool access included but unfortunately did not have the time to enjoy them It was a short but lovely stay and I would recommend this hotel Ask for a room with a pool view 
402495,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Way over priced Check in was very disorganized Asking for late check out was a nightmare to say the least , Location was good great shower wifi and bed
402496,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, According to their site on booking com there is avalibale parking and no need for reservation but when we arrived the parking was full We had to go for more expensive and far parking not fair , Great location nice rooms good breakfast with many varities
402497,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The service and quality and value for money has unfortunately been going down Apparently there is no more tissue in the rooms They give guests the bad rooms first when you ask for something no one follows up on it unless you go to the reception and make it an issue Cards don t always work Water is strange and feels like it doesn t ask off your hands It first I thought it was the soap but turns out it s the water Advice Stay somewhere else , The location 
402498,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The only thing is the room smells bad Really don t like it , Really good location Have swimming pool which is cool for summer time The staffs are helpful and patient Recommend it 
402499,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The triple sharing room no 425 was very small and cramped The shower water cannot drained and water overflows Even after many requests to look into this problem nothing was done ,No Positive
402500,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, My boyfriend and I went to the spa at various times throughout the day and each and every time there was a sign there that said Please do not disturb Doing a massage in the back But the sign literally never moved I m convinced only one person was on shift both days or something because whomever was never at the desk I also had trouble with room service To order pizza and it took an hour of our request for an hour to be fulfilled So getting things done in a timely fashion when it comes to room service wasn t the best , The location of the hotel is great It is very close to Las Ramblas about 5 mins walking distance and there are plenty of restaurants and shops around The bed was a nice size big and comfortable The shower is bigger than my walk in closet I m not even joking The staff at at reception were all very enthusiastic and helpful They have someone posted at the entrance at all times to call a taxi for hotel guest They halted a taxi for us at 3 a m so we could catch our early morning flight I also enjoyed the bar and lounge areas All very nice 
402501,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Front desk very busy and wait sometimes was long for assistance , Location was ideal Central but not too hectic Room was very comfortable and quiet Junior suite was fabulous Staff helpful helped us get football tickets Overall highly recommend 
402502,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I picked the hotel specifically because it had parking When we arrived we were told it was full and to park in the multi storey close by This was ok but when we collected our car having already checked out we were charged 98 for two days parking There was no offer from the hotel to even contribute to this This did spoil what was otherwise a great stay , The location is brilliant at the top of the ramblas The pool is not huge but perfect for cooling off after sight seeing and our kids loved it There is a nice pool bar where we all enjoyed lunch The staff were helpful and welcoming 
402503,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, There wasn t wifi connection in the room as on the hotel description only in the lobby One morning there wasn t water in the tap One day fire alarm worked but there wasn t any trouble Hotel reception personnel didn t allow for late check out but there was enough available rooms in that day , Location 
402504,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, No one seemed to have a clue as far as room service was concerned We were transferred around in circles and still never got the food in the end , The breakfast is worth a mention as there was great choice and the staff were especially pleasant and helpful 
402505,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The location is very noisy I had real trubbles having some rest in the night The price was very high for example they will charge you with 19 euros for one breckfast They also charged me with 10 euros for checking out 1 hour after 12 a clock and not to mention that if you take something from the minibar they try to put thinghs on your bill that you haven t consumed for example they ve put one wiskey on my bill and charged me with 5 euros I don t drink wiskey so I figured out Overall it was a big disappointment this hotel and to be honest their last star from their four stars doesn t shine very much I don t recommend it , The room was big 
402506,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Leaving, Fantastic hotel Great location Lovely rooms attentive staff Nice pool with comfortable loungers and seats and big parasols Would definitely go again 
402507,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Allowing smoking and glasses in the pool This is a health and safety risk And children should not be exposed to people smoking whilst In the swimming pool , The rooms were spacious and the staff were so friendly 
402508,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Check in was rather slow but the gentleman who eventually attended to us was friendly I sent an email a week before arriving requesting a room facing the back road of the hotel which I did not get I was told it was fully booked Those rooms are best as they are quite huge comfortable and quieter It really gives you the feel of city living in Barcelona The room I was given was facing the pool It was so small and tiny which isn t worth the money spent A bit disappointing but okay , I love the location of this hotel I have stayed here 6 times already and couldn t ask for a better central location 
402509,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, If you need parking book it in advance , Very friendly staff Good sized rooms Great location Metro right outside Just off the Ramlas and Placa de Catalunya
402510,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, the air conditioning did not work well not even after it was fixed Housekeeping is pretty slow something I am not used to , The idea of inroom pool in suite hotel gave complimentary drinks in room even though I don t take alcohol its a sweet gresture 
402511,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, 1 The room we received was different to the one we have seen as family room on booking When we asked management said that there are 2 types of family rooms and we got what we paid for 2 We asked to stay 1 night longer and staff said that this was not possible because the hotel was fully booked We subsequently tried it on booking and we got availability for a family room , Location breakfast They gave us an extra bed without charge 
402512,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Maybe the cleaners can be a little more quieter when cleaning in the morning They can get quite loud or its just the thin walls , The staff were very helpful and willing to go out of their way to make sure I was happy After a lot of confusion with my airbnb I quickly needed a place to stay for the night that was close to where I was already The booking process was simple enough but I guess I was a few minutes too late as a large number of families checked in just before me Andrea at the desk was very apologetic and made my check in very quick and simple If it wasn t for her and Ronel going out of their way I would still have been very flustered Would definitely recommend this hotel and I would come back again for the location and the top service 
402513,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, in my room newer part smell cigarets water flowed from the wall I told about this in reception a few times but during whole week staff can t do anything It is two or two and half star hotel , localization beds breakfast staff during breakfast very kind and helpful
402514,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, Service with a smile and nothing was too much for the Receptionists Guillen especially went out of his way to look after us as we had arrived far too early at hotel 
402515,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Nothing it was all great , This is a great hotel right in the centre of Barcelona The staff there are lovely very friendly and helpful The pool area is a good size lots of beds to lie on around the pool and also in the outside bar area both in the shade and the sun Loved the covered outside eating area which sprayed cooling mist at intervals There is also a spa which looked lovely but we didn t have the time to make use of it Lots of seating areas dotted around the hotel too We had a problem with a leaky shower which was fixed immediately so no complaints there The marble flooring throughout made the interior lovely and cool all the time There was lots of choice at breakfast and dinner in the Pelai restaurant was fabulous We would definitely come back 
402516,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Pool was smaller than it looked No parking was available at hotel Parking was over 35 euro a night at location recommended by hotel staff, Staff was excellent
402517,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Very slow check in and service Dirty room No ventilation in bathroom No toilet brush Noisy air conditioning Poor wifi in our room Room service was just linked to two takeaways services locally sushi and pizza Expensive , Location Size of room Bathroom Use of facilities before and after check in out Pool and relaxing area
402518,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The only issue I had was having to buy a swimming cap to use the spa pool really strange my hair was up and I wasn t planning on putting my head under while using the Jacuzzi I decided not to use it which is a shame as it looked really nice But it didn t detract from the hotel overall , This hotel was lovely really good location lovely helpful staff clean and modern with great facilities The beds were comfy and the bathroom was spacious There was a cute little outdoor swimming pool which was a real bonus with small children 
402519,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Price expensive Hotel layout confusing rooms and hotel dark Front desk always busy had to wait , Extremely comfortable beds Nice pool area but small 
402520,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Room was pour in disabled and wheelchair did not fit in room given and could not get into the shower as you gave one over the bath All our clothes were damp in the room the room was not cleaned on one occasion despite asking the staff did not bring drinks we ordered at the pool and we had to ask 3 times The second too the tv be safe did not work and again it did not get cleaned regularly At breakfast the out us where the wheelchair did not fit We spoke to staff but no one changed anything this was expensive when it was booked due to the access for the wheelchair and then the wheelchair user could not use half the facilities We were put on the second floor and the lift again was too small for the wheelchair, Location was excellent
402521,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The swimming pool was very small and the gym had only three cardio machines , The location was excellent Few minutes away from the famous Las Ramblas Safe area and close to main metro station 
402522,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, bad smell in the room staff provides me a room without cleaning up and someone is still staying there Wallet get stolen at their storage room Bad experience not recommend ,No Positive
402523,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The money in my wallet was stolen by their luggage guy during my stay It was about 500US dollars I asked for extending one night of stay and asked the front desk to move my baggage to the new room However the money in my wallet was disappear after I received my backpack It was a bad experience also there is always a bad smell in the room ,No Positive
402524,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Check in process was very difficult long and late Room was only available from 3pm not 2pm as stated on booking Some staff had a poor attitude, Great location breakfast shower and sun terrace small pool 
402525,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, If you dont eat much at breakfast you dont need to include breakfast you save the money for some drinkd or else outside, Nice room Perfect beds Good place for shopping and drinks 
402526,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Impersonal staff at fromt desk They were nice but it was very much a tourist place to stay and they were too busy checking people in and out and if conversing they seemed to rush , Bar area lobby Also the spa was nice but sadly not working The steam room was down and attendant said it was missing a part I wa surprised no urgency was placed on fixing Was there 5 days and no one worked on even after I requested the service 
402527,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I did not like how the management handled my complient I have especially asked for a king size bed there were a drop box that let me choose which bed i should take for 2 rooms After arriving in the hotel they asked that i have to pay the full amount upfront before staying which is not very common Anyways i did not complain and i said ok They gave us the key and let us take our bags to the rooms As we were entered the room one of us got a king size bed and i got a twin bed room I went to the hotel reception and i told them that there is a mistake i choose a king size bed online They did not mention anything about based on availability So i said i am sorry the reason why i choose two rooms instead of one for me and my friend is to actually have a king size bed And what really angered me is that they took everything upfront without even telling me that there is no king size bed so i would ve canceled it and share a room with my friend So i told the receptionist that i want to speak to the manager she said there is no one he already left I m like well if he is gone than you are in charge She said no im not than i m again saying who is she said no one is in charge So i asked if i could talk to the manager she went for a bit and came with the most ridiculous offer i quote her Well since there is no king size room i would like to offer you a different room with a higher price i m like are you serious instead of compensating me your offer me to pay extra Than again with a rude looks and her colleagues came trying to convince me to stay in a twin bed room without even letting me cancel my room and share the second room with my friend After 30 minutes she said she will call her manager which i think was inside but did not want to talk to me Saying we found a room for you and she handed me the key with a very bad manners Anyways i took the keys and stayed in my room , I liked the location and the rooms
402528,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The hotel lacks a concierge desk and when we arrived no staff or trolley were immediately available to pick up our luggage and check in was slow, The family room was spacious and had lot of beds and the hotel was clean much cleaner than other 4 star hotels in barcelona also really liked the fact that there is a vending machine at the lobby
402529,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Asked for a quiet room and I could still here street noise Air con only really cooled a small area of the room the pillows on the bed weren t very comfortable I felt they looked better than they were comfy , The shower was amazing The pool is nice but small so can get crowded quickly on hot days Poolside service is awesome 
402530,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, We loved this hotel The facilities were great the staff and the service were excellent and the location was fantastic We didn t eat at the the hotel so can t speak for the food but everything else was top notch We had booked a family room but when we checked in there wasn t one available We were given 2 rooms instead which was a real bonus for us as we were travelling with teenagers It couldn t have been better 
402531,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Check in takes half an hour Especially if it is a lady by the name of Cristina Very Unwelcoming attitude Hotel charges you at check in ridiculous Than at check out they charge you the extras They gave us a room with the window facing a pool bar The tv was broken and eventhough they said they would fix it they did not Overrated touristic hotel , Nothing i liked nothing about the hotel 
402532,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Strange sloshing water noise through night Like pipes from a toilet above or air condition spoiled our sleep Local area is business like rather than touristy , Room was excellent Very clean and modern Great bathroom Blackout curtains 
402533,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We booked a triple room for 280 per night This turned out to be a twin with an extra bed there was enough space but it wasn t as spacious as we d have liked for the money There were ants in our room not lots but I think they might have become a problem if you left food lying around or made a lot of crumbs , The staff were pleasant and helpful The hotel location was great just a few steps from the Pl Catalunya and Las Ramblas and the Metro station 
402534,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The hotel cheated us by giving us a triple room which was much smaller than the pictures Extremely slow check in process With very few exceptions staff not very friendly , Good location
402535,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, No door on toilet a trendy bathroom design which denies this basic privacy and had nowhere to hang wet towels etc , Good soundproofing in the middle of a busy part of town Great location close to the old part of town 
402536,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Unable to check in at specified time No customer service rude front of house staff Room not cleaned properly even after delayed check in Stayed in Catalonia catalunya the week before wonderful can t believe it s the same chain , Location good lovely pool area 
402537,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, What can I say This hotel was amazing The staff were the most helpful I have ever come across They went out of their way to accommodate our every needs We arrived early in the morning from a cruise ship and were checked in straight to our room We had a late flight out and for a small fee we were able to check out at 6 00pm The room was great big clean and modern Fab facilities and a great location My kids also loved the free wifi Would definitely recommend this hotel

402539,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The only real area of concern was the checkout process There were only 2 staff handling checkout check in in the late morning which meant it took some time waiting in the queue , The location was excellent close to transport the Old Town and many cafes We had a large room on the 4th floor with a huge king bed overlooking the pool but it was very quiet The pool bar was a nice place to have a drink after a long day of sightseeing The porter staff were excellent 
402540,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Parking faciliteit Although advertised with hotel parking faciliteit this is not easy as onze would expect Had to ask at the receptioniste several times to get this arranged They have have max 7 places Do not list as hotel with parking please , Nice place Good location friendly staf
402541,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Very poor maintenance We stayed in Madrid and Malaga before coming to Barcelona This was the most expensive amongst our hotels Had booked a superior room with terrace and private pool And a superior triple room for kids The filter was not working in the pool and it was dirty The water from the shower was leaking into the bedroom The kids room was large and spacious but stinking of cigarettes despite being a non smoking room Had to shift to standard rooms and getting a refund from the hotel was a challenge Sadly could not find any other hotels and had paid for the rooms upon check in Otherwise would have changed my hotel The reception staff was quite decent They had allocated us their best rooms but the cleaning staff does not do their jobs It is a very busy hotel with lots of people checking in and out Service needs substantial improvement , Location was average Property looks better on websites than actual 
402542,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I did the reservation and when I reach the hotel the lay they says your reservation is cancelled cause you didn t put your visa details I didn t recived any email says that what I received only the confermation after that the transfer me to another Barcelona cathedral it coast me 2 hours to reach the room between the two hotels finally I reach my room on 10pm the day after the call me And shout me to leave the room with out any late check out bad staff and bad hotel,No Positive

402545,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, 19 Euro for breakfast was asking a lot when you are already paying 120 per person per night even if it is a 4 star hotel in the heart of the city So we went to the various cafe s around for breakfast each day for half the cost for example there is a Costa across the road Travelling with teenagers means this turns out to be a bonus as they can have a lie in without having to get up for breakfast We did have an issue when we arrived with the room types doubles vs twins but the hotel management and reception staff did resolve it not easy given the challenge of a full hotel which turned a negative start back to a positive Overall as a typical middle class family with elder kids I would not pay the extra you do to book 4 star hotel in the heart of a major city again as I think that puts expectations of service levels into your head that is difficult for any hotel to match maybe The whole experience ends up being a neutral whatever feeling Hope this makes sense you never walk away feeling it was value for money Overall to me the Catalonia Ramblas was a bit better than ok a bit below being good , The beds were extremely comfortable The pool area was a nice area to relax the pool itself is really only big enough for kids The location was of course fantastic being literally steps from the Ramblas

402587,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, As other reviewers have described the front desk needs help and training in dealing with guests The male staff was uncooperative and impatient frequently long lines and the hotel demanded payment for the entire stay on check in which I refused although I did charge the first night s stay At a later date in the stay my room key no longer worked because the front desk informed me I owed them money and would not issue a new room key until I had paid in full , The room and its amenities were very good breakfast was excellent except for the line up at the coffee machines bellmen and cleaning staff were friendly and helpful Enjoyed my superior room with private pool Noeli at the front desk was most courteous and pleasant

402590,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Check in was a nightmare we spent 1 hour the receptionist was so slow They didn t have the booking price and asked to pay double price We asked them to call a taxi with a baby seat and they were not able to do it as apparently you need to order it four hours in advance , great location
402591,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Check in was horrible Make staff was very rude Very very disappointed Even after booking a suite we were given a room at 5 pm And when we asked politely why you delaying they answered what can we do no room Horrible experience not worth it, We made a mistake won t be coming back Not worth iit Just a 3 star hotel charging like a 5 star

402608,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I specifically booked this hotel because there were three of us going and the hotel offered 3 single beds as opposed to 2 singles and a sofa bed The room we got was noisy swimming pool area under construction and we got 2 singles and a sofa bed We were moved to another room but this time the spare bed had no blankets or pillows we highlighted this on our way out for the evening but they sill were not there on our return The guy at reception said there was nothing he could do housekeeping was gone home We told him to leave the blankets and pillow on the bed and we would make it ourselves we highlighted the problem at reception the next day but I m afraid despite a good will gesture of a bottle of cava we could not recommend this hotel Another evening we asked for room service and again there was a problem with that so we didn t bother , I liked the location of the hotel

402613,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, After a very noisy 1st night that was nothing to do with the staff they were very sympathetic towards us and without hesitation relocated us to a beautifully quiet room and were wonderful throughout the whole of the rest of our visit We thank them all very much for turning what could have been a bit of a nightmare into a brilliant holiday 
402614,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, the room was in the first floor to much noise and my request was quite room in the upper floor the room amenities was for one person while my reservation was double room, yes but most of the food items containing pork

402620,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We ordered a junior suite with private pool We where told over the phone this had a separate room area where an extra bed for our daughter be set up Upon arrival at checkin this was once more confirmed by staff but after paying when entering the room this was not the case Instead of trying to find a resolution the staff seems to find pride in arguing with me which was not helpful In the end I spoke to a very polite front office manager who was unable to solve the problem but kindly tried to made amends by offering free perks like free breakfast and late checkout Service seems to be something the hotel needs to pick up on in general as when I tried to order room service a similar situation occurred again where seemingly in house room service was closed and staff spent so much time argumenting about this that they failed to effciciently direct me to external room service which then meanwhile also had closed strangely only 30 minutes after the internal one so no food after 2330 which is very strange in Spain In other news the general outdoor pool and restaurant where closed for refurbishing the private pool in the suite is not heated so to cold for use, Room standards where generally nice Breakfast was excellent

402631,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The d cor in the hotel is all dark wood panelling and I found this a little overpowering not only in the corridors but the rooms too We spent most of our time with the lights on and no natural light in our room Also didn t like the fact that they don t have their own restaurant for evening meals this is a restaurant open to the public although it is attached to the hotel Also the price of the breakfast is a little steep , The location for this hotel is excellent for Las Rambles and the staff are more than helpful Absolutely spotless hotel Lovely relaxed atmosphere Our view from our room overlooked the outdoor pool but as we stayed in January it was a little to cold to use it

402636,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, It was a terrible experience We got robbed as we were checking in at the reception desk There was no security guard at anytime nor doorman We had to wait for the General Manager to check the video cameras Clearly he could see how this thief went thru my purse in front of these hotel employees He said the hotel was not responsable for my stolen valuables It became very suspicious when both employees at the front desk claimed they did not see anything After seeing the thief in the video clearly we thought otherwise Afterwards I was sent to the Police Station to make a formal claim I do not recommend this chain of hotels ,No Positive
402637,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Housekeeping staff weren t exactly helpful Room service was not available one night staff had gone home early , Location was excellent Hotel room was very comfortable
402638,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Nothing comes to mind, Room was perfect for 3 of us Staff went above and beyond what was required but I have to single out Vitalik on reception as he was ultra helpful in locating parking with sufficient height for the van we drove down in 
402639,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The spa facility and the gym are quite small , Location it s possible to walk to a lot of places of interest The room was superb Service exceptional stuff was very friendly and helpful everywhere 
402640,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, No room service or food available when we returned late night but only a minor issue , Great location helpful friendly staff Good sized room for 3 with lovely wet room style bathroom Sound proofed patio doors so no sleep disturbance Swimming pool and spa facilities but we didn t have time to use them on this occasion 
402641,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The exterior of the hotel had a cracked window and let the overall appearance down , Everything was so worth it and the pictures lived up to the expectation 
402642,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, No parking available at the hotel However we got parking for 7 days for only 70 euro for the whole time , We Like the location and the service of the receiption staff
402643,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, No atmosphere In 4 day s no one even said good morning even Christmas Day the best we got was a nod Very sad Rooms have strange lay out glass doors to the loo weird and a huge sliding door to separate bathroom to bedroom too heavy to slide closed so no privacy Kettle in a cupboard so awkward to use and No drawers for clothes Would we go again No , Very central to playa Catalunya and bus to the airport Very clean modern hotel
402644,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, That we had to call housekeeping everyday for shower gel etc Rate did not include breakfast, Stay was great best location staff are knowledgeable always willing to help
402645,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, My laptop couldn t connect to wifi for a couple of days despite some very nice staff helping me I managed to finally get connected on my own but I had to change my internet link and I am not tech savvy , Very close to Las Ramblas and the Placa Catalunya where many tours originate and you can get lots of tourist information 
402646,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, payed for hotel with my company credit card asked receptionist for invoice to be made out to company name and address she seemed unwilling to do this i will be sending a complaint to hotel direct as I need this for my accounts records i know I booked in my own name but this should not matter,No Positive
402647,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The extra bed pull out sofa bed was very uncomfortable to sleep on I was surprised to see that we did not get what we had booked for which was 1 double bed and 1 single bed We instead got twin beds pushed together and a sofa cum bed The sofa bed was not actually a bed It was actually a very thin fold able mattress that gave me lower back pain after one nights sleep on it The three of us my parents and i ended up sleeping on the double bed which was luckily spacious enough for us three towards the end of our stay Would not recommend anyone above 20 to sleep on the extra bed , Location of the hotel was fantastic Staff were helpful and friendly 
402648,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, staff was very friendly room was clean and spacy we only stayed for a night but thoroughly enjoyed our stay i would definitely recomend this hotel as location is convenient as well close to la ramblas and good metro and airport connections
402649,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The check in process took a long time as there were not enough employees checking in the long line of arriving guests We could hear hallway noise through our door which wasn t a huge deal until the 2a m Saturday partiers next door hung out in the hall before entering their room I m not sure if this is a hotel known for partying but we also walked out to dinner past someone passed out on the floor outside our door at 7 p m These 2 incidences were not ideal and leave me feeling not enthused about the hotel , The location was great 2 blocks to the Placa Catalunya from which you can walk to many attractions or hop on one of the very close by metro lines Clean and very spacious rooms and bathroom 
402650,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I asked to be put on a top floor but we were put in a small room on ground floor for 2 adults and 2 children so cramped could not move us not good room raced a wall my sister had an enrols room for one person ridiculous, Staff were so helpful tried to accommodate a new room but failed very sorry
402651,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, All good apart from the fact we were expecting a bigger indoor pool , Staff were very friendly helpful Rooms were in immaculate condition very comfortable Location was excellent 
402652,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, N a, We booked a standard twin room It was huge with a separate hallway area into the bathroom It was beautiful The staff were incredibly helpful I m a very fussy person when it comes to hotels and this is one that I can t stop raving about to friends Will definitely return 
402653,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The restaurant is very warm which is slightly uncomfortable when eating, The staff couldn t do enough for us very helpful at all times Great room on the front of the hotel overlooking the hustle and bustle of the city with the bonus of a tiny balcony Huge Queen sized bed which was wonderful for my lovely big man Can t wait to come back again
402654,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I would not call it bad experience but the heating sistem did not work very well But it wasn t that bad , The staff is friendly and I liked that they all spoke very good english For me it was indeed a 4 star hotel The room was in good size and I liked that the tv has english programs as well and wi fi very good 
402655,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, I want to thank all the staff it was an amazing vacation It was really very nice stay at your hotel thank you all again great room great location great staff great service great great 
402656,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, I had an issue with the elevated noise levels in the rooms due to the hard wood flooring in the corridors and rooms as well A little carpeting would have helped reduce that noise , Excellent location and easily accessible via various modes of transport Staff were very helpful too 
402657,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Nothing all superb, The whole experience from start to finish was superb The special gift for my fiances birthday was a lovely touch Really excellent customer service
402658,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Nothing negative to say but when busy the bar service can get slow ran out of draught beer but it was after a Barcelona game, Great location really enjoyed my time wish it had of been warmer to use outside pool area but will return in warmer months
402659,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, The staff were very helpful from check in to asking directions large family room was clean and comfortable and everyone had a good nights sleep with no noise pollution 
402660,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, There was nothing I could fault I stayed therefore three nights so perhaps not long enough to find faults but genuinely a very nice hotel with friendly staff , I liked the location alot very easy to get around and all the main shops within walking distance Only around the corner from La Rambla which is very lively and alot of restaurants catering for many cuisines Metros are nearby The hotel was very clean and the room was a good standard with a mini balcony Although we were overlooking the main street there was minimal noise heard from the inside of the room as they had two sets of doors out onto the balcony 
402661,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Charged for milk for room 1 euro 80 for enough to make 4 small cups of coffee Thought this was really poo especially as we had to almost beg to get any milk at all , Nice room with terrace comfortable bed clean room great shower excellent location 
402662,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Bathroom always had a bad smell because of the old shower curtain Wonder why they could not replace it Reception was struggling to give me a room that i wanted had to wait for a long time to solve the problem Special thanks to Piotr who looked at my case and gave me the best deal for my stay , Liked the housekeeping It was done well on time Bed was comfortable 
402663,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, Excellent bathroom very comfortable beds The staff were really friendly and helpful from the front desk to the bartender to the housekeeping Great design in the room 
402664,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Some small drawers would have been useful in the bedroom and a plug point near to the mirror I did not want to plug electrical items in inside the bathroom The temperature of the room was not easy to control , The location near to La Rambla was excellent the hotel staff friendly and responsive and the room large and clean 
402665,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Thought maybe for the price the breakfast could be included , The hotel location is great The staff were amazing always willing to assist with any request and offer suggestions Would recommend 
402666,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The room was too warm despite the autumn weather end October 20 so we had to turn on the A C overnight and we ended up catching a cold The bathroom provides no privacy as the WC has a glass door that does not lock They could have as well put it between the beds We were not expecting to pay London prices in off season Barcelona , Very convenient location Helpful staff
402667,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, There is a free walking tour advertised at reception This is not free you are expected to tip the guide There is a lot if waiting around for other tourists to join the tour Would have been happy to pay but a bit dishonest it is advertised as free , Brilliant location quiet at night Staff helpful and friendly The breakfast is fabulous 
402668,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Smell of damp in the lower floors covered with strong perfume in the reception area We were given a room on the ground floor it had a strong smell of damp and the room was facing a space below the swimming pool area so that no daylight reached the room After complaining we got a new room on the third floor that was better , The location and the spa
402669,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The roof top pool was freezing even though the sun was shining and it was 21 degrees A heated pool would be great but then again it is October I m assured it s warmer in the summer , We booked two standard rooms But everything about this hotel would make me want to go back from the friendliness of the staff to their cannot do enough for you attitude the cleanliness of the rooms the breakfast and of course without saying the location 
402670,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Room was a bit on the noisy side Bathroom mildewy in corners We asked for three single beds but ended up with king and pullout couch We were too tired to complain but realized later that the place had nicer and quieter rooms , Location and friendliness of staff 
402671,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, The location is excellent for who wants to be near everything just a walk to las Ramblas and same for Catalonia square Very near to shopping area Staff is very receptive and warm 
402672,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The hotel is very large which I wouldn t mind but here is the problem when it is full it barely copes with the amount of guests it can accommodate It really does spoil the otherwise pleasant experience the restaurant at breakfast is so crowded that you have to wake up early to enjoy it the waiting time for check in and checkout at the reception easily exceeds 20 minutes the pool area is so tiny that getting a sunbed is a great struck of luck , The hotel has perfect location and very good facilities which also includes a pool Very handy during summer Breakfast is pretty good as long as you come early enough to avoid queuing The standard room was spacious and quite modern 
402673,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The food in the restaurant downstairs was so disappointing The staff were so professional , The front desk staff were fantastic always smiling and ready to help 
402674,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, If I had to complain then it would really only be the fact I was located on floor one adjacent to the patio area that could be slightly noisy But certainly not a complaint , Great location All staff I met were friendly helpful and had a smile 
402675,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The Reception staff were very slow in booking us in and did not give us their sole attention The lady on the hot breakfast counter never had the bacon on show and always got it from a cupboard underneath as though it were rationed , Plenty of armchairs in the downstairs lounge The evening meal was excellent although there was limited choice which put us off from returning 
402676,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Staff not as helpful as I would expect Asked to book a massage at the reception and was told this needed to be booked via spa but there were no staff at the spa No solution to this except to wait in the spa until someone turned up, Good facilities but general cleanilness not as great as you would like Great location
402677,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The spa was closed on the day of our stay and when we said the staff could have let us know were told that it s just one of those things and we couldn t expect it to be open even though this was part of why we booked The room had some wear and year and let down by small things such as no milk for coffee and some our toiletries being throw out by housekeeping The reception staff were not very helpful , The hotel has a great location and very comfortable beds in the room The outdoor terrace was nice although smaller than it appears in the photos Some friendly and helpful staff 
402678,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, The shower and toilets in the room didn t lock properly but that was the design of them , Pool was not too busy and had good facilities Very near the main areas of town and placa catalunya
402679,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Reception is always congested Needs more staffs in reception Prefered the water in pool private warm Helps when you come back after whole day , Excellent location Friendly staffs
402680,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, A lot No bath when advert said there would be 30 to have a bathrobe per day Had to pay our 600 before we had even seen our room Breakfast far too expensive for what it was Also money taken from our card without our permission but replaced the next day why , Our bed and the location of the hotel The staff were very accommodating but said their hands were tied and the policy of the hotel had to be followed not their fault just bad company rules very bad 
402681,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Small slight problem with the wifi being offline but was a technical problem and it was in the middle of the night and the staff apologized , Fantasic hotel the hotel catalonia group is very good stayed at the hotel 4 times and have never been disappointed The hotel has always managed to give me all my requests 
402682,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, one of the staff attitude Room has got glue smell Room 442 close to housekeepers store i guess what made it noisy in morning early time, Good location Good staff Nice rooms
402683,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We arrived to check in and were told the cleaners were in our room so we went for lunch then when we returned again we were told the previous guest was refusing to leave the room so we had to go out again We paid for a suite with pool and all the pictures on websites portray these to be on the top floor with a view ours was on the 5th floor with a very small shabby balcony very disappointing for paying a premium rate and misleading too , Fabulous location clean good facilities 
402684,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Milk and sugar were not fully replaced every day Had to ask for more milk Only 3 pots were available when there were 6 capsules for the Nespresso machine Breakfast was very expensive at 19 but plenty of places nearby to eat , Location Size of room Outside terrace and pool too small to do anything with but nice to cool off in as it was so hot and humid 
402685,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Very very loud could hear every coming and going Staff were not particularly welcoming and were in a hurry to get me out of there calling twice before 4pm even when I had paid for a late check out til 4pm , Wonderful location straight off the Ramblas and close to Catalunya which made it easy to get everywhere Very nice and spacious hotel It rained while I was there but otherwise I would have used the pool 
402686,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We decided to stay an extra night and the receptionist gave us a great deal BUT when we came to checkout the next day the young man tried to charge us the higher rate He said he thought it strange we were given that rate He kept going back to his supervisor and told us we had to pay the higher amount This all took half an hr and we had a long drive to Madrid ahead of us Finally after I got very upset he said ok he d give us the rate we d bn told originally It was NOT in my opinion the right way for hotel staff to deal with the situation We would never stay there again , The staff were very helpful especially the doorman who gave us all the info we needed Our bed was fantastic 
402687,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, We had a brilliant stay at this hotel and certainly would recommend it 100 to anyone It was so central and literally 2 minute walk to Les Ramblas but also ideal for the shopper and for great eating houses The pool area was beautiful and had good variety of seating areas etc 10 10 All staff no matter what their job was were so friendly and helpful Cant wait to return next year This is our 3rd yera going as a group of girls and by far the best and I amvery fussyabout where I stay 
402688,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Hotel room was a bit dark and as we were situated on the same level as the pool we had to keep our curtains closed so people couldn t see in this didn t help with the darkness of the room Pool area got very busy at times and people reserved sunbeds with their belongings then left and didn t return for hours so much so we had to sit on the floor Perhaps they should introduce a rule if you don t return to your sun lounger within an hour your stuff gets moved , Great location at top of las ramblas Within walking distance of loads of great shops and restaurants Also 2 minute walk to the hop on hop off bus city tour Great base for site seeing Lovely pool and bar area Room was large and very comfortable Staff were very friendly and the bar was reasonably priced Would recommend 
402689,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, We had to call reception for tea bags once and ice once On both occasions we had to phone back chasing when nothing came to the room The breakfast seems outrageously expensive when paying for a suite it should be included , The location is perfect and despite being right in the centre of Barcelona the room was incredibly quiet We had a suite which was perfect especially as we were travelling with our 10 month old baby she had her own room the lounge The terrace meant we could relax outside while she napped I m not sure there is much difference between the suite and the jonior suite seems we had slightly different terrace furniture and that was about it 
402690,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, requested high floor when booking given a room on ground floor Booking was for 3 adults and 1 child double sofa bed in room not suitable for adult 4 people 2 cups provided , superb location and friendly staff

402693,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel has an excellent location very close to all forms of public transport and a taxi rank It is within minutes of the Ramblas with all its restaurants shops and open air markets We were very luck to be able to stay in one of the hotels suites with our own private plunge pool which was a very welcome relief after a full day sightseeing We will definitely be returning to the Catalonia and would thoroughly recommend to all other travellers

402700,Catalonia Ramblas 4 Sup, Regrettably our trip did not get off to a great start as the triple room I had booked was only made up for two adults However once the situation was explained to the manager she moved us to a more suitable but not until the following day , The hotel was well located and our experience of the staff very pleasant The bathrooms very spacious and I particularly liked the separate shower to the bath in our room
