38484,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, There was a ticking sound we couldn t trace but it was after midnight and we didn t bother the desk There was scaffolding around the front of the building which wasn t a problem just not good for pictures , Comfy bed very close to Lancaster Gate subway station and Kensington Gardens 
38485,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Liked everything would stay there again , Beautiful buffet breakfast Proximity to transport Close to Kensington gardens Lovely walks in area Plenty of places to eat nearby 
38486,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, This was the loudest hotel room I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world in my life and I travel a lot Every time someone used a tap or had a shower above me I sounding like Ayer was coming into my room Every time someone walked passed my down e down the stairs it sounded like it was happening in my room Every sound and conversation the couple had in the room above me I could hear which was particularly annoying given it went on until 1am on a Sunday evening And the bed was no comfobale So a really bad nights sleep all round I told the staff in the morning as thee response was oh that room has issues stay in anther ro next time If you know about it why let anyone stay in it No apology or gesture to make up for it , Price and staff

38489,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Booked executive double room but room was very small for my 6 5 frame and could not fit in the Fifth floor bathrooms But luckily the staff was nice and relocated us to more spacious room , Location and friendly staff Beautiful quite neighborhood 
38490,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, We arrived exhausted and earlier than plan but the desk attendant went out of his way to get our room ready at once At dinner time they recommended a little Italian restaurant that was quite good The next morning the breakfast was adequate 
38491,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, A slightly bigger room would have been better , Great location for Hyde Park and Central London Room was cosy double bed only accessible from one side but very clean 
38492,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, It was all fine Standard and basic accommodation in a good spot , The location is good great if you plan to head to the airport the next day Which was the plan for me My room was simple and basic air con bed etc Wifi was solid and all the basics but not the room of your dreams 
38493,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Access to lobby can be hard if carrying big luggage Otherwise the staff can come in handy to help you out , Super comfortable and spacious room The biggest one we got in London Fast wi fi and great breakfast 
38494,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Nothing , Superb location very close to Paddington station and just one block from Hyde Park The breakfast was excellent and the staff are very nice I will definitely stay here again
38495,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast room was probably too small we went at the busiest time and staff struggled to keep up with demand We only just got a table That said we weren t in a rush and after waiting a few minutes the juice bread and hot breakfast were all replenished and we enjoyed a lovely breakfast , Great location just a short walk from Lancaster Gate Tube station Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are only a minute away too Nice pub The Swan lively atmosphere around the corner Room was small but very comfortable and had the best nights sleep in weeks 
38496,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, the room is very small and not easy to find The wifi was not reliable and slow Our room was not made up for 2 nights and when we asked why they said sorry , The location is great which is few minutes for the underground station The staff reception and restaurant are helpful They helped keeping our luggage for 5 nights after checkout The breakfast is good as well 
38497,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Sometimes the toilet did not flush very well Would have been better if it always good There aren t much space in the gym , The staffs are very helpful The bed was very comfy I enjoyed walking around hotel area Very nice walk through the park and not too far to The Natural History Museum 
38498,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Seems like when we book with a external company that we are giving the small room by the elevator with a view of a wall It happened again this trip , Location breakfast was good
38499,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, One of the elevators was broken during our whole stay and the other elevator was difficult to get to with suitcases etc If I was traveling with small children it would have been difficult Luckily i have teenage boys who could carry their own gear and some of mine , The location is great and convenient to the Underground Clean as well 
38500,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The shower is ultra modern Maybe some directions for adjusting water temperature would be a good safety idea Also there needs to be a rubber mat in the bottom of the shower I did slip a little getting out as there is nothing to hold on to Also there is a step up into the bathroom from the bedroom which is unmarked I tripped over it twice before remembering it was there , Beautiful little hotel near Lancaster Gate tube station It has a lift It has air conditioning Most hotels I stay at in London has neither It has a charming area called the Library that serves drinks and snacks I loved the period detail in the architecture The staff were friendly and efficient The room where I stayed was very quiet unusual for a 200 year old building 
38501,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, It stated that there was 24 hr room service and that we could get a meal in the evening but when we returned from our evening out both nights there was only lasagne available and that would be heated up in a microwave Very disappointing We only wanted a wrap or sandwich but not available , The breakfast was very good 
38502,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, There was a cock up with the room booking I was given the room of someone who had already checked in earlier in the day and it only come to light when we returned after the Hyde Park concert , Good breakfast 
38503,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was a little on the small side felt like we were in a cupboard but it was OK for our short stay , Very pleasant stay easily accessible to Hyde Park 
38504,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, WE BOOK IN EARLY AND THEN CAME BACK TO FINED MY SONS ROOM WAS TAKEN BY ANOTHER GUEST AND MY SON BELONGINGS HAD GONE AND WE ARE STILL TRYING TO GET THEM BACK AS THE MANAGER CANNOT FINE THEM AND THEY HAVE TOLD US THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FINE OUT WHERE MY SON BELONGING HAVE GONE,No Positive
38505,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Room a little small OK for one person but not big enough for two Limited wardrobe space no drawer space Very hot weekend even with air con it was still a bit hot in the room overnight not the fault of the hotel though , Clean and modern Very quiet and location perfect
38506,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Room very small but it was only for 1 night so ok bathroom tiny lots of random steps on each floor take care , Location just next to Hyde Park Clean room Good breakfast Price on Booking com 
38507,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Small rooms with natrow corridors There was an electrical problem while our stay which couldnot be fixed but the stuff were verymuch apologetic and sympatheticc about it , Small comfortable hotel within walking distance of paddington station Nice neighborhood with plenty of eating places all around 
38508,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Room very hot and air conditioning very poor Room was split level and staircase was very creaky and quite narrow Reception bar area very small , The bedroom was clean and quite spacious and hotel quite close to tube 
38509,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The bed sheets pillow covers didn t feel as clean as they should The single bed rooms are very small while the rooms with seperate beds are much more spacious During our stay part of the building next door was undergoing renovation which made the property look less appealing , The breakfast offered lots of options including English breakfast and the staff were very friendly They were always ready to help The location is next to Hyde Park which was very convenient 
38510,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The first room was completely inadequate a double bed you could only get in to from one side Woefully small and unfit for purpose for 2 people , When there was a problem it got resolved but not straight away 
38511,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, We booked the room on behalf of our colleague because it was a retirement gift from the company I booked the room at the end of April using a business credit card which was then shown on my boss s statement that payment had gone through as we knew it would because it was a non transferable no cancellation booking I even called the hotel at the time and they said the payment will go through within the next couple of days There was no mention when booking with youselves that it was the policy of the hotel that you still have to produce the credit card even though it was already paid for On Mr Simons arrival which was supposed to be a relaxing time was asked to produce the card and was advised from the management that they couldn t except the payment for his booking without the card EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PAID BY OUR COMPANY how ridiculous He then had to pay for the already paid room from his own money and was given a refund statement for the other payment This whole situation is extremely disappointing unnecessary and an embarrassment for our colleague , No comment 
38512,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was on two levels with a staircase up to the bedroom and bathroom beneath Only one window downstairs with very poor view No air conditioning It was OK but not 4 star in my view generally We got genius discounts to 152 so that was fine but pay full price and you would be very disappointed , The room was quite spacious They provided a fan as it was very hot Breakfast was good and we didn t have to queue up for it as you often do on a weekend The tube station right by the hotel is presently closed but two others are close by Hotel is near the busy Bayswater Road but far enough off to be quiet Easy to get around the main parts of London 
38513,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Noise cleanliness and some of the staff, Rooms very small and not very comfortable There is a step you have to step over to enter the bathroom Not very pleasant at all Shower tray kept filling with water Had to ask to have drains unblocked Water pressure in the shower was shocking Carpets needed to be vaccumed in the room and hallways So noisy Building work going on next door and you can hear everything Couldn t believe how we were spoken to by two staff members 
38514,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Only small downside my room was right next to the lift and being on the 5th floor was in regular use with returning guests during late evening, Good size single room modern design good size ensuite with shower air conditioned Friendly staff excellent location for Hyde Park very close to Lancaster Gate tube station Very clean would stay there again
38515,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Nothing really affected us, Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the stay The breakfast room is located below ground level and is quite small but this didn t cause any issues for us as it is well lit and pleasantly decorated Communal areas are also a bit small but all we wanted was a nice room in a decent location to tour London and that s what we got 
38516,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Room 1 poor requested room change Paid 2 months I in advance to have staff not honour booking as did not have the credit card on me and had to repay Unexceptabe into venirnce following 24hr flight,No Positive
38517,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was really small the fan in the bathroom didn t turn off and there was an enourmous air con fan right outside our window which was on all through the night,No Positive
38518,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Our room wasn t ready until nearly 2 and a half hours after our check in was supposed to be and our breakfast in the room was late and cold missing items too , The room was lovely really clean and modern
38519,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The property adjacent seems to be empty and may be a little off putting at first sight but the hotel itself is fine The Breakfast room is in the basement so has no windows but this is more a personal negative I prefer Windows and light especially in summer , For guests able and willing to walk the location is excellent quiet but close to Bayswater Road and Hyde Park Marble Arch and within walking distance of Oxford St Regent St Carnaby St Public area in Hotel is small but we ll furnished including books newspapers and 24 hour service Breakfast buffet offers a good selection of hot and cold items 
38520,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Thin walls so i could hear my neighbors, Good breakfast buffet Really clean modern rooms 5 minutes walking from hyde park and 10 from paddington station
38521,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Only one elevator so during peak hours around breakfast tour time elevator did take a bit long But not a major issue for us as the hotel wasn t very occupied at the time I think , Location was great short walk from the underground As we were travelling with an infant the staff were nice to give us the biggest room in the category but their largest standard room was also a bit tight especially the bathroom so might have to request or book accordingly 
38522,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The breakfast overall was very disappointing The bacon was streaky bacon never been served that in a hotel before Scrambled egg did not look like scrambled egg The toaster took ages to brown the bread My husband had the cooked breakfast but I had a continental which was OK Certainly not worth 12 50 each though The tables in the breakfast room were far too close to one another and one morning we were seated on bench seating very close to others which made it difficult to move in and out Our room was very small and overlooked a back yard area which had some rather noisy venting system although it did not disturb us too much during the night , The staff especially on reception were very friendly and most helpful Very nice welcoming residents seating area and library as you enter the hotel Location was perfect for us 
38523,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, There was not one thing I didn t like about this hotel , I loved this hotel My room was always kept wonderfully clean and the staff was friendly and helpful What I loved best is that it was so close to several tube and bus stations with Paddington being only a ten minute walk away There are lots of restaurants small stores and souvenir shops within a block or two from the hotel Hyde Park is very close and it was just beautiful A great place to go have lunch or just sit and enjoy the park I would definitely stay here again 
38524,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, a refridgerator in the room would have been nice to keep drinks cold, The bed was better than ours at home the air conditioning was a life saver and everything was clean and well layed off 
38525,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast was better 10 years ago Prefer fresh to tinned fruit Room was quite small , Able to book in early able to leave luggage on day of departure
38526,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room where I stayed didn t have a good layout When I was lying in bed the cold air coming from the air con was very strong and I didn t feel well with that Some of the staff could speak English well but they were all friendly though , The location is handy not far away from Paddington station about a 10 minute walk and very close to Hyde Park The room was good and the staff was friendly 
38527,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room in the basement is a bit less nice compared to the other rooms It has a blinded window only no chair no suitcase rest or whatever you call the thing on which you can put your suitcase and a built in cupboard without doors So nothing you can t survive but you do notice it Bit expensive , Good WIFI more than enough for streaming video or video calls The rooms have everything you need including an iron and board Nice and clean room overall Good shower Ah yes and the airco is good as well no problems with that The machine does what you tell it to do which is not always the case The hotel has a luggage room if you want to store your luggage on your first last day The breakfast is good You can get a nice full English breakfast for only 10 pounds Sir from the breakfast room even filled my flask with ice cubes on a 30 degree day top job Hyde Park is 2 streets away there s a Hop on Hop off bus stop at the gas station 5 minutes walk from the hotel Tube station Queensway is the nearest 5 10 minutes walk but even closer is Lancaster Gate tube station but that is closed until Juli 2017 Looking for a good hotel without unpleasant surprises consider this one 
38528,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, For executive rooms they were very tight Bed fitted under window width of room TV on wall to side You would not want to be hanging out in room Breakfast even though it ticked all the boxes as advertised the quality was cheap I thought The fruit was mostly tinned the yougart poor quality , Staff very friendly Reception restaurant and household Rooms Clean and well maintained Linen Towels crisp clean Rooms and Bathroom decor very nice Location good for touring and tube system Used the gym small 3 machines it was quite and I had it to myself Very comfortable The tube station Leicester Square was closed but Paddington was only 5 to 7 min walk away 
38529,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Great hotel right near Hyde park Location was close enough to walk to Oxford street Really friendly staff and clean room and bathroom Impressed with the size of the room compared to other accommodation in London 
38530,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, No kettle Didn t realise it didnt have a kettle in facilities description Not a big deal to most but I like a cup of tea The room was very pricey for what it was although I got it on a deal and would never pay the full price It s just each to there own I guess, The room was clean and tidy and the location was amazing 2 mins and we were in Hyde park couldn t complain about location
38531,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room on the first night was awful blocked shower old creaky bed a broken tv Very disappointing for price, After requesting a different room rest of the stay was much improved
38532,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Nothing, Great location its a 10 minute walk to Paddington or Queensway stations There are several pubs cafes and restaurants nearby not that we used them as we were out an about using the London s fabulous tube system The staff were very helpful and the linen and bed excellent 
38533,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Seems to be windows of this basement floor room look on back yard People oftne smoke there and sometimes you smell sigarets in the room if you have open window, Got a basement floor room More space fresh
38534,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Suite was located on 1st floor with no view at all from the window at least for mine Sound proof wasn t at hotel standard as I can hear people speak in corridor bang their doors and climb the stairs in room stairs of neighbour suite Towels were not replaced completely and one even come with a stain that appeared in same way as I sent to clean wonder if they really replaced for me The nearest underground station was closed during my time of stay so need to walk pretty long way for the tube The front desk asked us for 30 for breakfast on check out which we didn t consumed ordered and I refused to pay , Booked the executive suite and roomy for the number of luggage we had Walking distance to bus stop was just around 400m 
38535,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The so called executive room I was very disappointed in as the seating area was one chair As good as breakfast was three out of four mornings the cooked breakfast was only cold to Luke warm , Had a very nice four day stay here When I booked the hotel we were upgraded to an executive room Staff were all very helpful and could not do enough for you breakfast had everything you could want or need 
38536,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The first day my TV did not work I made the claim to the front desk and the lady in charge told me she will come in few minutes because she was alone but she never came I understand she could not have left the front desk alone but it was kind of odd that there was nobody else in the hotel other than her Next day the TV was fixed , The best feature of the hotel is its staff trully friendly kindest ladies especially those in charge of the breakfast Breakfast was OK and the room was quiet despite facing a very populated pub It requires some walking to reach the hotel from Paddington station but location is very convenient to enjoy the beauty of Hyde Park 
38537,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The reception staff are really friendly but they made a mistake with my room giving me a room that two other arriving guests had been given This is really something that should be avoided I did get a free breakfast to compensate for it The other staff can be quite noisy once when I was walking down the stairs one staff member had to say sssssshhhh really loudly when he saw me coming to get them to stop yelling , Excellent location less than 10 minutes walk from Paddington station You have shops and restaurants nearby as well as Hyde Park It s between two dodgy looking buildings but once you re inside it s very nice and newly renovated Very quiet Room wasn t too small and the bathroom had a bath and shower 
38538,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was small but had everything we needed It is as the description says a boutique hotel , The staff were very friendly and helpful Everywhere clean and tidy Good breakfast 
38539,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Nothing , verything was perfect during my stay in the Best Western Mornington hotel the room was enough spacious for one person clean tidy with a newly renovated modern bathroom The breakfast was adequate to my needs and had a fair share of options to choose from It s placement came in very handy considering that my flight landed in Heathrow and i managed to get to the hotel very easily with Heathrow Express and then a 5 minute walk from Paddington station to Lancaster Gate street It s also very close to the center and you can access it through the Queensway metro station 148 bus and taxis which the reception can book for you in advance Last but not least the girls in the reception were all extremely polite helpful and very professional Extra props to Laura for keeping me company while i was eating my dinner the last afternoon and her beef lasagna suggestion Thank you if i visit London i will sure book my room here again 
38540,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Only one elevator was functioning and the stairs where a bit narrow , Very central and close to the Lancaster tube station It is also a close walk to center of attractions like the Hyde Park garden and the high street shops in central London Satisfactory breakfast 
38541,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The bed was very small my feet hung over the end The air conditioner didn t work properly and the room was a bit on the dark side as it looked onto a air conditioning system directly outside the window ,No Positive
38542,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Location next to derelict building Lancaster Gate station closed so 10 20 minute walk to other stations Room small and poorly furnished Awful breakfast , Reception staff were nice
38543,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Room was hot as the aircon didn t work very well The room was still hot and not properly ventilated even turned to the lowest 16C while London was 25C It was annoying for experiencing on and off power for tv water kettle and plug The mattress was falling on edges meaning that it should be replaced after more than 5 8 year usage The design of the washroom was poor with the glass halfly covered the bathing area so water can easily split to the floor causing possible fall Check out staff was very rude and gave me a lesson to me don t be rude But there were 2 staff there one was ignorant and was reading his own document while the rude on was insisting on answering the previous guest on direction to tube What an unforgettable experience For a big hotel chain with bad mannered staff it put a disastrous reputational damage to the whole hotel chain Lancaster tube station is closed meaning the hotel prime location is no longer the case I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone and would personally never use this hotel chain It is disappointing ,No Positive
38544,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Indifferent staff Wouldn t speak unless spoken to Wouldn t greet unless greeted first and even then their response was nothing more than a grunt Too far from the nearest usable tube station No room upgrade or Points as we didn t book with Best Western directly , Towel warmer and soft towels
38545,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Would have been more helpful if my ground floor room did not have four stairs to get to it , I stayed here on the way out and on the way home after a long haul flight The hotel was a short cab ride from Paddington Station and convenient the breakfast was excellent staff were helpful and very polite and orderered me a taxi on the morning I left to Paddington Station I have mobility issues and they organised a room on the ground floor for me I would use this hotel again when traveling 
38546,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The hotel was a little small but considering we were only in the room to sleep it wasn t too bad , The hotel wasn t in the centre of London but was a short 10 minute walk away from Paddington Underground It was very close to Hyde Park Kensington Gardens and what a beautiful place that was The breakfasts were good as well 
38547,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, One male member of staff was clueless I ordered some tea at the bar area he gave me long life milk with the tea which was gone off he then said ah yes I thought it was off he then said he gave me back the wrong change and that I owed him 50p Extremely unprofessional , Beds were comfortable great location One female staff member was friendly and looked for honest feedback 
38548,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, It would be nice if there is a fridge in the room instead of keeping asking for ice to make our drinks cold I wish the room is bigger in size , The front desk staff Laura was very helpful and kind Upon checking in she showed us two rooms to choose The room which we selected was not ready till later so we went to have lunch When we came back our luggage have been placed in the room The breakfast was good it has good selection of breads croissants fruits cheese and cooked English breakfast We can order to cook poached eggs omelletes or order coffee latte hot chocolate etc Staff was very nice and polite 
38549,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The only thing we didn t like was the sink in the bathroom drained slow Everything else was great , Hyde Park is so pretty we loved how close this hotel is to the park There s a small 24 hour bar in the hotel which was convenient We received an unexpected upgrade to a loft room It was very easy to arrive at Heathrow Airport take the Heathrow Express train to Paddington Station then a short walk to the hotel The Mitre Pub around the corner from the hotel was great too 
38550,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, I was given an executive suite having injured my leg then find that I had to climb a very creaky spiral staircase up and down to the bedroom rooms where cold and had a dispute about bill when checking out to be fair it was my misunderstanding thinking they where charging twice Man at the desk was very polite breakfast was reasonable , Not much 
38551,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Brilliant stay The room was lovely and the staff were friendly and accommodating Wonderful breakfast and perfect location Would definitely stay again 
38552,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Breakfast wasn t the bed I know this isn t the hotel s fault but I could hear other guests phones vibrate through the floor whenever they rang or the alarms went off Loud fan noise in the bathroom that I couldn t switch off No chilled bottled water , Bed comfortable enough Location good for what I needed hence why I booked this hotel 
38553,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The bed wasn t so comfortable I think there were bedbugs I had bites on my arms I washed everything when I returned home , The bathrooms were clean and modern 
38554,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Very noisy hotel Wooden floors so you hear people walking in other rooms and especially noisy the rooms close to the elevator You could feel doors closing very strong Wi Fi was not working very good and not easy to access , nice bed duvet and pillows small but nice bathroom Good breakfast They were kind to give us a late check out thanks to booking com Cheap price on Sundays in an expensive London 
38555,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Nothing I stayed here one night before catching the Heathrow express and a flight to Australia , Breakfast excellent Staff efficient and friendly and food was very good 
38556,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The water to the bath shower was only luke warm and the bar prices were a bit steep , We were allocated a lovely spacious room which was spotlessly and contained everything you need for a comfortable stay Staff were helpful and polite The residents bar had a nice ambience 
38557,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, the fact that underground station Kancaster is clised and you have to walk a mile to the next underground station Rooms small with no noise reduction so you hear all the noise from the pub downstairs the hotel is generally very noisy giving you hard time to rest, friendly staff
38558,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room service cooked breakfast that we payed 5 each extra for was of much poorer quality than the breakfast that we had on the second morning in the breakfast room It was quite dry and came with salad Although the 24 hr bar was a good idea as mentioned above in reality we had to wait a long time for someone to appear and when they did the service was pretty brusque The drink prices were also very high though I suppose that is London for you , The reception staff were very friendly and helpful Though some were quite hard to understand The 24 hr bar was a good idea The range of cold breakfast food was good ie smoked salmon ham lots of different cheese as well as the usual toast cereal fruit etc 
38559,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Rate is increasing at high speed , Hotel is very well located Breakfast is very good indeed Staff is very friendly and very professional 
38560,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, My single room was over hot I turned heating down on arrival and kept window open all night The sound proofing above room not brilliant as could hear guests flushing etc but they were quiet at night and the rest of the hotel was very hushed I d request top floor in future There are lifts Kept tripping over plinth between bed and bath A potential hazard It was also a shame nearest tube closed but bus stops close by so easy and regular access to Oxford Street via 94 or 390 Could also walk to Nottinghill , Location and atmosphere Staff very helpful It felt like an exclusive club which as a single traveller I prefer to the usual anonymous chain hotels I d stay again 
38561,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Coffee in England is generally poor so I can t single this hotel out but the cherry on top of a great stay would have been Barista standard coffee There are automatic machines that do a good drop these days and that way I could have helped myself , The staff were polite and friendly without being embarrassingly deferential The Breakfast was great value for money and we could order our eggs directly from the kitchen if we wanted them prepared to our own taste 
38562,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, No evening restaurant or dining area But room had more than enough space for dining , Quiet location close to Oxford street and Hyde Park Very professional staff Room service provide small tasty meals 24 hrs Excellent breakfast and breakfast dining area 
38563,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Do not bother to book an executive room they will put you in a double anyway Even after complaining about my room not being an executive I was only offered another only slightly bigger double room Looking at the bookings list in the breakfast room I saw that I was actually listed as a double even though I booked and paid for an executive ,No Positive
38564,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Our room was right next to the elevator which means you could hear everyone coming and going Free wi fi did connect but didn t work , Great location if you want to take a stroll in Hyde Park or do the shopping on Oxford Street The hotel staff is friendly and helpful When Lancaster Gate tube station gets renovated it ll be even more convenient to get around Great breakfast also 
38565,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, We booked an executive room and the room we were given was more like the economy room that they offer I feel like we were given the wrong room because the room we stayed in was not worth paying 100 for , clean comfortable Lovely shower
38566,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Due to the lancaster gate station being closed till mid 2017 it takes about 10 minutes to get to the tube station as such be prepared to make the walk if you are carrying heavy bags during your check in check out apart from that it was a really good experience staying at best western mornington , Amazing value 
38567,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The curtains were a bit difficult to pull across I think the runners need either renewing or repairing as you could not close the curtains fully Slightly annoying but not enough to spoil our stay , Bed very comfortable and facilities were good however the bath was quite short My wife who is not particularly tall could not lay down comfortably in it but the room was very clean and tidy The staff were very polite and friendly We did not use the restaurant facilities so cannot comment on those I will certainly use this hotel again 
38568,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was very small particularly for two people There was no room to go round the bed which was up against the window The room was fine for one person , Good location Friendly staff Clean room Good breakfast 
38569,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The rooms were very small with 2 single bed put together for a double bed so as soon as you sat on the bed it would just slide forward and the floor boards didn t help breakfast choice was very limited with no crossiants biscuits or anything as such no fresh orange juice some oranges with a small squeezer for you to squeeze your own juice which no one would even bother trying not happy, The location close to everything
38570,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The size of the room the view a huge metallic fan I managed to change room for a wall view The bed wasn t comfy and I could hear what was happening in the room close to mine , The clean bathroom and the friendly receptionists
38571,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Couldn t connect ot the Wifi in the basement bedroom Sink in bedroom ensuite didn t drain properly Seal on shower door was broken in corner causing water to spill onto floor , location good Staff friendly and offered room for baggage to be left

38576,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The noise from above room kept us awake and woke us early Although not the hotels fault it was very loud and we wondered if they would come through the ceiling My daughter and I left exhausted and not just from walking miles round London , A lovely hotel in a great location Close enough to Paddington Station Lancaster Gate was shut unfortunately but this was manageable Staff were friendly polite and helpful and the manager dealt with an issue promptly and appropriately

38583,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Our room 312 was absolutely TINY which was super disappointing considering i had booked an executive double room months in advanced and it was still 400 for 3 nights Ideal only for business transit solo guests The staff need to work on their customer service and demeanour they come across really rude and annoyed when dealing with guests which can be quite upsetting for tourists , The library sitting room is really nice and lifts were convenient Location of the hotel is good next to Hyde Park walking distance to Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube station nearby however the station is closed until July 2017 which we were ONLY informed of when we checked in

38589,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Staff were very rude I asked the receptionist a question about transport and she didn t know so she asked the manger in the back office and I heard him loudly say Why are you asking me this question How am I suppose to know She then came back and gave me the wrong answer I understand they aren t suppose to know everything but they could have been a little bit more professional and helpful Every time I would go to reception they were rude not helpful and I felt like I had put them out Service wasn t good at all My bed was crooked They put two singles bed together which is fine but it s not fine when one bed is higher then the other bed Was so uncomfortable and couldn t sleep , Good location Rooms are clean

38591,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was tiny the staff barely said 2 words to us the area outside the hotel was littered with wood and other sorts of debris and the location of our room was directly next to a public bathroom The walls were so thin we had to whisper for fear of pepole listening to us , It was relatively close to the underground but the closest station was closed 
38592,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Could be only this time of year Feb 2017 The area is generally safe although there s a bum in the abandoned building next door Also the closest tube Underground Lancaster Gate was closed for renovations until July 2017 So had to walk to Paddington or Queensway Although we foundthat busses 148 390 and 94 were even more convenient for sightseeing , Excellent English breakfast with over easy eggs scrambled eggs beans mushrooms tomatoes sausages hash browns cured salmon and mackerel cheeses yogurt fruits cereal Best I ve ever had at any hotel anywhere 
38593,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Staff could be a little more attentive room was very small but was ok as we didn t have much luggage The derelict building next door were rather a shock when we arrived and it s a bit disconcerting with the number of homeless sleeping rough in these building doorways , Location good as long as you are ok with a pretty long walk to Paddington as the nearest station as the closer underground is closed Good to be able to open the window and a quiet location 
38594,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, A bit small rooms but they were nice not much soundproofing between door and hallway so you can hear anything that happens in the hallway but didnt notice any sounds coming from other rooms Bit low water preasure in the shower The food you can buy at the hotel at late evening night were rather tastless and not recomended unless you re really starving , Nice staff very comfortable beds a couple of good restaurants very close easy to get transportation to places Good breakfast

38618,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Single glazed windows meant it was cold at that side of the bed Air con didn t warm up the room quickly Thin walls and floors meant it was hard to sleep if the neighbours were noisy but the manager was very helpful in this regard , Comfortable bed Nice toiletries 
38619,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Small complaint which I didn t raise at the time but the shower fixture was a little loose which meant I couldn t use it at full power as it went everywhere Still more than adequate pressure I m sure had I raised it the matter would have been resolved , I paid 38 for a single room in December the room was spotless modern and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities TV iron and ironing board and a decent hairdryer The bathroom was also very well kept and toiletries were provided Staff were all very helpful and friendly The full buffet breakfast the following morning which was included in the price was amazing

38621,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The heater was hard to set up It took some time to heat up Internet conection failed after several attempts There was no service for visitors just a room to stay other facilities were all locked Four star hotels should set up the room my towel dryer was off when I arrived There was no free parking available around the hotel Also no event for the new year eve was arranged in the hotel , Friendly staff hot water nice room

38625,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was incredibly small Yes it was a single room but felt very pokey Unfortunately I couldn t spend time relaxing in there it was so tight for space Also it should have been made clear that it was a basement room, Location is great Tube station very close and very convenient

38633,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Asked for top floor room allocated ridiculously small basement room with frosted glass window onto below ground steps Had to climb over bed to reach window Refused room change full apparently Offered free breakfast and drinks to compensate This room should not exist Guy on reception resigned to the awful situation not his fault etc etc Booking com you ve messed up here Best Western get a grip , Breakfast good choice and standard
38634,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Double bed barely fit into very tiny room Space was cramped Heating unit had mind of its own and did not regulate temp correctly We feel room was overpriced for a renovated building that was noisy , Breakfasts were awesome and staff was very attentive However if I had booked direct breakfast would have been free As it was we had to pay 20 pounds for breakfast every day

38637,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The bedrooms could be a little bigger but not bad for the price , A good value hotel close to the centre of London and also walking distance from Paddington for that early morning train 
38638,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Very small room and bathroom A 2 night stay was manageable but any longer would have been prohibitive , the room was warm once we put the heating on 
38639,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The entrance with the glass door dirty , The room was comfortable cleaned and quiet Perfect location if your time to stay in London is limited Paddington station is 10 minutes walking Hide Park is just across the Street and the Central line is also few steps around the corner

38641,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Poor soundproofing from the hallway the doors kept slamming shut Floor plan of the room was not good and the bathroom was quite small , Great location with Lancaster Gate station Central line and Paddington station close by Hotel next to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park Affordable breakfast when purchased the day before 10 Nice modern pub The Mitre around the corner 
38642,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was super small with barely any room for both of us to walk around the bed However that also helped to make sure we were out enjoying the sights instead of staying in the room , The room was very well kept and the room service staff is fantastic the hotel is in a great location close to the Underground station and Kensington Palace
38643,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The wifi was terrible we got into it once then just gave up as it stopped working The hotel corridor was also quite noisy at times , Room was really clean and beds were very comfy

38646,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, In our room there was a high threshold between bedroom and bath that took some getting used to Otherwise we had everything we needed and no complications , The most amazing staff anywhere Incredibly we checked out and went to Paddington and got on a train to Wales leaving our passports and wallets behind in the hotel safe unlocked The staff immediately phoned and emailed and we turned back and retrieved everything It s embarrassing to tell this story but it does illustrate how honest these people are 
38647,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The bathroom is tiny and the room was very warm even with the heat off I opened the window for the night but where my room situated it was very noisy in the morning I guessed that where the hood from the kitchen is , It was very central close to underground and min away from Hyde Park Staff are very friendly

38653,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Room was small Front desk staff unhelpful and lacked knowledge of the hotel Most common answer to questions was I don t know , Location and the price
38654,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Staff were rather rude and unhelpful I constantly felt like I was bothering them When I got there and I had a fault in my room I was made to feel like I was being precious and fussing over nothing , Room size was great
38655,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Unfortunately the boiler was broken on the first morning of our 2 night stay so there was no hot water which made for a pretty chilly start to the day We weren t given notice that this had happened which was a bit irritating , The breakfast was great staff were friendly and the location was ideal 
38656,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Negative comments about this hotel were totally unjustified in my opinion This is a city centre tourist hotel Rooms were clean and comfy breakfast was good with varied choice An perfect base for a city break If you want 5 star pay 5 star prices but it won t necessarily be better 
38657,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, I didn t like location the photos are no real Tiny room The hotel was dirty There is so many dust in bathroom and the carpet covers a creak floor City centre is away from Lancaster Gate but achievable by subway Only attraction is Hyde Park in front of the hotel,No Positive
38658,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel was fab I ve been to London lots of times and usually the standard of hotel is expensive but basic This place was just gorgeous We were lucky enough to have an executive suit at a great price and I didn t want to leave the room Great choice for breakfast in the morning and very attentive staff I would highly recommend
38659,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, No issues, Wonderful friendly staff Very helpful at all times Hotel is in a great location The room was clean comfortable and spacious Good breakfast with full English or continental options Great value for money I would stay again 
38660,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room We had to move room 3 times for the 6 nights we were there and the last room we were moved to was extremely small The first 2 nights we were in a small room 14 later in they move us to a room in an executive floor The room is 3 times larger and is considered a suite although that size of that room would be considered a standard size in the US After spending 2 nights in the larger room the plumbing on the entire floor didn t work and it discharged a very unpleasant smell in to the rooms Again had to move to another room that s even smaller than the first one You can only get on the bed from one side to open the window you have to get on the bed and you can t open your luggage unless it s laid on the bed But we managed The staff since many of the staff if not all are not British native most are from Eastern Europe reception wasn t warm They re cold but professional Except for one tall young man I think his name is MICHAEL whose customer service skill is of those Starwood hotels level Second to none We re very appreciative of everything he did for us ,No Positive
38661,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Overall the front desk staff were not very helpful when asked a variety of questions ranging from bus schedules and when the heathrow express was running We managed to find all the information on our own so it was fine After the first night the housekeeping staff managed to leave the toilet brush in the toilet bowl not sure what happened but it was a surprise , The location was good and quite convenient Upon arrival I was also given an upgrade to a larger room which was highly appreciated 
38662,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, FIRST ROOM room 15 tiny room just enough room for double bed pushed against wall window with ONE bedside table no prob as i was on my own but TV positioned sideways so you could not watch it from the bed and i did not want to sit in a chair 50cm in front of tv coffee maker was in cupboard the electric lead could not be plugged in to use ON TOP of the table so only way to use was to crouch down on floor and potentially destroy thje cupboard with humidity SOLUTION make guests aware this is a small room suited to one person or cozy for 2 and ADD MORE PLUGS and reposition TTV simple STAFF were helpful and moved me but only late in evening when they knew what inventory was left 2nd room much better thank you , excellent staff friendly helpful Excellent breakfast one of the best i have ever had REAL scrambled eggs not rubber additional items cooked to order 
38663,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Hotel slightly dated and one of the receptionists wasn t very friendly , Great location and really nice hotel room The actual hotel was a bit dated but the room was very nice and clean 
38664,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Location and size of room were excellent I had stayed at other hotels in the Paddington area and the rooms were so small that you couldn t even move The proximity to Paddington makes for a smooth ride to and from Heathrow just remember that you can take the Heathrow Connect for 10 pounds instead of the Express which will cost you double the price Lots of breakfast options around tube and Hyde Park within minutes Overall a great hotel We will definitely go back 
38665,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Nothing, Quiet area but only 5 minutes walk to Pared road 10 minutes to Paddington Station 5 minutes to Lancaster gate underground Used the Heathrow express for onwards Journey
38666,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, even for London rooms are a bit on the small side over the weekend the wi fi was not functional not the hotel s fault their service provider wouldn t service on the weekend a minor inconvenience that s all and business center as backup was adequate , quiet room spotless modern updated good breakfast very responsive staff excellent location The Mornington is a perfect cross between a B B and full service hotel Recommended 
38667,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, We had some noisy people in the room above which caused sleep problems on one night , Very good breakfast and very attentive staff Excellent quiet location 
38668,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, I expect to have a motor on top of the dressing table and a TV in front of the bed The mirrors on the wardrobe were useless because the area in front is to tyni to see yourself in full and the lighting is to poor to even make properly your hair the blow drier was positioned there , Cody hotel with great location friendly stuff clean quiet 
38669,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The only plug I could find for the kettle was down on the floor , Lovely cosy little hotel Very bright clean and comfortable A small room but didn t feel cramped at all 
38670,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was small corridors narrow wine wasn t great free wifi asked for your email address air conditioning was hard to understand and TV channels were limited , I liked the staff breakfast cleanliness and location

38674,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, bathroom a bit small shower screen doesn t prevent floor from getting wet Power point in bathroom for shaving would be good , Staff were friendly Good breakfast Location is good lots of good restaurants close by 
38675,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The view from the window on an internal court with a noisy engine No slippery in the room , The position nearby a central line underground station and a peaceful elegant neighborhood 
38676,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, My room was very noisy 502 better sound proofing is needed for this room I could hear everything and everyone on the corridor Bad night s sleep overall The breakfast was poor very little choice and bad coffee No decent cereals limited cooked breakfast and no fruit and yoghurts to choose from Rudely disturbed whilst getting dressed in the morning by a very impatient cleaner that wanted me out of the room at 9am Once I pointed out that check out was 11am she retreated , VERY pleasant host at reception on the night of arrival 4 10 16 Bedroom very clean 
38677,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Did not respond to request to change room type Ridiculous double room size No place to put luggage no place to stand almost no place to move from one side of bed to other side The closet in both rooms barely enough to one person, Nice stuff that tried to help The twin room was good
38678,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Rooms were small basically space to just walk around the bed No fridge at all which is disappointing and is something I like to utilise , Hotel was close to the underground stone throws away from Lancaster Gate Park was basically across the road and great to see the Diana memorial and all the wildlife there Beds were comfortable and stuff were helpful Plenty of good pubs around the corner 
38679,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Was in room 217 for 10 nights and it was quite noisy Room is not good for light sleepers at all I often woke up thinking room had been broken into it was that loud and creaky Hairdryer was useless I had to keep button pressed while drying and the dryer had no power really Air drying hair was a better option , Breakfast and breakfast staff was excellent Especially Editya and Ivanic Editya deserves a medal seriously Bathtub in room 217 was great Bathroom and room were clean Generous wardrobe iron with stand several towels big window with view 
38680,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, At first sight of Hotel we were concerned about the empty building ajoining it was very neglected and empty however our part of the buildinging inside was very clean and tidy our room faced a neighbourhood pub but their patrons appeared considerate of neighbours , Staff front desk and breakfast room were polite efficient helpful and proffesional 
38681,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Next to the hotel there is an empty building for many years which is absolutely disgusting and all the dust and horrible smell comes to the hotel rooms I am pretty sure they are rats everywhere and I don t understand how this hotel is rated with 4 stars and Best Western agrees to give their franchise to such a horrible hotel They have the ventilation on 24 7 to absorb the bad smell with the result of creating massive noise during the day and night , The location
38682,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The booking site was misleading It indicated breakfast included in green letters but was not included Both sites that we had checked in Sweden and I in USA Hotel was not 4 star level We expected more My friend from Sweden my English friend and I taught hotel is 2 star level My English friend stayed in 3 star remodeled Travel Lodge it had a new king size bed Only cost 79 English pounds 1 2 what I paid It was in belter location in the middle of London ,No Positive
38683,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, There was a problem in the morning where the ceiling was leaking but it was rectified immediately It was apparently due to guests on above floor that had water running thruout the bathroom floor I hope that they would fix the problem so that it wouldn t be an issue again for next guest , The man at reception was super friendly and extremely helpful We got upgraded to a small suite room and a discount on breakfast And of course a late check out time of 1pm We also were allowed to leave our bags whilst we shop next day for free Our stay was made more memorable because of the great service Will definitely visit again when I am in London again Easy access to bus train station Lancaster gate 
38684,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Basement room was really tiny with a broken blind and no WiFi They moved me when I complained but avoid room 23 , Great selection for breakfast make sure you book in advance to save on cost Had a single room but it was comfortable and a fair size with good facilities Very clean hotel and staff were very friendly and helpful 
38685,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Only complaint is for room 110 where there is a door to the next room badly isolated conversation could be heard as if persons were in my room , A small nice hotel on a quiet street I particularly appreciated being given a room already at 10h00 I needed to fresh up for a conference speech two hours later Excellent breakfast 
38686,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Initially allocated a single room in the basement which had no wifi signal However when this was mentioned to staff I was relocated to a larger single room on the upper level Basement room was also smaller with bathroom facilities partitioned in the room itself , Room was good size for a central London hotel and staff were friendly and proactive in addressing concerns Hotel was close to Paddington station with Queensway eateries nearby

38690,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The reception staff needs to learn about service not very nice service The rooms are very different in size and the beds are not large beds as stated They are 150 cm max in all double rooms only family rooms have 180 cm We first got a room next to the elevator was so small that we could not get 2 suitcases in there We got another one which was okay Our friends got a room with a view to the garbage shaft where the noise started at 6 o clock in the morning They were moved finally to a nice room on the 4th floor So beware to ask for a bigger or nicer room Some of the rooms should be discounted in price , Room was nice and clean but quite small Breakfast was good Perfect central location

38695,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Some plumbing malfunction in the shower in the room above me caused the outflow to pour through the ceiling and light fittings into the hall and bathroom of my room As this was in the middle of the night the manager did well to find a bucket and mop to clean it up , I arrived at 10 30am and was pleased to be given a room straight away instead of having to wait for the 2pm check in 
38696,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, BREAKFAST NO BACON NO SAUSAGES WAS TOLD BE A FEW MINUTES BUT 20 MINUTES LATER THEY HADN T ARRIVED SO HAD TO HAVE COLD EGGS BEANS AND TOAST NOT GREAT FOR 170 PER NIGHT LOCAL PARKING A MILE AWAY FOR 27 00 PER DAY , COMFY BED MODERN ROOM

38698,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, If one had to quibble the room was really small And the wardrobe was mostly taken up by the ironing board and by a large safe large enough for a notebook I couldn t even unpack a small suitcase This will be a problem for anyone staying for more than a night or two The neighbouring building is in a state of decay and it is a bit of a shocker but this has nothing to do with the Mornington And renovations now seem to be getting under way there , My room on the 5th floor was well equipped good TV aircon bathrobe excellent toiletries ironing board nice bathroom small desk comfortable armchair small but comfortable bed good lighting All recently modernised Except for the size the room had the standard of a luxury hotel You can see the attention to detail Good library on the ground floor all the usual daily papers were available there The staff were helpful throughout Friendly and attentive staff in the breakfast room in particular and a breakfast which left nothing to be desired What a good way to start the day whether on holiday or on business And I was there for five days making such things more important Great location on a quiet side street but right next to tube stations Lancaster Gate or Paddington and Kensington Gardens For early risers a good start to a sunny London day is to walk right from the hotel along the Serpentine to Hyde Park corner Buckingham Palace and further sights At least two good pubs nearby Not the cheapest place to stay but one gives the impression that it is well run Which cannot be said of all London hotels I would in general much prefer a good private hotel to a chain 
38699,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, This is one of those small hotels With 5 floors each floor has around 8 rooms An old building that has been refurbished So don t have high expectations when it comes to luxury The AC was not working the fixed it but after 3 days They offered us a fan though Sound isolation is poor and the coridoor between rooms is small So you can hear house keeping in the mirning or if you have incosidetaye guest next to you , Staff are so so friendly They really made a big difference in our stay Great location A few minutes walk form Lanaster gate station Although rooms have no fridge the reception has a fridge to store the guests food They also have a microwave should any guest wants to heat their food Good price 
38700,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Window looked out over ugly noisy pipes A bar fridge and a small table with 2 chairs would have been good The sofa s position rendered it useless , Close proximity to Hyde Park and tube stations

38710,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room is super small It s difficult to open our luggage in the room The double bed is super small for two people The ventilation in the toilet is extremely poor The toilet smell was disgusting when we first entered the room There was no ventilation in the toilet although the staff claimed that there s an automatic one not an electric one but I really don t think there s I was glad that I only had to stay there for one night Definitely NOT value for money , Good location Very close to the Lancaster Gate station That s the only good thing I can say about this hotel 
38711,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Lack of food in the evening, A very nice clean hotel not too noisy set back in the square the young man could not do enough for me he was a true gent Close to lots of amenities and the park as an ex hotelier i was happy with my stay

38719,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, It disappoints me that the room is much smaller than what shows in the images and the breakfast is average but they charge 10 15 for each person which doesn t worth the money , This hotel is just beside the Hyde Park where you can have a walk every morning

38751,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Entry is up about 7 steep outside steps which is difficult with a large suitcase and unaided I dealt with three different women at the front desk between my arrival and late departure the next day I sensed that although friendly all could use more training in both knowledge of the area and hospitality The bathroom could definitely use a safety bar in the shower It is only a 10 minute walk to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express Very convenient However this is a bit of a challenge in the rain and pulling a large case Taxis from the hotel charge a hefty price because the station is so close so it is better to walk , It was raining and the lady at the front desk kindly lent me her umbrella to go out to dinner and made good restaurant recommendations The hotel is modest but the room was updated and had all the amenities including tea and coffee and a safe The bathroom was better than expected Very close to Lancaster Gate which is on Central Line

38771,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The cleaning staff could do a better job of cleaning the rooms during the stay They placed the coffee maker glasses etc on the floor They clearly only rinsed used glasses instead of replacing them and they left dirty glasses in the room instead of removing them , The library bar was excellent
38772,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, We left two rings in the room However we phoned to them in the afternoon they said it is gone We think probably cleaner or staff taked it or someone entered into room taked the ring after we checked out In other words this hotel is not safe ,No Positive

38776,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, The only thing missing from the description was that I didn t have a workspace in the room no desk or anything that made working on the computer a bit more difficult Otherwise I was pleasently surprised by the breakfast much better than I thought And a plus for that I got a doublebed for my own 
38777,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was not ready when I arrived at 2 and I could not check in unless I provided a deposit with the card despite the room having already been paid for Because I only had a debit card I was requested 30 pounds as a deposit to be iven back upon departure This extra money should be specified when booking and paying in advance , Great location lovely room very clean
38778,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Our sofa bed for the children wasn t out and we had to get the bedding and make it ourselves , Comfy beds great breakfast selection Fresh fruit in the room on the 2nd night 
38779,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was ridiculously small The bed was flush against one wall and there was barely room to move around the sides and foot It was booked as a double for single use but was more like a single with a double bed squeezed in , The hotel is in an excellent location and the public rooms are very attractive The staff were charming and helpful 
38780,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, I was in room 302 which is close to the cleaners lock room and the cleaner bangs the door all day including early morning so its impossible to sleep passed 7 am , The bed and the room was comfortable the heated towel rack was very nice The reception staff was very nice too 
38781,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, It was a tiny size room for what was advertised The rooms aren t sound proof so could here the person next door clanging and banging The shower was close to the radiator so could easily burn yourself The bath had eroded marks from a previous slip mat For four star it s more 2 5 Best western for London another disappointing chain No thought or care in presentation of facilities for a descent customer experience, Convenient location entrance to hotel seemed nice until we got in to our box size bedroom just about swing a cat 
38782,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Bedroom small but normal for London and bathroom on ground floor with not the best obscurity through window facing pub A blind would have helped , The reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly 
38783,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was very hot and the air on made a lot of noise when turned on Plus room 207 backs on to the kitchen extractor fan and noisy all the time, Clean nice bed good bar
38784,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Hardly worth mentioning but the shower screen was a little too low small for the power shower hence wet towels and loo roll Oops Room 16 , Bed very comfortable room extremely quiet location perfect shower excellent ie powerful 
38785,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The staff were not overly friendly other than the overnight staff member who was quite helpful The others were not inviting and often failed to even acknowledge you as you walked past the desk to the elevator that was steps from them , The location was very close to Lancaster Gate station and not a fat walk from Paddington It made travel over our trip a breeze The library bar was a nice place to grab a drink at the end of the night The breakfast was excellent 
38786,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Everything was good, Stylish contemporary decor nice compact design bedroom with quality ensuite bathroom the breakfast was really tasty with good quality produce and choice the staff were curtious and attentive could not fault it
38787,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, My window was totally obscured by some metal structure that was a bit noisy, Rooms were nicely done and comfortable Good location Three minutes from tube 
38788,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, As the same one booking was for three persons in single rooms it was have been great if we were located on same floor and preferably adjacent to each other since there was enough advance booking to calculate availability The only other remark is that there was noise filtration from the room adjacent to the one occupied by myself ,No Positive

38791,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Room was comfortable but I do not like rooms on lower ground floor as it was only for one night it was not really an issue, Location was good near to where I was meeting friends 
38792,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, television at the side of bed so has to be viewed side on so not very comfortable also would be better with bedside table or shelf both sides of double bed to put drink on, great area and easy to reach all places of interest staff were very helpful friendly and well mannered very clean lovely lounge and library and excellent breakfast
38793,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, room far too hot had to turn radiator down from hottest setting when I arrived as room was already baking Very hot all night had to have window open , Excellent location friendly staff

38796,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The independent Food Service company that has the menu in the room 4 separate times after the 5pm opening time they just did not answer Opening at 5pm if they do exist is too late I was doing some work at 1pm and it s a pain to get food here that s all , Staff
38797,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Location right next to tube station Lancaster Gate and to Hyde Park Very quiet area Staff nice and helpful although when I asked what was more economic for the journey I had to make between private cab or a black cab I think the lady really knew what was cheaper but she wouldnt tell me Overall very good and economic especially bc it s London and it s not easy to find a nice clean and well located place unless you re willing to pay a super expensive price
38798,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, Really comfy double bed I did book a quadruple room but we had a sofa bed not two single beds the kids weren t too impressed but it was only for two nights so fine The breakfast was brilliant really recommend it 
38799,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The normal double rooms are too small , The staff was very friendly also they upgraded our room as there was no space to place the baby cot in the room that I ve booked Air conditioned rooms which is an advantage during the summer Also enjoyed late check out at 1 00pm as a genius benefit by being a member of Booking com
38800,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Payment on check out Their system is confusing eg you pay up front when booking but then they cancel that transaction and then recharge Go figure , Location very good particularly as Hyde Park was just around the corner as was the Lancaster Rd BTS Room and facilities were small however very clean and surprisingly contemporary Breakfast excellent 
38801,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The room was the smallest I have ever seen And very noisy from a kitchen fan The size of the room was nothing like the picture online and was extremely uncomfortable, all the reception staff were excellent
38802,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, The over all appearance and feel of the Hotel was both cosy and welcoming The Staff were superb and even made a courtesy call to my room to check I was happy with it 
38803,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, 1 Both mornings the whites of the fried eggs were not cooked and runny 2 Anti British feelings expressed by the barman who was not English 3 Encouraged to leave the hotel early and cleaning staff tried to enter the room when we both trying to get dressed 4 Woken up at 6 am each morning by the noise of the extraction unit for the kitchen 5 Location spoiled by the run down derelict buildings next to it 6 No restaurant unusual for Best Western , great location with loads of nearby restaurants with different choices very clean and on the whole very friendly staff 
38804,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Very small room Also very quiet on the night I stayed , Close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations and convenient for Hyde Park Clean and friendly hotel with recently refurbished rooms Very good value for money on a winters Sunday night Useful bolt hole if you are arriving from Paddington leave your overnight bag at the hotel and travel light
38805,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The size of the room it was more like a cupboard very awkward to enter as the bed was situated right next to the door so no space to manoeuvre especially with a suitcase and how noisy was the chambermaid on the 4th floor She stomped around from 7am to and fro from the laundry outside room 403 The room was quiet when she wasn t around , Good location and the breakfast served was very good with a good selection and very attentive and friendly waitresses
38806,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Incessant slamming of doors in the corridors will keep you awake as the rooms are not well sound proofed Pigeons are roosting outside the windows so don t leave your windows open , Convenient location for buses and trains from Paddington Clean renovated bathrooms although quite small 
38807,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Room view overlooking walls and roofs of other buildings On check out reception was rude on a bar bill which I never consumed and was charged to my room despite I informed her I never had anything from bar , Cleanliness in room 
38808,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The only negative was the housekeeping our room only had towels and toilet rolls replaced but no hoovering cleaning or replacement of bedding which obviously needed changing at one point at all throughout our 4 day stay , Great customer service staff couldn t do more for you Great facilities with gym and computer with printer available as two examples Lovely luxurious feel throughout Great uplift of rooms even at entry level 
38809,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Some staff were very rude Very early in the morning a staff woke me up with rude knocking the door for asking whether smoked And without sorry went out , Breakfast was good The subway was close

38812,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, 6 steep steps to the entrance A bit difficult with a baby pushchair and luggage No fridge in room Ordered room service which took over an hour and was then delivered by a courier from a food house not belonging to the hotel which was not particularly nice , Staff were very friendly and helpful Location was excellent
38813,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The bed could have been wider and there was a minor plumbing issue , The staff were very accommodating and moved us to a better room when we found that it would mean one of us climbing over the other to get to the toilet 
38814,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel is in a good location very close to an underground station The breakfast was very good All staff were friendly and helpful 
38815,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Fire Alarm went off 2 in the morning after evacuating was informed that a showers steam set off the alarm untrue Thin walls and ceiling heard everything Bed not of good quality and had to be pushed together Staff not professional in their approach, Location
38816,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Although I booked a room with a king bed I was given a room with a queen bed when I informed the staff the said thats what available and booking com has made a mistake I made a request for extra bed the hotel staff denied receiving any advise from booking com obviously there is a miss communication between the hotel and booking com This has cause discomfort as our 7 years child had to sleep with us in a queen size bed , The Hotel location
38817,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Shower taps with no labels to say this one s on off this one s hot cold and some arrows to show which way to turn, Friendly welcome clean rooms Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice Convenient for the West End 
38818,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, We had a lower underground room next to the dining room which opened at 7am so did disturb us slightly Also there was lots of noise and snoring that we heard above us throughout the night , Fantastic location for a few days in London with our daughters 
38819,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, Extremely disappointed with our stay 1 Overpriced we took an executive suite which are the best rooms but these had zero sound proofing with every noise heard from corridor other rooms street noise etc and the rooms were also uncomfortably hot This was in October 2 staff lacking customer service skills reception duty manager Inability to deal with several issues during our stay the hotel is understaffed in my opinion I would not recommend this hotel to anyone this has also severely tainted my view of the Best Western brand , The only minor positive I can say is that the location was ok for visiting central London However do not be fooled by the brochure pictures of the exterior on approaching the hotel entrance you will find that the adjoining building is abandoned and boarded up not giving a particularly good first impression 
38820,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, There was no plug in the sink and the staff had no idea how to find one until housekeeping came in the following morning not very helpful as I had left by then , Breakfast was excellent Although the hot food was buffet style it was very fresh and regularly topped up Loved the self squeeze orange juice

38840,Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park, The only complaint I ve had with any of the hotels or inns where I stayed in the UK is that they don t have bell staff to help guests with luggage I would have thought that in the more expensive London hotels like this one there would have been bell staff or a concierge ,No Positive
