239690,Melia Paris Notre Dame, Only complaint was A C either it was not working well or hotel should not be advertised as air conditioned As Americans we expected cool and the A C did not deliver , Excellent location tucked away on a quiet street about 2 blocks from Notre Dame Cathedral Food options all around Great walking to everything including transit Room was small for Americans but great use of space design including high ceilings Felt luxurious and classy Staff was always accommodating Definitely recommend and would use again 
239691,Melia Paris Notre Dame, Nothing to improve it was perfect , This is a gem of a hotel Perfect location and excellent customer service especially from Antonio at the front desk He engaged us with his historical knowledge of Paris and gave us amazing advice about where to go tan m you Antonio 
239692,Melia Paris Notre Dame, I did not like in this hotel 1 The staff were unprofessional 2 I had booked 2 rooms one of the rooms the A C was not working and they keep telling us that it is going to be fixed but nothing happened at the end and during my checkout I came to know that some rooms A C does not work at all 3 WI FI was not working 4 the toilet is separate from the bathroom the problem is the toilet very small that if you are a big person you will not fit in, Nothing
239693,Melia Paris Notre Dame, The main problem was the lack of air conditioning that I read before booking the hotel Fortunately the outside temperature was around 22 23 degrees so it was relatively ok The hotel offered us the opportunity to stay at the sister hotel but it was not the case with us I see that the AC problem has not been fixed yet , We liked the location every time in Paris we are in the Latin Quarter and the hotel s appearance its cleanliness and the cleanliness of our room We did not have breakfast at the hotel The room was relatively small but it was ok But the small problems did not seem important anymore due to the competence and courtesy of the staff 
239694,Melia Paris Notre Dame, Nothing to report , There are a lot of hotels to choose from in Paris not an easy task unless you have a recommendation After a little research we choose the Melia for its location and considered the area to be better than some What a surprise the Melia turned out to be just perfect for a stay in Paris The Seine is 2 minutes walk plenty of restaurants in easy reach and a number of the museums and attractions within easy reach The staff were very friendly and helpful Antonio going out of his way to make our stay a little special Breakfast is good and sets you up for the day Would we return to the Melia when next in Paris yes we would 
239695,Melia Paris Notre Dame, My room and bathroom were very small It didn t bother me as I was on my own but a couple may struggle I paid an extra 20 euros to get a Notre Dame view but really the view was only very partial Still it was a nice quiet ish room apart from when the heating came on which sounded like someone was hoovering nearby , The hotel was very pretty and located in a quiet street a stone throw away from Notre Dame Rooms and bathrooms were well appointed and the staff was lovely Breakfast was varied and very fresh 
239696,Melia Paris Notre Dame, All public rooms at hotel uncomfortably warm We opened our room window but anywhere else was sweltering Also room at 350 euros was very tiny Though view delightful , Wonderful location delightful front desk staff excellent breakfast Honor bar welcome Gracious welcome from front desk daytime clerk helpful and warm A real asset to the hotel 
239697,Melia Paris Notre Dame, Street can be loud at night if the window is open Bed a bit on the hard side Breakfast overpriced for the variety quality, Excellent Location In a way charming Nice idea of serving yourself a drink as if at home in the pretty foyer room of course charging it to the bill 
239698,Melia Paris Notre Dame, Overheated areas bar breakfast room, This was a beautiful well maintained hotel with an ideal location We loved everything about it facilities were excellent Breakfast was expensive but extensive and delicious Highly recommend this hotel 
239699,Melia Paris Notre Dame, First of all I arrived lugging 2 bags and there were two ladies at the reception and neither of them acknowledged the fact that a guest had arrived till I opened the door and asked for help with my bags Then the lady who checked me in was rude and condescending My husband made the reservation and used his card I had said card on me when I checked in but I was told that since the card wasn t in my name I couldn t use it I m sure she would have thrown me into the street if I hadn t asked if I could pay cash It was even more ridiculous because I had just arrived from Brussels where I had used the same card to pay for my room Then there was the search for an iron but a very nice member of staff was kind enough to track one down just in the nick of time He was really helpful , I m not sure what it was but it was very comfortable to sleep in 
239700,Melia Paris Notre Dame, The decoration of the rooms especially the bathrooms quite a bit and the reception and bar a bit was overall terrible The wallpaper in the rooms was coming off in areas and the design choice was terrible The bathrooms looked like something from a 90s Russian oligarch s house The carpet in the bedroom was dreadful The rooms are not very big either None of this would have mattered if it hadn t cost so much money 330 a night The value for money was not even close so I would not stay there again unless they halved their prices, The location was excellent and the staff were extremely nice
239701,Melia Paris Notre Dame, The lift was a bit small and the bath had a bit of a drainage issue Everything else wonderful though and would definitely return , The staff were a delight 
239702,Melia Paris Notre Dame, Shower water pressure was poor and there is an feeble unmanned honesty bar for guests to use in the lounge area , Location is superb staff awesome room was lovely Highly recommend 
239703,Melia Paris Notre Dame, The bed was hard and uncomfortable It was also uncomfortable to sit on to watch TV as it moved away from the wall if you leaned back It was the worst bed we had out of 11 hotels we stayed in on our trip round Europe , Location and desk staff were great 
239704,Melia Paris Notre Dame, We had quite a nice stay of 4 nights as a family with 2 rooms but got very disappointed in the end as we had to find out that our luggage stored at reception during the last day got searched and some cash amount had disappeared as result This is very disappointing for a 4 star hotel and totally unacceptable ,No Positive
239705,Melia Paris Notre Dame, AC in room did not work and made the room smell of curry Needed to sleep with the window open which made it noisy A kettle for tea would have been nice Shower was terrible not much water coming through although the pressure for the bath water was fine My freinds were upgraded to a superior room and had a mouse in it they also had slippers bathrobes and a kettle Room much too expensive Taxi could not find the place , Location was very good staff very nice Breakfast OK but downstairs in basement no windows 
239706,Melia Paris Notre Dame, One small detail to replace the bath soap and shampoo Not so successful , The hotel is clean and equipped with good taste and has very good location There are two metro stations just three minutes walk from the hotel and RER station with direct lines to CDG airport and to Chateau Versailles The hotel is located near the Notre Dame de Paris and there are lot of restaurants and cafes with reasonable prices Nonetheless surrounding area is very quiet and safe The hotel staff is very friendly and demonstrate a willingness to help with any question or problem The rooms with reasonable size bright has insulated windows very clean tidy and quiet at night The bed mattress towels and linens very high quality The hotel provides to every guest a map of Paris and metro map for free In addition excellent room service and service for bags storing I want to mention again the wonderful staff of the hotel Thank you for a memorable holiday experience 
239707,Melia Paris Notre Dame, It s not worth to hire a room with a view to Notre Dame Pillows are uncomfortable , Very close to Notre Dame metro and Railway to airport Rive gauche Quartier Latin and Le Marais at short walk The staff are very nice 
239708,Melia Paris Notre Dame, The bed was very hard however they did place a memory foam cover which helped for a comfort sleep on the second night , Breakfast was lovely so we decided to eat there every morning Staff very helpful in guiding us how to use the metro and which lines to take 
239709,Melia Paris Notre Dame, Room interior looked a bit dated when compared to the fashionable style of the exterior I love the entrance of the hotel and the lobby of the hotel, Location was fantastic I really recommend this hotel if you would like to stay near Notre Dame Safe to explore in evenings it s so conveniently located Hotel staffs was so kind I liked the view from our room s window 
239710,Melia Paris Notre Dame, the breakfast room is in the basement the hotel is still ok but will need a restoration soon , the location ist perfect room size was fine atmosphere was very nice i loved the little front garden it lets you forget your stress toilet is extra very comfortable
