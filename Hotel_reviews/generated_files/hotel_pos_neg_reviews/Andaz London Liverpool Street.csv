178958,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The hotel is too expensive for the quality on offer It is not clear what this hotel is trying to be It isn t classy fun trendy or business like just a mediocre refurbishment that has killed any character or soul this hotel might have had in its glory days One night was enough , The Japanese restaurant is good the air conditioning works and the bedroom was big 
178959,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Thrown out of bar with locals hotel bar doesn t have as good a selection of drinks A bit sparse not such a homely feeling Sausages a little anemic and under cooked Very expensive experience No alcohol in the mini bar , Good breakfast nice bar nice large room
178960,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Didn t think the hotel was worthy of 5 stars rooms were tired and small We were not happy with our first room but were offered a better room after , The location was great Bed was comfortable Great complimentary soft drinks in the room 
178961,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, All staff are friendly and go out of their way to make you feel at home Giovanni head of breakfast service was very attentive and great proffesional The hotel is in a great location next to Liverpool train station and Spitefields market Lots of shops bar restaurants Bedroom was small but well equipped and very comfortable Only criticism the blinds didnt cover the morning light so if you are a light sleeper this might bugg you 
178962,Andaz London Liverpool Street, I don t think anything could have improved our stay very satisfied , The staff were particularly pleasant making us feel welcome from the out set and the fruit bowls in the foyer were a bonus Complimentary soft drinks in the room fridge were a welcome feature of this hotel takes away the fear of drinking a bottle of water only to find a whopping charge at check out The location is spot on with everything you could want close by Liverpool street station is practically next door but we had no train noise disturbing us 
178963,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The check was as bad as it was during my last visit several years ago One of our three rooms was not ready when we arrived which is a very common failing in 5 London hotels when I pay for a room to be available at a particular time arrangements are made on that basis and it s very un professional that they are not ready However but it s the system of checking in that is do hopeless a desk in the offside of the entrance hall with 4 laptops presumably so that 4 people can work at the desk but like last time only 2 of the staff in the foyer actually checking people in As it s not a reception desk where do you wait on a sofa so that if someone then comes through the doors and is nippier than you or smiles winningly at the man at the door he checks her in while you re left sitting on the sofa I note others remark on this adversely so why have the hotel not acted on it , The bed was Dry comfortable The toiletries were excellent Ren and there was a plentiful supply Excellent breakfast in 1901 
178964,Andaz London Liverpool Street, I really struggled to find anything but the approach into the hotel reception was a bit dark and at first I thought the reception area was just guest on computers not clear that it s the reception area BUT everyone very helpful , Very friendly clean and a free bottle of wine and cake for my birthday which was a lovely surprise 
178965,Andaz London Liverpool Street, There was a lot of noise from a party The pipes were also noisy The hotel was very bland and cold looking all the original features seemed to have gone , The staff were attentive The bed was comfortable The water was hot and powerful 
178966,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, We booked this hotel as a base for our wedding All the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful In particular Ali on the front desk was very helpful and resolved a booking mix up The Housekeeping staff were also brilliant on the wedding day as the bridal party got ready by bringing extra mirrors chairs and mirrors to the room 
178967,Andaz London Liverpool Street, There wasn t anything We had the most relaxing enjoyable break we ve had , Pillows were so comfy not like the balloon types other hotels have The room was bright and airy and the huge shower was fantastic We were also amazed how quiet it was good soundproofing 
178968,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The rooms needed a refurb scratched wood technology could be updated l but overall not bad for the price and size of the room But there are definitely better 5 star hotels around , Free mini bar is a nice touch
178969,Andaz London Liverpool Street, All perfect, Unbelievable generosity with honouring my husbands birthday extremely friendly helpful staff gorgeous hotel delicious complimentary breakfast the staff could not do any more to make our stay better
178970,Andaz London Liverpool Street, It felt like an overpriced Hilton inside You are paying for the location more so than the quality of the hotel , The room was a decent size and had just been redecorated but for the price was not o Pat with other lladies neon hotels we have stayed in
178971,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Need more charging points for phones close to the bed so people can have their phone close by and still on charge , It is a great location at Liverpool Street and the hotel is lovely and modern inside We at at Miyako there and it was very good 
178972,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, The king size bed was a joy to fall into after a tiring day of sightseeing and the super comfortable duvet and pillows were perfect The junior suite was nice and spacious and despite the hotel s central location it was very quiet The staff in the hotel were always very friendly and nothing was too much trouble 
178973,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The air worked but did not seem to cool that effectively despite it being on the whole time and set on low Some of the coat hooks opposite that bathroom were bent and loose which caused hangers to fall off them , The bed was very comfortable and I slept right through the night without waking up Plenty of wardrobe and hanging space bathroom was spotlessly clean effective black out curtains which was essential given the size of the windows Towels clean and good quality Ate breakfast on the morning of day two and the range and quality of the food was excellent Good strong coffee and wide range of fruit juices 
178974,Andaz London Liverpool Street, I didn t like the room and bathroom frankly and was quite disappointed when I first walked in very plain and bare considering how expensive the room is Also there are odd corners i e the sink in the bathroom is tiny and placing your toiletries is a bit of a pain I didn t like the hotel toiletries and bought my own I also didn t like the way the shower was designed and the water pressure wasn t great The room is actually quite big so there s a lot of space by the cupboard but not by the desk There was no view and that s quite depressing I got used to it and while the location is great it s way too expensive for the room , Great location staff were very accommodating and friendly Food was very high quality both breakfast and room service and even the free mini bar snacks and drinks were really good Some hotels have been known to scrimp and not top up the free mini bar but the folks at Andaz topped it everyday Nice towels 
178975,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Plumbing in the room was a little noisey but that s just being picky The breakfast at 28 is much too expensive We have stayed in many hotels but this was the highest price we ve had anywhere As there are place to eat nearby at a third of the price I would suggest a lower price and perhaps more residents of the hotel would pay , Spacious well designed room free mini bar no noise from outside and complimentary wine and canap s after 6pm Lastly the hotel is right on Liverpool station so great location 
178976,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The weather little , Bed pillows were really comfy Good location for walking or catching the tube The staff are really helpful accomodating 
178977,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Can t open the windows , Everyone was very friendly The location was great The little extras toiletries and free non alcohol bar really made the difference 
178978,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Having to pay twice and an extra 50 a night deposit on top of original price just for security reasons I had to wait a week to get the pending second payment back they took which is crazy , Rooms are excellent breakfast fantastic staff very helpful great location 
178979,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Breakfast very very expensive for what it was service charged added but service not great , the bed was one of the most comfortable I ve ever stayed in gorgeous 
178980,Andaz London Liverpool Street, nothing, The hotel was beautiful and very clean there was the most fabulous smell in it the whole time we were there like freshly laundered clothes They had added balloons and confetti to our room on our arrival as it was our wedding Anniversary and later on in the day they delivered cupcakes to us also The mini car is packed full of soft drinks that are all complementary as well as crisps and cookies The staff couldn t have been more helpful and the breakfast was delicious so much wonderful food to choose from It is ideally located for people who like to sightsee and there are so many lovely pubs bars and restaurants just a few mins away It is right around the corner from Liverpool street station It was slightly more than I would normally pay for a hotel but it was a special occasion I would definitely return to this hotel 
178981,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The bed was too soft not good for my back although this is very individual to myself you can t please everyone It would have been nice if breakfast was available that day earlier than usual for those running the marathon , The staff member who checked us in Nick was super lovely and very helpful Our bags were taken up to the room for us and a special gift left for myself as I was running the London marathon that weekend I believe our room was upgraded also When I was not able to go to breakfast due to having to get up extra early my breakfast I had brought along with me was collected toasted and brought back to my room I was also allowed to shower in the health suit after check out following the marathon 
178982,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The room was nice but we found that it was a little noisy during the night with sounds of doors opening and closing etc Also had an issue with the shower drain being clogged up We were given some compensation for these issues but if we had paid full rate we d have been disappointed Also I think a 5 hotel really should have plugs or USB charging points by the bed to enable a phone to be charged on a bedside table rather than other side of the room , The staff were friendly and welcoming It appears to have been recently updated and this has been done tastefully They also gave a discount when a couple of issues were raised with the room experience The location is convenient for the station and the hotel is well equipped with restaurants bars etc The little touches such as free coffee and drinks in reception is nice as is the free minibar no alcohol options though 
178983,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The reception area a little disjointed no actual checkin desk just computers and check in consultants The pub was a little boisterous and the champagne bar a little stuffy something inbetween would be good , The room was lovely and superking bed was very comfortable and meet and greet was good Location was excellent next to Liverpool Street Station easy access to Brick Lane and Shoreditch which we were visiting all in walking distance 
178984,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Parking was appalling and one of the reception staff was particularly unhelpful My daughter was booked in a suite to ensure that she had a good night s sleep before her wedding but the allocated room was next to a lift and she was disturbed by residents and then again by delivery vehicles at 5 am reversing into the loading bay below the room , The Restaurant was fine and very well decorated however it was very expensive as breakfast was 28 pp and we were then charged a compulsory service charge on top of the 28 
178985,Andaz London Liverpool Street, This hotel lacked a bit of soul and the eating bar options we found were limited and not what we expected for a 5 Star Hotel , Bed was very comfortable and the room was adequately clean
178986,Andaz London Liverpool Street, no replacement shower shampoo gel on second day but that was only negative , Great location and staff very helpful and friendly nothing too much trouble Had a fab time 
178987,Andaz London Liverpool Street, N a can not fault this place , Absolutely flawless service from all staff the breakfast choice was brilliant rooms were clean spacious and warm the location was great and there was a tube station just 2 minutes away for anyone wanting not to walk this place was one of the favourite hotels I ve stayed in Will be back 
178988,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Considering the price expected more and it wasn t great being woken up at 6am to renovation work on the floor above Not sure I got the full benefit of the hotel facilities as they weren t fully explained to me Bar also shut early which was fine but no option offered for in room service , Room great staff brilliant location perfect 
178989,Andaz London Liverpool Street, First we got a very small room without window and no armchair or even extra chair Not similar to the picture we saw on booking We were very disappointed and did not agree with it Alex the guy at the reception tried very hard to find a better room for us Finally we were very happy with our nice modern and confortable room Aparently there are diffret rooms at this hotel some very good and some not so good , It is a very nice hotel with excelent location The staff is nice and guests enjoy complimentry soft drinks and coffee all day in the room and at the lobby 
178990,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Needs to improve interior sound proof I could hear the guy next room sneezing and yawning, One minute next to Liverpool Street Station extremely convenient 
178991,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, Superb location easy to access all parts of London Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful Also for a Central London hotel I was amazed how quiet our room was 
178992,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, We loved our stay at The Andaz Staff were so helpful our host Sacha even sent up a chilled bottle of Prosecco and canap s with a handwritten note for our 10th anniversary Really above and beyond our expectations 
178993,Andaz London Liverpool Street, My room was located a long walk from the reception That in itself I didn t mind but I had to go through 2 key card access doors Which was annoying , Excellent hotel in a central location in London Rooms are amazing Staff very friendly 
178994,Andaz London Liverpool Street, More seating in the reception would have made it more comfortable, Location was great Room was very comfortable great shower We appreciated the free minibar and drinks in reception
178995,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The window of our room is very small , Like the design of their bathroom Almost the best design that I ve never met for a hotel guest room Generous complimentary for guests including still sparkling water organic juice and etc 
178996,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, Welcome and Check In with attention to detail although late night arrival and all room facilities explained Room very comfortable and all areas spotless found variety of breakfast choice and mini bar good 
178997,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Room 470 was really small Quite noisy from outside They will hold 100GBP upon your arrival room price for whole stay from you credit card but they ve charged me again for room after checking out Nearly week later and still holding my money , Great staff 
178998,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The room had very little daylight as the window faced a wall and into an inner courtyard, A really nice luxurious hotel with attentive staff good breakfast and good sized rooms
178999,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Not much to improve on , Had a king room The bed was unbelievably comfy Too comfy Staff was excellent we recieved a free bottle of wine for a birthday Was a nice surprise 
179000,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The facilities are not what you expect of a place like that Its nothing special really besides the location The room was basic and rather simply furnished could have used another armchair or couch or else , Staff is very nice and helpful Easy check in and out 
179001,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Expensive breakfast and could have told us that our booking included it Noisy waste plumbing and variable shower temperature 6th floor , Good breakfast Complimentary drinks Helpful staff Location next to rail station and can walk to London attractions
179002,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Windows that open it was warm and stuffy, The room was spacious and the bathroom was fabulous large well stocked with good toiletries and the shower was excellent 
179003,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Despite a lot of free computers and a number of free staff we waited over 15minutes before we could check in Normally we wouldn t have minded but we had to be at the theatre quite quickly after arriving so it was a bit stressful , The location was ideal staff extremely helpful and the benefit of a free mini bar was a nice extra 
179004,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, Everything Proximity to Liverpool Street Station was a must for us it s right next door to the hotel We were greeted by Francesco he was polite friendly professional and most attentive to our needs we were celebrating my husbands birthday and we were delighted to be so well looked after Our room was large huge most comfortable bed Large flat screen TV Tea coffee making facility with complimentary bottled water Separate bath and shower in spotless ensuite Buffet Breakfast was delicious as usual large variety beautifully presented with great service This was our 3rd stay at Andaz London Liverpool Street We are never disappointed 
179005,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Would like to have opening windows in the bedroom Personally not keen on air conditioning unless absolutely necessary and therefore difficult to regulate the room temperature, Excellent breakfast Services including evening wine and canap s a nice touch
179006,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The noise when you flush the toilet was horrible , The staff had left me balloons and confetti in the room for my birthday There was also a dessert tray delivered to the room in the afternoon 
179007,Andaz London Liverpool Street, There was nothing really nothing , We went to Andaz for my 40th birthday celebration This area of London was new to us and we totally loved it The hotel wow Location perfect About 100m from the Liverpool Train and Underground station Close to Brick Lane Spitalfields Market numerous bars and restaurants Staff more than perfect Swift check in But not just that we got an upgrade for my birthday as well as complimentary breakfast for our entire stay The room lovely beds nice and well equipped bathroom free robe and slippers as well as free water and soda tea and coffee in the minibar And the room was decorated for my birthday The hotel very calm and relaxing atmosphere with the little details that made it perfect Free coffee or water at check in and during your stay at the reception Lovely little notes on a big screen in each elevator Free wine at the reception desk from around 4 in the afternoon The restaurants breakfast was amazing So glad we got this extra There s a buffet with literally everything you might want stocked very regularly by the attentive friendly staff Plus you can order extra items that aren t at the buffet like eggs benedict pancakes gluten free items for free Made fresh to order Don t hesitate to visit their sushi restaurant as well Perfect service and fresh sushi and other dishes And then to make it all ever more perfect we received a bottle of prosecco in the room together with chocolate treats and macaroons for my birthday So yeah personal service at it s best I ll be back for sure 
179008,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The decor in the room itself could have been to a little more of a higher standard It was very clean and tidy and the bathroom was beautiful but for the price there could have been some finer touches in the room to the same standard as the lobby itself , Hotel as a whole was beautiful and has a lovely smell Lots of little added extras like pastries in the lobby all day Very friendly staff The free mini bar with soft drinks was a nice touch 
179009,Andaz London Liverpool Street, I have stayed in nicer hotels in London for a third of the price this place is not worth the money Very noisy Only mirror in the room was by the door the furthest point from the only plug sockets in the room so it was diffcult for my girlfriend to get ready Shower temperature was hard to get right A bose sound player was provided in the room with the iPhone adapter from 4 years ago Was told fridge got restocked it didn t My view was of the lobby so all I could see was the lift Terrible place don t waste your money Oh and they charged me twice , Bed was comfy and the buffet was decent
179010,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, Breakfast in the 1901 Restaurant was a wonderful experience it s spacious relaxed no queues at the buffet no rush food was superb so all in all excellent 
179011,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Payment by card was a problem a misfit between hotels POS and our ING bank system caused blocking the same amount of our stay for 5 times in pending transactions which caused a lot of lost time spent clarifying with both parties, Bed extra comfy very large and location close door to door to Liverpool station
179012,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The hotel was rather dark and dim It was not 5 star in my opinion Not good value for money , The bed was comfortable and everything worked as it should 
179013,Andaz London Liverpool Street, I already wrote a detailed feedback so I will not repeat the same points Mainly the bath plumbing system probably needs a rework and the hairdryer in the room could have been more solid , Location Great Breakfast Great really tasty stuff and good variety Staff Amazing Thanks again Sascha 
179014,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, Excellent hotel a few seconds walk to underground for easy access to the city all staff superbly friendly and helpful loved our stay and will 100 be back
179015,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The walls were a little thin and I wish my room had more natural light The room i stayed in faced the courtyard but it was right at the end of the hall so there wasn t much light , Loved the location but I m a fan of the shoreditch area The complimentary mini bar is also a huge plus staff was friendly 
179016,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The cleaning could be a lot better I found hair on the desk and on top of bedding , The staff was so nice and welcoming The location was great and the hotel is top notch

179026,Andaz London Liverpool Street, What s not to like , This was my 5th visit to the Andaz and as before I just find its always the staff who make the difference at any hotel I visit and as always the staff at the Andaz shine like a beacon for superlative attention to the clients needs we arrived quite early no problem your rooms ready free coffee on arrival superb leaving the hotel they even assist you by pushing the revolving door for you a superb hotel based at Liverpool Street Station which means that your only 10minuts away from the centre of London and all the attraction and only four stops away from Kings Cross Station on the district line A big thank you to all the staff at the Andaz or their quality and commitment 10 10

179030,Andaz London Liverpool Street, breakfast was very expensive we were asked straight away whether we wanted tea or coffee 10 minutes later nothing nobody came to see if we wanted to order anything eventually i asked where our tea coffee were and nobody knew loads of staff attending to the buffet nobody taking responsibility for customers needless to say I removed the discretionary service charge which for an expensive buffet restaurant is an absolute con I will definitely stay again but definitely wont have breakfast , staff fabulous
179031,Andaz London Liverpool Street, We were in Andaz two times I dont know why we were here now Maybe its close to our favourite sushi Samba Anyway no staff to take your luggage to and from room Its not cheap hotel to dont help you Second thing is heating we have so cold room heating was on maximum but no working Room was very simple I think price is very high for it Breakfast room very cold too and average food We also try sushi in Japanese cuisine in hotel average and not so kind staff Location is very good but our last stay here ,No Positive
179032,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Two small changes I would make the room was VERY warm for my liking It would have been nice to control this Also the shampoo and conditioner weren t the best this could be improved for a 5 star hotel , The bed and room was wonderful We really enjoyed our stay Nice staff nice free minibar and great location I would stay here again

179034,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Issues with bathroom toilet engineers had to come two times and fix it the housekeeping did not come to clean the bathroom after engineer s works All of that causing delays in my schedule of approx two hours This should not happen in 5 hotel , Location breakfast

179043,Andaz London Liverpool Street,No Negative, Andaz is the higher end boutique arm of Hyatt Location is convenient to the tube market restaurants and shops We asked for a room facing the courtyard not the street as its quieter 
179044,Andaz London Liverpool Street, This is a tired hotel and how it can be referred to as boutique as it s part of the Hyatt chain is anyones guess The rooms we re ok but not well looked after with splashes of paint on the walls with the toilet sounding like a steam train as it uses some sort of vacuum method which takes a minimum of two flushes unique experience but not a good one The glass next to the lift was smashed the booking in process is literally in the dark in that the staff have to help as you can t see what your doing due to poor lighting The room whilst adequate in size for a short stay was again tired with paint splashes on walls toilet seat in need of replacement and the phone in the bathroom of poor quality and definitely not giving the place a 5 star feeling What really shocked me was the 5 star rating no way 5 star prices in that the breakfast was an eye watering and shocking 31 50 This is a 3 possibly due to it s location and 7 restaurants 4 stars but having travelled quite a bit it can t be classed as 5 stars , Staff were helpful and friendly The hotel is situated next to the Liverpool Street mainline and underground stations with historic sites eateries pubs and the famous Spitalfields only a minutes walk Valet parking is available for 45 00 The hotel has 7 restaurants 
179045,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Nothing, The way I was greeted when I arrived to the friendliness and helpfulness of each staff member I encountered Then the beauty and decor of the hotel and facilities made it all a very restful peaceful enjoyable stay

179085,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Room was incredibly noisy till midnight and from 0530am from trains Bathroom floor a bit tired Bedroom carpet decor not what I d expect from 5 star hotel Those bedrooms would be value for money at 150 per night not 240 per night v overpriced for what it was Not luxurious but great location for my meetings , Pleasant staff Welcome drink nice idea Good fresh food for room service

179093,Andaz London Liverpool Street, If your image of a hotel in this price range is a posh neighborhood on a classic quiet street think again The hotel is camouflaged on a busy messy commercial street adjacent to Liverpool station The location was extremely convenient for the train station near the old City of London and not too far from the Tower of London However for other tourist sites it was a little inconvenient and for that reason I would probably not choose it for a return visit The traffic in central London is horrendous Getting to the Andaz in East London from central London in a taxi after arriving on the express train to Picadilly from Heathrow or taking a taxi all the way back to Heathrow on our return took a very long time , There were free snacks and beverages in the lobby all day including pastries at breakfast In the room some minibar snacks were complementary and a little sweet treat was left in the room every evening

179105,Andaz London Liverpool Street, We were unable to get a drink in the hotel after returning from a night out as everything was closed The room was comfortable but the only window opened into the hotel so there was no natural light , Staff were really helpful and check in out was painless Rooms were comfortable and had both shower and bath good location with restaurants and bars around Breakfast was very good we had to go out of the hotel to another building but it was a beautiful building and the buffet style hot and cold breakfast was really good

179114,Andaz London Liverpool Street, I didn t like the bathroom that was a personal taste thing but it was clean and very functional Breakfast was tepid again personal taste as I like my food hot on the plate I also thought that it was a tad pricey but not a deal breaker Having said that breakfast staff like all staff generally were friendly and accomodated our beans and fried eggs request all of which were piping , The staff were accomodating and friendly Free mini bar and canapes was a nice touch Being offered a drink on arrival was another nice touch The room was clean comfy and a good size for a King Nice comfy bed with great pillows always a winner I forgot my toothbrush and I was supplied with one before I could blink Free wifi was simple to access none of that login nonsense The lobby looks and smells awesome

179116,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Accidentally booked the wrong date online noticed 2 seconds after I clicked the payment button booking com so contacted hotel immediately and they flatly refused to consider changing it so gave the night away to my in laws Computer says no attitude of staff was terrible so expect the same if you have any issue with your stay here , Can t complain about the hotel itself
179117,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Couldn t find a reserved spot to drop car off for valet parking Had to pull over on double yellows and go into hotel to find member of staff I m being completely picky here though , Requested a bottle of Champagne on ice ready for our arrival as it was an anniversary surprise for my wife Not only did they have the champagne ready they also provided chocolate strawberries cupcakes card and Happy Anniversary written on slate with white chocolate Above and beyond absolutely amazing service 
179118,Andaz London Liverpool Street, There is no classical front desk but rather a lounge service area This leads to some uncoordinated checkin sometimes , The location is amazing Situated right at the heart of trandy and vibrant London Close to all hipster areas

179125,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Noise from the corridor was very apparent from within the room The AC was on a set point with only 3degrees offset We had it set on the lowest setting however he room was practiaclly unbearable They sent a maintenance man to the room who merely told us it was fine and getting colder I assured him it wasn t as we d been in there for some time yet nothing more was done on the matter We left an item in then room which obviously was no fault of the hotel however we called to ask if they could send it to us and were advised there would be a 15 charge Disgusted by the charge we told the hotel we would send someone to collect it We gave the name and time on which the item would be retrieved Unbelievably the hotel refused to give the item as they knew nothing about it being collected Very disappointed with the overall experience as id booked it as mine and my partners 1 year anniversary ,No Positive

179129,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Rather noisy construction across the road during working hours some maintenance in rooms close by However noise from inconsiderate neighbours was I think made worse by the fact that there was an interconnecting door between the two suites My sleep was disturbed on both nights until 2 am or so I enjoyed my stay but it would have been much better without this noise nuisance Unsure if I would risk another stay in the same suite shame really it is a lovely hotel , Staff were very attentive housekeeping were very good Very nice high end hotel 
179130,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The plates for the hot breakfast could have been warmed Some labels on the breakfast items would have been useful eg the plain yoghurt was mistaken for milk because it was in a small milk bottle and it was not very clear which type of milk was in each carafe , Nothing too much trouble for the staff The five rooms we booked were on the same floor as our daughter s wedding reception

179143,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The mini bar included free soft drinks it would have been nice to have a few alcoholic drinks too chargeable rather than having to order them as room service Not an issue at all though , Fantastic service and friendly staff who seem to genuinely want to help rather than feeling a bit forced as it can sometimes do Cleanest place I ve ever stayed Beautiful building with amazing restaurants and artwork Comfortable beds and all the facilities you could need Complementary canapes and wine were served in reception which was unexpected but a great start to an evening Fantastic location right next to Liverpool Street station with bars nearby 
179144,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The second night we booked on the day and got a king room same spec as the room we had the first night but the second room was pretty much half the size not sure they can both be advertised as the same spec , Staff were fabulous

179147,Andaz London Liverpool Street, The room was on the top floor 6 and one of the walls was slanted making it rather dangerous especially at night I hit the wall several times , Staff are very courteous 
179148,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Room was very hot and I couldn t open the window to get fresh air And even tho I adjusted the thermostat it didn t make any difference There was not mirror near a socket in the bedroom so I couldn t blow dry my hair with ease There was no socket beside the bed to plug in my phone charger I always check my phone before bed and when I wake up and I use my phone as an alarm so this was inconvenient, Friendly staff quick service comfortable bed and good bathroom Also very quiet 
179149,Andaz London Liverpool Street, Nothing My wife had to search for the hairdryer there is a useful hint in the bathroom cabinet where you would expect it to be saying it is in the desk drawer , Everything From the initial welcome from the hosts the large room great location next to the rail and tube station near lots of good restaurants great breakfast at the hotel Friendly atmosphere
