52131,Hilton London Paddington, The hotel did not allow me to use my HILTON Honors benefits like free WiFi because I did not book through HILTON Did not give me HILTON Honors Points credit for my one night stay because it was not booked through HILTON To the credit of the manager he did credit the 12 50 pound WiFi fee after I challenged the charge To be honest the condition of the hotel is tired and in need of a makeover The rooms are small bathrooms small and dated the walls are scuffed and the facility is not inviting I would not stay here again and would not recommend , Helpful doorman and bellman Nice breakfast 
52132,Hilton London Paddington, Not much It is a little pricey but it s the best there is if you get in from Heathrow late , It s a lovely old fashioned grand hotel with a lot of period features retained Staff were very friendly and helpful from check in to check out Nice breakfast in the morning too 
52133,Hilton London Paddington, Hot water system was very bad We had trouble both at night and in the morning The water was very cold Will not earn any Hilton Honors points HHonors nor free Wi Fi nor other kind of HHnonors benifits if booked through Booking com A hotel s staff knocked at the door around 7 45 in the morning and asked whether what time she could clean the room Could she just wait until we check out , Very good location It s easy to go to Underground station and Railway station by using Hotel s back door 
52134,Hilton London Paddington, You don t earn Hilton Honors points if you book through Booking com AND you have to pay for Wi Fi AND that Wi Fi costs over 15 a day , So convenient for the Heathrow Express
52135,Hilton London Paddington, Staff at reception seemed to lack training very slow I had prepaid for my accommodation and did not take anything from the bar fridge yet they had charged me for a drink I did not take I had to request they amend the account I also needed a sewing kit none in room had to request one be sent to the room Went downstairs for breakfast and as we didn t want the buffet had to sit in the open area to eat NOT GOOD On the second morning at about 4 40am everyone was told over the PA system to evacuate the hotel There we were standing out in the street in the drizzle with absolutely no instruction from any hotel staff as to where to stand or what was going on We had to ask the firefighters what was happening , Proximity to the station
52136,Hilton London Paddington, It was Saturday and accirding to the hotel staff Saturday is not a business day so while all the surrounding shops were open the hotel refused to open the business centre so that I could print my boaarding pass They simply refused ,No Positive
52137,Hilton London Paddington, The air conditioning was insufficient to cope with the hot weather London as experiencing at the time Our room was very warm as was the rest of the hotel , Proximity to Paddington Station was perfect for us 
52138,Hilton London Paddington, some staff a bit demure but hey that s hotels for you, Just a great place to stay for London Nice hotel with access to our own mainline station to travel in and out of London and also access to the rest of London
52139,Hilton London Paddington, Leaking tap in the bathroom that never got fixed over the 4 nights we were there, Nothing beats this place for location Room was a nice size especially compared to other London hotels
52140,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, With no early room availability after a long haul flight the use of the changing rooms at the gym allowed me to freshen up Much appreciated The concierge reception and room service staff were outstanding The rooms were large but a bit dated However were more than acceptable You can t beat the Hilton for location 
52141,Hilton London Paddington, The reception staff were not particularly friendly when they saw we had booked through Booking com , We had a really good night s sleep in a quiet room on the top floor which is a bonus when staying in a hotel It is handy for the railway station and leaving luggage 
52142,Hilton London Paddington, Poor tv reception no satisfactory response from staff when this was raised No C4 No radio 3 or 4 Rather high daily fee for internet , Room space Location Proper solid bathroom door unlike some hotels that have see through glass bathroom doors Comefortable bed Some excellent staff In particular in reception 
52143,Hilton London Paddington, paying for a small bottle of water out of the fridge on my way out of hotel in the middle of fire alarm , The room and facilities were excellent found the staff to be helpful we had a fire alarm went of at 5am Sunday morning staff and fire brigade were very professional 
52144,Hilton London Paddington, Pay for wifi in 2017 Gives a really bad impression Breakfast expensive small selection dry croissants understaffed crowded Small room small bed lack of little things like shoe horn shoe polish ,No Positive
52145,Hilton London Paddington, Mess up over bed Booked a twin bedded room but found a double This was at 00 30 Sunday after watching a brilliant concert at Wembley Plus unable to collect our luggage as Concierge was taking a break , Superb breakfast Sufficient to see us through the day 
52146,Hilton London Paddington, A lot of loud music from disco in hotel very late into the night spoilt what was other wise an vey enjoyable stay, Room very clean and tidy and excellent breakfast
52147,Hilton London Paddington, Breakfast Dining Area could have been larger for the number of guests, Very good location for Paddington Station staff very helpful and room was of a good size for a London Hotel 
52148,Hilton London Paddington, The warning on the mini bar in the room saying you will be charged for drinks even if you haven t had them , Great breakfast location Friendly staff vary helpful 
52149,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, The hotel is located just next to the train station You do not need to step outside the station as there is a lift within the station building that takes you to the hotel reception 
52150,Hilton London Paddington, The hotel doesn t have free wifi and is very expensive about 11 for normal wifi for 24 hours and 14 for premium wifi for 24 hours I ate at the Brasserie in the lobby and while the service was great the food was quite average , The hotel was in a great location for both the airport and getting around London via the tube The staff were friendly and attentive The room was comfortable and clean with 24 hour room service available 
52151,Hilton London Paddington, The shower in the bathroom could be better and the tv reception and limited tv channels could also be better, Breakfast was excellent lots of choice and high quality The bedding and the bed were so comfortable Lovely clean bathroom Excellent location being on paddington station Staff were brilliant
52152,Hilton London Paddington, The shower head would not stay up on the rest when I was using the shower and kept falling down For the price I paid I thought this was very poor Also the instructions for turning on the shower were misleading , The room was a really good size for London I had dinner in the brasserie which was excellent Breakfast was also good too 
52153,Hilton London Paddington, I think wifi should be available in the rooms and included in the price of a room , This is a lovely hotel I would say it has a retro look and perhaps some would call it dated But overall it is a very attractive hotel that has been decorated to a high standard The rooms are lovely We were lucky to get the room at a special price and as a result I was expecting the rooms to be a bit shabby Not so They are in excellent condition and very tastefully done Location is great it is just above the Paddington trains station 
52154,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Staff was great Very helpful Beds were super comfortable It is easier to get to the airport from this Hilton via Heathrow Express than it would be from an airport hotel They are literally in the train station and there is a Starbucks on site Large rooms with large bathrooms American style hotel 
52155,Hilton London Paddington, Unexplained evacuation at 2am Staff a little disrespectful towards two of our guests in their 20 s As with all London hotels it was pricey , Location size of room upgrade to breakfast as a mistake was made
52156,Hilton London Paddington, It say free wifi but it is not for free It said breakfast included but it was not included I ordered a taxi but it arrived 20 min late which meant I was late for my appointment Not great service,No Positive
52157,Hilton London Paddington, No aircon Just a sort of fan system which didn t cope at all with one of the hottest June days ever 30 degrees which as Australians we wouldn t really say was that hot But the room was like a sauna and as we were fronting out onto the main road we couldn t open the windows for the noise Worst night in a hotel ever We d stayed in the Premier Travel Inn on York Way outside Kings Cross 2 days earlier which was half the price and infinitely better I d never stay in this hotel again putting aside the aircon issue the facilities in the room were no better than the Premier Travel Inn and compared to a true luxury hotel like Storrs Hall in Windermere where we also stayed this trip it s not even in the same league , The location is great super convenient and the public areas have been renovated to a very high standard 
52158,Hilton London Paddington, The fact that the hotel refused to add on my points for Hilton honors saying I booked via booking com and thus could not credit my points nor give me free wifi , The fact that it s just by the trains
52159,Hilton London Paddington, There was no free wi fi in the room The free wi fi in public areas was very slow The tap in our bathroom didn t work properly , Booking com talked about breakfast lunch and dinner meal plans but the hotel knew only about the breakfast plan Staff in the hotel are excellent but facilities dated 
52160,Hilton London Paddington, Ambient noise from police and ambulances being close to railway station during the night Double glaze the windows a solution , Breakfast was generous with a lot of choice Service from staff is friendly respectful and efficient Very comfortable spacious room with great bathroom 
52161,Hilton London Paddington, any hotel that still expects its guests to pay for wifi services seems to be just a bit in need of money if it can t afford to give its guests such an accommodation it felt awkward to be told that if its a booking com reservation we don t give free wifi it didn t help that the room given to us was so faaaaaarrrrrrr away from the elevator our conclusion was that it was probably because it was a booking com reservation we had requests for either a late check in or a late check out neither of which was granted just a summary not possible the hotel minibar had a fine print note that anything that is moved out of place will immediately be charged to the room whether or not actually consumed how very unwelcoming and inhospitable is that , location location location can t be beat especially if you re taking the heathrow express to and from the city the terminal is right outside the hotel backdoor and the hotel porter can even take your luggage for you location wise it can t be beat while the front desk people could be nicer the concierge and the porters were simply awesome maybe they should be assigned to the front desk 
52162,Hilton London Paddington, The reception staff are not welcoming you very much feel like you are an innconvience No information was passed on once I was given room key had to ask where lifts are check out time etc Hotel is run down , The location is great if you are travelling from paddington train station 
52163,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, The cocktail bar was a bonus Enjoyed a well made Singapore Sling reminiscent of my time in Singapore Next door to and connection through to Paddington Railway Station and its shopping facilities was a very convenient 
52164,Hilton London Paddington, All good slight confusion as had altered booking from one night to two nights and the booking com platform meant I inadvertently booked two different standards of room they upgraded us to the higher standard as we are Hilton HHonors members but it was a bit tense at checkin I think front counter staff could be a bit less hostile , The beds were fabulously comfortable
52165,Hilton London Paddington, Expensive accommodation and no free WIFI if you booked thru agency like Booking com have to pay extra 12 for 24 hours , Comfort of Stay and good Location 
52166,Hilton London Paddington, The hotel provided all we asked for therefore no dislikes, Hotel was picked for comfort and close proximity to station Friendly staff and quick service for breakfast 
52167,Hilton London Paddington, No valet parking, Luxury suite with roof top Terence oversee view of Paddington area 3 stories design with comfortable bed and nice sitting area for relaxing 
52168,Hilton London Paddington, Wifi not free surprising as 220 per night Only 2 functional lifts and slow The bathroom slippers were in a cellophane pack but stained brown so not used Had not finished breakfast but was cleared and I was only away for 2 3 mins waiter did apologise and bring new coffee newspaper Shower very variable in temperature , Location very near tube Room safe Very fast checking and checkout Staff polite and friendly
52169,Hilton London Paddington, 2 devices did not work bed side phone ipod player I called the reception several times to report that but no answer I ordered a bottle of water yogurt after 10 30pm from the room service not the restaurant but I was still charged 5 tray charge which is almost more than the cost of the items which I ordered , Good mirror lighting for make up 
52170,Hilton London Paddington, Having to pay for Wi Fi in the room The shower was hard to manoeuvre and the water was not very hot or with enough pressure , Bed was nice and hard as I like them Very convenient to travel from to Paddington station 
52171,Hilton London Paddington, Defcaffinated tea not good bed too soft and only 3 free channels on TV in 21st century , Location friendly helpful staff clean and a good breakfast selection 
52172,Hilton London Paddington, very non friendly reception team careless rude we had to pay for the intent in the room because our reservation through booking we had to beg the receptions and duty manager to have late check out at 02 00 pm while the occupancy was low I could not use the HHonors points again because the reservation was through ebooking like we did a crime we had to beg them to have one single bed instead of twin we asked for good view and we had room 627 which has a long wall just in front of the window they transferred us to room 108 to solve the problem and as an apology from the desk manager and the view was the very close roof of the hotel I will never stay in Hilton Again and will discontinue my HHonors membership , Location AC
52173,Hilton London Paddington, No heating so brought in radiators Should have changed our room Towels really thin What has happened to this place It used to be so nice and stylish , The beds were comfortable
52174,Hilton London Paddington, None , Hotel is located beside Paddington station very close to both train and underground Very close to restaurants Room is clean and comfy Wide range selections in breakfast 
52175,Hilton London Paddington, When the bill was put through my door overnight the rate was 20 more than the one I booked I had the booking com confirmation and they refunded the difference when I challenged them but palaver is the last thing you need when you have an early morning train , Excellent location if you need to catch an early train flight from LHR Nice rooms and quiet for such a central location I asked for one 
52176,Hilton London Paddington, A bit pricy hence the WiFi ought to be free , The location is the best thing about the hotel easy way in and out of London tube close meaning easy excess to the whole of London 
52177,Hilton London Paddington, Room too hot even with aircon on as low as possible Took them an hour past check in time to have our room ready Not great for an incredibly expensive hotel Also lots of people staying were running the London marathon me included no offer from the hotel for post run changing facilities and no pre marathon support as is offered at other London hiltons Pretty poor considering how much it is per night to stay there , Location was perfect and early breakfast is brilliant
52178,Hilton London Paddington, No House robe and slippers , I like the location and the proximity to metro station shops restaurant and business centers In addition the staff are very pleasant and welcoming 
52179,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, The Brasserie is top class food and service are excellent I would especially like to thank Steven who looked after me at dinner time during my stay He was professional friendly and charming 
52180,Hilton London Paddington, First no wifi toldbecause we booked thru a 3rd party ie Booking com not direct that we had to pay for wifi Made us feel we d paid through some cheap booking company and Booking com is not that Our TV didn t work and we were initially told the whole floor TV didn t work and did we want to move It was 10pm and I d just run a bath so no Asked to speak to a manager and he said we d been given wrong info and he sent up a technician to repair TV Hilton get over yourself and offer all free wifi at 210 a night for a 3 5 to 4 star hotel stop being greedy , Location to Paddington Station
52181,Hilton London Paddington, Think people expect a lot from a Hilton sadly this does not deliver Rooms are very dated The mattress was so uncomfortable soft every unsprung spring could be felt Due to train problems we had to book here quite late so perhaps there would have been better rooms if we booked earlier We went on to stay in a far superior hotel some might even say it was Premier It was an ultra modern yet small Hub in a fantastic location It was brilliant we managed to get some much needed sleep on one of their far superior beds , Convenience its location at Paddington station
52182,Hilton London Paddington, Nothing to report Loved it all , I can t recommend this hotel enough We arrived early on the sleeper from Cornwall and they did all they could to accommodate us They even made sure our room was ready early so we could get changed Lovely friendly staff beautiful hotel the bed was probably the comfiest I ve ever slept in Next time I travel to London I would only look at booking this hotel Just perfect 
52183,Hilton London Paddington, The staff was mediocre They didn t seem welcoming and didn t offer any information about the hotel layout or amenities They could use some customer service training , The location near Paddington Station was wonderful Extremely convenient 
52184,Hilton London Paddington, No free wifi in the rooms cost 15 only free wifi in the lobby, Location right in Paddington station for travelling polite friendly staff given a free upgrade
52185,Hilton London Paddington, I booked a family room for three after seeing the picture of such a room on booking com which looked spacious enough with a single bed added on the side of a double bed so a long enough room In reality the room was a different type of room most likely a normal room not a family room with a single bed added at the foot of the double bed as there was no space to put the single bed on the side of the double bed and that made movement in the room very inconvenient and impractical for three , The location
52186,Hilton London Paddington, It s annoying when you pay to stay in a 4 5 star hotel and you are still charged additional fees to use the standard channels of the TV and in room wifi , In room comfort 
52187,Hilton London Paddington, Some kind of noise all night was staying upon level 5 mattress was too soft Restaurant a bit too pricey , Fantastic breakfast at executive lounge very clean hotel friendly and helpful staff Everything you can expect from Hilton 
52188,Hilton London Paddington, All the stairs once on the 6th floor I ll know the next time My mistake , Enjoyed the sandwich wine on my arrival Breakfast just right for me 
52189,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, The tower room was spacious and added extras such as the percolated coffee machine was a real plus point for me Having a sofa and chair meant I could unwind without having to laze on the bed as can be the case with smaller rooms 
52190,Hilton London Paddington, The reception staff is rude and not patient to answer queries The room is dark and tided and full of chemical cleansing smell No free wifi is provided at the room It is absolutely not worth for value , The buffet breakfast is delicious and full of choice 
52191,Hilton London Paddington, No free WFI as didn t book on Hilton site very mean in this day and age Especially as I did try to book direct originally but couldn t get it to work correctly , Three Italians nearby
52192,Hilton London Paddington, The room was not in proper order when we arrived the bed linens were not clean and we had them changed the tissue paper in the toilet was empty and we had to ask them to change the empty boxes the staff were not very friendly Being a Hilton Honors member i asked to have my check out one hour later than there check out time they told me that booking through Booking com lets you loose all your Hilton Honors privileges and that you should use Hilton booking next time i have faced this issue many times with Hilton world wide I hope you could fix this issue, The location is awesome very easy to reach from paddington train station
52193,Hilton London Paddington, Nothing , Excellent Hotel Literally on the door stop of the train station Didn t avail of breakfast by choice No complaints whatsoever Will definitely recommend it to family and friends 
52194,Hilton London Paddington, Few issues with the room Staff were unfriendly and unhelpful Carpet was torn and ripped Condom wrapper in room room had not been cleaned properly at all ,No Positive
52195,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Lovely size room with king size bed nice big bath too Tea coffee making facilities are also a bonus All the amenities too Central staircase is very grand and picturesque Location is unbeatable to get around London 
52196,Hilton London Paddington, Discriminatory policy regarding complimentary WIFI is unacceptable for a hotel in this price range It should be available to all guests not just those booking through Hilton LIkewise limiting complimentary water to Hilton Members is cheap ,No Positive
52197,Hilton London Paddington, Wasn t there long enough to notice, The reason I stayed at this hotel was that I had to go to Exeter early the next morning by train and it s a 2 minute walk from the bedroom to the platform I have stayed locally before but the hotel I usually use is more expensive and not so comfortable I used the gym on arrival and the facilities although a little cramped were excellent 
52198,Hilton London Paddington, Paid WiFi Really Bathroom facilities dated and tired , Room size was great and location very convenient The beds were excellent Nice open and spacious lobby with valet and doormen Business centre facilities were everything you d need with excellent buffet food snacks and service
52199,Hilton London Paddington, Staff was too rude when I have asked about the internet He even told me if I do not like I can write my complaints to internet blogs , Only the location was okay
52200,Hilton London Paddington, Breakfast in room dining was great but too much food which could have fed a party of three Long queue at booking in which takes too long, Situation location overall comfort and very quiet bearing in mind busy spot 3rd floor 
52201,Hilton London Paddington, However the front desk staff are a little off hand and not particularly helpful Even though booked through Booking com Hilton usually they ensure I get the loyalty bonuses free wifi etc but not the points here it was dismissed and not even addressed The hotel is relatively expensive compared with others around that offer more for less , The hotel is clean tidy and generally good quality The breakfast was well stocked and the staff made our rambunctious 3 year old feel he was important enough to behave 
52202,Hilton London Paddington, Our room wasn t ready despite us checking in an hour after official check in time Our tv did not work and this was found out late at night Nobody answered the phone when we called down for 15 minutes In the morning we found the kettle did not work Again the phone was not answered for 5 minutes We asked them to send us up tea for two and when it arrived it was coffee for one After speaking to the manager we did get some discount off our room If you are on business I d say it s ok We stayed because a friend who was on business was staying there and wanted to use the Heathrow Express There are lots more better hotels in London with far better service and value ,No Positive
52203,Hilton London Paddington, Could ve maybe mentioned the extra 50 deposit before I was charged for upon arrival not after I d paid for the room didn t check the amount until I d paid No issue paying 50 deposit just would ve like to have been informed before paying Reason being all payments like this I use my credit card for incase of issue getting refund , Spacious quiet room with all facilities I was a bit worried as there was no mention of tea making facilities in room but my fears were put aside as soon as I entered the room Quality fixtures and fittings throughout the hotel with extremely helpful friendly staff Breakfast was all fresh and plentiful and I would highly recommend the instant pancakes 
52204,Hilton London Paddington, The fact that i had to pay the wi fi connection , Excellent location next to train and metro stations the staff extremelly friendly and deady to acomodate any need The bed fantastic
52205,Hilton London Paddington, Paid Wi Fi The air con in the room seems uncontrollably warm for winter Facilities are a bit older to liking , Location is perfect Easy to go around whether it is by tube or train 
52206,Hilton London Paddington, No complentary wifi TV Also booked double bed but was given twin beds which was annoying as i made it clear in the requests i was surprising my fianc e why would we need twin bed I find it hard to believe that such a well known Hotel doesn t provide free internet tv it charges for everything Was charged just for flicking through some channels which i didn t each watch and asked for refund for that , Clean spacious room Great breakfast selection
52207,Hilton London Paddington, The bar closed really early on Saturday evening not long after 22 15 Although it was explained that it was due to potential trouble from non residents that is something that needs managing as it spoils the enjoyment of and is too restrictive to the residents , The room was great the location ideal and the food was really plentiful and good quality 
52208,Hilton London Paddington, Concierge staff was well care for my needs , Croissant was extremely bad in quality No free wifi under booking through booking com It shows that the hotel doesn t pay into real attention to guests collected by booking com 
52209,Hilton London Paddington, The surrounding area is not one of the better places in London , Great Hotel wonderful concierge who was very good with my disabled wife Executive rooms excellent with a good free breakfast 
52210,Hilton London Paddington, Business location is good , The payment of tariff did not include the paid wifi and I really don t think booking com should put in this written term with a general booking Nowaday wifi is as common as air condition that should not be classified as extra request which is subject to payment 
52211,Hilton London Paddington, They did not have my reservation They treated me like I was some fraudster I waited 40 mins before they could verify my booking and let me in Disgusting treatment, Located close to station
52212,Hilton London Paddington, Staff were rude Hotel room drab not modern at all felt like I was in a bad 70s horror movie , Location was great really close to Paddington station Restaurants were close and many to choose from as well 
52213,Hilton London Paddington, The room was freezing cold the central heating wasn t working and got a cold as result They ve sent a technician to fix it without success I ve paid a lot of money for my accomadation but my experience was appalling to put it mildly , The bed 
52214,Hilton London Paddington, Reception check in was very busy and understaffed and a trainee was left to check me in on her own but she was a little slow and made a few small errors , Lovely Art Deco style hotel Great central location Also great for Heathrow express as it s three minute walk away Bedrooms are really nice and the bed was fantastically comfortable Didn t have food so can t comment As is often the case mini bar prices are extortionate
52215,Hilton London Paddington, The staff on reception The receptionist who checked me in looked tired and dishverelled and seemed so miserable in her job and when she did speak I could not understand her , The proximity of the hotel to St Mary s Hospital
52216,Hilton London Paddington, Old facilities Room air con did work properly bit cold initially then repaired but not stable all the time , Excellent location easy transportation
52217,Hilton London Paddington, I was surprised that this particular Hilton hotel was so ran down and very badly managed My TV was definitely from the last century and didn t work the clock was showing a wrong date and time the room was dated bathroom was very dated and the plug was stuck The plug control handle was broken The mirror in a bathroom was discolored and chipped I got a discounted rate so my room so I wasn t too upset but if I would have paid for such a room over 200 a night the usual rate I would be very disappointed This particular hotel doesn t deserve a Hilton name because it feels like a two star motel on Route 66 , The only thing I liked about this hotel is that it is literally at the Paddington train station Which was very handy for my travels 
52218,Hilton London Paddington, bed not comfortable tv ancient and not working on arrival had to pay for wifi tired looking room , view over paddington station the bath the lobby the location 
52219,Hilton London Paddington, Breakfast was very poor does not worth their money I m not recommending to include breakfast and bathroom was a little dirty but tolerable , Location great especially who s travel by train and comfort on the high level Room was very spacious and big for London standard 
52220,Hilton London Paddington, Checking in and out lovely staff but weak understanding of English language meant that sorting things out took time which led to queues Needed more staff available , Excellent concierge service lovely room very helpful at breakfast
52221,Hilton London Paddington, Boring cafeteria like restaurants all at the lobby level which remind one of being at a railway station during rush hour Everything seems stressed hectic and not least noisy Trying to buy space for a meeting in the executive lounge was burdensome and once in there you found yourselves with all the others who have tried to escape the lobby and restaurant area that it served no purpose The meeting rooms arrangements are so formal and expensive without being effective In the ideal world one would like to invite people for a breakfast meeting lunch meeting and dinner meeting but that does not work lots of noise nil privacy and the hotel staff who are probably quite service minded are all so busy stressed that you are left with just one thought lets get out of here fast , Its like having your meetings in the airport super convenient location for a roundtrip quick set of meetings 
52222,Hilton London Paddington, Red wine in the bar was terrible please find a better one to serve for late evening post theater drinks Whole bar area has little to recommend it in terms of decor and comfort , Great access to Heatrhrow Express and other Paddington trains Overall hotel has a very nice ambience 
52223,Hilton London Paddington, I didn t like the room service I call three to four times and they didn t answer I was really surprised because this is the first time hapened to me in any of the hotels usually it takes you few seconds and then they answer but this time I was waiting for someone to answer but no one did , I like the location
52224,Hilton London Paddington, My Wallet been stolen in the Lounge It was too obvious that the cleaner stole it as I forgot it in the Lounge s toilet The cctv approved that but no one supported me What I hated much was the duty manager on that day whereas he didn t show any sympathy he was so careless and he didn t try to manage the situation , The Location was fine the gwt Room was good size 
52225,Hilton London Paddington, If you are in town to explore London there are more locations that are convenient , The hotel is very conveniently located should you need to leave early or arrive late at Heathrow The Heathrow Express starts and terminates at Paddington station and the hotel is linked to the station The staff were friendly and the rooms are comfortable The room is a very decent size compared to other hotel rooms 
52226,Hilton London Paddington, A bit impersonal Paid for wi fi, The hotel is fine as it goes The real selling point is it s proximity to Paddington Station and for that it can t be beaten Not a bad price for central London either
52227,Hilton London Paddington, TV routed on a stand at end of bed too close and not movable and room smaller than other hotel suites I ve stayed in, good size bathroom and if weather had been nicer would have used terrace Breakfast better than previous stays much improved
52228,Hilton London Paddington, At Check in stood for 5mins before any of the reception staff asked me what I wanted Unless I went through room service no and got connected by them no attempts to call reception were answered I tried for 45 mins Not really good enough ,No Positive
52229,Hilton London Paddington, cooked breakfast could ve been nicer tinned mushrooms not fresh bacon was tough as possibly overcooked and sitting there too long , spacious room high ceilings
52230,Hilton London Paddington, Cancelled my reservation before 6 00pm on day of arrival I arrived at 3 00pm to find I had no reservation Said credit card was declined earlier in the day I was intending to use a different card and had not notified the card they tried to bill that I was leaving the USA That was reason for declination Reservation should have been held until 6 00pm , Convenient location with easy access to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express 
52231,Hilton London Paddington, Poor hygiene in bathroom Other guests belongings still in room someone s phone SIM card Room obviously not cleaned properly Cigarette smoke smell in room Fingerprints and dust everywhere Private function going on in hotel we were on 4th floor and told we would not hear anything but could still hear noise through early hours Really unsatisfied considering this was a treat for Christmas Will not be staying with this chain again , convenient location and quick check in and check out 
52232,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Great location accessible from Paddington station so it s convenient to the Heathrow Express when the Heathrow Express is running It was not in fact running for several days around Christmas but the area is still convenient to many other places in London The rooms were very large for central London and the bathrooms were modern large and comfortable 
52233,Hilton London Paddington, Expensive breakfast option We went round the corner to a trip advisor highly rated called Mimo s and got a superb breakfast for 15 less than the hotel , Excellent staff in the concierge who were polite and friendly Bed was really comfy Hotel decor and styling made you feel special Great location too Easy check out was useful
52234,Hilton London Paddington, Booked family room children s bed left outside room and not made until I complained a number of times took them till 8 45 pm to get sorted from3pm Was disappointed to say the least never had to complain ever Then to top it off had to knock at the neighbouring room because of screaming kids at midnight Hotel stay to forget i think , Location great close to tube
52235,Hilton London Paddington, Didn t get told about the 50 a night deposit before hand for the mini bar and other services, The bed was comfy and the room was spacious The staff were exceptionally nice
52236,Hilton London Paddington, Stay away from this hotel They gave us a room in a banquet room floor where they apparently booked a party that was going on until 3am We had to request a room change at 1am and got a much smaller room than what we originally booked Our other guests who stayed at GWR royal suite room suffered from no heating and NO HOT WATER Stay away far away from this hotel , Location
52237,Hilton London Paddington, Everything was not the same as shown or said when i booked the hotel trough BOOKING COM 1 The air condition was not working We called reseption several times they send enginior comes at 0800 any way we called at 0810 and a guy called enginior came to room and as result they send me one heater to keep us warm While the heating equipment was Daikin and is suppose to be of the best type 2 The lightning switch were not working during the night we woke up severl times and we got crazy sleeping with light on 3 The dush in showeroom was nicely built BUT under the dush The water got kold in first day and after that in day two still There was cold water we could not get shower while staing from 23 12 26 12 We use wet towel in order to clean the body 4 For breakfast they told us that as tower seuit room which must be the best room paid to hotel we get excecutiveplace to eat Here was not enough place to sit Here the quantity of breakfast was very cheap and little choices This iis while we paid exra for breakfast 5 Internet and wifi we called zero and got a code After 2 hours person number two in the room called reseption and lady told me that we have to pay extra I protested and the lady said you have not boked trough us and that is why, The location of the Hotel was ok near Paddington station and near the Hide park
52238,Hilton London Paddington, The air conditioning did not work and the room was too warm I have read similar feedback from the other guests and it will be great if the Management can look into this It was the only negative aspect in an otherwise pleasant stay , The room was spacious clean and well equipped The location and breakfast was excellent 
52239,Hilton London Paddington, no access to free wifi initially as staff explained that is only available for direct bookings not via booking com after some persuasion they agreed to give will be great if booking com could help with this in future , superb convenience as it is linked to paddington rail and tube clean warm room roomy considering it is in prime location in London great breakfast 
52240,Hilton London Paddington, No free wifi despite being Hilton Honors members because we didn t book directly with Hilton we also didn t receive HHonors points for the same reason Bed was tiny and the TV didn t work properly , The location was good being virtually in Paddington Station the cheap room was however a 5 minute walk from reception After getting out of the lift the walk to the room included stairs which was difficult considering the amount of luggage we had no offer of assistance from the concierge 
52241,Hilton London Paddington, we asked for a brandy and received it in a tumbler and not a brandy glass even in derby in a low class pub you get a brandy in a nice glass , was a nice stop but was very embarrassed when cleaner walked in our room when we had just come out the shower and naked on the bed do your cleaner know how to knock and I think your cleaner will know who she is
52242,Hilton London Paddington, Long wait at check in even after being moved to another desk with no apology for long wait Saturday night disco could be heard and felt on third floor until passed two o clock a m even though event board said event would end at 23 55 Sleep impossible Was told first and second floors were blocked off Could not get hold of reception or concierge on room telephone no answer Still waiting for management reply to complaint , Convenience to station and size of room and bed 
52243,Hilton London Paddington, Entrance reception sitting and breakfast area out dated felt like the 80th You need to redo the firstfloor to match the name Hilton and location , location service at the door and greate english breakfast

52246,Hilton London Paddington, The temperature control system didn t work properly in fact hardly anything in the room work so was ending up being awake all night because the room was too warm and it s winter ,No Positive
52247,Hilton London Paddington, Thought the room standard was a little low Some bathroom plugs were fiddly to work shower over bath worked OK I suppose but not going to suit everyone couldn t turn all lights off from bed Aircon TV channel menu system and choice not great compared to other hotels ,No Positive
52248,Hilton London Paddington, They took a 50 a night deposit onto my visa card which when we booked out would not automatically debit back to my account They said it would take 7 10 days which is disgraceful I don t know what they would do if you were staying a week or two If its a short break I would suggest you give then the deposit in cash so they give you the cash back , Clean rooms with complimentary water and tea facilities Within minutes of Paddington tube station 
52249,Hilton London Paddington, Lifts very slow and only one in use Staff impersonal unless you are obviously wealthy Breakfast very standard nothing special , Beds comfy Superior family double room a good size

52253,Hilton London Paddington, we only had cold water as out thermostat was broken Discovered it in the morning when too late to be transferred to another room We reported it in the morning and we are still waiting to hear from Hilton the manageress assured us we would hear from you, nice staff and very comfortable bed
52254,Hilton London Paddington, I had sent a message with my booking Nobody got back to me about it Not even acknowledging it was read It would have been fine if they said there was nothing they could do But it seems like nobody read it or simply didn t care about my request I wanted to make the stay more special for my wife that had her 30th birthday while we where staying at the hotel Hotel was nice but no extra service I just felt like a guest not a valued guest , Breakfast was great
52255,Hilton London Paddington, Perhaps a little noisey Given that it was so centrally located though it is reasonable to expect a little bit of noise , Very conveniently located The rooms were large and comfortable Nice hot shower with plenty of pressure 
52256,Hilton London Paddington, A strange phenomenon one is charged for removing any item from the mini bar whether it is used or not Case in point I wanted to look at the brand of sparkling water took it off the shelf read the label replaced it and was charged I presume electronic sensors indicate when something has been moved ,No Positive
52257,Hilton London Paddington, pillows were to soft but only for my liking i could have been sleeping without one also i know it was cold while we were there but the temp all over hotel was waaayyyyy to hot to the point it was uncomfortable these are not big issues and would not prevent me from returning in fact i would highly recommend , Great Location staff were very friendly and helpful breakfast was super and spotlessly clean 
52258,Hilton London Paddington, The price of WiFi was absolutely outrageous Most other hotels have free WiFi but the very expensive charge levied for WiFi left a bad taste in my mouth I had the sense that the hotel was exploiting the needs of travelers and making a dishonest profit from this , Room was excellent as was the breakfast 
52259,Hilton London Paddington, The lady that checked us in struck me as a little miserable although she didn t do or say anything bad to us a smile couldn t hurt She does work in customer service after all , The hotel overall was great The breakfast in particular was fantastic so much choice and you can eat as much or as little as you like The hotel room was very clean very quiet and homely After a busy day on the streets of London it s nice to get into your room and feel at home It was incredibly handy having a tube station right next door as the missus decided to bring half the house with her and of course I had to carry it all 
52260,Hilton London Paddington, The entryway mat outside the hotel could be swept more often , Very comfortable spacious and convenient There was even access to Paddington Station from the hotel I had a very quiet room too 
52261,Hilton London Paddington, Check in at 3pm and check out at 12pm very much disliked this , The location was very convenient for our specific purpose since we arrived from Heathrow and were taking a train the following day from Paddington 
52262,Hilton London Paddington, The reception staff were less than helpful and after several attempts to get a room key that worked we were given someone else s room We were shocked to walk in and find someone else s luggage in the room we had been given I m very glad they were not in the room at the time It s an unforgivable mistake ,No Positive
52263,Hilton London Paddington, Charge for room wi fi especially as I had booked an expensive suite Thought breakfast was a bit uninspired in the hot choice department i e Only scrambled egg no hot tomato etc, Nicely furnished rooms and location right next to Paddington station superb 
52264,Hilton London Paddington, Generally food is below average for this price range Basic and greasy similar to pub food of the old days , Rooms are a good size and location is great
52265,Hilton London Paddington, London hotel prices accommodation and bar , Excellent location to stay in the City before an early Heathrow flight It s 5 minutes from your hotel room to the Heathrow Express 
52266,Hilton London Paddington, The breakfast in the restaurant was excellent The waiting staff were excellent but dinner on the other hand was less than impressive , Very nice hotel in a great location right next to Paddington Station The room was large clean and nicely furnished 
52267,Hilton London Paddington, At breakfast food is great but my table wasn t properly cleaned for me so I had one unpleasant breakfast I got upgraded to a Deluxe Room for handicapped it is great but the water pressure is very low not enough hot water and there was rust mold on the railings on the wall Seems a bit scary But overall still a very nice place , Great comfy spacious room Nice variety of food for breakfast Great location 
52268,Hilton London Paddington, The cost of internet connection is ridiculous at 13 for 24hrs when many other establishments provide it free Plus t doesn t cost the hotel that much , Service at breakfast first class
52269,Hilton London Paddington, It s a bit soulless and I didn t appreciate paying 20 for 3 prawns with trimmings and a 175ml glass of Rioja , Recently refurbished and right next to Paddington Station
52270,Hilton London Paddington, We booked a twin room and got a double It was such a long experience booking in I was directed from reception to executive lounge that I was just too tired to complain , The food was good but on our second morning service was slow at the table Very clean and comfortable bed especially the pillows 
52271,Hilton London Paddington, Was all great , Excellent location for transport connections places to eat ease of access Very comfortable quiet spacious rooms with good amenities felt secure Staff most helpful 
52272,Hilton London Paddington, There was a party in the hotel and I could hear the music It did stop me from relaxing and sleeping initially it did stop at a reasonable hour though , The room was nice and big plenty of room The bed was rather hard compared to the Premier inn but the facilities were good I will stay again 
52273,Hilton London Paddington, you can t really compare this Hilton to Hiltons in Asian countries people choose to stay at this hotel mainly because of its location, great location spotless clean afterall it s Hilton
52274,Hilton London Paddington, Check in procedure was overly lengthy and despite not arriving until after 3pm the room wasn t ready Wi fI not free , Proximity to Paddington station very easy to walk out with luggage and get on the Heathrow Express Very comfortable bed and very clean 
52275,Hilton London Paddington, Room had interconnecting door to another room with chair pushed against it As sole female traveller was very uncomfortable Noisy all night may have been hotel ventilation system was making a noise inside my room all night , People were professional
52276,Hilton London Paddington, There were two of us staying and there were only toiletries for one Paper slippers would have been a good idea as the bathroom tiles were cool There was a stain on the curtain which surprised me , The staff were very nice and patient 
52277,Hilton London Paddington, I felt that the prices in the restaurant were high, My reason for coming was sad and personal I chose this hotel because of its link with Paddington because I was On my own 
52278,Hilton London Paddington, Our room on the fifth floor was broken into on the last night between 7 30 8 30 and the Hilton did nothing to help us Our laptops and Ipad amongst other valuable items were stolen There were no security cameras on our floor and none in the lift There were no staff at the entrance to the Hilton Paddington from the Paddington Tube Railway station And the customer service after the event was terrible We were one of two rooms broken into The hotel didn t offer us a cup of tea coffee or even a glass of water and very reluctantly agreed to get us a car to Heathrow despite the fact they knew that we had to stop all cards and had no money I am a HHonours member and have stayed in Hiltons all over the world and were appalled at their disgusting behaviour to a loyal customer in stress ,No Positive
52279,Hilton London Paddington, The door stop very near the toilet in the room I kept stubbing my toe on it, The Steam bar staff where excellent Perfect straight from Heathrow via the train and into the hotel no taxi required
52280,Hilton London Paddington, We have been staying at the Hilton Paddington several times a year for several years This year for the first time we booked a room via Booking com We arrived in the evening for the 3rd stay in a 2 week stretch and the young lady who checked us in demanded a 50 pound deposit for incidentals told us that there would be no included breakfast expected nor free internet not expected and generally treated us like we were less than welcome We were shocked at the negative attitude with which we were greeted because we booked via a travel agent This is not the general attitude that we have encountered at this hotel but it was really out of line and quite a disappointment , Beds and rooms are generously sized comfortable ultra clean and well designed We like the proximity to local restaurants and transportation options Most of the staff are incredibly nice and accommodating We stay here several times a year for business as well as family travel 
52281,Hilton London Paddington, I asked while I m booking to remove all Alcohol drinks from fridge because I have babies 3 years and 4years but they didn t Then I asked them again to do so when I checked in but they refused The person who was in charge were irresponsible for what customer wants they said their policy not allowed to remove any drinks Is your policy holly book I cancelled my stay instead of 10 nights I stayed only 2 nights I prefer to stay in hotel treat their customers as a king not as cows , The location of the hotel near to Paddington station
52282,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Staff very friendly and helpful Location is perfect for transfer to London Heathrow Literally walk through the lobby and you are in Paddington Station Very quiet at night even so located Also is a Sainsbury s in the station right below the hotel 
52283,Hilton London Paddington, When we checked in I will have to say the young man at the front desk was very unfriendly and very unhelpful Not a good way to start a hotel stay I always went to the concierge for help to avoid that staff member The housekeeping staff were very helpful however Free wifi would have been good We had just finished a tour of Cornwall and had free wifi in every one of our other hotels in Cornwall and in London It infuriates me to pay a healthy price for a hotel room and have to pay 40 a day for wifi The selection of TV channels were horrible Again our selection at the very small hotels in Cornwall were superior to the Hilton I understand you don t go to London to watch TV but with free wifi unavailable TV is important in the later evening , The proximity to the tube and the Heathrow Express The bathroom was great with counter space that can be limited in London Great restaurants very nearby Room to move around and access suitcases 
52284,Hilton London Paddington, This hotel would have been nice 30 years ago but has been in steady decline ever since The furnishings and rooms are dated and tired The staff unfriendly and unwilling Lack of attention to detail e g The back doors connecting to Paddington station were locked early in the morning meaning that guests had to walk out the front of the hotel and around to access the hotel This defeated the purpose of staying close to the station Overall disappointing and dissatisfying , Location very convenient if needing to travel on Heathrow Express to airport but not leaving too early in the morning 
52285,Hilton London Paddington, change the beds immediately as if am sleeping on concrete bed towels quality is bad and old AC constantly working , nothing is worth the money paid
52286,Hilton London Paddington, Staff is quite rude and dismissive First question I was asked is whether I booked through booking com not a very polite way to welcome a guest and gives the feeling of room allocation based on booking type Also turns out you are charged 15 for bad wifi Skype conference did not work apparently a fee you not charged if you do not book through booking com according to front desk staff at checkout Apart from the fact that wifi is free in most public spaces let alone hotels the fact that it was discriminating against a hotel guest due to the type of booking made apparently guests that book through Hilton and other sources receive a free wifi code again the words of staff at reception made it even more absurd Talking to the on duty manager that day did not help the situation at all Very obvious it is a hotel banking on its location with little regard to guests Rooms are okay but tiny expected in London I guess and in need of refurbishment , Location is great Proximity to Paddington station makes it a perfect place to explore the city 
52287,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, The location to nearby London attractions and a direct link to Paddington Railway Station and the Paddington Tube Station just across the road Comfortable bed and friendly staffs
52288,Hilton London Paddington, They dont clean well and they didnt clean the mugs and cups since i came Whenever i want a clean mugs i have to call and they keep it in the room without cleaning The staff always angry and not kind i was really disappointed , The hotel was quiet 
52289,Hilton London Paddington, The basic free wi fy is terrible I m sure the paid for version is better but who charges for wi fy nowadays , Very good location easily accessible from Heathrow Nice rooms comfortable bed
52290,Hilton London Paddington, The breakfast is the same every day , Good location The location is active even at night The staff is so nice and polite especially one lady in the reception She is one of the greatest who I meet during my traveling She helped me a lot especially when I come before the check in time She is so kind 
52291,Hilton London Paddington, Room not ready at 3pm we were told it was to be another 40mins After speaking to the manager we were allocated a room straight away , Fabulous room quiet clean very comfy bed 
52292,Hilton London Paddington, Just about everything else particularly the cost but also service food and a room inferior to a Premier Inn Breakfast food was the poorest of canteen standard and a real bunfight We left ours and had breakfast out which added insult to injury not to mention the cost I have stayed here in the past but standards have really slipped Sadly I cannot recommend , On Paddington Station therefore the opportunity to leave bags during the day before catching later train This was the only positive aspect of our stay 
52293,Hilton London Paddington, Having a cold bath on 2nd day as No hot watet was available Hotel reception said boiler was broken Not my problem but still charged us full rate Bed was lumpy windows were dirty Not looking for one of their condesending replies , Location 
52294,Hilton London Paddington, Paid wifi Not that it was too much but for the little I needed to use it made it extravagant and at the many small bites and guesthouses even Airbnb all over Uk and Europe that I ve recently stayed in wifi was free , Perfectly positioned for a great nights accommo prior to departure next day via Heathrow express to airport Nice food and a few cocktails staff were lovely express checkout was great Fantastic to walk thru link straight from hotel onto Paddington station 
52295,Hilton London Paddington, I didn t like the way the rooms are cleaned more attention please, could you sit your guest who come in group check in to avoid the reception been crowded 
52296,Hilton London Paddington, When we first checked in the girl behind the desk said we could have access to the lounge but we didn t I would have thought we would have at least had breakfast included for the money , The location as we were staying the night with a 4 year old it made it easier for him to be near train underground stations The Room was ok it was big enough for the 3 of us
52297,Hilton London Paddington, Some of the staff were really unskilled and obviously not capable to work in a 5 hotel Big headache to get from the ground floor to the towers section changing elevators going through doors and quite a lot of walking , Excellent location just next to the station Nice recently refurbisheed room art deco stytle with large bathroom Clubfloor breakfast was quite good 
52298,Hilton London Paddington, No breakfast before 6 00 am not even room service before 6 00 am consodering the location this is a transit hotel where the guest are leaving early to the airport There was a constant loud noise from AC or other equipment No bathrobes or slipers in a 5 hotel Internet is 12 in 2016 , Location
52299,Hilton London Paddington, Was in Room 263 on night of August 27 28 Problem 1 Massive dinner party with very loud music in Great Western Room directly below me Unable to sleep until music stopped at midnight Asked to speak to duty manager but he was too busy checking people in to see me Problem 2 Consistent cigarette smoke smell investigated and determined it was possibly due to smoke coming in the room windows from some area between the hotel and Paddington station , Room was well appointed and clean Hosted a 6 person party at the restaurant and the staff there was very friendly and professional 
52300,Hilton London Paddington, I was happy with everything Except the fact that one has to pay for the WI FI, I liked the fact that it is really central and a lot of places can either be reached on foot or tube The staff were really helpful and welcoming My daughter felt at ease and loved the spacious room and the hotel as a whole It is very convenient for those who want to reach Heathrow
52301,Hilton London Paddington, 1 Check In they asked for a GBP 50 a day deposit for extras minibar calls etc First time in my whole career I ve been asked for that bearing in mind the full price for the bedroom was already paid before the check in I strongly denied it 2 Air conditioning didn t work Way too hot in the bedroom Staff told me they fixed it but it wasn t 3 Not new but when booking through Booking com you can t get the stay onto your Hilton HHonors account , 1 Location right into Paddington Station and near Heathrow Express 2 The GWR room was nice sadly the aircon didn t work 
52302,Hilton London Paddington, Shower over the bath Damp smell in room Limited space to store own items in bar fridge Docking station not working , Comfortable bed Fantastic location 
52303,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, excellent location could access the hotel from within the Paddington Station without the need to go out Our room had a nice balcony facing the street 
52304,Hilton London Paddington, Everything thing went wrong Our stay was horrible I had booked for myself 1 adult and 1 child 15yrs with breakfast included They charged me extra for that breakfast and didnt even let me know that the hotel was only booked for 1 person After all the payments for our 2 night stay and spending Australian dollars 877 just for the 2 nights come to the front and realise that i had to pay an extra 50x2nights 200aud that is over 1000 our stay for only 2 nights No facilities only gym the steam bar was not varied Pay to get in 20 and only african music As i young adult I was too scared to go alone and i was so bored staying up in my room on a saturday night Didnt use that at all Our toilet stopped working I mentioned it to the cleaners and they didnt even come to the room or let the hilton know Careless I was very disappointed in my stay I will not stay again and I will not even recommend to stay there I walked out really upset ,No Positive
52305,Hilton London Paddington, Decor is a bit dated but enjoyed my stay here The executive room is perfect for a family of three and very spacious , The service is impeccable from the receptionist to the chambermaids to the staff at the executive lounge The concierge is also very helpful and knowledgeable especially Mourad I would definitely stay at this property again Location is fantastic with the tube station and bus stops just across the road The area is bustling till late at night with plenty of food options 
52306,Hilton London Paddington, The staff were helpful and the breakfast very good, We really enjoyed our stay and this was our first stay at Hilton Hotel Paddington We will certainly come back again
52307,Hilton London Paddington, In addition to the charge for the room 100 is deducted from your credit card as deposit on arrival and then hopefully recharged to your account if not spent , Comfortable clean room
52308,Hilton London Paddington, Too few tv channels and standard definition not HD strange for such high class chain Rooms too far from the elevator, Location clean and comfortable rooms
52309,Hilton London Paddington, Breakfast is a bit pricey , Staff were friendly patient and very helpful There was a mix up with our room but the problem was resolved smoothly The location is excellent Right outside Paddington Station which was perfect for us having to catch the Heathrow Express The room was clean and luxurious and the bed was enormously comfortable Breakfast not included in room rate was delicious Sooo many things to choose from it was amazing One of the fanciest hotels I ve been to The decor is glorious and it certainly made me feel like a princess D
52310,Hilton London Paddington, Have stayed here twice in the last month and Hilton could not find my booking via Booking com To make matters worse I was charged then later for a no show which neither booking com nor the Hilton have mentioned Have also been charged twice on my for my most recent stay and only to phone the Hilton when back overseas and not receive any feedback or apology for a clear system and accounting error So do check your statements when staying at the hotel, Convenient location 
52311,Hilton London Paddington, appalling service for Hilton Rang service for heating as the room was very cold which they promised to send someone up 3 times In the end i gave up and went sleep , good size room and Bed was fine and comfortable
52312,Hilton London Paddington, This hotel is at the end of the Heathrow Express but it is not a business hotel The business centre is totally inadequate with limited hours I needed to print 1 colour page but they cannot do this as the business centre does not have a colour printer The night manager does not have access to the business center computers out of hours Let s get real this is not good enough for a hotel at the end of the Heathrow line I will not be staying here again Hilton needs to be business friendly this is from a HILTON GOLD CARD holder , location great
52313,Hilton London Paddington, The second room we had was on the street so on Sunday night it was loud and because the rooms are no air conditioned it was impossible to keep the windows open for air , The location of the property was perfect The staff was very accommodating My room which was off the street was very quiet 
52314,Hilton London Paddington, Service was a bit slow Nowhere to freshen up on arrival before going to concert at hyde park , Room was lovely Breakfast was excellent Hotel foyet was luxurious Close to underground 
52315,Hilton London Paddington, Alot i dont like the receptionist they dont treat people with respect, Whenever u need the staff to help you with something they dont take you serious most especially the receptionist you have to keep calling tgem and reminding them which is very bad
52316,Hilton London Paddington, Unfortunately our room was directly about the nightclub We could hear the music pounding and the Dj s commentary until 3am The staff gave us free earplugs but it was difficult to sleep In the morning we were given a discount , Large and clean room Helpful staff On arrival our room was not ready so we were given access to the lounge with complimentary drinks and food 
52317,Hilton London Paddington, Nothing, Room was large upgraded at no extra cost by reception very comfortable bed slept like a baby Great breakfast buffet and the location is the best Just catch the Heathrow Express and walk off the Paddington Station platform into the hotel which after a long flight is great 
52318,Hilton London Paddington, Can t think of anything , The bed was massive and the room beautiful and spacious A lovely hotel with an unrivalled location for anyone using Paddington Station 
52319,Hilton London Paddington, Loud music from the Steam bar which could be heard clearly from the room until early hours Sensitivity of the minibar which automatically charge my c card because a beverage was disturbed within the fridge when I put a bottle of water inside of it which I purchased elsewhere , Beds comfy hotel throughout clean as well as the room Good facilities in the room quiet 
52320,Hilton London Paddington, No ramp facility that I could see for wheel chairs and roller cases A lot of people loitering outside on arrival, We came in on a late long haul flight and fell asleep and missed the deadline for breakfast in our room but they stil delivered Staff were great 
52321,Hilton London Paddington, Staff were not helpful room was not ready when we arrived When we were eventually shown the room they had not added the extra bed When the bed arrived the mattress had very bad staining When we checked out the following morning the manager said he would contact us regarding our unsatisfactory stay but never did Would never use this hotel ever again even if it was free , Location
52322,Hilton London Paddington, Need more food options in the hotel , Easy to get to from the airport We took the Healthrow Express The London underground station was right across the street making it easy to get the London tourist attractions 
52323,Hilton London Paddington, a little scarce with the tea milk sugar in the room no free bottles of water , great shower comfortable bed great breakfast great position friendly helpful staff
52324,Hilton London Paddington, The floor gives you the sensation that it is unstable and it trembles when you walk We had some cookies on the tea plate but they weren t restored on the next day We had only one bar of soap for two persons and for hands and body we missed a lot having a bottle of shower gel The personal space inside the mini fridge is very small and a little bottle of water barely fit , The welcome we received from the reception concierge staff made us feel very comfortable The bed was very king size and the hotel was very quiet We called the service room for habing dinner at midnight and in less than half an hour they had it prepared and served 
52325,Hilton London Paddington, That I was charged a GBP50 deposit fee on check in which I wasn t notified about when I made the booking Also the booking said there was wifi but as it turned out wifi was only in the lounge as I had booked through Booking com If I had booked through the Hilton website apparently then I would have had wifi in the room If you want a late check out you have to pay GBP20 per hour No chance of keeping the room until they need it Just another way for them to make money Also there is an entrance directly from inside Paddington station This wasn t clearly signposted Only found out when I left , Great location Came in on the Heathrow Express for one night so wanted somewhere close to Paddington Station Easy access to centre of London Room was decent sized with a double bed which you don t always get as a solo traveller 
52326,Hilton London Paddington, For how much the rooms cost I think you should get free wi fi, Great location for the trains staff very helpful and nice rooms are big very clean had a great stay
52327,Hilton London Paddington, Incredibly slow check in process Old fashioned design of rooms poor mains sockets no USB charging an ageing hotel and it shows in both attitude and facilities, Clean and comfortable
52328,Hilton London Paddington, Nothing, Excellent location for those who plan to use the train line in addition to the underground tube The reception staff are nice and maintaining their treatment quality despite the busy crowd of customers 
52329,Hilton London Paddington, Aged rooms very old towels yuk no slippers for this price breakfast nothing special probably worth to go in a cafe nearby for breakfast They checked me in the room at 4 45pm That was tough after an overnight flight , The convenience close to Paddington and the lovely and funny staff Good concierge 
52330,Hilton London Paddington, no free wifi I mean come on its 2016 unreasonable prices for mini bar, we used this as a last day close to Paddington loca very good just paying for wifi and not many channels on tv was tiring
52331,Hilton London Paddington, The staff who is a French girl in reception for check in are very impolite to guest We had a very unpleasant experience though the duty manager had apologies after complaining But we feel that it is all about racism We had 2 different bookings for 3 nights stay she just checked one booking as we reminded there was another booking she checked again but showed dislike on her face She asked us to sign on the check in form but didn t tell us where to sign we hardly find the right space We had room with breakfast but got no information about breakfast restaurant and time And we cannot get members points even though we are Hilton honours member as she told us because we made our booking through booking com her response let me feel that they look down upon booking com , The room is comfortable
52332,Hilton London Paddington, The main part of the hotel is quite worn down, Location at the Paddington station although the Bakersloo line no longer stops there the new tower wing is a real upgrade
52333,Hilton London Paddington, Staff at check in were absolutely dreadful Check in was 3pm Could not get into our rooms until gone 3 20pm as rooms not available Reason given was that they were busy First check in girl too busy counting cash and liaising with colleague to bother telling us our third bed would be put up at a later stage Very amateur , Across the road from the tube

52351,Hilton London Paddington, Service at dinner could have been more attentive quicker , Breakfast staff were very attentive and professional even the trainees Despite obnoxious guests my opinion they maintained a professional approach 
52352,Hilton London Paddington, Absolute disgrace that a Hotel of this standing does not have free wifi in this day and age that is taking liberties with the price they charge for a room , Great location for Heathrow Express and popping out to Euston Road for a great Lebonese meal
52353,Hilton London Paddington, Certainly felt like we were in a tourist trap Failed to understand even in London how they can charge 5 for a standard coffee in the lobby when Starbucks is next door Items in the minibar are extortionate 5 for a mars bar and 34 for a glass of sub standard champagne , So close to the station Concierge staff were superb specifically Prasanna Nice size rooms for London

52359,Hilton London Paddington, Value for money is one of the areas that the Hotel must consider The hotel stay was quite expensive and although it was my choice the VAT seemed to be the portion that set off the price Please also consider TV channel and offerings when traveling with small children this could be a good option at night after a long day walking in the city , The location and proximity to train stations and underground is a plus In addition the breakfast option is important The staff also was extremely helpful standing out Grazia and Sandra both went above and beyond 
52360,Hilton London Paddington, The wifi paid 14 and only valid for one device although we had two rooms with 4 persons After complaining we got an additional access for one device Still felt being ripped off , The location is next to Paddington Station which is very convenient

52366,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, One of the concierge recommended a lovely place for dinner and was very nice to us Also the possibility to leave your luggage before you check in or after you check out is a very good alternative to the expensive left luggage facility at Paddington station

52432,Hilton London Paddington, No heating in the room and window broken after reporting it to the reception engineer took to long to fix it as it was past midnight and I needed to go to sleep so had to sleep with a jumper on Only smoking area is at the front of the hotel where everyone is getting dropped off and picked up so you are always dodging cars and people and no outdoor heating, Staff very polite and helpful
52433,Hilton London Paddington, There was an indication that there were three beds in a triple room but when i got there there was a double and a trundle I feel that it would have been cheaper to have a double roo and pay for an extra bed , the facilities and the location
52434,Hilton London Paddington, Having member of staff interrupt us on first night to check mini bar and member of cleaning staff knocking on door at 0930hrs to clean and we hadn t yet checked out, Great size room very comfortable Clean

52436,Hilton London Paddington, It has nothing to do with the hotel Do not go to the Garfunkel restaurant at the corner the staff is awful very cold not welcoming very rude with customers and the food is not that good Check the reviews online and you will get what I m talking about , Best location in Paddington You have a direct access to the hotel through the rail station Tube station is right in front the main entrance of the hotel and you also have an access through the rail station Restaurants fast food restaurants money exchange office etc are all close by or in the rail station and a Starbucks coffee is practically attached to the hotel Staff very nice helpful and welcoming Family room was bigger than we thought the extra bed was free of charge Beds were very comfy We had enough space for three adults in the room Room was very clean I would definitely book again a room in that hotel 
52437,Hilton London Paddington, Nothing that I can readily think of albeit our stay was only one night Minibar prices were traditionally exorbitant but on the plus side well displayed in advance , The ease of accessing the hotel from Paddington Station and the quietness given it s proximity to a very busy rail hub and a busy area of Central London 
52438,Hilton London Paddington, We felt the receptionist when we booked in was not particularly friendly However the receptionist that booked us out looked miserable We have stayed in hotels where the staff have been much more friendly and with much better social skills , The room was nice The hotel is modern and clean We had a nice breakfast on both days 
52439,Hilton London Paddington, We were annoyed to be shuffled out of the bar at 11 30 on Friday and rudely refused admission on Saturday night told that we couldn t buy a drink elsewhere in the Hotel When we found another bar selling drinks in the hotel the service was abrupt and untrained the drinks expensive 12 for a glass of wine and this venue also rudely closed down at 11 30, good location nice room Most of the staff helpful and friendly
52440,Hilton London Paddington, The hotel was a little too hot which made sleeping a little uncomfortable Other than that great service Thank you, Friendly staff and good facilities
52441,Hilton London Paddington, Dark out of style interieur The setting of the Brasserie is far from cozy and not welcoming , Breakfast and the food at the Brasserie was nice also the service at the Concierge 
52442,Hilton London Paddington, No Free Wifi in bedroom a charge of 12 99 per night bit ridiculous Staff could have been friendlier in particular lobby area staff Booked a room for three adults but one bed was a camp bed , Location
52443,Hilton London Paddington, The lighting in the room could have been better i e reading lights, Great location comfortable room efficient and friendly staff proximity to train station
52444,Hilton London Paddington, Nothing, Every thing most is he staff and the way the help you also room serveice was great and fast locatin is next to all what you need room with excutive lounge acceses was great
52445,Hilton London Paddington, One of the concierge senior staff is very unfriendly He turned down the impressive good service image which I received in Hilton Tokyo and Hong Kong , House keeping restaurant front desk all provide excellent services 
52446,Hilton London Paddington, bed was a bit hard for my liking and quite hot and stuffy in the room even with the AC on , close to Car parking at the railway station and the tube across the road didn t eat in the hotel so can t really comment friendly staff
52447,Hilton London Paddington, I find that Booking with you can be very expensive and extortionate to your more generalised prices It is difficult to know when the best time is to book with you Please would you comment,No Positive
52448,Hilton London Paddington, The breakfast staff on our last day seemed disorganised and inattentive Whereas previously they were fine it wasn t the same staff on shift as previous mornings For example suggesting that we sat at a table that hadn t been cleared from the previous guests when there were other tables available causing us to stand there like lemons while they cleared it and placed clean items down , The location is great the staff were helpful and friendly 
52449,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, An ideal location to explore central London and next to Paddington Station A very good breakfast an extremely clean room and very nice and accommodating staff
52450,Hilton London Paddington, breakfast waiting staff were not great at re laying table unless asked Carpet in our bedroom 312 was tired ie damaged, location straight from train to hotel to tube fab eating places nearby and hyde park around the corner Breakfast choice one of the best I ve encountered
52451,Hilton London Paddington, Nothing, Great location for the Heathrow Express and other rail services from Paddington Hotel comfortable and quiet which we find a bonus in London Staff friendly and helpful 
52452,Hilton London Paddington, I didn t stay long enough to notice any major shortcoming or inadequacy , The old but elegant structure architecture of the hotel with its spacious rooms and exceptionally polite staff 
52453,Hilton London Paddington, Information from concierge for prete a manger was down the street Actually there was one in the station , Location easy access to healthrow express 
52454,Hilton London Paddington, One receptionist at our arrival was not very friendly Just one Certainly was having a bad day , Spacious room for 2 adults and 2 kids 11 13 years old cleanliness of the room and bathroom very good amenities Excellent breakfast A member of the breakfast staff spoke portuguese She was so nice and made our stay even better Concierge at our arrival was very helpful 
52455,Hilton London Paddington, Staff at reception were not great This only applies to one staff member that we were dealing with all others seemed fine Not very friendly and it just felt like a very awkward situation Also because we booked through booking com we were not given access to the wifi unless we paid for it Was not happy about this at all , It was very close to the Paddington tube station
52456,Hilton London Paddington, Overall not quite as good as I d expect from a downtown Hilton , Great location if you re taking a train but there s not much within a block or two other than a few decent pubs If you re looking to visit the downtown tourist sites there are as good or better hotels closer to the action for the same price Check out The Grand at Trafalgar 
52457,Hilton London Paddington, Room couldn t be heated staff did nothing about this issue Breakfast had to be consumed in the entrance hall directly in front of the lift Very loud music could be heard in the room , 
52458,Hilton London Paddington, Breakfast area is too small and so at one time we had to wait for about 30 min but the actual breakfast food was very good I booked early and didn t get a good rate whereas my friends who booked later got a much better deal , Location near the train station I loved the direct access The rooms were good size and had very a comfortable bed 
52459,Hilton London Paddington, The staff and management are poor and have bad attitude They ruined my stay Booked an executive package and when it was closed we received some make shift lounge with little entitlements and no service, The room was ok Nothing special
52460,Hilton London Paddington, The restaurant staff were not very welcoming food was expensive as expected but ok I really hate places that leave space on the receipt for a tip even though they have already added a service charge Had to queue for breakfast mostly due to them not having enough staff on the door , Nice room very comfortable Couldn t get any closer to the station
52461,Hilton London Paddington, Lots of equipment in disrepair For a hotel advertised at a 4 star level the attention to detail is lacking and equipment is less than expected House keeping services is not consistent , Location is fantastic Staff are helpful and great It seems that they have limitations on what they can do to improve the experience 
52462,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Beautiful clean hotel that is 15 mins away from Heathrow airport by train Wonderful helpful staff Kind regards to Mr Mourad at the concierge and Miss Ilaria at the reception Tour bus stop is I front of the hotel Restaurants around the hotel 
52463,Hilton London Paddington, The staff was snarky and not helpful Wifi was not included with the hotel This in 2015 is absurd , The one redeeming quality was its location near Paddington Station That s it 
52464,Hilton London Paddington, Was discussed with someone coming into our hotel room when had young daughter asleep early in the morning then running when seen horrified felt wasn t safe there, Loved the location
52465,Hilton London Paddington, I found out the first morning that there was no room service breakfast if I missed the restaurant breakfast The hotel had no parking facilities and the nearest parking was a good 10 minutes walk , very helpful staff they could cope with any number of languages and knew the local district very well
52466,Hilton London Paddington, No Nespresso machine No free late checkout beyond one hour , Central great for business or holiday Close to Tube and Express Good size rooms adequate bathroom Clean and friendly Free wifi
52467,Hilton London Paddington, Bathrooms needing renovation busy lobby it s like a market square generally lacking relaxation areas outside of the room , Great and central location with easy access to most of central London and to Heathrow 15 mins via the express train in Paddington Hotel also has good sized rooms 
52468,Hilton London Paddington, Although the hotel was excellent We were meet by very unhelpful staff After standing at the hotel reception for a full hour the matter finally got resolved As a result of the this we missed a very important dinner reservation which we were deeply upset about We lost the deposit and had to find somewhere else to eat ,No Positive
52469,Hilton London Paddington, No smiles in reception the lady who checked us in didn t inform about where breakfast was served where the lifts to get to our room were situated nor when check out was The building needs updating , Some staff very helpful the doorman and some of the cleaning ladies Big room
52470,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Perfect when travelling to Heathrow Less than a minute walk to Heathrow Express I would definitely stay there again Very friendly and helpful concierge Rooms are good and comfortable They had all we need Good selection in breakfast buffet as well

52472,Hilton London Paddington, Room was extremely hot Air con stuck on hot Engineer was called and not resolved Spent entire night wide awake hence my partners 30th birthday was spoiled as we were unable to enjoy sightseeing on no sleep I travel to London a few times every year and won t be using this hotel again , Location is excellent
52473,Hilton London Paddington, The queue for breakfast on the Sunday morning was crazy so we couldn t have any we had a flight to catch Their restaurant is a bit small for the capacity of hotel , Liked that our room was quiet despite being next to the station and busy road Room had a lovely layout too 
52474,Hilton London Paddington, Nothing negative I loved to stay here , I just loved to stay here Perfect in every way Suite with a balcony VERY spacious one big room comfortable bathroom with bath and shower nicely carpeted GIANT and comfortable bed Polite and extremely helpful and kind staff I spent the night of my birthday there Will come back soon Thank you for everything 
52475,Hilton London Paddington, No complaints at all , No complaints at all Efficient check in lovely clean room and very good breakfast No queues at check out Would definitely stay again in the future 
52476,Hilton London Paddington, The room service was over rated, The hotel is very central and close to many attractions Just few steps from Paddington train station as well the underground station Just down the street you can find everything you want such as grocery shops restaurants etc The reception staff were welcoming and helpful I was initially booked for a standard room and upon check in got upgraded free of charge to a bigger room as we had a baby and needed sufficient space for the baby cot The housekeeping staff were more than happy to clean our room even at around 7pm while we were away Wifi connection was convenient and fast 
52477,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Great room and amazing location Very convenient to the Underground as well as non stop service to London Heathrow I highly recommend the Tower it s worth the upgrade Extremely friendly staff as well 
52478,Hilton London Paddington, Unfortunately too hot in the room and not able to turn down the air conditioning Had a sleepless night due to having to open the window so not very restful at all Have sent a complaint but not sure if this has been actioned as the page seemed to be directed to the US , Fantastic location and very helpful and friendly staff 
52479,Hilton London Paddington, I think the staff are great and the facilities first class I really look forward to being welcomed back in December, This is the best hotel in the UK in terms of location I will be a Guest anytime I visit the UK
52480,Hilton London Paddington, We had a complimentary breakfast in the tower lounge and there was no information about what was on offer so missed out on the eggs because didn t know they were available , Coffee machine in room
52481,Hilton London Paddington, In addition to hot water issue Double Hilton Executive Room with Executive Lounge Access leaves much to be desired For the amount of money you are going to spend on this property you will be dissapointed if you have been to other lounges for comparison This is by far the worst Hilton I have stayed in but you can t beat the location Duty Manager did rebate 15 per night for mornings with no hot water , The location is the only positive to this particular Hilton
52482,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Fantastic location right next to Paddington Train Station We had a really great spacious room for 4 with large bathroom and 2 double beds Would definitely stay here again 
52483,Hilton London Paddington, Hotel Bar was used for private functions both evenings I was there Not much in the way of facilities but then again your in the center of London so you dont really need them, Fantastic location for heathrow express and Tube Made travel around London so much easier 
52484,Hilton London Paddington, Some signs of wear and tear around the hotel with chairs outside breakfast area in terrible state leather all cracked and saggy Staff were very friendly but many obviously new to job and we had a lot of negative issues with service , Great position with easy access to Paddington station and especially Heathrow Express makes getting to and from airport a breeze Hotel decor very 1950s and very historic Room comfortable and well set up Staff were very keen to please 
52485,Hilton London Paddington, I guess the rooms were a little dated and small But that London, excellent access to Paddington no need to go outside Comfortable bed Great for a one night stop over
52486,Hilton London Paddington, Fair amount of road and train noise but this in inevitable given its location Fiddly TV menu Excessive internet charge access should be bundled into the cost of what is already an expensive room , Easy access direct from station friendly staff and very efficient luggage store Comfortable spacious room Tasty breakfast with lots of choice
52487,Hilton London Paddington, None , Arrived from Heathrow Airport by Heathrow Express and took me a minute walk to the hotel which is basically located almost within the Paddington St It s a very busy hotel and the staff is business oriented as well which I really appreciated Btw I forgot to tip the bell person when I picked up my luggage I am extremely enbareesed about it and sorry I live in an eu country where there s no tipping custome 
52488,Hilton London Paddington, 1 bad maintenance for bathroom 2 unpleasant smell from the vents and drainholes 3 old furniture 4 used sofa with stains 5 the heating was not enough we had to ask for an electric heater, 1 the mattresses are great perfect sleep 2 the underground station is less than 40 seconds away 3 the breakfast was great
52489,Hilton London Paddington, Not a bad experience just felt the food itself we had in the restaurant for our evening dinner though good felt a little ordinary , 1 Location is perfect for travel to from Heathrow and London itself especially being opposite Paddington Train Station big plus 2 Our room was great in all respects size comfort temp control atmosphere really enjoyed stay 3 Staff were great genuinely made us feel looked after 
52490,Hilton London Paddington, Bad wifi and poor breakfast service Disappointing to have staff that were not really interested in making the guests experience great , Clean and comfortable luxury hotel
52491,Hilton London Paddington, Pity GBP12 95 for wifi per day cheap shot from the hotel Worse is that its free if booked direct with Hilton That s not nice A 50 pence pair of slippers would be appreciated in the room when paying over 180 pounds a night The Steam Bar should be called The Frosty Bar everything is cold including the service but the prices will leave you steaming maybe that s where the name comes from , Very handy for Paddington Very good sized rooms 
52492,Hilton London Paddington, It was a buffet breakfast which is fine but it could have been hotter , I loved the fact that you were just upstairs from the tube as we were there for only a few days and it was quick and easy to get where we wanted to go 
52493,Hilton London Paddington, 1 Terrible bed new Tower room 2605 the newest section The bed was very uncomfortable 2 The restaurant manager host was most pretentious and condescending for no apparent reason , Good concierge service doormen front desk staff 
52494,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, A decent hotel very well placed for people travelling through London Placed right inside Paddington station Very convenient as I arrived in London after a long night flight with a lot of luggage and had a day to spend before travelling on by train The Paddington Hilton is very much the generic city center business hotel but provided everything I needed The staff where friendly and made a big effort to get me checked into my room even though I arrived really early 
52495,Hilton London Paddington, the reception room service and concierge were relatively slow in picking up the phone , central location 15 minutes from the airport by heathrow express train hotel connected to paddington station where you can find the metro cafes restaurants and a supermarket bus stops all around the hotel breakfast was nice and healthy
52496,Hilton London Paddington, The staff were a bit snotty but I think it s that kind of place it s a shame they think it s ok to charge for WiFi and have such a draconian policy to the minibar, Location and great building very grand
52497,Hilton London Paddington, Being charged for wifi many other hotels that charge less for their roomsinclude wifi 10 45 for two coffees was a bit of a shock Our breakfast was included but I wouldn t have paid 20 each for a standard cooked breakfast that you could buy for 7 00 at a local popular cafe , Good location room lovely if a little dated 
52498,Hilton London Paddington, We had no sleep until 3am because our room was over the lounge and they where having a party all night It was very unfair to put us in a room over the lounge when they knew they would be a party all night When we complained to the staff the next morning he didn t seem to care The staff were cold , Location
52499,Hilton London Paddington, The hotel is a rip off 220 pounds for a room without breakfast wifi at 15 pounds per day Did not find price list for minibar items It is outrageous not to have even some complimentary water ,No Positive
52500,Hilton London Paddington, Beds are among the most uncomfortable I ve experienced in any hotel Not much sleep over 2 nights stay, Good location for my needs Staff were very friendly and efficient
52501,Hilton London Paddington, We had booked a family room which we got however the room was setup for 2 people 2 towels 2 cups etc We had to ask for cups in the evening and were lucky enough to bump into a member of the cleaning staff in the morning to provide us extra towels in the morning , Nice location nice staff clean rooms overall and excellent hotel 
52502,Hilton London Paddington, staff very unresponsive have written an email to Mr Alexander sambande regarding duplication of bookings on 20th of Oct and today is the 25th Oct till date no response Very dissapointing, Location location and Location
52503,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, The hotel is connected to Paddington station so it s really good for late arrival tourists like us There is a refrig in the room which is not available in all other hotels we stayed in UK 
52504,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Loved the size of my room I have been to a number of hotels in London and by far this has been the best The location two steps away from the Heathrow express train in Paddington station 
52505,Hilton London Paddington, There were missing items in the room No toothbrushes no complimentary water no bedroom slippers and no glasses in the bathroom Had to request these to be sent up , The location was excellent Commuting to and from the airport was a breeze especially with heavy luggage 
52506,Hilton London Paddington, My room was quite a distance from reception having said that l would stay in that room again, My room was excellent and ny breakfast was perfect served by lovely staff 
52507,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, I booked this hotel several months before my stay so was pleased to see I d saved about 300 by doing this I had a lovely large room on the top floor Complimentary water every day 
52508,Hilton London Paddington, My only concern is with parking I asked on booking and was told that there were many car parks in the area but was given no specific assistance Would it be possible to prepare an info sheet giving guidance to people on which car parks are available cost and directions etc , Very comfy tidy and staff great 
52509,Hilton London Paddington, No free WiFi provided Maximum of 1 hour free late check out offered I had to pay 20 pounds per hour for late check out , The perfect location it s near to metro station 
52510,Hilton London Paddington, Having to leave , Just the most perfect place to base ourselves for a trip to London Only 15 mins from Heathrow too Staff were so friendy rooms were so spacious and clean Even after we checked out they looked after our luggage for the whole day free of charge so we could continue to enjoy the sights Underground downstairs sainsburys for anything we needed definately be back 
52511,Hilton London Paddington, We were disappointed by how unwelcome we felt the whole time we were there One of the Concierge individuals was rather dismissive so I guess we looked like ugly Americans that really didn t belong there It s ok though we will never go back as there are plenty of less expensive places to stay that are much more comfortable and closer to all the history and cultural sites , Nice place but the staff is a bit pretentious We chose this hotel due to its location to Paddington Station and the Heathrow Express to catch an early flight going back to California 
52512,Hilton London Paddington, I booked a free cancellation room and 5 months before my check in the hotel booked the amount from my credit card then the 2nd day of check in the hotel charged me more money so I asked the front desk staff who didn t know why and the front disk manager came and explained to me that the hotel blocked the amount 5 months ago but then cancelled it and now he need to charge me the full amount again he was lovely guy and helpful I asked him to check with reservation what actually happened and after two days he told me that even reservation does not know what happened I am very surprised that a big brand name does not know what happens in their systems and why they charge a customer twice Also the checkout time is 12pm and at 10pm the room service staff opened the door although we had the Do not disturb sign on the door Then when she saw us at the room she said oh sorry I thought you checked out She could knock the door first at least instead of opening the door while we are getting dressed , Location and staff
52513,Hilton London Paddington, Reception staff helpful but lack friendliness , Very very convenient location adjacent to Paddington tube and railway stations Clean and comfortable room Helpful staff 
52514,Hilton London Paddington, I was satisfied with the hotel and the service I received , The location proximate to the Paddington Underground station and the Heathrow Express was excellent The staff were pleasant although there was some miscommunication regarding charges for wi fi what I was told at check in as to there being no charge to not coincide with the account I received at the end after some discussion with a member of the hotel staff the charges were removed 
52515,Hilton London Paddington, Exterior and lobby are old and borderline shabby , Perfect location for traveling by train from Padditgton and for arriving from Heathrow Room agreeable and well appointed 
52516,Hilton London Paddington, Over priced hotel 289 for room only without breakfast is a disgrace Food in restaurant was good but pricey You need to work harder to keep your custom, Location
52517,Hilton London Paddington, Need to leave a note to get complimentary bottled water replenished in consecutive nights , Conveniently located easy access to Paddington Rail Station and the Tube 
52518,Hilton London Paddington, the reception staff named Grazia promised to my room would be readied in 5 to 10 minutes but then said room not readied When I asked again another 15 minutes later she said will get back to me after 10 minutes But she walked away and didn t response to me as promised Also each time when I tried to check if my room was readied she asked my name again which showed she did not take down my name and follow up my room availability as promised In the hospitality industry I can t believe staff has no such basic hospitality on remembering name of the guess especially the guess has been waiting for the room for two hours , Hotel is cnnected to London heathrow express
52519,Hilton London Paddington, The only part I feel uncomfortable is the reception I m not sure why the staff looks not friendly And the facilities in the room are quite old because I lived in the doubletree by Hilton hotel in Edinburgh that is great and high quality , Great location paddington station is a big traffic hub there is a heathrow express which is the fastest way to heathrow airport And there are lots of restaurants and shops around the hotel very convenient 
52520,Hilton London Paddington, We arrived at night We came for our first night after our marriage party After our arrival Staffs are not very friendly talking I felt like going back home Just coz of my hubby I stained at that night , Rooms are fabulous and nice 
52521,Hilton London Paddington, Nothing, We stayed twice this month had a memorable stay in Hilton London Paddington Convenient location and close to the tourist attractions Room are comfortable well maintained and clean bath room Truly enjoyed the professional service of Hilton 
52522,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, The rooms in which we were put in were extremely comfortable and very clean Not much of a view however the windows were large and a great amount of daylight came in making them very nice to wake up in The staff were very very friendly giving us two rooms close to each other as we were a family with young kids 
52523,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, the location was very good a few steps literally to the paddington station the staff especially those at the concierge were very accommodating and helpful 
52524,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, Location was Excellent tube staion outside from door and main staion through hotel Hop on hop off your bus a very short walk for tourist site seeing Walking distance to marble arch and Hyde park Staff excellent to our kids each morning at breakfast 
52525,Hilton London Paddington, There is no coffee downstairs and the breakfast does not open until 6 30am too late Had to go yo Starbucks for coffee which was open There are limited restaurants in the neighborhood They do not allow gold honors members in their executive lounge , You can take the Heathrow Express and be at the hotel within 15 20 minutes The underground is right below the hotel It is a hotel where Premium Tours picks up 
52526,Hilton London Paddington, The air conditioner didn t work well so the room was quite warm even though it was cool outside We opened the window and that helped , Brilliant location just had to go down in an elevator and we were right in Paddington Station The staff were very friendly and helpful Beautiful breakfast A very classy hotel especially the entrance An unexpected bonus was that we were given free bottles of water every day 
52527,Hilton London Paddington, Extreamly bad ventilation Very warm room near impossible to sleep No cold air from AC just a lot of sound Boring bar Overpricd not worth Money , Near Paddigton Station
52528,Hilton London Paddington, All the people walking through the hotel as a shortcut The employee at Concierge who wanted 20 pounds for a trip to Victoria station I did it taking a normal taxi and with trafic cost me 10 pounds Unfriendly staff serving a last pint at 2230 , Friendly and professional staff at reception The location was ideal as we had had to travel around London and to Wales 
52529,Hilton London Paddington, The main entrance is not suitable for strollers We had a lot of luggage and there was no one at the entrance to help with stroller or luggage The staff blocked my card for 50 GBP in advance assuming the use of minibar When I asked about it at the check out I heard that I can expect refund up to 30 days later , We decided to stay in this hotel because of great connection with LHR 
52530,Hilton London Paddington, Tried calling room service to order dinner No answer for almost 20 minutes despite repeated attempts Ultimately ended up going to the restaurant which doesn t offer a great choice I paid more than 200 for a night but the very basic toilet roll was of much inferior quality than the cheapest supermarket brands , Location very convenient
52531,Hilton London Paddington, The gym i very small and lack windows that s boring and depressing If you are 70 you will fel that you are in good company No nice pubs in close area to the hotel , Perfectly located close to Paddington Station Nice cost and silent room Pancake machine at breakfast was great 
52532,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, very comfortable beds quiet room Excellent helpful staff Right inside Paddington Station for Underground Trains to LHR elsewhere Don t miss the great Lebanese and middle eastern restaurants on Edgeware Road just a 10 to 15 minute walk away 
52533,Hilton London Paddington, A little disappointed in the curt attitude of the concierge when I had a question regarding airport transportation, Location near Paddington Station was very convenient The property was very nice and comfortable we appreciated the family room that would accommodate our three adult children 
52534,Hilton London Paddington, Ridiculous for a hotel at this price to charge for wifi and bread at the dinner table Penny pinching on little things not appreciated , Location was great staff made some mistakes in restaurant but cheerfully fixed 
52535,Hilton London Paddington, Staff don t care much since it is a very busy hotel it will be fully booked with or without you You are just a room number passing by If you are looking for some pampering and being greeted by your first name just forget about it , Location is great great access to tube and trains
52536,Hilton London Paddington, The cleanness of the room is not up to expectation Also after house keeping clean the room you can find that they don t clean your trash , it s close to the station also 10Min walk to hiedpark 
52537,Hilton London Paddington, Iron didn t work and me being me I like to clean the toilet after use but there was no facility for that other than to put my hand down the toilet and clean it manually I think you should have toilet brushes in the toilet, The location was fab straight off the train
52538,Hilton London Paddington, Not warned that floor 2 had steps to access bedroom very disabled unfriendly Pay for internet in this age Breakfast vastly overpriced mediocre in quality over cooked hot breakfast cold coffee chaotic staff food on floor ignored despite it being pointed out to waiters who managed to consistently walk round it , Location Good bedroom 
52539,Hilton London Paddington, Lobby full of loud Chinese tourists No Sky sports Hairdryer not powerful enough , Location and the fact you can access hotel directly from Paddington station Friendly staff 
52540,Hilton London Paddington, No car parking or valet facilities booking with booking com led to the allocation of our rooms being very far from each other on the other side of the floor and one on an entirely different floor , Attentive staff location was great
52541,Hilton London Paddington, no hot water both days Television did not work When I informed front desk of the problems i further said i was checking out a day early They said it was ok but they could do nothing about refunding for the day I would not be there as i had booked it with booking com I left anyways as two days in a row taking a cold shower was not going to stretch into a third day, next to train station
52542,Hilton London Paddington, A little more attention could be paid to the front of the hotel , The location directly opposite an entrance to the Paddington Underground station was excellent the rooms are small but clean and well presented and the staff was friendly and helpful 
52543,Hilton London Paddington, Wireless Lan charged at GBP 12 50 where a breakfast is GBP 10 and any coffee shop will give WIFI free when buying a coffee Loud at night on 3rd floor with thumping sounds from the close by night clubs Overall comfort and room size such of any good 3 hotel or B B , Location close to Paddington Train station which comes in handy for the airport express However given that a chauffeur service can be booked at GBP 45 taking this train can be questioned All staff were really friendly and forthcoming and everything was clean 
52544,Hilton London Paddington, Paid Total amount in advance before check in including for Break fast coupons but Family was sent back in room by lady at breakfast reception desk saying your payment is not in hotel record Had to see hotel manager to solve to problem of breakfast coupons , Good Location easy approach from Airport 
52545,Hilton London Paddington, Terrible staff International phone charged me 150 pounds for no good reason Talked to the manager and she was just repeating the official answere Breakfast was bad , Location is good
52546,Hilton London Paddington, at breakfast all the staff appeared extremely busy and under resourced There were a few areas which needed replenishing ie fruit juices and sweet pastries which took a while to be filled up We had to ask twice for our teas and the hot breakfast bar didn t look appetising I had to await around for a while before staff asked if I needed something poached eggs please As the staff were rushing around there were occasions when I questioned safety I don t normally fill in these forms but felt on this occasion that I needed to as the hotel in itself is of a high standard I do use the tea coffee lounge area as I work at Paddington Station and on occasions hold informal meetings there , as stated above the cleanliness and quality of room and value for money
52547,Hilton London Paddington, Facilities are all run down TV channels are practically non existent TV in lounge very old and unservicable chairs in lounge all worn threadbare room furnishing so very basic for a hilton 4 star Sorry exclude location this is complete zero value for money , Location is a massicve plus 
52548,Hilton London Paddington, I cannot believe that for the price paid the room does not come with robes We have stayed in many other hotel brands for a lot lower rate and all come with robes , The location is by far the best attribute of this property 
52549,Hilton London Paddington, no wifi in the room confusing and time consuming booking in procedure, the value was excellent the fittings and facilities was as good as any five star hotel in london
52550,Hilton London Paddington, None had a great stay and would definitely be coming back here , Great hotel and the GWR tower rooms include the GWR tower lounge which is a very nice addition The offer price we received was about right The Hotel is located opposite Paddington station so is ideal for travel around London 
52551,Hilton London Paddington, Very difficult to use the safe as it is floor level and you need to get on your knees to access it Bartenders need more training Did not know what a Martini or a Scotch and soda was , Fantastic location in Paddington station Close to underground trains and Heathrow express Great food options in Paddington train station Executive lounge in hotel is first class Full breakfast Lunch buffet and wine happy hour
52552,Hilton London Paddington,No Negative, We were delighted to have a free upgrade when we checked in and were very pleased with the reception staff The idea of a free upgrade is also helpful as it gives an insight into other rooms available to book I would give this hotel a 10 10 Very pleased The hotel is very central Paddington station is just a few yards across from the hotel so you can start travelling around London almost immediately after you step outside the hotel We only stayed one night so we didn t get to experience all aspects of the hotel but from what we did it met high standards We would definately stay here again and highly recommend for anyone to stay here 
52553,Hilton London Paddington, I would say that the public areas of the hotel look a little tired and need imaginative re decoation to breathe life into them But my room was faultless clean and comfortable , I travelled back from Hong Kong on business and arrived back at Heathrow mid afternoon I decided to soend a night at this hotel to recover from the flight and chose it because I got a good deal on Booking com and because it was right next to Paddington and Heathrow Express The hotel has Art Deco features The room had a double bed and was very comfortable and quiet with excellent bathroom facilities I managed to sleep 12 hours to recover from the long daytime flight Breakfast the next day was included in the package and was excellent Great service from hotel staff efficient and courteous
