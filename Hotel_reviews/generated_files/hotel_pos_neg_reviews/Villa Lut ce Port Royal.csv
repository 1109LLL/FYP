209504,Villa Lut ce Port Royal,No Negative, I booked a single room and I was upgraded to a little suite on two floors with a double bed I never had such a hugh room in Paris The design of the room was marvelous I enjoyed my stay in Paris very much 
209505,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Room 305 needed refreshing torn wall paper broken tiles in the bathroom not enough light to work read at the desk no coffee machine etc Also room was noisy on the street , Bed was confortable
209506,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Room was cramped with two floors for a single person room poor lighting on lower floor, Friendly staff short distance from Major train station of Austerlitz Breakfast was ok
209507,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Had difficulties finding parking in the neighbourhood, Got a free upgrade because my son was super friendly to the receptionist at arrival Something I really appreciated Excellent value for money clean modern good breakfast
209508,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Room was definitely not 4 stars hotel Type especially beds and covers on them Quality of pillows was really bad Room itself was very old and Carpet on the room stairways was in so bad condition This hotel or probably different rooms must be renewed but I don t think that will be performed So the hotel must be 2 or 3 stars maximum in the rating according my travel experience , Just the hotel staff was ok as they were very friendly and kept our room very clean I also received a few very good advices from them about Paris and especially parking 
209509,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Room too small wifi has no signal at all short breakfast no parking for the car rooms in a separated building has to cross a n ugly open air area to get the room , The photographer that took pictures for Booking com
209510,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, The area wasn t the best Staff on breakfast on one morning weren t very nice Eggs were finished 20 mins before breakfast end and was very hesitant to make him more It was 35 37 degrees Celsius during Our Stay and there was little to no air conditioning , The breakfast was lovely Reception Staff were very nice and helpful 
209511,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, location is not very convenient I can t believe this is a four star hotel wifi is bad The wooden floor has too much shrinkage which hurt my toe and separate the nail and toe elevator is not working breakfast is not as fantastic as the photo shown curtain of the window is falling down, staff is nice
209512,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, bad wifi connection I was allotted a room with no wi fi internet signal at all after several complaints room was changed after one night stay to have slightly better connection ,No Positive
209513,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Rooms are very small Some of the staff is helpfull some are not , Cosy family hotel Bathroom is nice Close to Place d Italie and various metro lines 
209514,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Not the room as represented on website no parking other than on paying street and different type of room that was required It took us over an hour to get the change over with no apology , Location
209515,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Everything Hard to believe it s a 4 star hotel It was very dirty smelly and the receptionists didn t know how to deal with the customers , I can t comment on this question 
209516,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, It wasn t so clean I find a pubic hair on the bathroom door it was disgusting I paid 16 just to order a pizza margherita at the reception so crazy There is poor light in the room I had to use the bathroom light to find some stuff in my luggage , The staff is kind beyond expectations The room is nice They accept pets They called me a taxi Excellent location close to the Gare de Lyon station 
209517,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Room hadn t been used in some time hair in bath and dust all over the TV several things in the room that did not work lights in bathroom mirror light etc heating was only set to 10 c when we arrived in the room etc In the room we had 3rd floor the mattresses are very old and the double bed is two singles impossible to sleep in the middle Wifi doesn t work very well on the 3rd floor Even though we are aware we booked a special promotional price we were expecting more from a 4 star hotel , Good location and price Quiet room 3rd floor 
209518,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, very small room but it is rather typical for Paris the cleanness was so so access to metro is fine if you don t carry heavy stuff I would appreciate segreggation of garbage especially as Paris hosted COP21 at that time, the atmosphere very cosy place nice staff nicely looking hotel and rooms easy to find not very far gare d austerlitz
209519,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Morning stuff unpleasent to deal with Temperature in the hotel was way too high from the hall to the room In the room there was no option to decrease the temperature as the heating was switched off and temperature was around 25 26 because of it it was diffucult to sleep and get ready in the morning, nicely decorated room
209520,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, This hotel is dirty and multiple rooms are bug infested My bed had many bugs in it I got horrible bites all over my face and on my back only from being in this bed for about 15 minutes before I saw the bugs The toilet jammed almost every time I flashed spilling water on the bathroom floor Wi fi in rooms not working no reach The rooms as well as the lobby are dark and depressing hotel staff does not speak sufficient English language to help the guests with many simple issues The experience from day 1 was very aggravating and disappointing I was Paris in business attending important event and meeting many business partners Too bad I had to attend all meetings with burning red swollen face from the bugs bites Disgusting and unbelievable I would like this review to be a warning to other people considering their stay at Villa Lutece bugs were found in more rooms another colleague who was staying in a different room on a different floor was bitten too This is below any standard and the 4 stars which this hotel claims are absolutely not deserved and do not reflect the reality ,No Positive
209521,Villa Lut ce Port Royal, The staff were not friendly at all One old guy sitting on the reception with food in his mouth had no customer skills that was the instant bad impression Room are totally not like what they look like in the pictures They literally feel and looked dirty Rooms are very small not worth the money at all corridors are covered with red carpet and dirt shows on the even a blind person can see it Same is with the door locks If u touch then please please please wash your hands after The hotel does not give u comfort or safe feeling on the contrary u feel scared and insecure They dont even have free cancilation They should have it because after entering the hotel and see the bad customer service almost every one with right mind would want to walk out of that place I guess they know this that is the reason they dont have free cancellation services This hotel in perticulerly spoiled my trip and the image of paris forever for me Please please please people be carefull this place is not worth it at all There is many other places batter then this 100 times on cheeper prices Stay away from this place , WHAT DID I LIKE I HATED IT PLEASE BOOKING COM EITHER REMOVE THIS HOTEL FROM YOUR SITE OR APPROCH THEM TO MAKE SOME NECESSARY CHANGES BECAUSE ANY ONE BOOKS HERE THROUGH YOU IT SPIOLS YOU SITE IMAGE
