299912,Zenit Borrell, Breakfast was pricy dinner was limited in hour No real amenities like gym sauna Jacuzzi and bar was empty Not a social environment Didn t know it was a gay neighbor Was looking to meet men Description of the property should include Gayiaxample , Centrally located great for what we needed 
299913,Zenit Borrell, Pricy for what it is Rooms are very small not the best service the doors didn t lock properly The ac kept breaking down in one of the rooms, Breakfast was good ac in the room was great
299914,Zenit Borrell, The hotel was in a fair location but a bit far from the main metro line L1 so if you plan to be there for 4 5 days be ready to walk every day 1 8 km from and to the metro station There is another one closer Hospital Clinic L5 but it was a bit less useful for us There were some weird noises in the room which we could not determine from where Nothing very disturbing just weird Seemed like some problem with the pipes Not much natural light at least in the room we were We found the bed very hard and had trouble to sleep for the four days we were there , The aircon worked very well and was not too noisy The staff was always nice and ready to solve any issue or offer advise Wifi worked very well everywhere in the location Everything was very clean Location is fairly centric at 10 20 min walking distance of the most centric places in Barcelona 
299915,Zenit Borrell, Desperately in need of renovation and refurbishment The entire hotel seem like 2 star hotel No GYM and no facilities what so ever The first Room they gave me had an issue with the AC where i was not able to sleep all night becuse of the noise it was making bangging sound i informed the reciption the next morning and they gave me another room They didnt even give me any kind of compensation or offer me something for the desscomfort that i had all night that night When i came to check out late they made me pay extra although i have informed them that i have booked through booking com and that i have an extra 2 hours I will never book this hotel again and i do not recommend this hotel to anyone , The fact that i was in the biggest and best room they had which also had a balcony was an advantage but i then came to realize that it was not value for money at all as i could have booked a cheaper hotel with better facilities The balcony has no view and its useless Yes the hotel is close to city center but i could have found a better hotel closer and much better than this one 
299916,Zenit Borrell, The rooms are a bit small The breakfast is 15 euros and it s really really poor and bad Nothing feels fresh The scramble eggs tasted like powder and the rest was bread jam and few more stuff Coffee from the machine really bad I would advice to not include breakfast and eatoutside , Nice and clean hotel
299917,Zenit Borrell, The room needs some renovation redecoration The soap was removed at the first cleaning never to come back Thanks shower gel for filling the gap , Very clean bathroom Mostly quite Nice and friendly staff Close to city center and public transport 
299918,Zenit Borrell, The breakfast wasn t good value for money, It was relatively local but staff were amazing and very accommodating the alcohol was good value for money overall a good stay 
299919,Zenit Borrell, The walls are thin and we could hear people next to us and above us , The hotel is in good shape and staff were friendly The rooms are clean and sufficient but a little bit on a small side We got a good deal so the price was reasonable but the location is so so I would have preferred to be a bit closer to action 
299920,Zenit Borrell,No Negative, The staff is very helpful and customer oriented Location is OK comparable quiet place in Barcelona 7 min walk to Metro and there you can get access to main sight Within 3 min walk there are supermarket and fruit shop A few highly rated bistros are nearby Sergi de Meia and cerverseria catalana 
299921,Zenit Borrell, no kettle so no tea and coffee in the room other than if you are happy to purchase at bar downstairs room was very small so we slept by the door and could hear everything happening outside the room not great if you like to slepp a bit longer until 10am as you will be woken up by doors being slammed by other hotel visitors no door closers on the entrance room doors so the doors make a lot of noise tiled floor finish in corridors great for keeping the flors clean but acoustics are crazy so can hear everything rooms are not 4 star size , Generally clean odd scuff marks here and there The rom is comfortable
299922,Zenit Borrell, far from the city center You can walk about half an hour to get to the center or public transport These prices may be preferred in places closer to the center The pillows were not comfortable Cleaning was not good, One of the better places to stay for the price Room facilities were good 
299923,Zenit Borrell, Really small room with very few spaces to deposit your clothes Not a suitable stay for more than 3 nights in my opinion I found the sugar opened and I left it like that on purpose to see when they will change it They never did I threw away myself the rubbish and only after that they replaced the sugar Limescale on the shower I recommend to the cleaning management to keep the shower tops 2 hours in vinegar in order to remove the limescale Otherwise having a shower is annoying Unpleasant view but I could deal with it as I did not spend too much time in the room Bidet provided but no towel provided for it No toilet brush provided Not a proper cover for duvet Tv placed in the corner not easy to watch it from the bed No mirror provided in the room When choosing my room I have decided for Double Twin Room option and I am pretty sure they gave me a Basic Double Room which is a lower price and quality option I don t like to go back and argue with members of staff what should I get and what not I thought that is understandable from the beginning I have been asked on my preference about the bed and I chose a double one because I travelled with my partner But if you choose twin beds option you get a bigger room Make sure that you get what you pay for , Cleanliness great customer service provided
299924,Zenit Borrell, We booked the hotel on their confirmation that the restaurant was open on Christmas Day They then closed it 24th 25th 26th Notice given on 23rd Dec No restaurant no room service no snack bar and no bar for three days In fact open to outsiders banned to residents Good management skills Thank you for cancelling our Christmas We will be contacting the hotel for compensation for their broken contract , They were gracious enough to serve us a breakfast of frozen croissants dried cake but did manage scrambled eggs and hot tea and coffee Staff overworked did their best and were generally helpful 
299925,Zenit Borrell, The view from the hotel window was not pleasant the breakfast is not included with the rooms prices , The hotel is a good location clean very friendly staff and comfortable rooms 
299926,Zenit Borrell, The basic room was very small and the bed was too small for two skinny people There was no daylight in the room and the room was spayed with a very strong perfume At the first day we did not get shower gel and there was also only one toothbrush and one shampoo no soap After complaining we got what we asked for The hotel is relatively far from the Gothic quarter and I suggest to use the metro , There was complementary water and the room and especially the bathroom appeared to be clean 
299927,Zenit Borrell, Not that many facilities such as a spa or a gym but not required either We knew this in advance , Rather small but clean and cosy rooms Properly cleaned All personnel was very friendly and at our service at any time 
299928,Zenit Borrell, A little bit further than i thought But it s still not that far form the center , The hotel is amazing with their service and friendly staff The room is super clean with good value 
299929,Zenit Borrell, I took a single room It could have been slightly bigger But for the money I paid it was fine , The hotel features an excellent location The hotel stuff is friendly and really helpful For instance they managed to provide me an earlier check in although I requested it just before arrival There are two metro stations in the vicinity of the hotel 
299930,Zenit Borrell, scrambled egg and bacon and sausages at breakfast all on one tray and totally tasteless , Easy to get to Staff very pleasant Terrace for room brilliant Clean modern hotel 
299931,Zenit Borrell, Staff were very helpful and patient whenever we ask they answer with a smile and offer best advice we could have, Room was always very clean and tidy as first day
299932,Zenit Borrell, Small rooms no taxi service available to hotel once reception called the Taxo company We had waited couple of times and taxi never showed up , Central location
299933,Zenit Borrell, Because we had a late check in they put us in a basic room instead of a twin room for what we paid extra The worst is that they insisted that it is a twin room The problem is that the twin room is almost double the size of the basic room and cannot be mistaken And because there were some strange noises coming from the pipes of the AC we demanded to be moved and on the next day we finally got our twin room Next time don t try to lie The shower in both rooms was not working very fluently There is no full size mirror in the room And generally the pictures shown are lying about the room size The rooms are smaller than they look , Location is good Wi Fi signal is good 
299934,Zenit Borrell, Too strong cleaner smell so I need to open sliding balcony door to air the room Also the inner curtain in front of sliding door gets caught when I open the balcony door Prefer a open French door design which I think is better and nicer looking , Balcony Sunshine into the room and makes it brighter Digital safe 
299935,Zenit Borrell, I d close the bar later to let people have breakfast till 11 and we asked for one double bed but we had two twins, Good position and really kind people The hotel is 5 10 minutes to the most beautiful attractions Everything clean 
299936,Zenit Borrell, If you want to eat at the restaurant make sure you have a reservation We took it for granted as hotel residents only to end up looking elsewhere to have lunch, convenient location friendly staff cozy room with comfortable bed clean
299937,Zenit Borrell, Small pillows, Room clean well furnished and comfortable Hotel well situated 5min from metro 20 min from avenue Parallel Staff very nice I recommend it

299939,Zenit Borrell, No ironing board available instead you have to iron your shirts using the small desk in the room This is poor service for business travellers Also breakfast is not included in the room procent which feels cheap It costs an additonal 10 , Location is great Good breakfast buffet 
299940,Zenit Borrell, That the hotel advertised I could ask for a different pillow did so twice and didn t get it the fridge did not work it was reported and not replaced and the curtain rail fell the night before we checked out the rail installed is too flimsy for those curtains , The clean modern look of the hotel and the friendliness and helpful attitude of the staff 
299941,Zenit Borrell, The first room we booked was tiny and the photos prior to booking didn t show the severity of how tiny the room was at all The second room kept us up all night as the aircon was making a shattering sound, The staff were extremely helpful and were able to speak English well which made it easy to communicate
299942,Zenit Borrell, The WiFi is very poor The parking costs 19 per day we ended up going to a much bigger better garage and payed 80 for 12 days , I like the staff at the reception 
299943,Zenit Borrell, Wifi connection is really bad and the location is far from the centre bus stop metro and all the attraction of Barcelona , The room is clean good air conditioner
