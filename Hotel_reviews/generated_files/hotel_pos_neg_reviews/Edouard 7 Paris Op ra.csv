170205,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, My second stay here This time we were there for the Tour de France final The location near Champs Elysees was excellent for that Also good metro access to multiple lines The room itself was very big by Paris standards and very well appointed Nice breakfast Great selection of restaurants close by and bars too recommend Harry s bar for cocktails I came in on train to Gare de Lyon A very easy cab ride from there to hotel 
170206,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, If you are looking for a view of the Eiffel Tower then this is not the place to be , Everything about the propert was great It s in the centre of the city You ll find a lot of shopping restaurants cafes around the hotel It s right in front of the Paris opera The property is small but nicely done up 
170207,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Booking com information about certain parts of the hotel are incorrect Not all delux rooms are 30sm and have a balcony Very important when paying a lot of money to make sure your 10th anniversary goes as planned Poor A C on a hot weekend Generic photos of the best rooms and bathrooms could be misleading Booked a bath got a shower Complained and for the second night was moved to a delux room with a bath and shower and balcony which is where we should have been for both nights , Location and staff
170208,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Nothing at all , The stuff was extremely nice My wife sprained her ankle and it was hard for her to move at the beginning They helped us to find medicine bandage ice bags etc Also allowed her to stay in the room several hours after the check out time It made it much easier to overcome a difficult situation The hotel is very nicely located and recently renovated Very comfortable 
170209,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Need coffee tea facilities in the room or at least made available, Great hotel and very nice facilities Perfect location One negative need coffee tea facilities in the room
170210,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, I have thought hard about this and can think of nothing, Large and well furnished room with very comfortable bed Absolutely superb staff friendly helpful and genuinely interested in our enjoying our stay Made personalised directions for us which helped greatly Very conveniently situated less than10 mins walk from the RoissyBus connection to CDG airport and a short stroll to Louvre Musee Orsay Tuileries and the Printemps and Galeries Lafayette shops Other places easy to reach on foot using BatauBus water taxi Paris is quite compact for viewing museums and monuments and the hotel s central location is perfect for this
170211,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The minibar prices were very high , Luxury hotel when it comes to location staff breakfast beds bath robes cleaning Received free cocktails in the bar on arrival 
170212,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, Breakfast was lovely we got a special rate for it because of the time of year so great value for money The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and the location of the hotel is excellent 
170213,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The rooms are a bit small but that is a feature of most hotels in Paris , The staff are very friendly and the location is superb Rooms are comfortable As I had stayed there before I was given a voucher for two free drinks at the bar very welcome with sterling at a low point against the euro 
170214,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, I loved everything , I loved everything about this beautiful hotel Brilliantly located in the Opera district and within walking distance of a major metro station it s very well situated From the lovely warm welcome including a free drink in the cosy bar to suggestions for restaurants and directions to attractions the staff were just excellent We were lucky enough to be offered a bigger room at a very reasonable increase in tariff which made our stay even better The decor and ambience is warm and stylish with a classic Parisian feel Our room was spacious and very well appointed and included large very comfortable twin beds on request plenty of storage space for cases clothes etc a small seating area and a balcony with views towards the magnificent Garnier Opera The spacious bathroom contained plenty of towels great shower and really nice toiletries The free wifi was efficient and the fridge well stocked The breakfast room was spacious and offered a good range to select from In short I couldn t recommend this wonderful hotel highly enough and am already planning to stay again in November 
170215,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The room size is not that big no complains as it is a historical building , Location is very central only 2min by walk to the opera Warmly served by the whole team Very good breakfast Love the stay 
170216,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The only annoying thing was the bed was too short , Excellent staff very helpful welcoming and accommodating Restaurant was a surprise with good food and wine selection Location was excellent easy 30min walk to most major attractions Very central 
170217,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The only criticism that I have and this is literally me nit picking is the pressure of the shower It was very soft The actual bathroom itself though was great , Everything was great I did a lot of research of which hotel I wanted to stay at and I was not let down This hotel was amazing From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were treated like royalty The location was great walking distance to the louvre and opera and many other attractions 
170218,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, No wash cloth Breakfeast expensive for small buffet, Bed was great Staff amazing But view of opera was only if you go to a semi balcony Room under the roof is too claustrophobic
170219,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, No facilities in the room to make a drink and when we asked for room service for hot drinks this was not available yet you advertise 24hr room service, the staff were friendly and the bed and shower was perfect
170220,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, A shower booth doesn t has such a partition So a floor of bath room will be wet sometimes , Hotel location is excellent We can access to metro station of Opera and Pyramides from this hotel by walk It s only a few minutes Hotel staff are very kindness Also a guest room is very clean You may can take a delicious croissant in a breakfast 
170221,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, disappointing new years eve meal quite small rooms as is often the case the rooms were poorly lit with atmosphere more important than visibility, excellent friendly staff very helpful great location good breakfast
170222,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, The hotel is simply wonderful clean tidy and elegant The staff is super kind and helpful The room was absolutely amazing as well as the position of the hotel We had a lovely view on the Opera Definitely recommended 
170223,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, The reception staff were amazingly helpful They suggested places to go and best way to get there and booked shows for us They were very polite and gracious Rooms very comfortable and White Company toiletries nice touch Would definitely recommend
170224,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Breakfast Every hotel have the omelet in breakfast its a global breakfast i believe and in this hotel I paid to get an omelet in my breakfast disappointing rather than champagne with this room booking start keeping omelet in breakfast , I was staying in Junior Suite with Free Bottle of Champagne Hotel was very near to Opera house and accessible to other attractions 
170225,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The breakfast was very expensive 30 euros so I went to a cafe round the corner for breakfast , Friendly and comfortable hotel in a central location It was also good value though the price may vary with the seasons The rooms were of a reasonable size for a central hotel in Paris though the bathroom had only a shower which worked very well not a bath 
170226,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Not value for money the location was very noisy and the decoration and interior was old and the breakfast was very simple nothing special the toiletry kit was not complete only showe gel champo lotion in general it didn t feel like 4 star , The staff
170227,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, Nice boutique hotel Excellent location Walk to louvre and opera Direct transport to Eiffel Tower and arc de triomphe Short taxi from Gare de Lyon Roissy bus from CDG to Opera Luxuriously furnished Comfortable large rooms Breakfast buffet was ample fresh and excellent for a small hotel Even some sweet treats to finish Staff were most helpful with advice for logistics of our stay in Paris Booking com had not informed the hotel that we had a child with us as was informed on our booking This is not hotels fault and hotel were most helpful in accommodating an unexpected extra guest Than you kindly 
170228,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, Very good location 5 minutes walk to Rossy Bus stop and Opera metro station 10 minutes walk to Musee du Louvre Very friendly and helpful staff Breakfast is also good We will definitely choose this hotel again the next time we visit Paris 
170229,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The hotel and Bar area are adequate but it is the room and location that are the here The hot breakfast wasn t so hot Plenty of lovely places to go to around the area and you will be so tired after discovering Paris that this was not an issue for us , This was just an excellent location 5 min from the Rossy Bus and on the tour bus circuit It is a stones throw from the very lovely if high end shopping area of Place de Vendome but window shopping costs nothing so a great place to have a coffee or a glass of vino I had decided to go for a junior suite as was a treat and we then got upgraded which was just excellent to get such a spacious room in Paris It allows you to really be at the centre and explore The receptionist I think Marie was lovely and helpful We were lucky with the upgrade but the location is great And the bottle of champagne as part of the deal was great and a lovely welcome The breakfast was for coffee fresh orange juice and pastries 
170230,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The service was not great No one said hello goodbye when we would come in leave There was no turn down service No towels were replaced Very expensive though a much cheaper rate was offered on your website but the hotel could do nothing about it The light flickered in the room Two beds were stuck together No nail file even upon request a basic amenity Had to bring up our own luggage despite telling reception we needed it to change for a lunch reservation We waited then called down to ask about its location then we waited then got fed up of waiting so went to collect it from downstairs ourselves At 370 euros definitely not worth the money Very disappointed , The White Company amenities the bathroom tiles the location
170231,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, It was a little pricey and probably more than we wanted to spend But overall it was lovely , The hotel was lovely In a good area The staff were nice helpful 
170232,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, Everything in this hotel is simply excellent from the point of check in reception was friendly n helpful The housekeeper was excellent she remembered we asked for extra soap n cotton pads n provided extra for 3 days in a row without us asking again We can tell every corner of the room were cleaned thoroughly daily Bfast staff received us with smiles and were efficient restaurant is also fantastic Highly recommended 
170233,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful with any queries that we had The location of the hotel was brilliant and also the hotel and the room was comfortable unique and clean We also had dinner at the hotel and found both the food and the staff to be fantastic 
170234,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, I booked my room and paid for deluxe room with balcony When I arrived to the hotel the lady on the counter ignored the balcony so I have to remind her about it but she told me your booking without balcony So I showed her the booking confirmation then she said oh we did not get details from booking com even I paid for my room 6 months ago Then she said actually it s booking com problem After all of that she said i need to tallk to thr manager then she came up with two choices either to take room without balcony or other room with hole take you out the room which was awful I have no choice so I have to accept anything they offer Was very bad experience , Location
170235,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, Beds very comfy breakfast spread was delicious staff always helpful and very friendly Close proximity to major attractions all within walking distance No outside or traffic noise interfering with sleep Recommend highly 
170236,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Nothing, The staff is friendly polite and they speak English very well They helped us about transport information and getting tickets to Louvre and Eiffel Hotel is close to Opera Galaries Lafayette Louvre and many stations You can walk so many points easily Room was clean and big enough Breakfast includes fresh juice fresh fruits newly baked crousants cakes french cheeee egg granolas etc You can easily find something you like to eat 
170237,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, We were not advised that the hotel restaurant closed throughout August this was disappointing, Totally soundproofed close to tour bus and airport roissy bus
170238,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Nothing, Edouard 7 is perfect The staffs were extremely friendly and the location was wonderful You ould get to anywhere in Paris within 15 20 minutes max with Op ra Garnier in walking distance The room was neat tidy and comfortable Would definitely come back 
170239,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, There was a language barrier in the restaurant and with the front desk I wish I could speak French , It is a beautiful hotel and I loved being able to go out on a balcony was so freeing The decor was tasteful and I loved the fact that it is a small hotel 
170240,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, Good location to visit the most of the attractions that we planned to go The staffs are very nice they warmly helped us in contacting with museum to get back passport we left there and let us print some attraction voucher papers I am happy to stay again next time and recommend it to my friends 
170241,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Did have neighbours banging doors while in and out of their room early in the morning while enjoying a lie in But this is being very fussy , Great location Only a 5 minuite walk from the louvre A hour walk to the eiffel tower however a lovely walk none the less along the river Very friendly people great places to eat all within walking distance Staff were very helpfull Nothing was too much trouble 
170242,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The balconies were tiny in keeping with other properties in the area Not wide enough to sit out on even in the suite , The staff were lovely and most helpful The location was superb The hotel was charming Very quiet despite being on a main road Would definitely stay there again 
170243,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Absolutely nothing I changed my booking about one week prior to this stay This hotel was more expensive but was worth the expense , The hotel staff best experience from any hotel stay at home or abroad Loved the suite very spacious comfortable and great views 
170244,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The room needs to have a small pot for coffee and tea , The hotel has a great location since it is only a short walk from major museums and the Seine River We really liked the size of the bathroom and shower 
170245,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, We were initially shown into a beautiful room with a balcony and view of the Opera however a large area of the carpet was very wet and the room smelled awful Our guess is that the previous guest had been sick on the carpet and the staff had tried to clean it We asked to change rooms and there was no problem doing so the staff were apologetic and accommodating , Good shower nice little balcony comfy bed helpful staff changing rooms printing Eurostar tickets etc 
170246,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, The staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs bringing an electric jug etc to our room The location is fabulous right in the middle of everything 
170247,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, WiFi was very weak, We LOVE the Edouard 7 Paris Opera We stayed at 5 hotels in our month long stay in France and this hotel was by far the BEST It is a 5 star hotel in our book and we can t recommend it strongly enough We stayed for 11 nights and it was wonderful Thanks Edouard When we arrived the hotel staff brought us some fresh baked treats and a huge bottle of Evian Nice They gave us a welcome letter and checked on us in the first hour after we arrived to make sure everything was ok and to see if we needed anything Every evening the cleaning staff checked in to see if we needed anything and if the room was cleaned to our satisfaction Nice The staff were wonderful polite and extremely accommodating Our bed was uncomfortable so they brought in an entire new bed for us Wow now that s customer service Any request was immediately responded to with a smile Sometimes it seemed we just hung up and they were already at our door They gave us an upgraded room with a fantastic view It was beautiful The hotel was in a great location There was a wonderful daily breakfast that was included with our stay with a huge selection of delicious food We were very happy with our stay at the Edouard and plan to stay there again It is a fabulous hotel with outstanding customer service 5 stars and A 
170248,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Breakfast while very good was a bit expensive especially when you consider the quality of the croissants and pains au chocolat available within a very short walk out the front door of this hotel It s not every morning that you get to wake up in Paris so taking a walk in a beautiful part of one of the prettiest cities on earth to grab a fresh French pastry warm out of the oven is not punishment And you ll save a small fortune if you do this We treated ourselves to the delicious breakfast at the hotel on only one out of two days when we were staying as guests previously , This is a comfortable well located and well managed hotel where staff take very good care of their guests The quality of a well run small hotel chain is palpable Service is courteous efficient feels personalized Rooms are comfortable and clean with a bright understated decor which lends a hint of upmarket feel Bedding is of a very high quality and the beds are very comfortable Bathrooms are clean bright well designed and furnished with very good soaps and hair products from the White Company This is a great hotel It has a distinctly Parisian feel and offers a few touches of luxury which is always a treat when you re visiting a city like Paris 
170249,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, This place is perfect, We were upgraded to a junior suite which was magnificent Gorgeous view from balcony high end bedding top line amenities helpful staff at all hours Great location near several metro stations cafes restaurants souvenir stores Very safe area 
170250,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Difficult parking our rental car when we arrived , Location was perfect for touring Paris Room was very comfortable and clean Staff are helpful and spoke excellent English 
170251,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, we had paid for a De Luxe room and for the most part the room was excellent however i must mention the WC It appeared that the toilet may have been removed from the bathroom to include a bath which meant there was a separate toilet which was tiny as a 2m tall man it was extremely difficult to manouevre in and out, the hotel location was excellent the staff were superb throughout they could not have been more attentive or helpful
170252,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, It was a perfect stay in Paris Absolutely beyond the expectations The hotel is incredible beautifully decorated in art deco style which is exactly what you are dreaming for when you stay in Paris We loved the view from the balcony to Paris Opera the cental location walking distance to all major landmarks the service and delicious breakfast they even serve freshly squizzed juice which is rare even in 5 stars All facilities and the room looks absolutely new and not tired as most hotels you find in Paris Reception staff is very friendly and helpful expecially we are grateful to concierge Antoine He helped us with every our need from parking our car to booking a wonderful restaurant for dinner We will definately come back 
170253,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Toilets restrooms did have soap or towels to clean your hand from 7 9 00am Needs to be actioned , Excellent staff and very knowledgeable about restaurants and tours and sites Excellent and clean accommodations with refurbished rooms Good location to close to the train stations and tourist
170254,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The welcoming person at the breakfast room can be more friendly in the morning I would prefer a smiley face , Great Hotel Renovated rooms very clean and super comfortable beds All white and beautiful toilet I loved this hotel the location is great walking distance to many museums and attraction points As a very hygiene concern person I found the pillows mattress and towels very clean so loved the cleanliness and this is very important for me The staff is great Marie helped us for everything with a smile So if you are going to Paris I strongly suggest Edouard 7 From now on Edouard 7 will be my Paris hotel 
170255,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, I have to say that for the price this is the best hotel we have stayed at in Paris and we have stayed at many in this price category The staff is lovely they offered us an upgrade on our room and the location is great 
170256,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, When asked for an omelette for breakfast we were told there would be an extra charge of 9 euros we thought this would have been included in the breakfast , The hotel was small stylish the staff were very helpful Our room had a balcony a fabulous view of the Opera House 
170257,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Had to switch rooms bc the first one was along a narrow street and sounds reverberated at times , Unbelievably friendly and accommodating staff Great room Perfect location 
170258,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Nothing , The hotel is in an ideal location centrally located between the opera house and the louvre The room was clean well appointed and the staff at the hotel were wonderful They were pleasant polite and helpful We definitely want to return to the Eduardo7 
170259,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, staff, the first room was on the 7th floor and was extreme dark we got moved to the 4th floor where it was smaller but much better going to paris we obviously wanted tickets to enter the lourve versailles and paris disney land where the staff manage to get all the bookings wrong 
170260,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Nothing, Whilst the hotel is looking a little dates everything is clean and functional The view is amazing and having a balcony is defiantly a plus But something extra needs to be said about the staff AMAZING The hotel culture is one of service and the need to please Well done to management 
170261,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, If there s anything it would be nice if the room is supplied with an electric kettle We got one from the concierge , Perfect location friendly staff room of good size and modern decor comfortable beds good value for money Would be more than happy to stay at this hotel when I visit Paris again 
170262,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, A longer stay no negative comments , The room was a good size the bed linens towels were of good quality comfortable The breakfast was very good staff was exceptionally pleasant helpful Great location 5 minute walk to train system buses I would highly recommend this hotel 
170263,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Continental breakfast clarity toast and cereal was included yoghurt wasn t as a paying client how would you know the issue was resolved amicably , Brilliant welcoming staff accommodation was immaculate
170264,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Restaurant and drinks in hotel mega expensive 20 euro for a glass of general champagne Other drinks just as expensive Very noisy road so if you are a light sleeper take ear plugs or stay somewhere else other than those small things that can be easily rectified it s a nice place to stay and the staff are very lovely, Great hotel clean great staff
170265,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, Room was spacious for Paris and did not have any smoke odor Lots of windows and quiet The staff was helpful and accommodating The bar and restaurant were also good and discounted for guests 
170266,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, I didn t think the price was not fair for one person the size of the room lack of a comfortable chair My 2 friends shared a room for the same price as my room They also had 2 comfy chairs , I loved the location and the staff My bed was very Comfortable 
170267,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Nothing to complain about, Great location near Opera shops restaurants and a short walk from the Louvre Super friendly staff which isn t always the case in Paris
170268,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, Just the fact that breakfast buffet was not to my liking but i did not mind getting my breakfast outside , Location friendly staff cleanliness nothing to complain 
170269,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The internal sound isolation is not very good We heard constant noises from the coridors every time someone paassed there Also the housekeeping is a liitle bit overdoing Knocked our door 2 times a day though we did not ask anything , Beautiful hotel Great location The staff is very helpful and courteous plenty nice restaurants and bakeries near it
170270,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, overpriced breakfast, Very clean and tidy room amazing view great location the staff was very nice and helpfull when needed felt like a 5 star hotel 
170271,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, The pillows for me are too soft therefore I wake up with a pain in the neck If there were options on pillows it would be perfect I booked a standard room with a king sized bed however I ended up with a room which was very small and only with a single bed This was very different from what i learned from the website and images The shower room was also very small and design didn t really help to keep your bathroom dry and clean After the shower there was water everywhere on the bathroom floor so be careful when you step out of the shower room , The location and the hotel staff Location is the biggest advantage Situated in the Opera area you can easily reach Louvre Orsey Madelaine and big shopping malls such Galerie Lafayette and Printemos etc within walking distance and Paris is a city that you can visit by walking Metro stations are also one minute away The hotel staff are very friendly polite and helpful They speak good English and are willing to offer help always 
170272,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra,No Negative, Very friendly staff Breakfast with fresh fruit juice Very nice location close to Rue St Anne which has a lot of Japanese restaurants when we missed Japanese food
