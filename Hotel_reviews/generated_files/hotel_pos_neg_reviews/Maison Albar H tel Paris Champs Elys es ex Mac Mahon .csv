133556,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , Our stay was great and the hotel staff were very accommodating, Our initial room was tiny and we payed extra and upgraded to the executive suite which was lovely The staff were helpful and accommodating The location was excellent and central The view from of room was amazing The bed was comfortable and croissants were good too
133557,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon ,No Negative, Location is perfect Super super super close to Arc de Triomphe A lot of restaurants around this property The staffs in this hotel are extremely nice and professional The breakfast is various and delicious The hotel is clean Everything is amazing I will definitely stay in this hotel next time 
133558,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , No hospitality no Aircon working breakfast very poor small extremely small Not 5 star at all No value for money Will not recommend anyone to stay here, Only location
133559,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , It s definitely not a proper 5 star hotel Not organised with regards to room cleaning 3 cleaners walked into the room within a span of one hour without knocking Furthermore no one helped with the baggage during check out They have a day tax of approx 7 euro which must be payed in cash Personally I think it s to evade taxes when hotels request for cash to be paid The front desk staff were friendly The shower drainage was not sufficient and would fill up during a shower I suppose coming from the middle east the hotel standards are very high and as a result most European hotels can t compare You need to lower your expectations , Location and the toilet is quite fancy and high tech which is cool
133560,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , the public computer was an Apple and I could not figure out how to use it The maid would remove service items from my room like a pillow or washcloth or bath mat etc I do not know why , excellent service from most of the staff
133561,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , No separation between shower and toilet so the entire bathroom got soaked whilst Having a shower , Beautifully decorated hotel room and really friendly staff Great location with a view of arc de triomphe and right next to champs elysees 
133562,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , The only thing I didn t like was that I paid for the property well in advance then lost my credit card due to the hotel policy I had to pay again with my new credit card and they would refund me my original payment However I have now been waiting over 3 weeks for the refund and have had no email back from the hotel ,No Positive
133563,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , Please stop coming and checking if everything is ok every afternoon evening We just want to chill sleep and not answer the door , Super comfy bed Reasonable sized room Coffee making facility Superb location 
133564,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , The staff were awful Bartender refused to serve me a Gin and tonic stating she had to cook a meal for another customer first There was no one else in the bar The time she took to say she couldn t pour a simple drink was longer than the act of pouring would have taken Utterly disgusting The room safe didn t work and they couldn t fix it I wasn t asked about my stay when I checked out They failed to order me a cab when asked and after 15 minutes I had to ask again Dreadful dreadful dreadful Avoid , Excellent quality of fittings and fixtures Room safe didn t work and they couldn t fix it 
133565,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , nothing to not like, The staff were great the overall cleanliness of the hotel was out standing the room was excellent Great location easy access to Metro arch de Triomphe Champs lys es and rest of City A 
133566,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , See above comments, This doesn t deserve to be a 5 star hotel better a 4 star Poor facilities and cramp everywhere The hot water was cold in the shower and the pressure was like when I pass urine Same pressure Overall poor facilities
133567,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , personal I have made the reservation and paid the total money by master card on internet 2 weeks before my travel and I thought everything was ok But just because i did not had my card with me they would not give me the room they demand I pay cash and then they told me that If I choose to change to another hotel they will use my card information and take the total money from my account Too much stress They have really destroyed my trip How can it be possible that they could use the card if I changed the hotel but they would not use the card when I stayed at the hotel I went to Paris to shop but I could not do that because I have to pay the hotel cash and I did not have my card with me , location 
133568,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , not a professional staff and not friendly at all no refill to the coffee stand there is no early check in and late checkouts, location and the interior design 
133569,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , Everything in the room and hotel is too small and the breakfast is nice but very restrictive , The location and viewing l arc de triumph right from our window We were also upgraded to a better room for free 
133570,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , The superior room is too small compared to the pictures of the same standing Two doors to access the bathroom Lighting is not easy to find A shower instead of a bath in a superior room , Location is good 
133571,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon ,No Negative, The hotel staff were outstanding and very accommodating and made this a memorable trip as I has very specific requirements for my room post proposal to my fiance Prior to the trip I liaised with staff via email who planned everything out with me and offered special deals On site Alex from the front desk managed the entire booking and upgraded our room to a suite with view of the Arc de Triomphe The best experience we ve had with a hotel we will definitely be returning to visit on our anniversaries and will be staying at the Maison Albar Hotel 
133572,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , Staff were unhelpful We booked a superior room and we had a box room on the top floor that felt like a prison it was covered In dust above the bed Phoned to complain about constant noise but staff did not care Felt like we were dealing with robots who were reading from scripts Ordered room service and did not come even after I called twice to see where our drinks were her reply was my colleagues are busy but I ll ask again finally after three hours I phoned and got transferred to another person who got them within 5 minutes Poor service and overpriced , Excellent location and looks nice 
133573,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , The most dissapointing trip ever The hotel has the most ridiculous and complicated procedures ever Prepare all the documents for that trip because you don t know what they may need They took the payment for the stay twice and took them 3 weeks to return it If I didn t get help from booking I don t know if I ever would get my money back The director was rude she ignored me and my emails It s a beautiful hotel and fantastic location but, It s a great location very nice and clean interiors All the staff but the director very kind and friendly
133574,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , They took money from 2 bank cards as payment then reversed one of them on departure Which doesn t become available in your account for up to 3 days they later told me This left me with very little money on my card I m only home today and still awaiting money to be reimbursed I m hoping it actually does and that we aren t out double payment for hotel , Rooms where smaller than imagined
133575,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , if you re at the back of the hotel the views aren t great, Beautiful interior and location is literally a stones throw from the Arc de Triumphe Staff are nice too Highly recommend
133576,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , The room is a little bit small which is not easy for me and my friend to put our big luggages Plus the drain is horrible When we taking shower the showering space is flood which is really annoyed, The location is perfect close to the metro and bus stations We can visit many famous views easily Also the staffs here are really nice 
133577,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , The rooms are small the breakfast was not included even though with this rate, Early check in frindely staff Location nearby coffees restaurants easy access to metro line 1 and also there is a grocery shop may be 300 meters walking distance 
133578,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon ,No Negative, 2nd time Mac Mahon excellent staff and hotel Delivered a try of goodies for my birthday and they arrange a lot of the restaurants for us Will always go back 
133579,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , Nothing our trip was perfect Will definitely be back , The staff were very friendly and accommodating the location was fantastic just a couple of hundred metres from the Arc de Triomphe Would recccomend to anyone 
133580,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , You were still busy with renovations which was not too intrusive but when finished the experience would even have been better , The staff was very helpful and friendly Your body lotion and wash with the lemon verbena smell was the best of 8 hotels we visited in Italy and the Netherlands during this trip We loved the quirkiness of the decor 
133581,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , There was heavy construction works going on in the hotel from the early hours of Friday all throughout the day and from ver early on Monday morning This was very disrupting to us as it woke us up very early and was a source of constant irritation This should have been communicated before we booked as we would not have stayed here had we known We found this very disturbing The staff were clearly under huge pressure as they were receiving multiple complaints from staff and as a result not giving the customers good service ,No Positive
133582,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , Nothing, Staff are friendly rooms are really nice comfortable cozy clean specious and definitely the location Family room is well equipped with kitchint
133583,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , Nite receptionist was not professional was not eager to help and focused on playing with computer not dressed in hotel uniform and drinking coffee from a small carton cup while talking with me Made hotel feel like a 2 star Also Rooms pillows where awful , Room size was good receptionist at check was great
133584,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , the staff the service the reception small entrance no soundproof no tv channels no english speakers no facilities, the room was comfortable and the bathroom was luxurious 
133585,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , We were charged 150 Euros for damage we didn t cause to a mirror in the room We were not even questioned by the hotel our card was just charged and invoice sent which was disappointing and upsetting We spent over 100 Euro in phone calls following up to ensure they understood it was not any of our doing and the mirror was cracked when we arrived So long as this doesn t happen again we would 100 stay there again the hotel was stunning and a great location , Everything was wonderful Great location great staff wonderful and interesting decor 
133586,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , No welcome drinks for genius client on booking com the reception is too small and the attitude of the stuff is bad I think it is a 3 star hotel or less,No Positive
133587,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , View wasn t great but they combat this with a TV channel that has a live feed over the city It s to be expected with city centre hotels Wouldn t put me off staying again , The hotel was fantastic Could not have asked for more Staff were great made us feel very comfortable Nothing was too much trouble Room was really trendy and well kept Shower was of a good size and really easy to use 
133588,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , The dark decor is a bit morose It is certainly not five star quality in terms of place or serice , The ongoing renovation makes the lobby most unattractive in fact there is hardly any space left to enter exit the hotel

133590,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , This was not a 5 star hotel by any means They do not have a concierge They do not have a lobby only a hallway with a desk They do not clean your room unless you ask They do not give you shampoo and conditioner unless you ask They do not have irons in the rooms They do not have luggage racks in the rooms These are all staples of a 5 star hotel which they claim to be On top of all of that they have construction going on The hotel was not remotely close to being full and they wanted to put us directly over the construction We had to ask to be someplace higher above it and the best they could do is move us up to two floors above the construction This is not a 5 star hotel experience Stay away , The location was good and the shower was nice 
133591,Maison Albar H tel Paris Champs Elys es ex Mac Mahon , The sound proofing of the room could have been better both towards the other rooms and to the street , Excellent location nice design of the room and the entire hotel
