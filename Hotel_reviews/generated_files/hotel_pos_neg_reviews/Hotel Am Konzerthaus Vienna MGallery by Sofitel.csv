268246,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, Booked Superior Room the best room the property has It was most terrible to be woken up by the sound of the hotel s elevator electrical engine every morning The noise is so intense that you can forget about sleeping between 6am and 8am The most disappointing fact is that hotel staff knows about the problem since they readily provide ear plugs but only after complaints and still continue to offer the room as the best accommodation in the property ,No Positive

268261,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, A waiting line to be seated for breakfast is unacceptable for the price we payed Especially because there were free tables so no need to hold people waiting An overall delay of almost 30 min is no good start of the day The room wasn t particularly clean either especially during the stay Overall I would expect better service for the money , Stylish interior a comfortable room atmospheric Some nice little extra s such as little chocolates or a cup of herbal tea in the evening

268268,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, What I liked most is the staff , First the staff are highly professional and extremely friendly It is located in a quiet area yet within walking distance to downtown metro station and CAT The hotel has a great balance of modern and good function

268273,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, The staff is outstanding but the owner or manager does not take action hat is obviously required We had one of the better rooms There was a single bed to be used as a couch with added cushions for a back rest This lack of a comfortable place to sit is not what one pays for Here it was made much worse by fact that the curtains behind the bed go to the floor and cannot be drawn unless the couch bed is away from the wall which means that when one leans back the cushions fall back Thus one must sit as on the edge of a bed This has been a problem since the room was furnished perhaps a decade ago The staff tried but there is just not a solution short of a real couch If management is not willing to do this perhaps the curtains could be hemmed so that the bed does not block pulling them closed at night , The location is about perfect 
268274,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, horrid meat choices cheap juice cereal pre served in mugs with no room for milk decor not very sofitel definitely seemed like a cheaper model , nice staff

268280,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, Breakfast zone is pretty small for such hotel Be ready to wait up to 10 minutes in lobby until they invite you , A spacious room with a large window The most delicious breakfast we ve ever eaten at the hotel a great choice of cheeses and appetizers Easy to get there from Hauptbahnhof just 25 minutes walking through beatiful Belvedere park And most importantly on Saturdays at 10 00 am they offer free 2 hour tours through the quiet courtyards of the old town English and German languages It was very interesting 
268281,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, Bathroom was ok but sorry very inconvenient toilet tub Would be good to have more modern type of sanitary equipment in the stylish hotel , Location is excellent quite street but close to center and Belvedere tram stop is in 3 min walking Hotel is renovated with good taste Klimpt style room was spacy good cleaning very good breakfast Wi Fi was at acceptable good level Tea set in the room Staff at the reception is very friendly We did laundry and it was done in a perfect way

268285,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, The room was on the top and I add always a kind of background noise most probably from some AC engine for me it was ok since I was extremely tired and I could sleep anyway but some people may not like it The facilities are very very old and need a urgent refurbishment The TV was a smart TV from the early 00 s with a very very bad signal reception ok I was not there to watch tv but at least I would like to actually be able to watch a TV channel if I need want to If the mattress could speak she would probably tell you some good stories as it was old and used for good All these aspects are ok if you don t care too much or if we are dealing with a cheap hotel But I wasn t expecting this from a supposedly good brand I stayed in IBIS and Holiday Inn much better than this for half of the price , The location Cleanliness and the fact that the Hotel provided instant coffee and tee you could use for your breakfast Bathroom goodies were also very good 
268286,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, Breakfast time is very crowded Most days we had to wait to be seated which is not a problem in itself you just need to be aware and plan accordingly if time is an issue for you But breakfast is included and worst the wait , The location is great You can easily just walk to all the main attractions But even though the hotel is very close to the city centre it s located at a fairly quiet street I was placed in a very quiet room perfect for a good night sleep after all the sightseeing

268288,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, Wifi was weak but really we did not travel to Vienna to surf the internet There was a strange situation with minibar in the end but it was resolved by the staff without any problems , As for us it was 10 out of 10 Perfect staff very responsive to our requests Very nice room clean and comfortable We stayed when the temperature was over 30 and enjoyed complimentary mineral water each day served to our room Breakfasts were tasty Location was perfect to visit theatres and other places we planned to visit Small fun tip if you are in your room and look under the bed on the last day to check if you left nothing you will have a lot of fun as we did Hope to visit other chain properties 
268289,Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna MGallery by Sofitel, The few restaurant staff had disappointed me during my stay 22 06 2016 to 25 06 2016 During my first breakfast I found a cling film in my salmon parcel and mentioned it to the one of the staff I was not expecting much but a reassurance that the rest of the food had been prepared to the highest standard of safety and hygiene was expected In fact the same staff to whom I brought this attention to didn t even say a word let alone any apology On my last day of breakfast while I was still having my breakfast the staff just took away my cup without asking whether I had finished my breakfast Not until I made a remark to my friend of what had happened then only the same staff brought over a cup Also on that same morning over breakfast I was sitting on the table for two by the cutlery station On safety ground the staff could have stood further away from the myself the sitting guest rather than having tray of pots of coffee teas and dirty plates and cutlery over my shoulder and head I dread to think if any of them dropped those trays over me I could have suffered serious injury , The bed in 625 was comfortable and love the arty Gustav K headboard The front house staff particularly Oliver were friendly and very accommodating
