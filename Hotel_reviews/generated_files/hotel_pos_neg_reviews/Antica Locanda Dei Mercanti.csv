487038,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, A fantastic hotel in Brera this is really lovely hotel in the heart of Milan 2 minutes walk to Duamo And not just a hotel but like somebody s home you feel very welcome and all rooms are unique they ve balconies terrace and decoration is super cute A nice Italian breakfast and nice stuff Highgly recommend 
487039,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, The room was very bright and comfortable Sleek modern decor and air conditioning during a freak heatwave was much appreciated The hotel breakfast was excellent and the location was great We were just a short walking distance from Teatro alla Scala and only a little bit further to the Duomo 
487040,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, The bathrooms needed a little furniture to place wash bags etc , Excellent location between Duomo and Castle on a quiet side street The hotel was originally a merchants house so the rooms have high ceilings and are elegant Our room was spacious with seating space to relax Large windows for light air conditioning Breakfast was very good and staff friendly attentive 
487041,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, Hardly anything it was a wonderful experience Personally a little pricy for me but for a special treat well worth it the pampered luxury There is a lift to each floor but 6 steps to the lift so if navigating much luggage it can be difficult but staff are most helpful with this if you ask , 1 Hotel staff was always friendly and most helpful 2 My room Bamboo was exquisite It had a partial wraparound terrace excellent wifi complimentary bottled water and was very quiet and restful 3 Very close to the center short walking distance to Duomo La Scala Brera district Metro taxis 
487042,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, No bad remarks , This boutique hotel was exceptional We travel Europe frequently and always enjoy smaller and quaint establishments like these Such a lovely room and location was great Breakfast was so much more than just a Continental affair Hospitality a 10
487043,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, It s a little bit difficult to find the place So be certain to get good instructions before your arrival The staff will be more than happy to help you , The staff was very friendly and helpful and the location is superb you can easily visit the main sightseeings by foot without using any public transportation All the same the metro station is just five minutes away Breakfast was more than adequate Everything was really nice 
487044,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Great position easy walking to central area of Milan Very helpful staff 24hour service booked our Duomo tickets for us Good breakfast Good wi fi 
487045,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, The entrance is very obscure We would not have found it if it were not for the direction of a stranger in the alley way Additional information ahead of the trip would have corrected that problem , The patio was an additional plus It added a feel of spaciousness 
487046,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, The value for money It s a litlle bit expensive but location justifies it , Great location the room was very spacious and very clean The staff was very kind We really enjoyed the stay 
487047,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, The hotel itself was a little difficult to find although the street was not There is no sign with the name of the hotel just very large double green doors Then you have to go up a few steps to the very small lift to the reception area on 1 in order to register Breakfast was lovely , The staff was extremely friendly and competent answering our questions even before we arrived The veranda off of our room was blooming with huge pots of flowers and trees and the scent of the jasmine greeted us every time we opened our door 
487048,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Great location beatifull rooms The stuff is very warm and helpful make it a very pleasant experience we will defenitally like to come back
487049,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, The breakfast is not buffet and it s a little bit strange for the first day however all the included items are so delicious also you can order some extras without further charge, Almost everything Their main plus is the location Also staff was so friendly and helpful they upgraded our room free of charge to the one the best hotel rooms I ever stayed We will definitely come back to this hotel for the next trip to Milano
487050,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, I was staying in a suite 22 Segreta and the layout lighting and amenities had a few question marks for me To start with there was no kettle or anything to have a cup of tea coffee which I find strange for a suite even though there was a sink a tap and even an oven all disfunctional and hidden under a sort of table top in the living room Second the lighting was extremely complex to figure out The light switches on the wall in the living room were all not working and lamps needed to be switched off individually Not a huge problem really especially considering that this hotel occupies part of old building in the center of Milan But what really bothered us is that the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a semi transparent sliding partition so that not only sound insulation is non existent but also the light in the bathroom immediately and completely illuminates the entire bedroom Which in the middel of the night could really be a nuisance if you are travelling with a family , The room s interior was actually very nice It had a lot of light and was clean and spacious The breakfast was very good for the hotel of such small size The location is superb Overall a really nice small and charming hotel especially for a couple without kids 
487051,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, Not much A little more help trying to find a doctor on a Saturday might have been useful But to be fair my local family didn t come up with many better options Just as a general observation hotels offer say they will offer assistance finding local medical or dental help if required but when pressed often fail to come up with much I seem to get ill on holiday A LOT , Fantastic location for us 5 minutes walk from Duomo and the right side of town for us for visiting family Molto convenient Nice sized suite for our family of 3 Good powerful shower Breakfast looked great but I was unwell two mornings out of three so couldn t really enjoy it to the full The rest of the family enjoyed it 
487052,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Very central but still very quiet located in a narrow street Tastefully furbished and equipped The staff is very friendly and helpful I would definately recommend this place for a city trip to Milan 
487053,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Very cozy boutique style hotel located 7 min walk from La Scala Very spacious rooms and comfortable beds The street where the hotel sits is very small and with no traffic so is calm and nothing bothers your sleep It felt more like home than a typical hotel environment The staff were super friendly and helpful I would definitely come back and next time star in one of the rooms with private terrace 10 out of 10 for me 
487054,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, Night manager refused to give us remote control for temperature control had to call manager got ugly weird , Room and terrace were lovely breakfast was good and day staff were a pleasure 
487055,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, Absolutely nothing, Our room was beautiful spacious and we had the most wonderful terrace The location was so near to everything staff was friendly efficient and so helpful I would highly recommend this unique wonderful hotel AA 
487056,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Very original boutique and cosy ambiance in the heart of Milan walking distance to all main attractions Spacy rooms more resembling an appartament than hotel Great atmosphere 
487057,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, They could have had a bit more variety at breakfast but the food was good and the staff was accommodating when we asked for extras at breakfast Nothing not to like really , I really loved this place and would stay there again on my next trip to Milan The location couldn t have been better Central and close to everything and yet the street was really quiet I also loved the modern decor inside a very old building The staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful and gave us good restaurant recommendations The room was spacious enough to fit the three of us comfortably and the linens and pillows were super comfy 
487058,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, The approach to the Locanda was a little offputting and though the room was very expensive and you were encouraged to take breakfast in your room and with a terrace why wouldn t you there was a 10 room charge for doing so , Being upgraded to a room with a larger terrace for our one night stay This was a joy as the weather was so warm and sunny The room was bright and fresh though not luxurious But the terrace was amazing 
487059,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, The twin beds were narrow firm but probably not used that way often Including meat cheese as part of the breakfast without having to request would be useful , Loved having the terrace fantastic being able to sit out there enjoy the night sounds with a drink Staff were very helpful 
487060,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, A teeny bit pricey but the size of the room was so much larger than usual for Western Europe that it basically made up for extra cost , Great staff Wonderful room Nice that they make your breakfast to order Location is simply fantastic business or leisure 
487061,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Staff brilliant emailing before we arrived spoke excellent English and were extremely helpful Everything they said would happen did And on time We particularly liked the terrace very relaxing space Hotel was quiet too 
487062,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, N a, Totally unique Rooms nside an apartment building Beautifully converted with Minimal Zen decor Flowers in tubs on the terraces in window boxes Wonderful Quiet residential street Breakfast elegantly served Tea coffee a glass of wine You only had to ask Ps A very good hairdresser right next door 
487063,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Only few minutes walking distance from Brera area and Duomo Very very nice and private terrace from the room Very fresh products for the breakfast 
487064,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, There were a lot of stairs to get to our room at the end of the day although this was offset by being in an very old and lovely building , Our room was open light and clean Great place to come to at the end of a long day looking around the historical centre of Milan Location was just off one of the main shopping eating areas and easy to walk to other areas 
487065,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Stuff very helpful with everything nice breakfast with a nice view lots of flowers everywhere very large rooms working air coditioning It s a very small hotel so you don t need to give you room number or anything as the stuff knows you from the first day so very convinient in many cases Hotel is 200 300 meters from Duomo and 50 meters from via Dante so cannot have any better location 
487066,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, Nothing to think of , What a find as near to dead centre of Milan as you could get Not a hotel but more of rooms Perfect peaceful elegant If you re in Milan for a couple of days don t want a full on Hotel but fancy a change and want to have great accommodation and be well looked after then try here 
487067,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, It would have been nice to have more hot coffee at breakfast the room safe and hairdryer did not work but i am sure they would have fixed these things had i been bothered i had no complaints really it was lovely , Lovely terrace Freindly staff Very tranquil in such a central location 
487068,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Room and bathroom were spotless tastefully decorated and very spacious Staff extra helpful Amazing location very central but quiet I m so happy I choose this for my wedding weekend

487070,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, The room was lovely large and light with fresh flowers and windows overlooking the street and good bathroom facilities The breakfast was also very nice Best of all though was the warm welcome from the staff 
487071,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, The historic building that houses the hotel is lovely but unfortunately the rooms were not well constructed and the walls are paper thin We could hear everything from the rooms beside and above us coughing flushing the toilet walking talking There are independent apartments in the building so not all of the rooms are associated with the hotel The noise went quite late the upstairs tenants were having a dinner party and started very early making it impossible to get a good sleep , The terrace was absolutely beautiful and full of flowers a lovely place to sit and relax 
487072,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Very kind and responsive service at reception and breakfast It does not feel like being in a hotel room rather in a small and nice rented apartment 
487073,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, Sewage odor in the bathroom , Great location between the Duomo and the Castello Sforzesco close to the shopping mile Via Dante We booked a room with a beautiful terrace which was modern and nicely decorated 
487074,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, Rooms are in the top floor of an old building that does not have the class of the Locanda not as well maintained It was a bit expensive , Very well kept with class in the bedroom and the dining room Very courteous personnel Nice breakfast Wonderful terrace on our room Location could not be better 
487075,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, Excellent staff great housekeeping fabulous location intimate yet in the heart of Milan Breakfast on the terrace was a wonderful way to begin the day The responsiveness to our requests for dinner reservations dry cleaning directions recommendations and transportation was superb in every way 
487076,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, It s one floor up so not great if you have heavy luggage, Lovely staff and beautiful rooms with orchids everywhere Minutes away from duomo Will definitely be back here feels like a home away from home
487077,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti,No Negative, This is a terrific brilliantly located boutique hotel in Milan It was spotless modern in a beautiful old building with mostly white everywhere couches chairs linen towels Beds very comfortable we had our 23 year old son with us aircon great bathroom modern and well stocked with their own shampoos Breakfast in their lovely small dining area The hotel is a minute or so from the main shopping precinct 5 mins from a great set of outdoor eating areas ten mins max to the Duomo and square ten mins to the fortress all in walking time Would definitely stay there again Staff were superb very helpful and service no1 
487078,Antica Locanda Dei Mercanti, I guess the one thing that made me wonder is the price of the rooms They are nice but not what you could call five star The linens are a bit cheap and things are missing like somewhere to hang your towel The breakfasts were nice but after three nights were a bit repetitive We really enjoyed our experience but I would most probably look for somewhere cheaper next time , This hotel generally gets positive ratings and you can see why The location is excellent The hotel is on a quiet street just off the main shopping area near to a couple of Metro stations The staff are fantastic and the place is spotless We had one of the terrace rooms the slightly larger one on the roof and there is no doubt it is a beautiful room It is light and spacious and the little garden is lovely It was general quiet except for the garbage pickup one morning
