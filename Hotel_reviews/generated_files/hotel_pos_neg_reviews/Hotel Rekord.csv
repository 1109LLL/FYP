382669,Hotel Rekord,No Negative, Very friendly service Nice location both for city sightseeing and beach Metro nearby and bus directly to the beach Small shop on other street big shop on bus line Comparable big fridge in the room good to have for eating self bought food No overflowing tourist spot like ramblas We enjoyed our stay 
382670,Hotel Rekord, quite noisy on ground floor in morning as cleaner uses cupboards outside room noise and voices from reception can be heard through vents in room , On arrival large desk and chairs occupied the room taking up all the space This was removed and sofa provided on second day but felt this should have been ready prior to arrival booked the room in February on promise of tea and coffee making facilities to be provided This was removed on first day told new management had taken over and removed all kettles and provided with expresso machine at a cost for renewal of coffee pods No cups provided had to go out and buy coffee and tea at extra cost Feel that new management rules and change of website information should have been mentioned to us prior to us arriving 
382671,Hotel Rekord, For some reason the A C was not working though I anticipated a lack of A C being in Europe We tried a couple of times to get it turned on but it was late and the room was already cool so we just rolled with it , Located in a quiet neighborhood the Hotel Rekord was a great place to stay It was about a 20 minute walk to the area restaurants and bars The accommodations were great with a spacious room and plenty of comfortable amenities 
382672,Hotel Rekord, There is not much natural light Considering the architecture of the building I am not sure they can do much about it , This review revolves mainly around an event that took place in one of the days when I was having breakfast at Hotel Rekord in Barcelona To be short and concise there was just one Nutella jar available at breakfast which means that basically people who wanted any had to pass it from one another Not very convenient and the management might want to consider an alternative such as smaller Nutella packs In any case when I wanted Nutella there was no more So I asked the lady waiter I believe her name was Lupe for some Initially she told me that she can t help and that there will be more tomorrow but I politely insisted and she got me a new jar I was so satisfied I literally think she asked one of her colleagues to go out and buy another one She even taught me some words in Spanish the next days I also wanted to pay for my hotel in advance and there was no issue obtaining the proforma invoice to wire them the money even though I was supposed to pay upon my arrival 
382673,Hotel Rekord, The room got quite cold on our 3rd night and we couldn t work the air con , Staff are very friendly and helpful Good location right next to a train station You can be in the city centre in 7 mins from the station so its a great location 
382674,Hotel Rekord,No Negative, The room was perfect Big enough with separate rooms Living room bedroom and toilet Very clean and comfortable The metro station is just two steps from the hotel and going to plaza catalunya in less than ten minutes There is also a mini market just near the corner everything was good value for money 
382675,Hotel Rekord, a lot of internal noise You hear your neighbours Their talks Their shower or toilet at arival the lady at the reception said that we don t have breakfast true We ordered room without breakfast At the day we left hotel 7 days later the man at the reception said that as genius on booking com we were supposed to have breakfast all these days , Location Close to subway station A few minutes from the centre No any noise from outside 
382676,Hotel Rekord,No Negative, Staff very friendly and helpful all time Excellent service Metro station just 2min from hotel Breakfast very good selection for everyone Very big room with comfortable beds 
382677,Hotel Rekord, I ve stayed in this hotel many times over the years but not for 4 5 years Really disappointed this time Dislikes Missing hotel room equipment including kettle tv remote pen paper etc According to the hotel staff all apparently all taken by previous guests Unfortunately none of the items was replaced by staff prior to my check in Thank goodness the previous guests decided to leave the bed behind Also annoying was that some facilities advertised on website were no longer provided by the hotel such as free tea coffee biscuits in lounge at certain times for meetings and socialising etc , Modern and clean 
382678,Hotel Rekord, We stayed in a room on the ground floor so I asked if we can get moved to a room in higher floor Firstly there were not any available but later on they said this will be chargeable , Staff were brilliant every single one of them The room was nice 
382679,Hotel Rekord,No Negative, The rating says it all Staff very friendly and helpful Breakfast was more than enough and delicious Free coffee in the early evening what a bonus for a budget traveller 
382680,Hotel Rekord, The only problem was that the heating system wasn t working during our stay It was probably something temporary But they gave us extra blankets , good wifi very close to a metro station more bathroom supplies than I ve seen in other hotels including a toothbrush kit It s a small detail but sometimes it matters 
382681,Hotel Rekord, The hotel doesn t have a restaurant and there isn t a great deal of choice around the hotel The breakfast is rather basic , Nice sized comfortable room and there was even an exercise bike in the room The staff were really helpful going out in the rain to wave down a taxi for me 
382682,Hotel Rekord, Very very small hotel with a very limited items in breakfast and noisy room from outside the hotel, The location was good and the room was very large and the room facilities were compelete
382683,Hotel Rekord, Nothing, Lovely hotel in a great location close to bars and restaurants and within walking distance from a bus tour stop Staff couldn t be any more helpful

382692,Hotel Rekord, nothing, Staff very good and helpful room good size area good for travel and bars and restaurant s breakfast ok all over very good will book again when in Barcelona
382693,Hotel Rekord, The room was dark and dismal and there was mould on the ceilings which we were told was our fault as there were 3 of us using the shower The locaton is very suburban and you do feel like a fish out of water in the area I felt it was very obvious we were tourists encroaching on local territory I think the hotel would be fine for a business trip more than leisure , The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful The food was basic but more than enough to provide you with enough energy for the day ahead The bathrooms were equipped with everything you might need for a couple of days away from razors sponges and deoderant
