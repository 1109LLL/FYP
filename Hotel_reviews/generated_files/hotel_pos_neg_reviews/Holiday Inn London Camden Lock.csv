138902,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, Bed too small as my wife and I are large people room rate too expensive for quality of room My wife and I didn t have a good night sleep on either night if we would have known size of bed we would have booked elsewhere We couldn t really go to the reception staff please move us we are too FAT The hotel offers a great location for others wanting to be in the hub of Camden It does offer good facilities which we didn t use My opinion was only blighted due to the size of the bed which was inappropriate for us , Location to Camden market
138903,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, The breakfast was quite stale and the staff in the restaurant asked me 4 times when I was going to pay for my breakfast , Incredibly friendly and helpful reception staff and a clean room with a fabulous view

138907,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, There wasn t anything we didn t like about the hotel , The hotel was in a great position for Camden Market which we went round before we came home Good base for us to get to Wembley for the Saturday evening Easy walk from St Pancras Station

138910,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, 1 On returning to the hotel just after midnight we tried to order food and drinks from the 24 hour room service menu After 3 tries each time being informed that the items we had selected were no longer available or could be ordered in with an hour s wait time we demanded to know exactly what was available and found the choice was limited to 2 each of 3 different sandwich fillings As we were very hungry we reluctantly ordered from this selection The management subsequently removed the food charge from our bill not the drinks charge but did not seem to take on board the point that the hotel could not fulfil its room service menu 2 We arrived at the hotel at 7 30 pm already late for an event we had bought expensive tickets for having suffered travel delays Nonetheless the check in process was lengthy largely because the reception staff wanted to be sure that we clearly understood that for any subsequent booking we should contact the hotel directly rather than using booking com as we would be offered a discount ,No Positive
138911,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, Location is good but if you are over looking the canal which is a good view it can be very noisey at night and into the early hours Fridge in room would be good although there was an ice machine on the floor Light pollution from items in room and gap in front door , Good Location nice sized room Bed pretty comfy good pillows
138912,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, Staff did not explain that 40 00 would be taken as well as room charge in case we used bar Breakfast chaotic with no one to tell us if we should just grab a table or wait to be seated Confusing layout of breakfast food,No Positive

138917,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, The room had no view looked out to brick wall of next building although this did mean that the room was really quiet and we were not disturbed by any late night revelry, Excellent location for Camden shops nightlife and Roundhouse Close to public transport Staff friendly and helpful 
138918,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, Bathroom was very small Breakfast was not the best quality not much choice of cold items and hot food bland especially the scrambled egg which had zero taste Also the hotel knew it was our 26th wedding anniversary but were unwilling to let us have complimentary water in our room on the second day stating it was only complimentary on the first day A slightly disappointing reaction considering it was a special occasion I feel this is a fairly basic hotel at a not very basic price We ve stayed at the Russel hotel in a junior suite for the same price no comparison , The bed was comfy location was good staff were efficient and friendly

138921,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, Booked for 2 queen beds but was told upon arrival that only one was available and that it was a Booking com problem Booking and HI mess up to the detriment of the guests Booking makes it appear 2 beds are confirmed but HI views it as a statement of preference A cot was installed but poor substitute to real bed Also amenities are less than the usual HI No slippers no ref , Good location Comfy bed pillows

138927,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, The rooms and beds are relatively small for 4 guests Basic amenities in the room The TV stopped working one day but was rapidly fixed while we were away I know it s London but the value for money is really mediocre on peak days would go back in this hotel if I can have a better deal , Located in a great location 2 minutes to Camden market Camden Town underground station and several bus stops The room was ok and clean with comfortable beds bathroom was correct in amenities and size The breakfast was great lots of tasty food with cooked breakfast and fresh juice and fruits The staff was very efficient and helpful Overall a pleasant stay

138929,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, I requested for a one double bed and 2 single beds in a room but upon seing our room there were 2 double beds only Went down to the reception and ask for the room that i requested but the guy in the reception said they dont have that kind of room He asked me if i booked with you guys in booking com I dont know what he meant but for 2 nights that i was in that room i was not happy I requested a front city view but that was not granted either There was no complementary bottled water in the room , Staffs were helpful 
138930,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, Room had a view of a brick wall Not much of an issue as we were Only there for one night and perhaps reflected in the price Maybe check if you want a view over the lock, Great location Just off the high street at the back of Camden lock

138949,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock,No Negative, Great location by Camden Lock Seems to try harder that your average Holiday Inn probably because it s a trendy area with plenty of eateries and dining spots nearby so the public areas are actually very nice almost slightly funky in Holiday Inn green Room very comfortable and had all I needed

139069,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, Room was nice size but overlooked a flat roof and the side of a building Shame as the location was good and a view of the lock would have been nice Hotel had signs that said they had free wifi throughout the hotel but I wasnt able to log on in the room and the website seemed to suggest you had to pay for it if you wanted it to work in your rooms Breakfast was included in the room price which is good as if I d paid the 13 separately I would have demanded a refund We went down with over 30 mins left on the set time When asked if I wanted tea or coffee I asked for decaf coffee I was bought a pot of tea I took it back and asked again for decaf and the young man didn t seem to grasp I was asking for coffee He eventually went off and came back with a pot of green tea saying this was all they had I cut my losses and said I would manage without There was hardly any pastries left and they didn t get topped up at all The cooked selection was ok the only issue was the hash browns didn t seem to be cooked properly Very disappointed and was hoping for better so took the edge of the stay a little , Room was clean and a good size as we had a room with 2 double beds Location was really good for our trip We had a gig at the barfly which is just up the road and the hotel was next to the famous market area so we were able to do that during the afternoon 
139070,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, While location was good its actual positioning left a little to be desired Canal bank on one side but grubby back street on the other and unfortunately our window faced out towards the latter Not very pleasant and we kept our curtains firmly closed Staff on check in and check out seemed distracted by other things and did not give us their full attention we did not feel particularly welcomed They also failed to mention that my card would be charged a standard amount of 190 in advance of any additional expenses and then refunded what we didn t spend This was NOT the amount I authorised when I entered my pin and I got a bit of a shock when I checked my bank statement a day later It was only when I phoned up to dispute this that it was explained to me Overall and I appreciated it s London prices I would say that this hotel is very overpriced from the room rate to the bar it was well over what I would expect to pay for an economy hotel chain We chose it for the location with the hope of a canal side view but it was hardly worth it would not book again , Location good just opposite Camden markets and central to Camden town Room was clean and had all the facilities you could want ironing board tea and coffee provisions complimentary toiletries 
139071,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, each morning it took 10 mins to get any hot water in shower No hot water on last morning of stay Some level of noise but expected this , Super location Great comfy bed Fantastic breakfast lots of choice good quality produce and very tasty 
139072,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, The room said it had wifi but it was unsuccessful The hotel charged me twice along with a 50 holding fee This wasn t resolved until a week after my stay and the reception staff were extremely unhelpful and rude I had to get confirmation from my bank twice to clarify this is where the missing money had gone as Holiday Inn reception denied their error at first It is a shame as if it wasn t for this mishap and the way it was handled i would have returned to this hotel , The location was perfect and the breakfast was worth the extra money

139079,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, The breakfast was good except some of the breakfast items weren t warm hash browns mushrooms sausage The room was too hot I looked for just a sheet in the night instead of the thick duvet There wasn t any other linen to use instead I didn t get a bottle of water which I would have loved as the tap water had a funny taste then the next day I saw the housemaid had some on her trolley so that must have been overlooked when my room was prepared , Very clean modern hotel Good facilities Best of all though is the location right next to Camden Lock and a 5 minute walk to the underground station Very pleasant staff 
139080,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, The bed was not comfortable at all Guy in reception gave us our room key and when we went up I opened the door to find it was already being used Need to be very careful with this as I could of had my 12 year old daughter with me who would of wanted to open the door and found a half naked man in there The reception guy seemed very embarrassed by this and was apologetic however it should not of happened , Nice size room and the breakfast was quite hot Went to the Burlesque show so the location of this hotel was great Market was just behind us so a very short stroll across the bridge and your there Restaurants and pubs nearby too

139088,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, Stayed in hotel 4 times in last 12 months longest stay 5 days with my wife as its convenient and its comfortable and the only minor complaint is pretty much you get ignored after you have checked in initially when you are coming going in reception with no eye contact smiles or hellos ever from staff on desk Possibly the ground floor is used by many non residents caf meeting place and that s a distraction but its really a stark contrast to when your booking in its as if no your here who cares It does leave you feeling disappointed A lot of staff do adopt a head down approach task over service generally and its the reception desk chatting to each other rather than acknowledging the customer by saying hello when you come in and even the bar team sometimes struggling to smile that lets the place down that s why I don t dine there or use the bar and go out more than I sometimes would i d sum it up in a word impersonal at times bit like a tube station , Location room standards great breakfast room service great help checking in friendly courteous and shower bath room always well provided for with basic toiletries and towels immaculate Great tv channels to watch as well Room service is pretty prompt and the guys who attend are always really polite and friendly 
139089,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, I had a room with a view for the river and everything was ok but the noise from pub next to hotel was horrible it was friday I don t know how it is in other days but luckilly they stopped playing music at 1 or 2 o clock ,No Positive

139092,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, The tea coffee facilities in room lacked so much as a little biscuit The room faced an inner courtyard with no outlook whatsoever I wonder if because it is booked through booking com they give you the less well positioned rooms as you are paying less than their rates , The beds were very comfortable and clean 
139093,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, 1 or 2 of the receptionists could have been a bit more polite , Breakfast was really good with plenty of choice and the beds were great our family all had a great night s rest

139113,Holiday Inn London Camden Lock, This was booked as business trip for a colleague using a company credit card and booked through the booking com website As far as i was aware everything was paid for as you took all the payment details during the booking as I wanted to pay for it The person staying then told me the room was not paid for as he arrived which is VERY embarrassing and he had to use his card to secure the room Then on Saturday morning I receive an email NOT even a phone call to advise me that i had to complete a spreadsheet and send photos of the card used for the booking otherwise the person staying would be charged to their card I was at home and the card was at the office so i didn t have access to it I then had to send photographs of my own card to the reception at Holiday Inn and pay for it personally suffering credit card charges because of this absolutely outrageous situation AS you can imagine in this day and age having to send images of my credit card to someone was not exactly ideal as i have no idea who the hell these people were I have had to call reception of the hotel and get told this is some new policy I will categorically be not using Holiday Inn EVER again and have no idea what on earth bookings com think they are playing at ,No Positive
