385873,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The reception area is not particularly inviting in fact rather shabby It could do with a make over The hotel is on a main thoroughfare so ask for a back room , The breakfast was satisfying Scrambled eggs seem to be common to most hotel breakfasts Continental options are always available and are good with lots of quality coffee 
385874,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Elevator to slow, Excellent hotel good value for money location can t be better breakfast is 10 the numbered steak was very good mine was number 5 812 391 and the icewatertank in the lobby is a brilliant idea Friendly and professional staff overall highly recommended hotel 
385875,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Bathroom design and overall lighting can be improved , The room was very comfortable great air conditioning The hotel is in great location especially for shopping and site seeing 
385876,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, excellent location and exceptionally helpful and friendly staff 3pm checkout available at an additional cost of 10euro per hour after 12 midday great for a later flight 
385877,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, Good location good facilities special interior style very nice staff Like the restaurant especially like the bar tasted the numbered steak Great experience to stay 
385878,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Corridors are a bit dark and could do with a coat of paint Carpets also need deep cleaned but these points didn t detract from the positives , The location was fantastic and could not be bettered for our needs The bed was extremely large and comfortable and the fridge actually kept your drinks cold unlike many other hotel fridges We received a very welcome free upgrade to an executive suite which was a nice touch I would definitely stay here again 
385879,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Catering in dining not good hamburgers were not cooked to requested medium half raw Bedroom door difficult to turn handle from inside , Convenience of position old world atmosphere size of room great bathroom
385880,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, The staff are genuinely friendly not the professional smile but genuinely interested in you very friendly The room is clean and has all the facilities that you would expect It is in a wonderful location just behind the Dam square with a tram stop outside the door You get a voucher for a complimentary drink in the hotel bar which is a proper beer pub as opposed to a sterile hotel bar 
385881,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, A C did not work well so room was too warm for comfortable sleeping Staff did look at it for us and tried to get it working better to no avail, Concierge was extremely attentive and helpful
385882,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The air conditioner leaked the first evening as well as the drain in the shower was slow to drain We put in a maintenance order online for these to be fixed The drain was repaired and it seemed the air conditioner was fixed as well Unfortunately the second night the air conditioner began to leak again We were kept awake both evenings of our stay We were given a 10 discount but felt we should have received more given we did not sleep well Also the room was extremely small It was difficult for two people to move about the room There are less expensive hotels nearby with better amenities , The staff were friendly
385883,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The room was very very small but then I guess you can pay extra and get a bigger one ours was the cheapest on booking com I think But Amsterdam accommodation is not cheap , Location is fantastic and staff very very helpful 
385884,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, Everything about the hotel was great very clean and well looked after Hotel bar restuarant staff were very helpful and polite Great location also 
385885,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The room was very small with no view out either window and the bed was very uncomfortable with a definite dip in the middle We both had sore backs after the forst nights sleep which only got worse over the next couple of nights In additiiin the door was pretty much at the end of the bed and opened outwards on to the hallway therfore every time the door opened other guests can get a good view of you in or sitting on the bed Ithink we were just disappointed because the room was nothing like any of the pictures on the website and the very clever photo of the hotel front is just as deceptive , Great location the staff were very helpful and the room was very clean This hotel was ideal as a base to go and explore the city as it was central and trams stopped outside the hotel It had a nice restaurant and bar We didn t visit them but they looked lovely 
385886,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, Staff were so friendly and happy just that alone i will be back i have been coming to Amsterdam one or two times per year for the last 20y The staff you have here is the best i have encountered well done I will be back 
385887,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Guests are paying for the location which is excellent The room itself was clean and tidy but very small with little room for clothes and luggage The room seemed designed for a weekend stay and if that is your goal then it will be fine , The hotel is in central Amsterdam moments from the man square 
385888,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Very very bad sound proof so bad I thought my own door was being opened every time my neighbours were opening their doors and you can hear their footsteps very clearly The hotel is very old and has this damp smell from age Toiletries are very simple It s not a horrible hotel but for what it s charging it s far from value for money 3 star at most , Very good location just a stone s throw from the Royal Palace and 10 min walk from Central Station There s a grocery store 5 min away which is a bonus as well 
385889,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, None, Located in the oldest part of Amsterdam About 5 minutes walk to the central station A tram station is right outside the gate It s a very beautiful hotel Equipments are aged but functional Friendly stuff and nice breakfast the lady from the reception desk introduce me the city when I checked in 
385890,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The room they gave me was not upto my expectation I have to take the lift to the 1st floor walk along the corridor of the rooms till the end and take a narrow stairs down to my room, Location
385891,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Basic double room was a bit of a squeeze We just managed to get into either side of the bed We asked for a quiet room so had no outlook but that didn t bother us as we were out and about most of the time , Old fashioned comfort and charm Staff friendly and helpful Great breakfast 
385892,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, This was by far the best stay on a very busy season booking com find me the best rate which i enjoy during my stay Property is wonderful stay was perfect well take care by the staff 
385893,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The two things I didn t like were 1 Using Booking com usually allows one to cancel a reservation I didn t want to or need to cancel but it was alarming to discover that this wouldn t have been possible if I had needed to Every other place I ve stayed from booking com has allowed a cancellation so this is an unwelcome and very stringent policy on your part 2 Also I know Amsterdam is expensive but this was still a really expensive stay and most of the people I know even frequent travelers to Europe would never consider staying at such an expensive place The price absolutely should have included breakfast I would object to the price much less if it did ,No Positive
385894,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Not enough lighting fixtures in the room dark The restaurant is expensive Long waiting times for hotel elevators , The hotel s location is excellent a minute s walk from the Dam center Room includes a kettle tea and sugar The shower has all the products required for the shower The rooms are very clean The hotel has a restaurant and a bar that serves very tasty coffee and food but not cheap Staff are very helpful and the service is excellent The hotel desk works 24 7 
385895,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Room amenities could have been better to justify price , Location was excellent Staff were very friendly and helpful However the amenities and room d cor did not justify price tag One has to take into account that this is a major city with the ability to charge prices that demand dictates We will visit Amsterdam again since it is an entertaining city but will choose July August to hopefully enjoy warmer weather 
385896,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The price The room it was down 2 narrow flights of stairs basically it was a fire exit There were 2 air conditioning units one of which we couldn t switch off which made sleeping very difficult, Very handy for central Amsterdam Staff were extremely helpful for example we were checking out and left our bags for a few hours and we were offered an umbrella to borrow because if had been raining 
385897,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Would have liked a nespresso machine in the room we had one everywhere else in Netherlands, Ideally located walking distance to everywhere we had room 222 which had a balcony overlooking the palace and church fab 
385898,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Breakfast was until 10 30 I went there 10 20 they told me I have only 10 minutes to eat I didnt understand why becouse after they didnt closed the restaurant The waitress was super nice but for me this rule very strict I understand if I would arrived after at 10 30 they would told me Sorry we closed But for me better to be and quest friendly if they would say me just sit down and enjoy your breakfast , Location in the city center best location with many option The Kitchen Restaurant was really nice with very good quality food 
385899,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The room was very small and claustrophobic drab bare painted walls sloping ceiling and had to bend to get up side of bed Four steps in the room down to bed small low level window and dimly lit room Trace internet occasionally My wife has arthritis in her knees and these steps would be difficult The price quoted at 715 was exceeded and city tax was added which was a surprise This should be stated in your advert and certainly not when in hotel reception , The location was perfect staff were great and so helpful 
385900,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Nothing I was pleasantly surprised with the stay I guess I could say the only thing I regret is not having stayed longer This will definitely be a hotel to come back to , Upon arrival we were upgraded to a larger room and it was wonderful huge with an an amazing bathroom Our room was located in a small wing of the building so it felt very private we had an amazing view of the street and nightlife The location couldn t have been better Super close to everything we just walked to central station The hotel was undergoing renovations downstairs but the staff ensured our accommodation was top notch The room was super comfortable and flawlessly clean The bathroom had a huge tub it was the size of a hotel room by itself 
385901,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Room very small particularly for a de luxe booking which we paid extra for I wouldn t like to see what a normal double twin room is like Bathroom reasonable though but could do with more shelf space hooks Rather economical with the supply of coffee and creamers though there was a fridge so we bought some proper milk Quite inconvenient to have to pay for all our trips in cash , Very pleasant hotel with pleasant helpful and well informed staff Room nice and quiet despite the King s Birthday celebrations outside we didn t get disturbed by it at all and bed very comfy Nice to have a safe in the room and one that was easy to program and didn t cost extra Bar cosy with nice ambiance We didn t use the restaurant but that looked quite nice too 
385902,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Nothing to dislike The longer you stay the more you are charmed by the history of the building , The staff at this hotel were the best I ve come across during my extensive touring of Europe The location of this hotel is fab just meters from Dam Square Everything is on your doorstep to walk to or you can hop on one of the trams buses right at the hotel entrance if needed You can walk from the central train station just be mindful that many streets are cobbled which makes dragging a suitcase a bit tricky at times The hotel building dates back to the 1500 s is the birthplace of Heineken so don t expect ultra modern as many of the original decor features have been kept A room at the front of the hotel with street view is worthwhile but be advised the street lighting shines into the room at night 
385903,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Room was tiny and there were extra taxes we were charged outside of what booking com charges This was unexpected and increased the price per night even more I would have expected more for the price , People were very friendly and the hotel was in a great location 
385904,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Nothing We were very happy with our hotel choice , Friendly helpful staff Excellent breakfast to start the day Excellent location with good public transport to the main sights of Amsterdam Pleasant quiet bar to relax at end of day s sightseeing 
385905,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The rooms aren t huge it was a bit tight with the desk and extra table and the beds to move around, The location is the best part about this hotel just off Dam square 
385906,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Temperature control was a little off and cold air was coming in from under the door but it didn t bug me much wifi died for like 5 minutes The only thing that bugged me was a bad smell that came from the bathroom a little bit like sewage I didn t spend much time in the room and it wasn t as noticable if you closed the door Again nothing really major to complain, Staff were super nice and helpful superb location comfy beds
385907,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Breakfast was quite pure for 4 stars Matrasse wass a little bit unkomfortable For that price expected more but in Amsterdam all prices are above avarage , lokation beats all the inconveniances Went everywhere by foot from that point easy to find it by whatching wheel near Dom 
385908,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Firstly to get a fair picture of the actual room Secondly if they will offer a crappy room that is not on the pictures price it appropriately , Horrible experience One of those that you feel stolen The pictures on the booking com website are totally misleading Hotel was extremely expensive around EUR 400 a night rooms are tiny and not new The door between the bed and bathroom would hinge badly every time we open closed The toiletries are suitable for a 1 2 star hotel maximum would never recommend this hotel for the price I was charged horrible experience 
385909,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Cramped room but manageable , Well located and reasonably modern facility Walking distance to main station and centrally located to town attractions Bed was comfortable and shower was great 
385910,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, There were some technical problems probably due to the fact of the building s age The staff dealt with it immediately , It s a location of the dreams Wherever you find yourself in the historical part of Amsterdam the hotel is within an easy reach The staff was wonderful kind and helful no exceptions The room was looking atthe quiet street so I didnt hear any of the hustle and bustle from Dam Square 
385911,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, Helpfulness and friendliness of all the staff Old world historic charm melded with modern comfort Central location and easy walking distance to city attractions and instant access to trams 
385912,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The restaurant menu in the hotel was pricey and limited selection , Our room was on the top floor room 601 It had a balcony and was newly refurbished The bathroom was lovely and the room was massive We were beyond satisfied Such a comfortable stay SO central everything is on your doorstep and the tram is right outside for further exploring We had the best nights sleep there 
385913,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, All was fine, Room had a nice amount of space for two people very good location a nice distance away from the centre to enjoy a good sleep Friendly staff Good stay
385914,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Food service menu could be better when kitchen is out of hours , Attentive and friendly staff who brought our room key to us while we were enjoying a lovely cold beer in the beautiful hotel bar Extra comfy beds so had a great sleep Fabulous location in Amsterdam for exploring Beautiful building and decor which was undergoing improvements at the time of our stay but did not interrupt our stay at all Will be definitely booking again when we return to Amsterdam 
385915,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The size of the room was quite small and I could hear the guest in the next room using the bathroom , The excellent location of the hotel staff were friendly helpful Room was comfortable without being ostentatious Despite the city centre location it wasn t noisy 
385916,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Better room service menu Only 4 or 5 items available after 12 , The best part about this hotel was the location The location is a bit touristy but centrally located so that you can walk to most attractions The hotel was clean and had a historic vibe to the outside We ended up staying at this location because the price was very similar to a lower star hotel The size of the room was much larger than the other hotels in the area The staff were helpful with directions and using the public transportation There was a nice bar in the building that we didn t use They also appeared to be doing renovations on a restaurant at the location 
385917,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, There is nothing to dislike about this place , Everything is just right Location value for money cleanliness staff room comfort everything It s a stroll away from the town centre where all the hustle and bustle is yet not right but n the middle of it where you don t wanna be Rooms are clean and quiet Staff is helpful and friendly Loved it 
385918,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Admittedly I did book through bookings com but sadly the hotel would not allow me to change my booking to a week later this cost me a lot of money ,No Positive
385919,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Nothing , This hotel is so central the staff are so helpful they really go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable The beds are the comfiest beds I have ever slept in The bathrooms were spotless and the shower is very powerful They are currently renovating the restaurant I think and during our stay we never heard one loud noise we barley saw the workers which was great you would never know that is being renovated 
385920,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, we did not have breakfast as considered it to be expensive and coffee and croissant shop just outside Hotel being updated so no comfortable lounge area to relax , Very central opposite Daam Sqare and tram stop just outside so very easy to reach other areas Staff were very helpful and pleasant Room on the small side but comfortable 
385921,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Price is a little expensive for what you get Have stayed in bigger rooms in other city centres for less with breakfast included But if you want to be close to dam square and have friendly staff with a comfy bed then it is a good place to stay , The hotel was nice easily accessible and close to the Dam and other attractions The room has all the basics all be it a little on the small size but it s adequate Staff were very friendly and helpful I would stay here again purely for the location 
385922,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Wifi in room very slow, Staff professional and helpful with a good manner Delicious breakfast bar facilities great Bed very comfortable Unbeatable location in the heart of Amsterdam with only a short walk to the old town and railway station
385923,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Slow lift Hotel feels a bit old Asked for late checkout which was not allowed and was charged 10 Euros per hour Breakfast did not look great , Great location 2 mins form Dam Square You only have to cross a street and 10 min walk from Central Station Tram station at door step A small Mall next door WiFi was good 
385924,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, WE HAD SUCH POOR SLEEP The room was small with far too much furniture making it feel ever so cramped The Mattress topper moved about and the bed creaked terribly and also gave me and my wife backache it woke us nearly every time we turned over Poor natural daylight in the room due to facing a wall courtyard and other hotel room windows which gave no privacy when the curtains were open We were woken up on both mornings of our stay by people going up and down the wooden stairs that backed onto our room 130 There was no milk in the room just coffee whitener yet there was a small fridge Water ran down the shower frame onto the floor by the toilet every time a shower was taken The restaurant was under renovation so building work started from 10 am I repeat WE HAD SUCH POOR SLEEP , The location is very good but there other better hotels in good places too The beer served in the bar was good and the staff there were very attentive 
385925,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Rooms were quite small but adequate Wasn t keen on sliding bathroom door not very discreet , Central location was great bed was really comfy and the complimentary drink in the bar was a nice touch 
385926,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, You could hear lots of noise in the room People walking past the doors opening and closing their doors also the noise from outdoors and even a man having a sneezing fit next door haha Nothing major just thought I should mention it , Lovely staff nothing too much trouble Excellent location
385927,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, We got very small room not the same like we see when we booking room For 3 days was not add any liquid to wash and shampoo Stay max one night , Very good location friendly staff
385928,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Cleaning staff knocking on my door THREE times BEFORE official check out time But they were very nice , Awesome location right in the very center of the city Staff at the reception desk very helpful
385929,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The breakfast wasn t that great for the price charged 19 euros per person was a bit too much , Very clean and comfortable room Great spacious bathroom 
385930,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Check out staff were not very friendly Didn t ask us if we d enjoyed our stay Bar staff very friendly and helpful Didn t eat in hotel so can t comment on food ,No Positive
385931,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Ok for starters the pictures and review made us believe this hotel was a lot nicer that it actually was from the moment we got in we realised it is an aged hotel very small lobby with two very slow lifts that brought us up too A lovely room with twin beds as apposed too a double bed The biggest problem we had was how terrible the beds actually were Extremely uncomfortable I would not go back , The staff were really friendly and the location was pretty close to dam square local coffee shops were also fairly good 
385932,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The room we had was down 10 12 very narrow steep stairs Although our cases were brought to the room when we arrived we had to bring them back up on departure I am glad we only had small bags We would have struggled getting larger cases up the staircase No good for any larger people either The room was small and cramped and if was difficult to move round the beds as the space was that limited The mini fridge was warm so we couldn t use that The bathroom was much colder than the fridge and there was no heating in there The toiletries weren t great It would be nicer having seperate shower gel to shampoo etc Power shower was excellent though , The location is great 10 minutes walk from the station and tram stop just across from the front of the hotel All the staff were friendly and helpful There is a nice cosy bar within the hotel for evenings 
385933,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Upon arrival the staff were very ignorant as I m young I felt like they didn t want me there which is not acceptable as I m paying as much as any customer , The bed it s self was so comfortable it was amazing our view from our window was lovely great location walking distance from everything
385934,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Hotel is very dated inside Guests are made to sign a form upon arrival to say they will not smoke however there are outdoor stairways within the hotel where people smoke meaning the smell travels into rooms Whilst exiting our room one morning and walking up the outdoor spiral staircase from the ground floor we thought it was snowing in actual fact it was just fag ash from the person smoking on the next floor lovely Bathroom was very old grout yellow and unclean no fan so room smelt quite damp Definitely doesn t feel like a 4 hotel , Great location
385935,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The maids wake u up even with do not disturb sign on and I never slept once out of the 3 nights I stayed due to noise the staff couldn t wait get us out,No Positive
385936,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, We paid a lot but probably because it was a new year weekend so it was not a surprise but it hurts Additionally the hair dryer was not so efficient at least in our room , Localization was excellent 
385937,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Hotel is very old Bath is cold Windows is noisy street Wery expensive but not enough condition I dont have stay again Booking photos good but reel diffrent I and my wife didn t like this hotel ,No Positive
385938,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The service was substandard We had coffee in the cups one night the room was cleaned the next day but to our horror the same used coffee mugs were there Also the toiletries replenishment was not done post the cleaning The service was quite sad The front desk staff were sweet though The hotel is way too overpriced for the service provided we felt , The location was good and the facade of the hotel is awesome 
385939,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Kept awake all night by guests above us we complained and asked to move rooms but non available which is fair enough but a refund should of been given we were told oh well your in Amsterdam I think after 12 midnight and paying 180 for the night we should be entitled to a good sleep After using booking com for 6 years in 11 different countries I ve never had a problem , Not much except the location 
385940,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, We stayed in Hotel Die Port van Cleve for 4 days and it was a real pleasure The hotel is located near central station 10 minutes walk and right in the center of the city It s very convenient for those who want to have a brief stay and search the city The staff is very friendly and ready to help The room was very clean with all the necessary supplements Thanks I ll come again 
385941,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The wifi is a little poor depending upon the location of your room the toilet cleaning leaves a lot to be desired and the room maids do not comprehend the DO NOT DISTURB signs as they knock on the door and enter when the sign clearly says DO NOT DISTURB, Great location staff are friendly and helpful
385942,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The twin beds when you re a couple , Super location easy walk from Central station or just pick trams 1 2 or 5 Beautiful old architecture building Nice looking bar and restaurant on site albeit that I did not have time to use them 
385943,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Room was pleasant enough but the bed was really too large for the room it was difficult to move between the sides of the bed and the wall Furthermore there were two simple chairs meant for working at the desk or I suppose watching television They must be amongst the least comfortable chairs I ve ever had to sit on Had I been staying longer I would have asked the front desk to find me something more suitable and I m sure they would have I was annoyed that breakfast in the hotel cost 20 I didn t take it for this reason that s simply far more than I pay for breakfast , Perfect location to get around Amsterdam and a full service hotel Staff were welcoming and helpful When the check in clerk saw me the next day he remembered my name Be aware that I was particularly lucky that the dates I was in Amsterdam were not very busy and had a very reasonable rate The price of this hotel is normally well above the ceiling that I fix for myself 
385944,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, At 12 00 a reception guy came to indicate not gently that is time to do the checkout when we were almost ready with our luggages on the door This inpolite reception man showed to me his watch as I was a little boy 4 star hotel with this kind of behavior is non allowed Anything else was great but only for this reason I would not stay there next time, great location great bed
385945,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Likely an isolated incident but the shower head would not aim straight and kept spraying all over the place The water would also not drain very well in the shower , Great location Parking garage just down the street with 1 2 price overnight validation Very friendly staff 
385946,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, We didn t like our view as our window was situated at the back looking at other Windows We didn t like how me and my wife had single beds and the beds separated if we laid in the middle when i requested a double We didn t like the room as it was completely different to the room picked when I booked the hotel We was very disappointed in our stay , I like how quiet the rooms where 
385947,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Hotel has not given to choose which kind of room view So your room probably would be have back side view Even our room was dark and had hotel inside view , Location was perfect Room was clean
385948,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, A receptionist was too rude I found an empty bottle of coke under the bed the breakfast is overpriced 22 , The hotel is near Dam square a perfect starting point for a visit to Amsterdam
385949,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, It could have been more clean first when we arrived it smelled really bad Also I couldn t sleep well because people on the hallways and other rooms upstairs were too loud , The location was fantastic Also the view was really nice 
385950,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, Old style Dutch hotel I enjoyed the stay Decently quiet at night even if room was on tram and street side 4th floor Room was on two levels and cozy I would go back here really great location 
385951,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The rooms were fine but fairly ordinary for the price we paid which we can only surmise was due to the good location, The beds were really comfortable
385952,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, A lot of hair in the bathroom particularly on the walls The beds very uncomfortable The room is very noisy since you can hear every steps and movement from the room above yours due to the thin wooden floor , Very nice building Pretty rooms 
385953,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, We paid for a superior room and a standard room but they gave us two standard rooms and when we challenged this they lied and told us we had been upgraded We paid 50 euros extra for the superior room but didn t get one Leaves a bitter taste and because of this I would warn people against booking this hotel , Central location good rooms and good breakfast 
385954,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Although the welcome was ok the check out was not that pleasant Impatience when I asked to clarify a few things on my invoice and the receptionist started taking another person before finishing with my paper work Food at the restaurant was standard , Location Voucher for a free drink when checked in The room upgrade with a renovated bathroom nice and comfortable The door men were very helpful and friendly 
385955,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Old building noisy because the tram station is underneath and the curtains allow the sun to get in the room which is really annoying finally expensive, Comfortable beds and great location in the mid of everything
385956,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Normal rooms are old and cramped Common areas look old and beaten all walls and furniture needing refurbishment Walls are super thin and you can hear the noise coming from mostly everywhere and I am not even a light sleeper I heard the noise of people talking in plain voice two bedrooms away from mine so if you are a light sleeper this is hell Reception area is just plain unwelcoming like nonexistent It is hard to read this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel I would give it max a 3 Star in a great location I simply do not understand how with such a great location 100 occupancy and charging such high rates there is simply no investment in making this a cosier nicer looking and more comfortable hotel to guest there is even a door signage that says needs repairing for you to hang on your wall need I say more Plus the night shift staff member who talked to me on the day I could not sleep because of the noise was not very welcoming , Location the staff that helped me after I had a problem with my room on the next day in the morning and saved the rest of my experience Their superior room are way better and more comfortable Their restaurant is also a nice one 
385957,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, The staff was so friend y and helpful They held our suitcases even after we checked out so we could do a little more sightseeing We even purchased our museum tickets here Great
385958,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, The food at the restaurant was fabulous The staff were really so fun and genuinely seemed happy we were there The location was perfect for maneuvering around the city easily 
385959,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Hot breakfasts were a little too cool for my liking Serving plates were cold I regard this as a relatively minor point in an otherwise exceptional experience Dinners were superb , Hotel was not full when we stayed there and we arrived to find we were upgraded to an executive room a great surprise since it was my wife s birthday and our wedding anniversary All of the staff from the manager to the domestics were outwardly friendly and helpful The standard of cleanliness exceeded that of a few 5 star hotels I ve used in the UK I don t think we could have a picked a more conveniently located hotel for our first visit to Amsterdam 
385960,Hotel Die Port van Cleve,No Negative, The location was perfect and easy to find The staff were super knowledgeable and helpful especially when it came to finding a tourist doctor The bar next to the lobby was excellent as well 
385961,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Room 412 was very smelly but staff came to the room immediately move us to another room which was very nice staffs response was fist class Breakfast area crowded Bar was being refurbished so could not use, Good all round Hotel Staff first class in all areas Great location 
385962,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Bathroom a little cramped and I would prefer toilet in separate cubicle, Breakfast was extensive and tasty Location close to Dam Square but far enough away from seedier Red Light district
385963,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, 1 Shower was configured horribly It was uncomfortable and small and the water would leak into the floor Water pressure was also poor 2 Bathroom products were cheap They had the all in one shower gel shampoo and conditioner 3 No mini bar Actually there was one it was just empty dirty in side 4 Bed had a thin foam thing on top of the mattress which the sheets were tucked into This meant the sheets were never right and came out when you were sleeping It felt like bathing with your socks on 5 Curtain had Rips all the way through You didn t notice this until the morning when the light came through , Location
385964,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, cost for a family of 3 There was a mouse trap on one of the stairs and when I mentioned it the woman at the desk said they do not have mice but this is AMSTERDAM as if that is typical ,No Positive
385965,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The room although superior was only superior in size The other rooms seemed quite small It was at the back but was very noisy Bring ear plugs There was tea coffee making facilities in the room but no extras for a superior room The room wasn t very clean on arrival with bits of paper on the floor The bathroom floor and buttons for flushing the toilet were not cleaned once during our stay There are memory foam toppers on the bed which are tired with dips in the middle As these toppers make you feel hot I m not sure how hygienic they are I wouldn t rate the hotel as very clean The staff were disinterested and not very friendly I would say the hotel was over staffed Breakfast was not included and we had the city tax added on arrival so it worked out quite expensive for what we got The breakfast was fine but it isn t advertised that you can have alternatives like omelettes poached eggs etc We paid a reduced rate but it would be very expensive at full price otherwise We didn t eat in the restaurant but it was empty every night which speaks volumes The hotel is very central but I would not recommend this hotel , The central location although quite noisy 
385966,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Room a bit small for 2 single beds But its Amsterdam you never spend much time inside the Hotell room , Resturant offer one of the best beefs I have ever tasted in years Hotel have a very good location short way to main attractions Bathroom was good with good size bath tub

385970,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The room we had was a little bit on the small side for moving around the bed However it was on the back of the hotel which meant there was very little noise at night , The staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much bother for them They helped us with tickets for the museums and gave advice on trams etc Food was of an excellent quality and well presented both at breakfast and evening meal the restaurant staff were also very good The hotel was in a central location which was particularly helpful for us as my husband cannot walk far at the moment It was very clean and welcoming We would return 
385971,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, There was no rooftop swimming pool or garden but then you wouldn t expect that in our normal world So I would say that there nothing not to like , All the staff were very pleasant and helpful The bed was very comfortable and at 6 6 long that was a bonus Conveniently place close to the centre and railway perfect for access via Eurostar and all the typical points of in Teresa of Amsterdam We will certainly return there and would recommend it to everyone 
385972,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, The room was small The minibar was not cool Using the wooden wardrobe was difficult especially the real making facilities and the room floor around the wardrobe area made bad noise while walking on it suggestion changing the model size and place of the wardrobe All the time the sound of slamming the doors from the corridors and upstairs annoyed Surprisingly it was the first time that a hotel at check in time asked the guest to pay all the money for staying there complete settlement , The facade of the historic building of hotel was excellent The location if hotel was good Cleanness of room and the hospitality of staff were good Using the symbol of delft art in white and blue color in room as tables blanket box of savon was a very good idea 
385973,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Had to insist on moving rooms as room was dirty e g mould on walls and shower curtain the final room was just about acceptable but did not deserve a 4 star rating and was very overpriced There was no water in the room no mini bar only plastic cups very cheap toilet paper as we paid 225 a night this is disgraceful We stay in Amsterdam on business every 2 years and book about 6 rooms We will not be using this hotel again , Nothing
385974,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, It was just a little basic for a superior room in a medium priced 4 hotel Draughty windows and lots of street noise Luckily we were so tired from walking around the city we fell to sleep easily 2 single beds kept separating Why not just furnish with a double Wifi died one evening for the entire evening , Location was Perfect It was 5 20 minutes walk to reach most places we wanted to go The staff were friendly to approach and all transactions were smooth Nice view of the new Church from our room Free Wifi was decent speed with 5G network available

385988,Hotel Die Port van Cleve, Firstly the check in process was a hassle impolitely they have accused me for not having my card I paid with and said I must have it and if not I might be kicked out of the hotel even though I paid I promised them to get a copy of it by morning time Rude act 2 was that after I have entered my room exhausted of my 14 hours flight I hear a knock on the door I immediately open and I see the hotel people that claim that the room I have entered is not the correct one and I was moved around like rubbish wandering at 11pm bed time The worst part is ahead In the morning I had to catch a flight and I ordered a hotel shuttle to take me to the airport 3 hours prior my flight at around 7am when my flight is at 10am and the drive to the airport takes 30 minutes the receptionist let me know that there is a thing called CITY TAX I did not have a problem to pay the 10 euros it costs but I did not have euros on me but only Australian dollars I was asking them for a solution or perhaps a close by exchange store for me to have some euros I was forced to go 30 minutes to the central train station by myself with a promise that this is the only exchange store that was open My only request was to delay the shuttle in 30 minutes thought 2 hours prior an international flight is also fine surprisingly not only that the store was closed and I just wasted 30 minutes I also missed the shuttle and they did not take care of that so I was still stuck in the hotel without my shuttle to the airport 2 hours before my flight At this point I started to show some anger It was sorted when they said I can give them 100 AUD and in exchange I will get the same value in EUROS I was angry because this could be done before and save me the 50 EUROS I had to pay for the taxi after I wastefully paid 20 EUROs for the hotel shuttle Just a horrible experience PLEASE do not do that to yourselves ,No Positive
