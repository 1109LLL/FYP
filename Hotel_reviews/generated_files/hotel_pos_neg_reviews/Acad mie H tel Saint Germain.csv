148778,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Not a good value for over 300 Euros a night Deluxe room 103 was too small wouldn t expect this in a real 4 star hotel Still manageable if we 2 adults with a 6 year old were allowed to sleep together on the one large bed But the hotel insisted to install in the room an extra bed for the modest 69 Euro per night We used it to put our suitcases on there was no other place left Also there was an unpleasant odor on the floor I d put this hotel more in the B B category I don t think as a whole it has the capacity for more , Good location of the hotel and light in the room bathroom High ceilings 
148779,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, The bar fridge in the room was not cold but it was a minor issue and we never bothered to tell anyone , Great location and very comfy bed Rooms are small but most rooms in Paris are Great value for money given the location
148780,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Would have been nice to have access to an iron to press some clothes but other than that nothing , Friendly staff helped out with everything including booking restaurant on first night taxis and airport transfers Really convenient location close to everything we wanted to see and do We booked again for the next time in Paris 
148781,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, We were charged twice for taking water from the room or from the breakfast area We never took any of the water I am not sure what was going on here The person cleaning the rooms should check the number of bottles in the refrigerator but I guess they saw a bottle of evian on our desk bought at a convenience store and decided to charge us The front desk removed the charges after asking us about it though so that was good Otherwise great location and good place to stay ,No Positive

148786,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, TINY room and I mean TINY Barely enough space to step down from the bed NO space at all to keep suitcases open One of the reception ladies was beyond lovely and the other was kind of rude When checking out she was barking questions at me whilst taking a call to someone else even though we were being served by the other receptionist , The location was well priced for this area Nicely styled hotel

148826,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, I didn t like the manner the manager from the lobby spoke to me when I informed her about dirty sheet She said It is just impossible I said that unfortunately it is possible and showed her the picture I made She said No it is just wet But it wasn t wet it was just dirty I don t like the idea when the manager doesn t believe me and I need to spend my time trying to prove that there is a mistake Finally she believed my words and apologized for this But I was dissatisfied as the whole dialog was unacceptable , The location of the hotel is great I liked the design of the hotel and its rooms 
148827,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Bedbugs contamination and failure to proceed to agreed refund Contamination punaises de lit et refus de proc der au remboursement promis Unfortunately I was bitten by bedbugs during my 2 night stay at Hotel Academie at the end of August 2016 I was able to prove it having found insects and cocoons in the bed in the morning The receptionist agreed to a full refund for my first night stay giving me a refund receipt and indicating that a bank transfer would be formalised when her manager gets back after my departure Hotel Academie recently sent me an email informing me that they refuse to implement the refund They argue that I have implicitly rejected this proposal when I agreed to stay at the Hotel though in another room which I had previously inspected and which did not appear to be contaminated for the second night of my pre paid reservation Not only was the room I slept in the first night infected Luxury room with spa but I am being denied a refund which was agreed to and put down in writing in exchange for the inconvenience This is very bad practice and service I therefore find it important to inform future customers J esp re sinc rement que les chambres contamin es seront trait es par des professionnels et que les autres clients affect s par la situation recevront un traitement juste et appropri dans les circonstances , Well located renovated
148828,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Clearer descriptions about breakfast options would have been good We thought we chose the continental breakfast only to find out the hot breakfast option was the only one that included the cheese and cold cuts of meat After choosing the cheese and cold meat we were charged the hot full breakfast although we didn t select any of the hot food Also our tea or coffee wasn t replenished through each day s cleaning With only 2 satchels each of the coffee and tea at the start of our stay these were not adequate for our 4 night stay , Boutique styled hotel It is close to Louvre restaurants and the hop on hop bus stop and easy to walk to the many nearby food outlets The rooms and storage space is very small the room suited our needs over our stay and were very clean

148841,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Honestly nothing I really would like to offer ideas for improvement but the hotel was perfect for us Our room was not large but we didn t expect it to be Room size was not important to us , The entire front desk staff was very warm and friendly They made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in after a long overnight flight and one of us hates to fly They really went out of their way to treat us well the entire stay The hotel itself was very clean and nicely decorated and the location could not have been better It s right in the heart of St Germaine but also on a quiet street We walked everywhere we wanted to go 
148842,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, We like everything about our stay , The Staff Extremely positive helpful interactive just delightful The hotel is in a perfect location to walk to Paris attractions and is situated near fantastic restaurants The hotel is exceptionally clean 
148843,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Man at reception on weekend made offensive accusations about my credit card and barked threateningly and delayed my departure unreasonably when the hotel s malfunctioning credit card scanner was to blame My card was immediately accepted when the number was entered manually His behavior was unacceptable Also the room s heat source is oddly located inside the closet It wasn t a significant issue in late spring other than potentially dangerously overheating a GoreTex jacket There was a small hole in the duvet cover Reception did not warn me when I arrived that the room safe had been removed for repair , Location is excellent Nicely renovated room was small but reasonably comfortable for one Most staff were friendly courteous and efficient 
148844,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, The very noisy spa baths self cleaning And the adjoining room could hear snoring sneezing tv and talking , The opulence and location and the helpfulness of the staff Very comfy beds 
148845,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Wish there was space to sit and read in the room Well designed but tight quarters , Location convenient to Musee dOrsay Notre Dame Batobus yet on quiet street Great bakery and excellent restaurant Le Perron just steps away Hotel was newly renovated and offered modern amenities Irene and Patrice at the front desk were welcoming and most helpful 
148846,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, The rooms are ridiculously small There is little space beside the bed The price is too high for the space provided , Great location very friendly staff
148847,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Noise travels between rooms where there are adjoining doors , This small recently modernised and charming little hotel is right in the heart of Paris only 50 metres from Boulevard St Germain Many of the main sights of the city can be easily walked to It is surrounded by good restaurants and the famous Cafe Deux Magots Cafe Flore and Cafe Procope are all within a 5 minute walk While the rooms are small they are well appointed and comfortable and all bathrooms have apparently only recently been refitted and tiled The reception staff are effervescent to put it mildly and very helpful If the price of breakfast at the hotel seems steep as it did to us there are many alternatives nearby for a coffee and croissant Some rooms like ours 101 have doors to adjoining rooms that apparently can be opened up to make a 2 room suite and the doors between block little sound Our neighbour sometimes sounded as though he was in OUR room Avoid these rooms if possible Notwithstanding this small issue we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again 
148848,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Room was small by U S standards but normal for European standards That is only reason I did not give highest rating for comfort , Great location Approx 3 blocks from river and Luvee Museum Although museum was closed during our stay because of high water level in river Lots of restaurants and shops near by Staff was extra friendly and helpful for an older couple 76 71 who did not speak French Bathroom fixtures were modern Spa tub wonderful after full day of sightseeing Breakfast was good and priced reasonable Mattress was comfortable 
148849,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, The bed was quite hard but that is to be expected in Europe The bathtub had an auto clean feature that startled me the first time it came on it was temperamental and came on mid shower not a big deal but I could have used a warning , Staff were super friendly and spoke excellent English They make you turn your key card in every time you go out which I thought I might be a bit of a hassle but I ended up really liking it because it was nice being personally greeted each time I came in Room service was great and very accommodating 
148850,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, We were there for 3 nights which I booked 2 months in advance which was a big mistake While we were there I checked online and I could have got my first night for nearly half the price I paid and on the other 2 nights they were priced 30 cheaper than we paid Not at all happy about that The bedrooms are very small and too be honest we got more space on a basic cabin on a cruise ship we travelled on recently , Staff were very helpful and friendly
148851,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Room was small but this is pretty common for Paris so it was in line with my expectations , Great bed and beautiful room Good internet Continental breakfast was a good value especially compared to what was available in the area as alternatives 
148852,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, The hallway was kinda narrow which I was ok with It s an old building in Paris except the carpet smell and Mr Rude George Security Guy awful attitude and behavior for I don t know what reason Big turn off I wont be back to that property because of him What a nightmare , The room was clean the sheets were crisp and the bed was comfortable The hotel has been remodeled recently so the room looks and feels basically new The front desk Patricia has a great personality very helpful a huge plus for this hotel 
148853,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Standard room is small but typical for Paris and Europe in general , English speaking and friendly staff and helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations Latin Quarter is walking distance for some sightseeing Metra is close for the airport and Versailles 
148854,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain,No Negative, The staff booked a shuttle for me which had to be canceled I paid in full and they insisted that I did not telling me that they would review the films that they took of me at the front desk All of this in front of another guest It was horrible customer service insulting and humiliating and I would not recommend this hotel for the price you have to pay 
148855,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, I like crispy bacon and the bacon was too undercooked for me Everything else was very good , Staff was so friendly and helpful Hotel is beautiful Our room was pretty comfortable and larger than expected 
148856,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Nothing to unlike about the hotel staff only 1 flaw was being took back to CDG for our flight to early we had to hang around for 4 hours before our flight as the couples we were traveling to the airport with had flights at 14 30 it would have been a more personal touch to be taken to the airport 2 hours later than we left all to accommodate other passengers, Fantastic layout in Napolionic style decor the staff were more than helpful
148857,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Missing tea service in the room and would have liked breakfast included in the rate, Loved the decor and the location right near everything 10 minute walk to the musee D orsay and 15 minutes to the Louvre Helpful staff
148858,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Washbasin area was rather cramped and we assumed the spa didn t work on the first night as we were told to press the button The next evening the receptionist clarified that it needed to be stroked and then it worked , We liked the room with its exposed beams and the bed was very comfortable We liked the fact that we could open the bedroom window for fresh air 
148859,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain,No Negative, This hotel was super clean and efficient I d like to have had coffee making facilities in the room or downstairs free of charge considering the room rate I think breakfast should be in the room rate then encouraging guests to use the ground floor facilities in the foyer etc a little more I wasn t quite sure if the bar downstairs was for guests to use or not It would have been nice for this to be a little more enticing to sit at the end of a night out or have a drink before going out All in all location room staff were very good 
148860,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Well we have to pay by checking in is that true , One of the reception is super nice she is definitely an additional nice impression of Paris for us And other personal are also really comfortable to talk with Thank you 
148861,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Noisy rain dropping outside Breakfast hours unsuitable for business travelers Though I was curious to see what a 19 breakfast would look like , Very good location Friendly staff Splendid renovation relooking of the rooms 
148862,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, No real complaints , Staff were exceptionally helpful particularly Irene Location is perfect for a short stay in Paris and is within walking distance to many of the top sites Room was great but the temperature was a little difficult to control 
148863,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain,No Negative, everything from the rooms to the very friendly and very welcoming staff at the front desk Nothing was too much for them Irene and Anna were wonderful explaining everything both in English and French but mostly their smile and cheerful faces made us feel at home The rooms were very comfortable warm and airy and extremely clean The location was very central to everything we wanted to see and the hotel was classic Thank you all 
148864,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, No tea making facilities but maybe that s me being too British , Fantastic greeting and reception staff always really warm and helpful best staff we ve ever encountered at a hotel Walking distance to museums notre dame great places to eat etc Fantastic spa bath which made us a lot less tired than usual when sight seeing in a city Great Express breakfast half price of main breakfast and served in room so very relaxed start to day Spotlessly clean Comfortable beds 
148865,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, There was nothing to dislike , Apart from the perfect location the room we stayed in was very charming and very comfortable and it had a balcony The bathtub with air bubbles was also a plus

148867,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, The room was quite small, Location was great in the middle of Saint Germain And really friendly staff as well The room was clean and they took security quite seriously by asking for the hotel keys each time you leave the hotel 
148868,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, No facilities such as coffee machine or kettle Wifi was a little weak , Got a nice upgrade to the junior suite Large spacious rooms Can t say enough how wonderful the staff at reception is especially one lady who was just a joy to talk to but unfortunately didn t catch her name 
148869,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Nothing at all the room was quite small but that wasn t a problem for us , Friendly staff nicely decorated well appointed and comfortable room The location was great many of Paris famous attractions were within walking distance

148872,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Accommodation had some noise intrusion from neighbouring room The rooms are described as soundproof but fell short in that respect A shame as score would be a 10 otherwise , Design ambiance and pleasant cheerful staff Decor fresh in rooms and elegant furnishings in lobby Super location Compact but well designed bathroom 
148873,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Interior sound proofing low quality I could very easily hear people from other rooms Box office TV channels low options, Hotel close to main visiting attractions Personnel very kind Exterior sound proofing is good quality 
148874,Acad mie H tel Saint Germain, Good classic breakfast but we are into super healthy food so was a bit limited for us and too expensive , Front Desk staff and porter very welcoming and helpful Felt very looked after
