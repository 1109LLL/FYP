258996,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, the hotel was super comfortable Clean New Fresh cozy Very frienly staff We thoroughly enjoyed a super quiet room even being in the ground florr room They also accomodated our request to stay for a super late check out at additional rate which is fair but they were fully booked and still found a solution it really helped a lot 
258997,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, Great location near the tube lovely room with space clean comfortable bed great museums within walking distance e g V A decent restaurant selection in the vicinity great coffee place near by called Over Under Coffee highly recommend 
258998,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, Staff hotel rooms and location are all excellent Beds bed bath linens top quality comfort It is all a true boutique hotel should be 
258999,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, Excellent location for Earls Court Underground with the District and Piccadilly lines into central London and Heathrow The staff are very friendly and helpful The room was a good size for London the bed comfortable and the shower had good pressure There is a small fridge a microwave and a kettle in the room Fresh fruit is provided at the front desk There are lots of restaurants and a Sainsburys nearby I m from Australia and it s my second stay 
259000,Hotel Moonlight, I would prefer a firmer mattress , Design and decorations of the room made it look quite more spacious than its actual size which I found quite impressive 
259001,Hotel Moonlight, Single room on the ground floor is too narrow The bed is small and there s no chair for the table What you can do is just sleep on the bed , Very friendly staff
259002,Hotel Moonlight, Genuinely didnt not like anything It was perfect , The hotel is perfectly located with a team of staff who couldnt do enough for us Room was lovely It was clean and spacious enough for the two of us Hotel was spotlessly clean
259003,Hotel Moonlight, Room is small but not claustrophobic , Beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean Earls Court is where several tube lines cross and the hotel is maybe 100 yds from the station Couldn t ask for a better location Convenient to Wimbledon during the tournament 
259004,Hotel Moonlight, Our room with twin beds was smaller than we expected , This is a classy little hotel with a lot of thought put into guest s comfort The windows are double glazed which made the room particularly quiet for a London hotel The lobby is very small but has a large lift The room was immaculate with lots of nice extras 
259005,Hotel Moonlight, Dirty air in the room No wifi poor connection Smart tv could not connect to wifi Paid way too much money for single room I know this to be true as I paid 1 3rd of the price at another hotel which was for a double room with big windows updated furnishings clean air Don t stay at this place it s not worth it, Staff 
259006,Hotel Moonlight, Nothing its a graet Boutique Hotel highly recommended, The staff were fantastic and so friendly and helpful The room was modest in size but perfect for a couple and spotlessly clean
259007,Hotel Moonlight, Single rooms is very small, The Staff was Very helpful they always had the time for me giving me instructions for travel by train to anywhere in the city or just to say Hi and ask how was your day and they were really interested in you and if they could make your day better great staff 
259008,Hotel Moonlight, The name of the hotel it almost put me off booking till I read the reviews , Quite clean well appointed great location for this part of London 2m walk to Earls Court tube very helpful and friendly staff rooms well equipped particularly the microwave and free to use mobile phone with roaming data for each room should you need it fresh fruit and a great bakery for breakfast pastries just a short walk 
259009,Hotel Moonlight, They give you so much stuff in your room there s no room on your desk to actually work , Super friendly have been before and will be back Great neighbourhood and easy to get to the airport what else can you want 
259010,Hotel Moonlight, Nothing , There is nothing to dislike about this hotel The frontage reception area and our room were all spotlessly clean The staff were amazing lovely people and so well informed Upon our arrival we were presented with a map and the receptionist pointed out all the local places of interest along with eateries and where to go for public transport The concierge then showed us to our room how wonderful is that We re very well travelled and this is the first time a hotel has made us feel so very welcome We mentioned to our hosts we were in London celebrating our anniversary and they gave us wine and chocolates to enjoy Perfect The room itself was a small double and although small it was furnished so well you didn t feel cramped at all Air Conditioning a bonus fridge microwave both provided along with a safe and some water tea coffee etc We asked for extras a couple of times and this was no issue Bathroom was immaculate and spacious lovely overhead shower and bath Venture away from the hotel and you ll find some lovely gardens nearby with plenty of choice to eat including some English Pubs offering ambience good food and fine ale Easily accessible by tube and bus this hotel is really a gem find don t hesitate to book and stay 
259011,Hotel Moonlight, The room could have been larger but was well appointed and quite comfortable , The basement room was small but comfortable The bathroom was clean and well appointed 
259012,Hotel Moonlight, The only negative we had was the light that came through the bathroom door there were no blinds on the bathroom window and a glass pain on the door it must have been the street light , Fantastic room with more than you could want or need Brilliant staff it was a thoroughly enjoyable stay 
259013,Hotel Moonlight, London rooms are expensive so the rates here are also not cheap but better value for money , The location is superb Earls Court station is a good hub for District and Piccadilly lines Also Holland Park and posh South Kensington is at walking distance Many bars and restaurants nearby Cleaning is good and the staff is very friendly Rooms are comfortable but small as nearly all London hotels Free fresh fruit and coffee at the reception a big plus for me 
259014,Hotel Moonlight, The bed was a bit hard for my liking and we would have preferred a bigger bed it was quite a small double But other than that it was great , Great location next to earls court and not too far from key shopping areas The staff were so friendly and even gave me a bottle of wine when they found out it was my birthday The room was very tastefully decorated as well 
259015,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, Great location quiet and clean Fridge and microwave in room Walking distance to the V and A the Natural History Museum and about 2 minutes from Earls Court tube station If you are coming in from Heathrow it is an easy trip on the Picadilly line Helpful and cheerful staff I do not hesitate to recommend 
259016,Hotel Moonlight, Room wasn t very big and no food served in the hotel However did have microwave in the room so could buy something and heat up in room , Great location had microwave in room 
259017,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, I ve stayed 1 night Took the club room Room was very nice and convenient No food in this hotel But there is microwave free minibar kettle and nice selection of snacks In the near vicinity there are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants The neighborhood is quite surrounded by small green gardens Staff is very friendly and helpful Highly recommended
259018,Hotel Moonlight, The single room was very small even by London standards There was hardly any natural light as the room had only one small window The decor of the room was dingy and unremarkable and was not consistent with the bright and modern bathroom The air con and fridge made a bit of noise so it was quite disruptive having the bed so close to them The room was literally one step from the elevator and the bed was one step into the room Any noise in the corridor and from the elevator can be heard clearly , Wifi was quick and reliable Bathroom was good sized and very clean There was an incident of a leak but that was resolved quickly Staff was attentive Room was well equipped with mini fridge and microwave 
259019,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, They have the Handy phones in the room with 4G internet and free calls from anywhere in London Very nice little place Earls Ct is in Central London on the Western Edge if you re not familiar with London It s a busy and pretty nice place South Kensington is adjacent and that is beautiful and Hyde Park is about 10 minute walk 
259020,Hotel Moonlight, Would be good to have 2 sets of cutlery and some plates and bowls especially as there is a fridge and microwave and a Sainsbury supermarket 500m away to buy breakfast provisions , The hotel is near to Earls Court underground on the Piccadilly and District lines so is easy to get to Heathrow or into London It was quiet very clean and comfortable The twin room was a little cramped for 2 friends and luggage but we managed ok The bed and pillows were comfortable and the shower over the bath had lots of pressure and hot water although it was difficult not to get the bathroom wet as the shower screen was tiny There was a kettle fridge and a microwave but no crockery or cutlery except for cups and teaspoons The wifi worked well and there is a lift The staff were all lovely and very helpful I will return here when next in London 
259021,Hotel Moonlight, The room was on the small side but the important things to me a comfortable bed security quietness and good bathroom facilities were all met so it all balanced out , The couple on reception couldn t have been more helpful they were friendly and welcoming on arrival On being told I was down in London for an art exhibition the next day and without prompting a route map was printed off for me for collection in the morning I thank the air conditioning too as being in a small room and even though it wasn t the height of summer it was still nice to be able to cool down with a flick of a switch as it were 
259022,Hotel Moonlight, Very small rooms and hallways Wouldn t be suitable for more than a night really Expensive for the size of the room , Nice clean rooms and friendly staff
259023,Hotel Moonlight, Wish there was breakfast available only coffee tea or fruit But it wouldn t stop me from staying there again , Beautiful small hotel in very convenient location So many great restaurants nearby all with great food Near Earl s Court Tube Station Friendly helpful staff comfortable room large bathroom including fridge and microwave Air conditioning All the comforts of home I loved my 4 nights there 
259024,Hotel Moonlight, Nothing really the bed was a bit harder than I prefer but I slept ok , Close to Earl s Court station small but comfortable room with good facilities 
259025,Hotel Moonlight, No Breakfast which wasn t a massive issue as lots of cafe within 5 minute walk, Easy to find excellent young lady at reception very helpful and pleasant and helped us with a local map etc The room was lovely and clean comfy bed and excellent shower lots of plug sockets 
259026,Hotel Moonlight, The room was small especially by American standards However it did have all the amenities that I was looking for including a private bathroom refrigerator microwave etc , The property is within a 5 minute walk of the London Underground Earl s Court Station and a short distance from restaurants museums and the Royal Albert Hall In addition the hotel provided a complimentary phone with 4G to use while I was there which really came in handy Also the front desk had complimentary umbrellas which I utilized on the first day of my trip 
259027,Hotel Moonlight, One night it was a little chilly in the room but I couldn t get heat to come out of the system I went to bed and henceforth did not have any problems , Excellent location close to Earl s Court tube stop You can easily take the Piccadilly line straight from the airport and there are no stairs at Earl s Court to challenge travelers with luggage Hooray While the room was quite small a standard single it had everything a traveler might need Fridge coffee and tea making equipment a desk comfy chair clean comfortable bed nice lighting nightstand with storage and attractive bedside lamp and a very well designed bathroom that while small had room to store things etc Very thoughtful layout All in all I liked the room very much Also the staff are VERY nice and always accommodating eager to help and make your stay pleasant They also provide a cell phone for customer use free of charge A terrific innovation 
259028,Hotel Moonlight, I found the fire door in the basement ajar a couple of times When I brought it to the attention of the staff I felt dismissed I was concerned about there being free access from the street for anyone who might have tried to come in As a woman traveling alone it made me feel unsafe , The location is fantastic The room was impeccably clean 
259029,Hotel Moonlight, Very small room with only one chair for seating and no lobby or useable desk Only instant coffee in room and no other option except pay machine by elevator with no seating , Location good for Tube train use Many restaurants and stores nearby Staff very friendly and helpful Nicely appointed 
259030,Hotel Moonlight, I had a single basement room that although very clean and new was a little on the cosy side Not a problem if you spend most of the day out and about or only staying a few days Have no experience of the upper rooms but other reviews suggest they are larger , Newly renovated last August Excellent staff Short walk to Sainsburys which is open til midnight Earl s Court tube very close by Great coffee at Under Over near tube station Plenty of other coffee eating pubs nearby as well Banks and ATMs across from tube station Ten minute walk to Hyde Park if you really want to but tube is so convenient Microwave makes it possible to keep your catering costs down Best to take your own cutlery corkscrew Would easily use this Hotel again 
259031,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, The staff was outstanding So friendly and very helpful The property had a fresh new feel The room was well equipped The location was only 1 block from the tube station We will definitely stay here again 
259032,Hotel Moonlight, Not a hotel if no breakfast no lounge no facilities In a run down location it s v poor value Bathroom a disgrace c hipped bath and grubby sealant all round the bath edge BOTH MY HUSBAND I came to London on business regularly before we retired and this is the worst we have ever stayed in Not a hotel just a room stayed in better B B , No much
259033,Hotel Moonlight, Tiny criticism is the shower did not point straight but at an angle into the shower screen Had I mentioned it I know it would have been resolved but as I only stayed for one night it wasn t a problem , Can t fault it at all Excellent location and value for money Staff went above and beyond to ensure I had what I needed Brought me extra water free of charge Called to make sure everything was satisfactory Receipt printed and ready for me checking out 
259034,Hotel Moonlight, Housekeeping people should be less loud doing their job nearby at 8 30 am in the Saturday morning Also shower needs bigger curtain otherwise you should be careful when taking shower , Great place to stay in London Surroundings are full of cafes restaurants there are two supermarkets too There is definitely everything in the room you may need in your travel including a fully equipped kitchen The underground 3 lines at one station is 5 min away So Heathrow may be reached by the underground Paddington as well 
259035,Hotel Moonlight, Despite being a new ish hotel it was already looking a little rough around the edges Sealant and grout in the bathroom was looking grubby Also the tiny shower screen seemed to be cosmetic rather than functional when we had a shower it soaked the floor which is uncomfortable at best and dangerous at worst , Staff were excellent and made us feel very welcome indeed They did their best to be helpful We could not fault the service 
259036,Hotel Moonlight, The electrical sockets stopped working during the night but this was not a particular problem for me It didn t affect the lights or hot water , Having been stranded in London by a rail problem I stumbled on this hotel via a very quick search on booking com The rating for the price and location seemed almost too good to be true On arriving st the hotel I found it to be excellent in almost every respect Considerate and welcoming gentleman at reception Lovely room furnished and equipped to a very high standard with features you would rarely find such as smartphone for guests use microwave fridge iron and ironing board and a comfortable bed The hotel is close to shops and restaurants so I will definitely stay again if I get the chance Thank you for a lovely stay 
259037,Hotel Moonlight, Nothing, Absolutely loved the small boutique feel of the property Staff was excellent and so helpful The bonus was the extras such as fresh fruit juices snacks and water at no cost didn t need to run to a local supermarket to get any of these things especially water as they were re stocked every day Also no problem to ask for more bottles water etc if you needed it As we left each morning I would ask for a few bottles of water to take with me on our daily excursions Wifi was outstanding and fast Never had a problem with it and was never bounced out didn t need to reconnect like other hotels in Spain The final bonus was the use of a free mobile smartphone to make any calls and use it for goggle maps Well done and I highly recommend this property If I return to London I would definitely stay there without hesitation Of the 5 hotels I stayed in Europe this was my favourite 
259038,Hotel Moonlight, No cons , Clean cozy quiet rooms Excellent polite ja helpful customer service Best I have ever had Good location Travelled with a teenager who shared my thoughts 
259039,Hotel Moonlight, There is a fridge and microwave in the room but no cutlery crockery , There is no restaurant in the hotel but plenty of local places to eat and the hotel provides a handy map with recommendations The staff are very kind and I received a personal email after my stay

259044,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, Room was immaculate and smells nice Bed was so comfortable My insomnia was cured while I was there Free fruits Would come back to London just to stay at hotel Moonlight 
259045,Hotel Moonlight, It was a shame that the hotel didn t offer a breakfast but the Premier Inn next door had a good breakfast for 10 50 , My room was really dark which I really liked There was a microwave freezer and a really nice bathroom The Airco worked perfectly and the staff was amazing 
259046,Hotel Moonlight, Extremely small room even I think by London standards Tiny desk with no chair Shower has no guard to stop spray from splashing all over the floor , Nicely decorated very clean good location

259048,Hotel Moonlight, Nothing I loved every minute of my stay Awesome Hotel , I will go back to this hotel in a heartbeat I was greeted with a handsome smile and the gentlemen knew my name when I arrived I arrived on my birthday and in my room they had left a bottle of wine and some chocolates Also there was a personal note from the hotel wishing me a happy birthday Earls Tube was the closest tube station about or less than a 5 minute walk They also provided me with an easy travel phone this allowed me to call home to my parents and have data access while I was out and about This hotel is excellent The rooms are small but it fit my taste I loved the room size The bed was awesome as well the best sleep I had while on vacation I will definitely stay here next time Walking distance to endless restaurants pubs stores and even a massage polar etc Thank you for an awesome experience 
259049,Hotel Moonlight, Blackout curtains didn t No place for a guest to sit wait besides the guest room , Friendly staff headed by a caring responsive manager Traveling with a large bag I found the basic room too small Club room was excellent comfortable well laid out v good bright bathroom A few mins walk to tube restaurants shops

259052,Hotel Moonlight, Noise from trains underneath double bed a bit cosy for two not cool enough despite air conditioning, Location cleanliness bigger than expected was advertised as a small room friendly welcome fresh fruit helpful staff
259053,Hotel Moonlight, No complaints at all I guess the only thing I didn t like was the brand of shampoo that s provided That s hardly even worth mentioning , Adorable boutique hotel in very quiet neighborhood good location easy walk to Kensington Park and Palace and close to Earls Court tube station Staff was so helpful and friendly Room is small but lovely and efficiently laid out with so many amenities Fridge micro kettle iron even a mobile phone with internet Nice bathroom too Good wifi
259054,Hotel Moonlight, Everything was fine, The staff were extremely helpful with extra info on the area directions Jenny Juan the guy on duty Saturday night can t remember name sorry were excellent in customer care service Jenny in particular 
259055,Hotel Moonlight, Booking com was awful not hotel s fault they somehow had my card details given to a 3rd party and I had to cancel all my cards no apology or explanation from them Hotel staff when explained were very sorry but said it was booking com s fault and I believe them Will never use booking com again, Excellent customer service and unbeatable value for a room in Kensington superb Staff were simply lovely and went out of their way to make me feel welcome Small but well appointed room all very new and like a mini 3 star hotel suite great big bathroom comfortable bed and the microwave and fridge made it super easy to eat in bring some cutlery though

259059,Hotel Moonlight, Our stay was just great, Very clean and comfortable room in an outstanding location in Kensington perfect to discover the city Alo the windows are soundproof no street noise 
259060,Hotel Moonlight, There was no breakfast Ok it didn t actually state that there was breakfast but if this is not available then you should say so please We requested some special food for breakfast and didn t even get a reply to state that breakfast was not available Also when we checked in the guy forgot to tell us that there was no breakfast The room was smaller than it looked on the website and too hot and difficult to adjust the temperature The shower screen was way too small to offer protection from wetting most of the floor The towels were hard and like sandpaper Lastly the bed was very hard and offered only one bed side table , Location Reasonably quiet Hot water
259061,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, I stayed in the Club room with king size bed with a nice street view Even the bathroom have a window with a nice street view Love that they provide complimentary fruits and snacks and water Though they dont have a eatery they provide a good choice of restaurants in the nearby They are very responsive to my email enquiries

259065,Hotel Moonlight, Room somewhat small but this is London and bed mattress a bit too soft for my taste, Location great in west London room clean and new very nice bathroom staff very helpful 
259066,Hotel Moonlight, The bathroom could have been cleaner , Great staff very polite and helpful Equipments are very recent Few meters from the metro station and very close to the centre Good value for money 
259067,Hotel Moonlight, Would have liked a little stronger main light but being picky It was impossible to have a shower without flooding the floor good job lots of fluffy towels provided Cannot comment on food as did not eat there Bedroom sound proofing excellent but not the bathroom s , Club bed room was extremely comfortable and very well appointed On suite bathroom excellent with range of toiletries Very close to amenities of Kensington without too much noise Additional complimentary free quality coffee and fruit available at reception

259072,Hotel Moonlight, Would have been nice to be able to have breakfast at the hotel but it wasn t a huge downfall, The rooms were exactly like the photos and the staff were all so lovely
259073,Hotel Moonlight, I had a single room and bed was really small even for a normal person as me The hotel doesn t serve breakfast , Hotel is very well located to Subway and commercial area Staff is great 
259074,Hotel Moonlight, a hotel with breakfast would have been slightly more convenient also the WC flush was constantly running no way to take a relaxing bath and an ecological issue, very friendly great location near Earl s Court good underground connections
259075,Hotel Moonlight, Couldnt turn the radiator off fully could only have it on its lowest setting as i like a cool room yo sleep in No bar or nreakfst facilities but i missed that when booking i didnt read it but fors state it and plenty bars eateries in a few mins walk, Excellent location very nice spacious well equipped room and surprisingly quiet room lovely staff on recpetion 
259076,Hotel Moonlight, Our room was on the top floor and very warm despite being there in Dcember So we slept withban open window to make it better , Location the staff went the extra mile to make pur stay very comfortable and special Room was surprisingly big for being London 
259077,Hotel Moonlight, , When they found out it was our wedding anniversary they brought in a tray with a bottle of red wine and red foiled heart chocolates which was very nice of them The staff on reception were fantastic 
259078,Hotel Moonlight, The only thing was that the building had central heating and the room was to hot for me very cosy but to hot and not possible to control , It was an amazing experience in London And I travel a lot to London Staff was super kind location amazing and I appreciate a lot as well the cleanliness of the place it was great Would stay more often there for sure

259081,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, Staff were super nice and helpful Rooms were nicely decorated and modern Location was very strategic just 4 minutes away from a tube metro station 
259082,Hotel Moonlight, The staff were so eager to please it was a little embarrassing especially by email , Everything was really great Lots of features in a fairly small typical London room 
259083,Hotel Moonlight, Bit hot in the room would of been nice to have complementary coffee in lobby, Location super friendly and helpful staff very accommodating with check in check out times
259084,Hotel Moonlight, I had a single room on the basement level The room was simply TOO small There was only about 1 meter on either side of the bed and very cramped though bed was comfortable The bathroom was also modern but extremely small There was no breakfast possible in the hotel This should thus be a 3 star hotel , The hotel was very nicely renovated and all modern fixtures 
259085,Hotel Moonlight, The Executive Single Room was rather small but due to the typical Kensington and Chelsea architecture this is to be expected , Earl s Court Station is only a 3 min walk up Hogarth Road You can avoid bad tube lines and travel on District and Central lines only to get around London The staff is friendly and helpful 
259086,Hotel Moonlight, Bedroom very small although a Club Room Bathroom needs a little tlc , 5 minute walk to tube and wide range of places for coffee breakfast etc Bed v comfy and microwave useful Free snacks a nice touch 
259087,Hotel Moonlight, In our room water in the toilet was not to be stopped , Good value really nice stuff comfortable bed Only a 4 5 min walk to Earl s Court Station and some fine Pubs 
259088,Hotel Moonlight,No Negative, I can t say enough about this place The staff went above and beyond to ensure my comfort during my stay I had a gorgeous comfortable room that satisfied all my requirements Awesome location so close to the underground and amazing restaurants Thanks again guys xoxo
259089,Hotel Moonlight, The only thind we didnt like was the fact that we had to leave , We had an amazing stay The staff was super kind to us and made sure that we are satisfied at all times with the room and everything else we asked for was done with a smile Diana Ojao and Austina were very professional and helped us with directions and how to get to everywhere we needed The rooms were cosy and very elegante We will definatley want to come back 
259090,Hotel Moonlight, Room a bit small and bed was up against one wall but as we only stayed one night this did not bother us at all , Really good location close to tube and restaurants Room very quiet and staff very helpful 
259091,Hotel Moonlight, The very small bed that is good for one person but becomes difficult for two , Good location walking distance from the station Staff was very good especially the young lady Room was very small the bed even smaller There is some problem with the pictures of the room on booking com and the actual room Discussed this with the lady staff who claimed to have herself put the pictures on booking com while she was extremely helpful and I give her the benefit of doubt the actual room is much smaller and pictures were of a higher category room 
259092,Hotel Moonlight, Considering that there was microwave in the room it would have been nice to have plates The shower splashguard could do to be wider The bathroom floor was very wet after having had a shower But those are the only gripes I d have , Staff were really accommodating and cared Bed was wonderful and we didnt have to check out at some ridiculous time In fact the receptionist said we could have a lie in Whilst it was awkward not having breakfast the fact that the room had a microwave meant that we could get croissants locally and heat them up 
259093,Hotel Moonlight, There was a problem with the bathroom and the room was extremely smelly I ve asked for a different room but nothing was available they gave me a bottle of wine to make up for the issue I had a really bad night with the smell in the room , The staff was very nice the location is excellent The room was small but nice
259094,Hotel Moonlight, No breakfast available but plenty places nearby , The staff were lovely Very friendly and helpful Was this really London The room was a decent size as was the bathroom unlike some cupboards I ve stayed in before in London It was quiet and complimentary minibar not alcohol was a great touch Nothing was too much trouble for the staff 
259095,Hotel Moonlight, Bright green light in the room illuminates the entire room and makes sleeping very difficult road noise especially acute during the weekends heater was too hot despite the warm weather outside, Location design comfortable bed fast and free WiFi
259096,Hotel Moonlight, The WiFi signal in Room 901 was weak in the corner of the room near the bed Otherwise it was good in other areas of the room , Second visit in a week Excellent staff as always Came back due to its location and convenience to the Tube supermarkets restaurants and proximity to major attractions 
259097,Hotel Moonlight, Bathroom smell overpoweringly strong of cleaning chemicals or freshener The green emergency light near the bed was annoying for sleep as was the clattering noise from the room above sounded like the extractor fan was faulty Heating also did not come on so room was cold , Friendly reception with helful tips Good location 
259098,Hotel Moonlight, Incredibly bright green light on bedroom ceiling impossible to turn off and kept me awake all night Called reception at 3am to be told by impolite staff member that it is health and safety and didn t get offered any solution not even an eye mask Ended up sleeping in the bath as bathroom slightly darker A horrible sleepless night ,No Positive

259125,Hotel Moonlight, It s very hard to answer this part The overall impression is extremely good and in truth the experience doesn t detract from this But there are little niggles such as the noise in the room at night not from just outside but internally The noise the fridge makes yes it s good to have one The length of time the loo takes to finish its flushing procedure and refill lengthy and quite noisy I could not get the TV to work using the remotes and even the guy that was kindly sent up to help couldn t get it to work other than a few stations manually These after a few hours turned the whole system off and I couldn t restart it The light coming in under the door from the public area the very bright green security light The bathroom whilst well thought through for such a small confined area if one is anything over about 5 5 max they are going to find it very cramped Would I stay again I don t know If my decision was based on the staff and initial appearance yes I would If one were to look into the finer points as I ve laid out probably no , The overall impression was very good It s is new and well decorated Staff were really very efficient and helpfull
