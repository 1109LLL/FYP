511920,Das Triest Hotel, 1 property says breakfast wasnt included however I rememberbasic breakfast being included in the booking 2 wasnt a suite rather a large room with a central bathroom and sofabed on one side and queen bed on the other , location location location 
511921,Das Triest Hotel, Optional mattress topper as mattress a bit too firm used an extra duvet Maybe introduce optional tea coffee making facilities in room , Staff always willing to help and sort out anything that arises Very Comfortable rooms short walk to Opera house and Nachtmarket 
511922,Das Triest Hotel, You notice already that here and there the hotel would need refurbishment again The shower handle and the shade of the bed lamp were a bit wonky Not really disturbing though but considering the price per night I would have preferred that every tiny thing were in perfect condition , The hotel s interieur was designed by Sir Terence Conran You see the English style especially in the bathroom The house is a historical building well adapted and modernized There a lots of trendy places for going out in walking distance as well as the Naschmarkt and the city center Definitely the heating is working well It was freezing cold outside but the room was cosy warm Must do Have a drink at the hotel bar One of the best bar keeper in the world is working there I would definitely stay there again let s see if Robbie Williams also does again 
511923,Das Triest Hotel, Hotel facilities are visibly dated and are in need of remodeling Staff seemed to be a bit bored and not as attentive as one would expect although they got the job done Breakfast buffet is poor for a 5 hotel in all respects from the variety of choices to the quality of food provided Hotel was overpriced based on our experience probably due to high demand of the season Christmas NYE , Very good location for exploring the city centre and close to major public transport hub Karlsplatz Room was spacious and comfortable with good storage and big bathroom 
511924,Das Triest Hotel, The toilet equipment were not effective Can not control easily , The room is generally comfortable and staff are amazing in extending all help they can offer 
511925,Das Triest Hotel, The works next to the building is inconvenient more than small inconveniences mentioned by the hotel But If you are on business trip leaving hotel at 8 30 will not cause any issues ,No Positive
511926,Das Triest Hotel, The internet was very weak almost impossible to use There was no drinking opportunity at the sauna which wasn t very pleasent Also there was construction in the hotel It is understandable that it needs renovation from time to time but I think it is not acceptable that the information about the work and the incredibly loud noise from 8 am to 6pm is only provided at the venue after I checked in It should have appeared already when I booked the room on Booking com since once I arrived I could not cancel my accomodation for free which put me in a very uncomfortable position , The location was excellent and the room was very nice 
511927,Das Triest Hotel, outdated not very clean staff at breakfast was awful the pillows are uncomfortable very noisy if you get a room facing the street oh yeah and no proper curtains so don t exoect a good night s sleep , the location is great and the breakfast is good 
511928,Das Triest Hotel, Non smoking hotel Wants to be very design oriented but it isn t Nice room however No bottle of water in the room Shower makes the complete bathroom wet Nice idea to have an imac in the room serving as internet access tv entertainment Welcome staff was not really friendly Check out went smooth No scrambled eggs at breakfast Other food were ok Nice cocktails in the bar Close to the city center Street rooms are kind of noisy Paid 50 eur more than my college who also booked via booking com Very bad , Muesli imac

511932,Das Triest Hotel, We had booked a superior room but in this hotel the term superior room actually means standard room Secondly you must phone the hotel beforehand and insist you have a room at the rear as the front rooms suffer dreadfully from noise from the trams, This hotel is wonderfully situated within easy reach of main attractions
511933,Das Triest Hotel, The night receptionist who doesn t speak English or other language except for German and she was not friendly or helpful The room towards the street very noisy But they offered us a quiet room the second night which was perfect , Fantastic location the silver bar and its famous bartender The reception manager was very nice
