106429,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, Quality of the bread for the breakfast is poor and industrial I have to buy my own baguettes in an artisan bakery in the neighbourhood every morning We missed a proper room service too With at least a short selection of food or snack , As usual amazing view from the suites Good bed and shower 
106430,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, Staff rooms no AC in the hotel as mentioned by reciption manager Also there is no security inside the hotel and some people make bad things inside hotel , Nothing very bad hotel and staff and rooms AC IS NOT WORKING only hot air 
106431,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, We arrived at the hotel 1130 It was early for check in so we told the front desk we parked our car downstairs and we will be starting our tour of the city We enjoyed the city had dinner the neighborhood then checked in 2300 The initial front desk person couldn t find our reservation then another of his colleagues tried to help him They gave me the wrong reservation even though I spelled my Last name first name multiple times Finally they found the actual reservation paper which was in front of them all that time There was no apologies no signs of remorse or that they made any mistakes We also made our reservation with booking com that included breakfast That was not even considered by them They wanted to charge us 20 euros person increasing the accommodation with breakfast for almost 300 euro This hotel is rated as a 4 star There is nothing special about this hotel that deserves this designation This is only a 2 star at best in the USA I only used it to secure my parking It is extremely overpriced There are several cracks in the tile floor in the bathroom Black mold is present in the corner of the outside of the bathtub , We used this hotel primarily for parking and then taking the subway to tour Paris 
106432,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, First time I had to do that ask to change room The room I was given was smelly a mixture of cigarette and sweat floor was dirty and aircon was not working When I mentioned the smell the first thing that the staff did was to send someone to spray it with chemical it then smelled chemical I was told the hotel was fully booked but after 20 mins was given another room no smell and aircon worked I wouldn t recommend this hotel,No Positive
106433,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, Wifi is super bad Hair drier is horrible Breakfast is very poor and at 9 30 you won t find anything breakfast is till 11 This is maximum 3 stars hotel ,No Positive
106434,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, If you are not driving or attending an event locally then I would not really recommend this hotel The price of the hotel was just as expensive as more central hotels so no point staying here unless the location is paramount The location is in not such a nice area of Paris and I did not feel comfortable walking locally with my children especially after dark Rather than nice family friendly restaurants most of the eating establishments seemed to be trashy bars so more suited for younger people without children in tow Another significant negative point was the VERY POOR Wifi connectivity So slow I used my mobile phone , Good nearby location if attending an event at the Stade de France If driving into Paris from the North e g from Calais ferry crossing then this hotel avoids you driving in and out of Central Paris To avoid the traffic and lack of parking travelling into Central Paris was very easy by train as the Metro was only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel Hotel was nice and the staff friendly 
106435,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, during one week we were in Paris Brussels Luxembourg Cologne in 3 star and 4 star hotels but this one was more expensive with less quality compare to other hotels Corridor of hotel looks like an old hostel and The staff seemed unhappy compare to other hotels This is my review comparing to 4 other hotels during our stay in 4 different countries and as they say you shouldn t expect more than that from Paris it s not a 4 star hotel , nothing special
106436,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, Some of the staff at reception are very rude I arrived on the 15th April 2017 the staff were on the evening shift were very rude and doesn t have patients to the customers , Rooms have space enough for families Unfortunately rooms has smell of cigarettes and we have small children we couldn t be able to do anything as the offer were un exchangeable We didn t have any choice 
106437,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, Room temperature control It was too hot and outside temperature was 10 12 C No temperature control inside except for heating Definitely I would not stay there in summer We had to leave the windows opened all night long , Room size comfy beds overall cleaning 
106438,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette,No Negative, Stayed in a very large twin room on the 7th floor Plenty of room and be d was comfortable Location was fine just 5 stops on the Metro from Gare du Nord 
106439,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, The bedrooms have horrible little paper cups for hot beverages poor quality so your fingers get burned and you can only have little drinks of tea There is also only a supply of tea coffee I would have liked to also have herbal teas available in my room, I was attending a conference at the Philharmonie so this hotel was perfectly located for convenience to that event while also being moments away from the Metro so Paris was easily accessible The roof top restaurant had a stunning view of the city and the breakfast there had a wide selection of delicious food The staff were friendly and helpful ready to assist with any problems immediately My room was beautiful great comfortable beds with plenty of space to hang up my clothes a desk space to work at and a great TV Best of all a long bathtub and an infinite supply of hot water to soak in after each days activities I highly recommend it 
106440,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, The corridors are a bit depressing the hotel would need a bit of refreshment , For those who intend a night out at the new Philharmonic Hall of Paris that s a great place to stay at I was welcomed by a very nice and competent girl at the reception The rooms are not luxury but fair enough for a short stay 
106441,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, The breakfast selection was not amazing and there could have been more it s was not worth 20 There was not much to eat , Great customer service reception was very friendly 
106442,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, The wifi didn t extend to our room at the far end of the hotel whatsoever Only English Channel was CNN and it was basically a trump a thon Breakfast for vegetarians was lacking Only choices were cheeses cold scrambled egg or tinned fruit or sugary pastries All I wanted was a fresh fruit salad w natural yoghurt to start the day right, It was all very clean and the bathroom seemed new and stylish Very comfy beds and perfect loction
106443,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, This was my third stay within last 12 months The standards were lowered since last visit There was no warm water one morning there was no soap in the bathroom no welcome bottle of water and the toilet was slightly smelling , The location of the hotel is very convenient for me 
106444,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, Parking was expensive at 20 euros per 24 hours and the rooms were too hot and thermostat had no effect in the room , Polite staff and location is only 30 mins from Paris centre on Metro and 30 mins drive to Euro Disney
106445,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, I didn t like there wasn t a pantry to purchase water from however its a nice hotel The elevator is secure requiring a key card to select a floor ,No Positive
106446,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, Not enough tv channels in room, The location was directly across the road from the park area and right beside the metro stop for going into Paris centre
106447,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, The shower it was then hot than normal than hot so we burned our self The presure of the water was not good And the staff need to learn english The tv to order movies only 5 movies availeble wich only one of them was in english and not that much tv channels And no iron to iron clothing , De location Taxi nearby hotel metro also Lost of resaurants in the area Room was clean big closet comfortable bed Free computerto use Staff was nice but can not speak english very well 
106448,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, The shower had a decent water pressure but at times was difficult to finely regulate water temperature The room was a bit stuffy when the windows were closed even with the ventilation air system on but it was not overwhelming The vending machine was out of Coca Cola 0 5L for 2 and almost every other drink and the staff offered to sell me cans of Coca Cola from their refrigerator in the back 330mL for 3 60 which made zero sense to me , The room was comfortable and a good size for adventurous travelers what I mean is it is a good base and place to sleep for travelers that like to get out and about and spend most of the time outside of the hotel The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was just fine as well The location a hundred meters or so from a metro station was great because the hotel is just outside of the busy and more expensive part of the city but with easy access to everything via metro There is a cheaper breakfast offer instead of the standard 18 breakfast this one is 8 5 and includes a coffee croissant and a juice I think 
106449,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, The check receptionist Helene was very rude and impolite and had a negative facial expression rolling her eyes and talking in a low tone very inappropriate Very argumentative Helene Not someone I would place at the front desk in a 4 Stars hotel , The room was very comfortable
106450,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette,No Negative, The response and information given by the front desk officers were excellent I can t recall their names maybe Charlotte and Vijay Grandmother was from Penang Malaysia Congratulation on the service provided by the hotel to me as a first timer in Paris

106452,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, Smell of smoke along the corridor in floor 3 No scrambled eggs for breakfast on day 2 , Always so helpful I was put in a huge room near my friends and extra bedding was provided so my friend could sleep in my room before the marathon Breakfast staff were wonderful as were reception staff Room was great very clean and spacious 
106453,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, I don t appreciate having my door knocked on and opened by cleaners inquiring yes every half hour from 9 AM and on when I ve been working until midnight and only have gotten to bed at 2 3AM The restaurant has some service staff with very poor English which is fine it is however kind of a kick in the nuts when you get there not knowing the kitchen has closed and one of them asks would you like to eat Drink Both and when you say both he replies the kitchen is closed and chuckles in French I also saw the same guy accidentally knock the phone out of a Hell s Angels member s hand look back shrug and keep walking narrowly avoiding a falcon punch in the dick because his friend stopped him Also the breakfast was terrible and I snuck out without paying , Great pillows Service was prompt and always available I gave the location top score because when I m in Paris I always work right across the street As for the neighborhood it s ok but I wouldn t stay there if I were on vacation

106456,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, Un fortunately the hotel appeared tied The carpets in the room had quite a few stains and the carpets in the lift were certainly overdue for replacement, The bed was comfortable and the food from the bistro was very good
106457,Mercure Paris 19 Philharmonie La Villette, The cleaning staff open the doors of the room almost without knocking I was sleeping by the time the cleaning lady came in and woke me up at 9 00 am I had to ask her to leave cause I was jet lagged and tired and after five minutes she came back in This time knocking once or twice really annoying Breakfast was extremely expensive Better options in the restaurants on the same side of the street specially the one right by the metro station from 5 Euros to 12 top , The front desk staff was nice and helpful
