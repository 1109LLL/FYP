152498,Hotel Oscar, Rooms much smaller than what appeared on website Microwave wasnt working, Awesome location literally a stone throw from champs elysees friendly and helpful staff 
152499,Hotel Oscar, Hiking luggage up the very skinny stairs but we were helped by the lovely Andreea Thank you , Great service Andreea was so helpful Great location we walked comfortably to the the Eiffel Tower and the Arc De Triomphe 
152500,Hotel Oscar, We were given the wrong room initially and were talen aback to find other people in our room and our possessions had been moved The manager was apologetic for the confusion After the first day bathroom supplies such as soap and face flannels were not replenished The tea and coffee machines are not as efficient as a kettle The wifi was sometimes intermittent Otherwise a lovely hotel , The location and room size suited our needs The staff were friendly and helpful and spoke English with us when our French was limited We are very grateful to one of the cleaning staff for her help on our departure day The hotel is only a few rooms so very private It has a great entry system with codes and not keys 
152501,Hotel Oscar, Very disappointed the difference between what was said by phone and the reality The staff is nice but not so helpful I had to bring my luggage alone to my room by stairs with no electricity To join my room which was a junior suite I have to go through a small court where all the BINS are located odor and ugly to see beurk Very rigid attitude for the breakfast service Are we still in the 20 s Well the price vs quality are not at ALL justified There is a lot to do I wouldn t recommande so much this place after all Disppatoined by the staff and the room , Nice Location near the Champs Elys es Everything can be done by foot 
152502,Hotel Oscar, Lot is street noise late at night and early morning Would not stay here again unless a courtyard room would guaranteed It is a very very small property which you either like or hate No amenities in site which is a drawback but the location makes up for it , Very specious roomy and comfortable amenities Great central location 
152503,Hotel Oscar, There was not a lift to our room I booked a room for 4 persons although we were a family 2 adults 2 children The room might be small but tidy It would suit family rather than 4 adults , The location is perfect At your door step you will find a grocery shop and few coffee shops The ladies in the reception were extremely helpful I can t thank them enough for their kindness The room was comfy and clean There are a coffee tea machines few glasses and plates and microwave 
152504,Hotel Oscar, Everything was perfect The size of the lift was small moving your luggages would take some time if you had many , The size of the apartment was amazing It was a spacious apart and ours had 2 rooms and a dinning tv area The apart had a lot of space to store your items in the cupboard and closets The wifi signal was very fast We had complementary tea and coffee capsules Looks like a new apart where the decor was modern and so was the facilities in the hotel It was secure where every room had their own passcode to enter The staff were very friendly and helpful They were available and guided us when we required Very nice staff The location was perfect as it was a few steps away from Champ Elysees Franklin Roosevelt Metro station There was a grocery store just below the hotel and many restaurant options Will book with Hotel Oscar again for sure Perfect experience overall 
152505,Hotel Oscar,No Negative, Exceptional service from Andrea who helped us in a big way It s the little things that count and I will be booking here again next time in Paris Great location good rooms no complaints whatsoever 
152506,Hotel Oscar, The white sofas need to be freshed up At places it kind of look grey No comments for the rest we appreciated our stay , The staff were just wonderful Thanks to all of them 
152507,Hotel Oscar, The room was small and it better to get the other rooms Which are bigger, I liked it because of its location Excellent location near the shanz road 
152508,Hotel Oscar, So noisy outside that we couldnt sleep well at night and the entrance of the hotel was pretty shocking to me It looks so old and scary, Big room and good location
152509,Hotel Oscar, We were locked outside the hotel for a while as the buzzer doesn t work The room was a bit tired and could have been much cleaner it needed a hoover and the surfaces needed a wipe down The shower was appalling like a dripping tap , the free nespresso water green tea drinks and nuts were a nice touch lots of towels fast wifi location was brilliant bed was comfy and sheets were clean 
152510,Hotel Oscar, We expected a hotel it isn t It is six rooms only with a concierge type desk only Finding it was tricky It is up one level in the building it is not well marked You need a passcode to get into the building which we didn t have the first time Having said that the room was great The service was great We would utilize it again , The room and the service was great It is just off the Champs Elysses Taxis were easy to reserve It is very private 
152511,Hotel Oscar, Hard to spot from the street Intercom was difficult to hear Once we got past the initial entry everything else was fine, Brilliant conversion of a floor of an old building to a modern boutique hotel Beautifully designed
152512,Hotel Oscar, To be fair I didn t find anything I disliked, When you first walk in you would think I ve made a mistake booking this place but once you go to the main door upstairs and you walk in then you realise what a great choice it was fantastic If your looking for a quite private hotel this is perfect for you If your looking for more busy social hotel then this wouldn t be right for you 
152513,Hotel Oscar, Cannot go in early and sit in hotel lobby Building doesn t open until you have codes or a person is at the hotel to let you in If you fly in early know when a person is at the hotel No place to wait outside Not very clear about that , Loved the location Room was very quiet Barely heard any noise Small but spaced very well Very happy I picked this hotel 
152514,Hotel Oscar, Nothing , It is Inside a lovely building very close to the Champs and within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower Very secure with three separate door entries Metro station five monte walk Very nicely decorated and very comfy bed 
152515,Hotel Oscar, The building is old and doesn t have sound proof facilities , The location is PERFECT Staffs are friendly and helpful Room is tiny but comfy Coffee machine and free apple juice are bonus 
152516,Hotel Oscar, Perhaps the code for entrance to the building will be handy to have before you visit , Almost everything Location 1 minute perhaps 50 yards away from Champs lys es The 3 roomed Hemmingway apartment we occupied was fantastic The supermarket below so convenient and Yelena and Dianne at the Hotel are Fantastic They literraly carry your bags and communicate with you even before you visit Hence communication open before visit which is very ice breaking so to speak Good work Y and D Arranged transport for us as well I will recommend this property to any one with no fear You need to go there to see what you get
152517,Hotel Oscar, I stay in the buliding that have no lift only that our problem cause we have big luggage , The location is very good the staff so nice and helpfull The room clean and the facilities complete 
152518,Hotel Oscar, I can t find any faults except that the mirror light in the bathroom wasn t working, There was a coffee machine and capsules available to use at my disposal Ironing board IPad and ample storage go my usage The TV even had English options My room was so close to the lobby directly next to it and I couldn t here anything from the room 
152519,Hotel Oscar, The room we took is in the back and you have to go through a court yard and go down and up Stair case very tight and terrible sound of machinery at night,No Positive
152520,Hotel Oscar, Nothing All was good Maybe one remark to the owner adding a small capsule of milk would be cool for the Nespresso machine , Second time I m going in this hotel and will definitively come back A few meter to Champs Elysee and the shopping area 
152521,Hotel Oscar, There was not reception after 08 30 hrs When I checked in receptionist gave me our code to open the door When we came back to hotel apartment at about 11 30 PM code was working for 1st 3rd door but it did not work for 2nd door middle door Hence we could not enter the building and have to wait long time in the cold weather No body was there to help us I had no choice except to knock the door with the hope that some one will come out and open the door Finally it exactly happened in the same way One lady came out and she opened the door by using her code then we entered in the building My family including small kids have to suffer a lot in the extreme cold weather condition We checked in at 5 00 PM and checked out at 06 00 AM early in the morning , Generally apartment was good 
152522,Hotel Oscar, Stairs to the lift were a little hard with my bags , Beautiful little place friendly staff and great location They let you choose your own pin number so you never have to worry about losing or forgetting your keys 
152523,Hotel Oscar, Access to some of the rooms is difficult , Excellent Location Excellent facilities in the rooms such as 500 TV channels Tablet Excellet WiFi Kitchenette etc
152524,Hotel Oscar,No Negative, A wonderful hotel apartment which was extremely comfortable and felt like home The staff were very nice and made us feel welcome and special right from the time we stepped in The 3 bedroom apartment we stayed in was comfortably furnished and had all amenities that we required It was in a fantastic location just off Ave Champs Elysee and also had a mini market right next door All in all this exceeded our expectations Will definitely stay there if we visit Paris again
152525,Hotel Oscar, They had no concierge service so we had to carry out our lugague on our own although the staff there did try to help us but still it was a big of a hassle , The apartment was spacious enough for the 3 of us location is just a 2 mins walk to the Champs and the hotel is so secure 
152526,Hotel Oscar, None, The location was excellent The lady at the front desk was very nice and helpful It was me and my husband and our 3 children We took the two bedroom apartment It was roomy and clean and more then we expected for Paris

152530,Hotel Oscar, There is no lobby and the reception and staff are not available 24 hours It more like an apartment building rather than a hotel , The location and the Wifi internet 
152531,Hotel Oscar, Not suitable for business travel the room does not have a desk chair for working Poor lighting dark room awful view to an inner closeted yard Complicated arrival you have to phone upon arrival for the staff to come down to open the front door It is not a hotel in the full sense it is an apartment on a first floor converted into a say first class pension Toiletries were not replenished unless requested Too expensive for the level of services you are just payment for the location Never again , Excellent situation at a stone throw of Champs Elys s and subway station Many restaurants and a very good supermarket 20 mts away Coffee tea making facilities a small fridge to keep foods utensils and a sink
