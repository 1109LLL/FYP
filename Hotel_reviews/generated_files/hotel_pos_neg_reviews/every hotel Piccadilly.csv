171202,every hotel Piccadilly, The hotel overall requires an update furniture is old and seen better days the bathroom was very small and badly stained bath i e soap scum the rooms were very dusty staff were either friendly or not attentive at all depending on shift , The location was the only great aspect of this hotel very central And the size of the rooms were decent 
171203,every hotel Piccadilly, Liked everything here Slight damp smell on the 7th floor but otherwise it was great , Very friendly staff and hotel is in an ideal location for the Westend and the sights like Big Ben etc very close by 
171204,every hotel Piccadilly, The shower wasn t very clean and the shower head came off They put it back on but water continued to spray and leak out of the top of it The toilet was oddly situated in relation to the bathroom door The doors on one of the elevators broke while I was there Then the other elevator broke They were able to fix one of the two , The central location would be hard to beat It s convenient to several tube stations The area is touristy but the convenience made it worth it My room was quiet the AC worked well and the bed was comfortable They also provided two free bottles of water and two cans of soda each day 
171205,every hotel Piccadilly, Clearly there is a problem with the maintenance and upkeep of this hotel None of the elevators were working shower heads were broken and the rooms had an old smell , Staff was very friendly however and the location was perfect 
171206,every hotel Piccadilly, The bed was not very comfortable and the sugar for the tea was so old it was solid , The location is excellent Liked that there was a fridge in the room and they left pop and water daily Staff was very nice 
171207,every hotel Piccadilly, Breakfast was good but it wasn t made clear that it wasn t included till after I was partway through the meal Still worth it though no prices were posted , Location and comfort are great Very helpful staff 
171208,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing to complain about, Good choice for breakfast cereals cheese and ham eggs sausages fresh fruits and salads three varieties of juice coffee was really nice thanks for soya milk as well fresh pastry and bread was amazing Definitelly worth the money Enjoyed the coffee from Nespresso coffee machine in my room 
171209,every hotel Piccadilly, Most of the people who worked at the reception were not as friendly as you d expect But overall it was a lovely stay , The room was very comfortable and looked quite elegant It had the look of a 5 hotel which was nice the bed had many many pillows which was glorious 
171210,every hotel Piccadilly, We stayed three nights The morning buffet breakfast was exactly the same on all three days They could have thrown in a different breakfast dish if I have to pick on something , This hotel is located where all the action is It was quiet inside but it was a party atmosphere outside Everything a traveler would need is nearby including the subway so you can come and go as you please Most of our touring was just a couple subway stops away 
171211,every hotel Piccadilly, Sofa could be more comfortable room decor was rather dull , Very comfortable Large and comfortable bed room junior suite was larger than average bathroom was large The location is of course smashing right in the middle of everything 
171212,every hotel Piccadilly, Room windows have been sealed all over Makes you somewhat uncomfortable There is no lobby , You could not ask for a better location Everything is within walking distance Friendly staff Mariana at the reception is lovely Good stable free wifi Room is supplied exceptionally generously every day 
171213,every hotel Piccadilly, Didn t like that couldn t open a window tho understand the reasons for that so felt a little claustrophobic at first Also a small lounge area in hotel would have been nice , Room size was good perfect location Very quiet no street noise but could hear people in the next room chatting coughing etc 
171214,every hotel Piccadilly, Wanted 50 for breakfast for two Walked twenty feet to Pret A Manger and saved myself 40 , The bed was huge Bigger than super king Excellent central location Great room with free soft drinks mini bar 
171215,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing, The room was exceptionally quiet even though we were looking over Leicester square The location was brilliant for the various theatres The staff were brilliant and were really helpful The breakfast was also a lot better than some more expensive hotels we had stayed in this week 
171216,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, Great location Staff were super friendly and accommodating They read my message about our visit being a special occasion So they gave us the mini bar for free wrote us a card and left cupcakes in the room 
171217,every hotel Piccadilly, Overall the hotel was lovely but not worth 265 per room per night without breakfast , Breakfast was lovely A wide selection of hot and cold items on the buffet including cereals and pastries plenty of orange juice etc 
171218,every hotel Piccadilly, When we arrived they told us hotel was over booked Big problem for us was we had booked 2 rooms and it was 12pm we had been traveling from 5am so this was disappointing to say the least The staff were less than helpful and said sorry but what can we do They offered to try and get us another room at Marble Arch So two different hotels for my collegue and I Shambles and poorest customer service I have every experienced Having tried 9 other hotels in the area we eventually had no choice but to take a room with a double bed and bunk up for the night We had to fight for an hour to seek discount but this was not being offered so we took the stance we didn t want to pay anything because of the complete lack of care Eventually they agreed to this which was something but just a shambles all round Very disappointing as nice accommodation in a great location , good location
171219,every hotel Piccadilly, The price, The room was super basic for a ridiculously over priced hotel Extremely expensive I was expecting to be in a luxury hotel at that rate Otherwise the staff was very nice and helpful and the location simply amazing But still the price is not right for such as basic place 
171220,every hotel Piccadilly, we came back at 13 15 and the room was nt clean yet their was no roon to open suitcases , the hotel is very near the station and we could walk everywhere easy 
171221,every hotel Piccadilly, Location hard to find from Coventry Street signage could be better, Easy access Location close to all the action Great sound proofing Warm and cosy Free wifi
171222,every hotel Piccadilly, I realise that this is personal preference the bed was huge but the mattress was very hard uncomfortable , Brilliant location easy walking to theatres restaurants bars Friendly helpful staff A good selection for breakfast cooked or continental great being able to have a later breakfast up to 10 30 am you can have a lie in Everywhere was kept spotless every day Would certainly recommend
171223,every hotel Piccadilly, Only one set of towels for two of us No information manual , Staff we met friendly and attentive Room was clean facilities and bed comfort good We both slept well no drink and nearly missed kicking out time Would stay here again definitely 
171224,every hotel Piccadilly, I would have loved the opportunity to relax in a spa hot tub in the evening after walking around London all day, The staff were so helpful and the beds and showers excellent 
171225,every hotel Piccadilly, A locked door basically divides my room to the room next side hence the noise can seep through , The room service the cleanliness The location The reception
171226,every hotel Piccadilly, Nil, The hotel is easy accessible walking distance to the bus stop and train station The room is comfortable and spacious I enjoyed the coffee from the in room coffee machine too

171228,every hotel Piccadilly, minibar items include only water and soft drinks but they are free , Excellent location on Leicester square modern furniture and equipment great value for money 
171229,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, The hotel honoured my request for a room with a view Room was spotlessly clean and contained all amenities for a great stay Breakfast was plentiful and tasty wide choice All staff were polite and helpful A credit to the Hotel 
171230,every hotel Piccadilly, too long checking in the lady at the long blond hair which trains but she lost and extends expectation could not change the data in the invoice acquitted incorrect despite the fact that on booking com were given correct , great location very clean big nice room I recommend
171231,every hotel Piccadilly, Pavement being replace outside the hotel entrance although that s not the hotels fault, I was offered a choice of a room with a view but would overlook the busy street or a quiet room Being in the middle of Piccadilly Leicester Sq
171232,every hotel Piccadilly, I disliked everything generally about this hotel First of all the photos on booking com were very misleading This is not a 4 class hotel I would rate it as a 2 class hotel It was absolutely poor value for money , I didn t like anything in particular about this hotel 
171233,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, this hotel was perfect location for theatre shows very comfortable clean room shower excellent and very helpful staff couldn t ask for better only minor problem it was more expensive than other hotels but you get what you pay for your location enjoyed our stay
171234,every hotel Piccadilly, I didn t like the fact that they took the full amount in pound out of our account twice on departure Then we had to wait 6 days to get it back Then the blame game started with them saying it was my bank holding the money We should never have been charged twice in the first place I know who was left out of pocket and it wasn t them ,No Positive
171235,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, Location was fantastic Just a lovely walk up Regent Street to Oxford Street and then next day lovely walk to Covent Garden Less than a minutes walk to Prince of Wales Theatre
171236,every hotel Piccadilly, softer pillows would have made the stay perfect , The room layout and size was excellent very pleasant surprise for a central London hotel The location couldn t have been better for walking everywhere central 
171237,every hotel Piccadilly, Not much to not like Price is high but then that is fair enough given the location and the rooms were average size wise but very quiet and more than adequate bed comfy and very clean , Location was spot on for what we wanted We had trips to Cafe De Paris and Her Majesty s Theatre and these were literally yards away Covent Garden Oxford St China Town Leicester SQ Regent St were again yards away We never had to catch the tube once in the whole 3 days we were there Awesome location 
171238,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, The staff were both friendly and professional The room was comfortable and clean Great location I would stay here again A member of staff left with us at 5 15 am to help us to get a taxi quickly as we hadnt asked to book one this was so kind as we had to go to Victoria for the Gatwick express The staff just seemed genuinely very nice 
171239,every hotel Piccadilly, No heating in the bathroom whatsoever so everything was cold in there notably the tiled floor the towels cold not possible to dry Were told the aircon in the room which was excellent would warm the bathroom but this didn t happen A serious put off for the next visit to London as we would book elsewhere A warm bathroom these days is a must ,No Positive
171240,every hotel Piccadilly, In the evening prior to my departure I have asked the front desk to settle my account since I was checking out in the middle of the night I was told by the reception staff including the shift leader it could not be done When I checked out in the middle of the night the clerk could not issue the invoice as he was in the middle of the night process It is either they are using a very old software program or they could not do a very basic thing wich is done in any hotel , The location could not be better Between Leicester sq to Piccadilly a minute from china town and the SoHo In minutes walk were theaters lots of restaurants and the underground The hotel was extremely comfortable and clean Staff were nice not always efficient I did not have breakfast at the hotel but there were lots of cafes around 
171241,every hotel Piccadilly, We were unable to contact the hotel over the phone prior to our stay The standard bedroom is very small and crowded especially for this high price the room we were assigned to on the 6th floor had a very awkward window and was unpleasant We were offered a new room at once which was much more pleasant , Great service hotel staff was very gracious We especially like to thank Elizabeth for her help during our stay 
171242,every hotel Piccadilly, I thought it was a bit pricey but I suppose it s because of location , The bed was massive and comfortable and the shower was nice and powerful also the location was spot on for us for what we wanted to do 
171243,every hotel Piccadilly, The noise from the hallway lights seemed oddly loud but I may just be sensitive Next time I will bring earplugs , Excellent location with a lovely sized room All extra amenities provided such as hairdryer and iron ironing board which were very useful The WiFi had good signal strength and was easy to connect too The TV in the room had plenty of channels so it wasn t difficult to find something to watch before bed The bathroom had plenty of towels and the shower has two options a huge head on the roof that felt like rain falling and a smaller hand held shower head both of which were simple to use The bed was spacious and comfy with plenty of pillows provided Breakfast had plenty of options and there is a tv to watch the morning news The staff were very pleasant and attentive Over all I was happy with my stay and will definitely stay there again 
171244,every hotel Piccadilly, Hotel itself I can t fault wifi was free that was great but felt like it was rele slow but i think because there was no password protect they cant stop people in the costa logging on where so many people on it slows it down , Friendly service nice people who go the extra mile for you Room was small but cozy small not tight small Love how close the attractions was from the hotel 
171245,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing this was our second stay , Great location easy walking distance for the West End sights and theatres near to both Piccadilly and Leicester Square Tube stations Staff welcoming and helpful Bed very comfortable and room very quiet great nights sleep Nespresso Machine kettle with tea and coffee plus bottled water and soft drinks included in room rate Buffet breakfast available but we did not try it 
171246,every hotel Piccadilly, Very small room without any room to put your suitcase or even toiletries in the bathroom We were misinformed about the inclusion of breakfast in the price Eating breakfast outside the hotel came to ca 5 per person per day vs the 12 charged by the hotel , Comfortable bed quiet room as we had requested Superb location without any noise nuisance even on Friday or Saturday night 
171247,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing to complain about, Staff were very polite room was a great size for central London Was given a voucher for a free drink at the bar on arrival I asked for a room with a view and was given a front facing room Was worried that being near the lifts would be noisy but didn t hear another person all night Amazing location and value for money If I m out in London again I wouldn t hesitate to book again 
171248,every hotel Piccadilly, The room was a great size but i felt that it could have had a better view we could see pipes etc from out of our windows , The hotel was lovely well situated if your wanting to be in the centre of the action near Leicester Square It was clean and tidy also the bed wasn t too hard 
171249,every hotel Piccadilly, The plug in bath was rusty and difficult to use But this wS a minor problem , Room fantastic bed extremely comfortable and facilities great We felt very welcomed from the moment we got there until we left Thank you especially to Mohammed who couldn t do enough for us 
171250,every hotel Piccadilly, Small room very cold bathroom bed was uncomfortable noisy The rates are overpriced and don t really match the quality of the hotel , Location in the middle of the theater district and soho Walking distance to two underground stations 
171251,every hotel Piccadilly, I had to ask a few times for tea bags and sugar very spearing in this area especially when you consider the price of the room , Very helpful staff we were able to have our room at 11 30 am as it was ready 
171252,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and the room was comfortable and clean Hotel was very central to most theatres Enjoyed our stay there Would book again 
171253,every hotel Piccadilly, The room was extremely hot and even turning down the heating didn t help The pillows were not very comfortable using one was too soft and using two too high I ripped my coat while out so a mini sewing kit would have been handy if there was one in the room, Excellent location very quiet rooms despite being right in the middle of everything handy little Costa right next door too
171254,every hotel Piccadilly, Our stay was shadowed with disaster from the moment we walked over the doorstep and we will certainly never return after the way we were treated In summary the management overbooked the hotel and our booking which had been made several weeks earlier could not be honoured On arriving at the hotel late on a Saturday evening my parents and I were booked into two separate rooms we were informed that only one room was available The hotel didn t seem to think that it would have been more appropriate to inform us of this mess earlier but only on our arrival whereupon they frantically tried to find an alternative room in other hotels in random parts of London I ll leave it to you dear reader to imagine how successful they were in finding suitable alternatives at 10pm on a Saturday night in London After much arguing in the hotel lobby we reluctantly agreed to have an extra bed placed in the one room that was available and the three of us stayed there for the first night at gross inconvenience to the three of us the three of us are all adults The following day we were provided with the second room as booked The most incredible part was that the management initially offered a 50 discount for the first night to make up for their mess I insisted on a 100 discount given that they had not honoured their side of the booking contract and were therefore bound to offer a full refund The following day I was informed that this request had been accepted All fine I thought at that point They ve solved it and we can consider the matter closed Not quite On checking out after the 4th night the management actually had the cheek to let us know that the 100 discount was being given on the room that was not actually provided on the first night and not on the room where we had stayed for the first night Incredulous , The hotel is clean and located in an extremely central location 
171255,every hotel Piccadilly, The staff are not brilliant precisely They were not clear if I had the breakfast included I went to the breakfast area and they told they thought it was not included in my room so I said it was fine and was about to leave but then they made a call to check and told me that everything was fine not precising what that everything was I asked Are you sure and they said Yes I thought it was included and had breakfast Then when I did the check out they told me I had to pay the breakfast That everything they checked was that I had a credit card so they could guarantee I would pay later but they forgot to mention that I explained the situation at the reception deck and they said they were sorry for the misunderstanding but I had to pay anyway 12 pounds for a quite bad and limited breakfast I will not recommend at all , The location was good 
171256,every hotel Piccadilly, The breakfast was a bit expensive and not many foods to choose from , Located in the heart of Leicester Square Near all attractions 4 minute walk from National Gallery Two subway stations nearby Near Soho and Ox Street Amazing location for theatre lovers All theaters are just 5 minutes away Hotel was clean and room was spacious The staff was friendly and the bottles in the fridge were free of charge Highly recommended 
171257,every hotel Piccadilly, Could do with some information on how to work heating and coffee machine Bathroom was small , Fantastic position Was visiting London with my daughter to celebrate her 13th birthday the hotel provided a wonderful cake for her on arrival in our room which really made her day Would definitely stay here again 
171258,every hotel Piccadilly, All the very bright lights were placed just above the mirrors making it difficult to do you makeup or see your outfit in natural looking lighting as a harsh shadow was constantly cast over your face body , The location was great and the windows had good views
171259,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, Could not have been a better location right off of Lancaster Square Very quiet on upper floors and wonderful views Windows do not open so they can control the noise but have a wonderful strong air conditioning system in every room Restaurants and bars galore safe area walk to all of Covent Garden so ho and of course Piccadilly Circus restaurants and theaters 
171260,every hotel Piccadilly, Would have liked more variety in the restaurant menu Thought it very expensive for what was offered , The staff were excellent especially David the Concierge and Agnello But overall everyone I dealt with were very helpful The location was excellent for myself and my granddaughter to get around on foot without having to rely on cabs and the tube 
171261,every hotel Piccadilly, Would be nice to have room service option especially for breakfast Also there was no in room directory information booklet with list of facilities i e air heating and how it works TV guide usually you get a booklet in hotels to let you know how everything works , Bed was really comfy nice big room for central London and great complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar 
171262,every hotel Piccadilly, No decaffeinated coffee either in the room or as an option on the coffee machine , Breakfast was delicious Despite being a buffet it was all hot and fresh tasting and was constantly topped up The staff were attentive and helpful 
171263,every hotel Piccadilly, The sound proof screens need a sticker hairdryer in our room was broken, Quiet friendly staff let us check in early good breakfast good wifi perfect location
171264,every hotel Piccadilly, Room 103 was on first floor It did its job but was quite claustrophobic due to not being able to open window that backed onto utility yard We could also feel the rumble of the underground intermittently throughout the night None of the above caused too much problems but I would request a room higher up next time Our room was clean but the communal hall ways and stairs should be monitored more frequently , Excellent location and staff Good choices for breakfast Clean comfortable room
171265,every hotel Piccadilly, Room 404 is an excellent size room and very quiet although the toilet plumbing was woeful Also the view from the window was of an ugly alley, David the Concierge was very helpful as was Agnello on the front desk 
171266,every hotel Piccadilly, We cannot find any faults so why try to find fault when we had a lovely stay , As soon as we arrived we were offered a room upgrade which was a very pleasant surprise Our welcome was very friendly and made us feel welcomed The Staff were all very friendly efficient and able Our upgrade was very comfortable and the housekeeping was excellent Hotel location is excellent for the West End and as we had read before the lifts were very quick We will visit this Hotel again happily 
171267,every hotel Piccadilly, Breakfast is not includeed in booking fee Lobby is very small but you can keep baggage , Very nice Location Perfect only 1 mins from Chinatown 18mins from Buckingham Palace 5mins from National Gallery 5mins from SoHo 15mins from British Museum 1 mins from Pret a Manger Burgerking 5 mins from Mcdonald s Cozy Room Nice facilites Various teas Capsule Coffee machine Good bathroom Breakfast is deliciou Workout room available Complimentary bottle of water Room is silent
171268,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing all fine, Location location location Have stayed here before Ideal for shopping china town a few steps away and the shows are on your doorstep 
171269,every hotel Piccadilly, Bar service and restrurant service slow and staff seemed to have to be reminded of if I wanted a drink or not given change when they ran out, Staff at main reception were excellent and very helpful bed and view from room good plus room service also excellent 
171270,every hotel Piccadilly, We liked everything, Welcome at reception Cleanlinessof room and public sreas positive friendly attitude of staff Good breakfast Central location but peaceful quiet inside 
171271,every hotel Piccadilly, We had junior suite that includes free mini bar use but in two days we had to contact staff that they come fill beers and whitewines Explanation was that they need supervisors premission for alcohol filling a little strange , Offcourse location is great easy to come with underground from airport Clean and peacefull room even to be so close center We will come back in next visit also 
171272,every hotel Piccadilly, There was a smell on the floor we were on when we complained and they could not fix it they gave us upgraded room on another floor and breakfast on the house that is service , The staff went out of their way to help and assist us terrific bunch of people Breakfast was also nice and fresh everyday Would go back there anytime 
171273,every hotel Piccadilly, If I can be precise and to the Poiint No Loo Brushes to clean the Toilet which was a little embarrassing Also the Location is not on Coventry Road as thought Plus the Postcode is a little confusing Better Location pointers, Everything
171274,every hotel Piccadilly, The hotel was a little more expensive than we would normally pay but I suppose that s because of the location, Great location friendly and helpful staff comfortable room
171275,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, We booked in because of the high quality wifi at this hotel We needed to have a midnight video meeting with a different time zone The staff we re friendly and helpful 
171276,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing but it s pricey, Location is amazing large room with comfortable king bed and free mini bar Our room facing busy street but the noise isolation windows did wonderful job 
171277,every hotel Piccadilly, I think that breakfast should have been included in the price Bar should be located where costa coffee is , Excellent location staff always very helpful and polite Rooms were lovely and clean Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends 
171278,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, We liked everything about this hotel the professionalism of the staff the comfort of the room the fantastic shower quick lift and to top it all off it was central to everything Every Hotel is now our London Hotel 
171279,every hotel Piccadilly, room too small and window can not be opened the air becomes rather unpleasant especially with an all over cleaning desinfecting odor of the whole house Also a bit worrying that sometimes no one is at the reception and anyone can freely get in , breakfast ok location excellent
171280,every hotel Piccadilly, Housekeeping didn t come until 4 pm we were already back to get dressed for the theatre by then Carpets weren t that clean The hotel is nice but not worth the price, Great location Friendly staff Didn t charge extra for receiving parcels Free wifi There s a Costa right next door The mini bar was free of cost
171281,every hotel Piccadilly, Flies We complained to the reception staff about the ongoing presence of flies in our room Unfortunately the issue was never resolved , Excellent location and friendly staff 
171282,every hotel Piccadilly, Other than the general comment that London rooms are expensive and generally small this hotel was fine, Good position Room small but ok Good shower and nice to have free drinks in the room Quiet which was surprising Goodnights sleep 
171283,every hotel Piccadilly, Service horrible pas aimables ils entrent dans la chambre ou frappent meme avec le do not disturb chambres tres bruyantes et odeurs dans la salle de bain awful serice at this hotel really noisy you can ear the coffee machine from your neighbours and also what they do in their bed the bathroom smells awful the crew knock at your door anytime even when you put the do not disturb and they also enter to your room even if you mention do no disturb and nothing to fix all of that ,No Positive
171284,every hotel Piccadilly, Everything was excellent, Amazing location terrific amenities like good AC and elevators complementary soft drinks and the staff was outstanding especially Mohammed 
171285,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing, Brilliant location and everything you need in one place hotel staff absolutely brilliant they even left beautiful flowers 2 cakes and birthday card for my wife s birthday stay thankyou very much we hope to stay again in the future 
171286,every hotel Piccadilly, I would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room some complimentary biscuits more choice in the mini bar I didn t like the nespresso machine as didn t know how to use it and it didn t come with any instructions I didn t like the view out of our window it was basically a brick wall I didn t like how warm the room was and that the aircon needed to be on all night The mattress on the bed was lumpy and not very comfortable For 228 a night I could probably have stayed at a more luxurious property out of the city and travelled in , The only thing I liked about this hotel was it was clean and it was a central location 
171287,every hotel Piccadilly, Room did not have any drawers to store the clothes not even a single drawer We had to actually leaved out from our suitcases for four days Room is very small even by European standards We were hardly walk around our suitcases which were used as the closet We are traveling often on the cruise ships and this room is even smaller and less covinient than standard cruise cabin , Location is great Extremely pleasent and helpful front desk stuff 
171288,every hotel Piccadilly, Poor quantity and choice in the mini bar Would have liked a heated towel rail , Loved the superb rainfall shower Nice comfortable bed Great location for sight seeing nightlife 
171289,every hotel Piccadilly, The breakfast was poor quality and expensive , The situation is central for all Very appealing decor spotlessly clean staff were lovely very accommodating on all aspects 
171290,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, I loved this hotel spacious clean modern A beautiful space all around with a fabulous staff If you are looking for a beautiful quiet space to stay but want to be in the heart of it all this is a great choice 
171291,every hotel Piccadilly, The only problem I would have with this hotel is the poor lighting in the bathroom by the mirrors You can never put on your makeup properly because the light is situated in such a terrible way that when you stand in front of the mirror the lighting is behind you and there are tons of shadows on your face , The location of the hotel is excellent for those that want a place with walking distance to all the attractions restaurants and theatre shows The hotel is very clean the linens are washed and changed everyday the cleaning staff is always on time to clean and are very professional They clean and pack your stuff away making you feel comfortable and at home the room is sound proof and the bed is large and comfortable I love the layout of the hotel and the interior design It is modern but also still gives you that feeling of Britain 
171292,every hotel Piccadilly, Rooms are tiny even though we paid extra for a deluxe room The toilet was broken Special requirements weren t met at all Very disappointed , Good location
171293,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, The location is superb for restraunts theatres and nightlife and also fun things for children Has Tesco and Boots nearby All walking distance The hotel staff are very friendly and nice 
171294,every hotel Piccadilly, Not what we didn t like really mYbe more of a suggestion a biscuit with welcome tray, I booked this hotel as was central London excellent location Leicester Square this hotel was perfect my mum and I were made extremely welcome The rooms were lovely comfy beds and we had a wonderful stay
171295,every hotel Piccadilly, Gym facilities are pretty poor I know space is premium but its a treadmill x trainer and stepper maybe a rower as well and a few low weight dumbbells but no real room to use them unless you re the only person in the room, Location was perfect very central and noise from the street was not as bad as I thought it would be Room was also a good size for a central London Hotel Bottles water was also a plus Staff were excellent and friendly 
171296,every hotel Piccadilly, The service wasn t always great I waited alone at the front desk for 15 minutes before someone showed up to check me in The bar restaurant wasn t very organized either Also a little pricy but worth it for the location, Excellent location right in the center of everything you want to see in London Great rooms very stylish and clean 
171297,every hotel Piccadilly, None, thats s fantastic good location in the london centre near the station China Town piccadilly street u can easy to go everywhere And the accomodation clean tidy size bigger than another same hotel U can see the london eye through the window at night The staff are lovely everything makes me feel so convenient So good

171299,every hotel Piccadilly, nothing best hotels so far in the area xx, well the location was the best as near to great places to visit and best club scene too as well am going back soon though not yet best hotel for city lovers the staff are best and wonderful got a free upgrade as it was my 1st visit tbh xxx
171300,every hotel Piccadilly, poor sound proofing between rooms We could literately hear the people in the next room breath Rooms are quite small functional but small , excellent location modern clean hotel 
171301,every hotel Piccadilly, Although the dining room was nicely decorated it had no windows but I suppose it s central London so I think that they ve had to be clever with a smaller space, I really liked that they upgraded my room to a king sized double and it had a good view many thanks indeed
171302,every hotel Piccadilly, Didn t know there was a gym if I d known I d have packed my PE kit , Comfy room with air conditioning that worked so it wasn t too warm Walking out of the hotel and walking straight into Leicester Square was ace Free mini fridge with water and cola 
171303,every hotel Piccadilly, No complaints at all , The staff on the reception were excellent I must give a special mention to Samuel who is a credit to your hotel he really made us feel welcome The breakfast was very good and worth the money 
171304,every hotel Piccadilly, This is former Holiday Inn hotel and therefor it is just ok The lobby is insignificance Didn t have breakfast at the hotel , Location location Close to West end district the excellent restaurants on Wardour st walking distance to the Covent Garden Oxford st 
171305,every hotel Piccadilly, Garbage bin in the bathroom was not empty when we were checked in We said this to the reception staff they apologized lots of times and problem solved only within a few minutes I know that it was nothing but an accidental mistake This kind of person related mistakes may happen all the time but the most important thing is the action of the management after they learned the issue In this case that action was excellent , This was my second stay at this hotel after 2 years Still very very good Location is unbeatable In the middle of London where thousands of people in the streets 24 7 but you hear nothing inside the rooms Walking distance to main day night attractions Complimentary soft drinks are also a great bonus Definitely recommended

171311,every hotel Piccadilly, Reception staff didn t seem to know what they were doing we were told two different things from two different members of staff Allocated a room eventually but then house keeping let themselves into the room whilst we were present to check it as they were told the room was empty Poor communication between staff and us the customer however we were given a bottle of prosecco by way of an apology , Comfy bed and pillows room clean and tidy

171314,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, Fantastic location less than 5 mins walk to Harold Pinter theatre Comfortable quiet room with large shower freeview TV Nespresso machine free bottled water and Coke in mini bar so can use as fridge Didn t eat there as so many places nearby particularly as so close to Covent Garden Stayed one night would stay again particularly with discounted price 
171315,every hotel Piccadilly, the bar was not a comfortable place to have a drink sat on tables and chairs that are set out for breakfast is not the most comfortable or inviting place hence most of the time it was empty , good location
171316,every hotel Piccadilly, Well I ve got to be honest the room I had was above the kebab shop and on arrival back to my room the smell was discusting because it was late I didn t complain and because the staffing reception was nice I didn t have the heart to complain, Breakfast was really good can t say we did much else in the hotel as we was at a show

171323,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing we didn t like Wanted to stay longer, Comfy bed helpful friendly staff Asked for extra nespresso pods and milk at midnight it was delivered to our room within 10 mins Wonderfully quiet room would never have believed it could be that quiet in London Perfect two day break
171324,every hotel Piccadilly, The above, The staff hotel location service was great But we had a large stain of dry blood on our quilt cover which was really disappointing However it was dealt with quickly when i told reception It was so obvious to see i don t know why it wasn t seen when room was cleaned before we arrived 
171325,every hotel Piccadilly, Poor gluten free choices and knowledge of staff We essentially paid 12 for a couple of pieces of bread and a cup of tea for my coeliac wife s breakfast Also the bacon was on the turn , Cleanliness was superb Location couldn t have been better 
171326,every hotel Piccadilly, The walls were dinged and dirty Carpet looked dirty The free Wi Fi has an annoying login page that will kill whatever you had open in the tab when you re connect There s an HDMI port so you can connect your laptop to the TV but no HDMI cable provided in the room do ask anyway The bed was clean but relatively stiff Thin walls could hear the neighbors having a conversation , Central location in London s SOHO very quick to go out on the town or come back after a night of merriment Good breakfast though not included in the over price Nice rainfall shower Quiet area no noise from the outside 
171327,every hotel Piccadilly, The Hotel bar was underground and quite soulless Returning after our show we wanted a nightcap but bar was closed and were told we could have coffee from the machine in our room We were a family group of 8 and because we couldn t have even a coffee in the bar and didn t want to all congregate into one bedroom meant we were wandering around trying to find a coffee house bar open with tables for our group As it happened we ended up in a tiny bakery with seating for the ladies only Not pleasant having to wander amongst the young clubbers and drunks when the hotel could have supplied a drink for their residents , Location fantastic and staff very friendly Worried about noise because of location but needn t have The double glazing was fantastic and could only hear very loud noises such as sirens Bed comfortable roomy bedrooms and bathroom lovely with very roomy rainfall shower cubicle Coffee machine a nice touch Faultless bedroom

171331,every hotel Piccadilly, Breakfast was Ok apart from coffee machine running out of water but that got seen to There isn t much point in going over the top with expectations when the place is surrounded by eateries of varying quality You are in the middle of Leicester Square after all What was on offer hit the spot though , Location staff were friendly and courteous place was clean bathroom was well equipped and shower excellent Despite being in Central London there wasn t much noise which was good

171339,every hotel Piccadilly, Our room was supposed to be ready for 3pm however when we arrived we were told the room wasn t quite ready which was fine because we arrived early We headed out for half an hour and went back to the hotel expecting our room to be ready which it wasn t so we were told to head down to the restaurant and had a drink and would be called when the room was ready We then headed back to the reception at 4pm and we re told the room was now ready The week before I had phoned the hotel to ask them if they could decorate the room as I was going to propose to my girlfriend the room was decorated which was nice but the staff had left a card addressed to Mr and Mrs Spence which I thought was a bit presumptious and upset my girlfriend My plan was to propose at a restaurant which I had booked for 5 30pm but as the room wasn t ready until 4pm I had to cancel the table As you can imagine I was very disappointed and told the staff oh what had happened They asked me if I had proposed I said no its all gone a little flat now all the staff offered me was a free dinner which I accepted but wasn t happy with the solution I would like more in the way of compensation because I feel my weekend was ruined by the inability of the staff to 1 get the room ready in time and 2 to not correctly listen to my request Very disappointed with the service is an understatement To make matters worse I had to postpone the engagement , The hotel was in an excellent location and was very comfortable The food was ok
171340,every hotel Piccadilly, The staff did not explain that if we didn t like the room we could ask for a room change which did not incur extra charges like a room upgrade Our window looked out onto a brick wall making the room dark and claustrophobic , The location was excellent for so many interests

171344,every hotel Piccadilly, No bad experience, The location is perfect for shopping finding a restaurant whatever your favorite cooking is going to theatres or museums just by walking or simply enjoying a beer in Soho The staff is a really competent and professional team always ready and willing to help you with a smile The room was rather large quiet and comfortable Excellent bedding WIFI works very well We will return to this hotel for our next stay in London

171352,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing Everything just perfect , One of the best locations in London very helpful and smiling personnel especially the restaurant personnel Rooms are big and very quite Very clean hotel 
171353,every hotel Piccadilly, Nothing at all , I am impressed about this hotel on a lot of areas excellent location which is just few steps to the piccadily circus station which has a direct line to and from healthrow airport and close to a lot of tourist areas in London room was of decent size and staff were really friendly and accommodating But what im truly impressed about was that we arrived before 9am and we re allowed to checkin early as per my request 
171354,every hotel Piccadilly,No Negative, The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming We travelled with my elderly parents and requested rooms close together close to lifts and on lower floors and all 3 needs were met The staff couldn t do enough for you They are the real credit of the hotel The location is right in the thick of it between Piccadilly and Leicester Square and close to taxi ranks and tube The rooms are comfortable and quite spacious for central London and clean Coffee machines in the rooms and the complimentary fridge is a fantastic idea really appreciated that touch Breakfast was great plenty of it and delicious and catered for all Overall couldn t fault it It was quite expensive but worth it for the comfort location and the excellent staff

171359,every hotel Piccadilly, I was surprised at being charged about 45 29pounds sterling for one local phone call lasting 15 minutes I made from the room s phone to a London friend When I questioned the charge at check out I was told that the rate was correct even for this completely local city call because the charge was per minute and explained on the smart TV hotel info I had not turned on the TV to do the research and the desk had not had the courtesy to warn me of this charge when I asked them at check in about making local calls they had only said everything about the hotel is explained on the smart TV There was no card or sheet explaining anything about the phone in the room itself so beware Asking generally was not enough to elicit a warning about this exorbitant charge Also when I asked about finding an early morning cab to take me to Paddington station to catch the Express Train to Heathrow the desk called a cab to negotiate a fare to Heathrow itself from the cab Do not fall for this I did not Cab plus train to Heathrow is half the price of a cab ride to Heathrow even a negotiated one and the train from Paddington is very easy and takes only 15 minutes I was happy not to have purchased the 12 pound breakfast offered at check in as this is served in a windowless basement room and there are plenty of lovely and less expensive breakfasts available everywhere just outside this hotel There is a huge construction site for a large building going up on the block immediately in front of the hotel s door so no cabs can drive you in further than a block away My 7th floor room was quiet at night as building goes up further views will be blocked I still had a view , This hotel has a very central city location close to many theaters and museums and therefore walking distance to most places that interested me on this trip The staff is international multilingual and businesslike but may not go out of their way to protect your interests
