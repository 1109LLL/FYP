178267,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Difficult transport from international train station , The staff were very efficient knowledgable and friendly The hotel bed and linen were first class and the bathroom was very modern and functional 
178268,Hotel Park Lane Paris, the breakfast not a lot of choice im a vegetarian lots of sausages bacon and cold meats although this suited the rest of my party, staff frendly very clean and comfortable good value for money
178269,Hotel Park Lane Paris,No Negative, The staff were very friendly We thought the location was perfect for us Close to the train stations we needed and a 35 minute walk to Eiffel Tower Arc De Triumph and there were many restaurants nearby 
178270,Hotel Park Lane Paris,No Negative, Great breakfast and the service of the guy handling the breakfast room was excellent The location is very good and also the metro station st augustin is very close
178271,Hotel Park Lane Paris, The waiter serving the breakfast We were total of 7 people When we got down for breakfast at 9 30pm the bread was almost finished I asked him to get more bread as it would not be enough for the group of us To this he started telling me that there were many people come for the breakfast earlier in the morning and all the bread was finished and as it was Sunday he cannot get any more he was raising his hands and my wife heard him saying to the manager these Pakistani people are making noise He was the one making all the noise while I only told him that it was not our problem that they were short of an important ingredient of the breakfast Once the manager came down more bread magically appeared The manager was very nice and helpful Honestly we didn t need any of this in the morning This chap is bringing down a nice hotel and he should be thought how to behave and at least have the decency of not passing racist remarks within the earshot of guests, The reception staff was very friendly and helpful in every way location is good there is a supermarket across the road
178272,Hotel Park Lane Paris,No Negative, Excellent hotel in a great location Only a few minuets walk from lots of attractions easily found using the FourSquare App Would highly recommend this hotel and ai dont say that lightly
178273,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Everything was fine Due to sickness we spent extra time in the Reception area prior to leaving Nobody queried us and when we apologised for the longtime spent in the area They were understanding , Yes Breakfast good and nice dining area Room fine a little small but very clean 
178274,Hotel Park Lane Paris, More coffee pods would have been nice , Breakfast was great value A good choice of food You can eat as much as you want The hotel is situated in a great place very close to the metro You can buy a day pass for zones 1 and 2 These are the lines to see all the major attractions All the staff were very nice and helpful nothing was too much trouble We loved our room and the bed as long as you like firm beds would definitely recommend 
178275,Hotel Park Lane Paris, The scrambled eggs tasted very strange Only 2 coffee pods for the coffee machine without whitener , The beds were really comfy and you get 2 pillows Usually you get one mediocre flat one The room was clean and from our window you could see the top of the Eiffel Tower The breakfast was good with quite good choice We would stay there again Nice toiletries
178276,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Everything was great No improvements are necessary , We stayed for 3 days and the reception staff Abdul Michael and Maria were always friendly and went out of their way to assist with our enquiries and requests The location was great for us and the areas we wanted to explore The room was very clean tidy and the bed was very comfortable The cleaner did an excellent job with daily cleaning Breakfasts were of a high quality with ample options available The man assisting with breakfasts was always cheerful and helpful Thanks to Louis for welcoming us and his assistance on our first day We would certainly stay again 
178277,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Very poor selection in bar , Ideal location for shopping and access to the Metro Very good Bar Restaurant 2 minutes walk away Very friendly staff Comfortable bed Good choice for breakfast 
178278,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Location on rather busy street Breakfast room in the basement without daylight, Friendliness and helpfulness of personnel Comfort of bed slippers and robes Size of the hotel not too large 
178279,Hotel Park Lane Paris, I had to wait for about an hour after the check in time of 15 00 for my room to be ready The staff were apologetic though The lobby and the bedrooms are fragranced too strongly not good for allergy sufferers like me The bathroom is too small , Central but quiet location friendly staff cleanliness comfortable bed
178280,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Car park was nearby and very expensive 39 50 euro day but I suppose there is nothing you can do , Excellent position to visit the city Clean and big rooms A bit disappointing the view from my room which was a Delux Double i e more expansive Espresso machine in the room and bathroom facilities Very good value for money a part from the breakfast which was expensive 17 euro per person but we didn t try since there were excellent and cheaper Boulangeries bakery nearby 
178281,Hotel Park Lane Paris,No Negative, The staff were fantastic ready to give recommendations and to go out of their way to be helpful Special mention has to go to Abdel who booked us our dinner on the Sienne which was just magnificent He also recommended a brilliant little restaurant nearby where we had some really amazing food within a 20 minute walk of a handful of sights and museums including the Louvre but also located very close to the metro for easy public transportation
178282,Hotel Park Lane Paris,No Negative, Loved the location helpful staff and the air conditioning made a real difference during a very hot weekend stay Beautifully fitted out and ambient Excellent selection of breakfast choices 
178283,Hotel Park Lane Paris, the view from my room was terrible the walls in the room were so thing you can hear everyone coming on the floor the food at the breakfast buffet was ok you can also hear the metro moving under the ground, Staff were very helpful and welcoming internet was fast the overall hotel was great and clean
178284,Hotel Park Lane Paris,No Negative, The friendliness of the staff was outstanding very helpful Rooms were very clean and well equipped and quiet which means a lot when staying in a city Public stransport bus and metro are a stones throw away 
178285,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Room was a little small , I didn t eat at the hotel No evening meal but a couple of good restaurants very close Hotel was simple but comfortable and clean Very friendly and helpful reception staff 
178286,Hotel Park Lane Paris, At first some of the front desk were a bit cold we asked for our luggage to be stored as we were going on an it of town trip prior to our booking and the front desk man said quite curtly yes but only this time The female staff Christine and the others Were more friendly and accommodating , I liked the nice breakfast buffet and the very cheerful and service oriented Staff Anton I also liked the bed and pillows very comfy
178287,Hotel Park Lane Paris,No Negative, Breakfast was good but expensive at 24 The room was very quiet but small The bed was very comfortable Access to metro and all of Paris was easy Very attentive staff 
178288,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Nothing, The room was small but had been recently redone and had a large bathroom It was quiet warm and comfortable The service was excellent from reception to the maid service They were all courteous helpful and friendly This hotel has a four star rating but I have stayed in five star hotels that were not as nice The neighborhood in Paris is the 8th one of the best and located in St Augustin walking distance from the Madeline Opera Place de la Concorde and Champs Elysee and half a block from the metro station It was a great value and I highly recommend it 
178289,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Nothing really, We were upgraded and enjoyed a superior room which for Paris standards was really big and beautiful We were also surprised by the excellent breakfast and all staff were kind and helpful 
178290,Hotel Park Lane Paris, The first room appeared to be quite small and noisy because of the traffic outside even with widows closed The hotel manager was so nice and offered us much better room for the same price Then it was quiet and fine The blanket on the bed was very heavy not what I prefer However the beds are very good not too soft hard The wardrobe in the room was ridiculously small no place to hang all you clothes , A location is perfect we were able to walk to all the must to see places in the center The beds are comfy and WiFi is free easy to connect and fast The breakfast was included and it was OK 
178291,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Very expensive parking 40 euros a day , Breakfast Le Petit Dejeuner was very good Big assortiment fresh orange juice fresh baked eggs good coffee very nice The location was great close to the metro close to some big clubs within 1km of the hotel and some restaurants around as well The rooms are next to a big street but you can t hear a thing of it with the windows closed WiFi is okay not very fast but it works is stable and good enough for browsing The staff is very friendly helpful and especially the night porter who poured us a drink and came to sit with us for a chat 
178292,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Can t comment everything was good , What can we say except that everything was great wonderful staff Director was so nice and helpful Really got nothing wrong to say about this hotel Strongly recommend it close to all the sites and to two tube stations what else do you need for a short stay 
178293,Hotel Park Lane Paris, The breakfast is not as varied as I had anticipated It is sufficient but I did expect more variety , Although I wanted an early check in and was confirmed the request when I arrived was told that I had to wait for a while because the rooms were not ready However when I extended my stay the staff were so helpful with my requests that I forgot about early check in ordeal I would like to especially thank Maria and Osiel for the incredible customer they provided during my stay The location is superb and the hotel is kept very well I would be back if I ever needed to be in that area
178294,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Could have done with drinking water in the room Decoration could have been touched up in the odd place but minor criticism , Very comfy bed quiet nicely decorated accessible Good transport links 
178295,Hotel Park Lane Paris, After leaving the hotel I found out that the maid searched through all my belongings so perfectly that she stole money from wallet hidden in the middle of my clothes Therefore I can not recommended this hotel because the staff does not respect principles of privacy and it is impossible searched personal belongings of hotel guests , Hotel was nice and on the perfect place in the center of Paris Room was clean and large Breakfast was also good wifi was working good If I had not a bad experience with a hotel chambermaid I will rate hotel very well but

178298,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Road outside is a little noisy in rush hour but this is very minor and the windows kept most of the noise out , The room and the hotel were fantastic Location is good I cannot comment on breakfast as we did not eat in the hotel Very central with Champs Elysees about 15 mins walk and the Opera House about 10 mins away Eiffel Tower is about 40 mins on foot 
178299,Hotel Park Lane Paris, The bath didn t run so we had to use the shower to fill the bath up And the towel rack above the bath was falling apart But apart from that was a great place to stay , My life liked the food However I am gluten and dairy intolerant So was difficult to find food but once explaining to the manager He was extremely helpful and made sure the next day I had gluten free bread and dairy free milk So was extremely grateful for his efforts So well done them 
178300,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Our room smelt very strongly of cigarette smoke i asked the following day to be moved and the manager kindly moved us but sadly again another smoky room It would be nice to be able to offer customers rooms that have been smoke free ,No Positive
178301,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Nothing about the hotel It was great , Staff were very helpful Room was clean and well decorated Breakfast was good a good selection Lovely decor in main areas of hotel Used app city maps to go to navigate which really helped us get around The hotel is as central as you can get to a range of site We walked everywhere and visited Eiffel Tower arc de triomphe sacre coeur Notre dame and the louvre But we like a walk It s a stones throw from st Augustin metro stop so was easy to get to using a map we got at gare du nord Was 2 changes or one change from st lazare but that was a bit more of a walk from the hotel Recommend le cafe de la regence for dinner Good service and quite modern but not too pricey It s on trip advisor 
178302,Hotel Park Lane Paris, The floor in our bathroom disabled access wet room didn t have the best drainage so would flood, The staff were great very helpful and made great suggestions
178303,Hotel Park Lane Paris, We stayed for 2 nights and there was nothing I would change about our whole experience , The staff made us feel welcome the moment we walked through the door The room was perfect for the two of us staying for a couple of nights and the bed was one of the comfiest I think I ve ever slept on We loved this hotel 
178304,Hotel Park Lane Paris, The room is a LITTLE bit small but given the good locaton it is still highly recommended , From CDG taxi fee is fixed at 50EUR Very convenient location with multiple metro stations around and close to both Champs Elysees and Opera 
178305,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Nothing , Lovely hotel in an excellent location close to all the top sights very pleasant and helpful staff very clean room with coffee machine minibar bathroom had bath and shower room was lovely and warm as it was very cold weather we will be back 
178306,Hotel Park Lane Paris, There isn t much of a common area which is fine if you aren t planning on being in the hotel much this suited us fine as we went round the corner for coffee and brunch but glad we didn t pay for the breakfast , The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble The location is perfectly placed we had a great stroll down to the museums but it is just as easy to jump on the metro at St Augustine which is a mere 1 min walk from the hotel Bugsys was a great joint recommend the burger and gin cocktails

178309,Hotel Park Lane Paris, Although it is a very personal opinion the bed I found to be most uncomfortable with a very hard mattress which made it difficult to rest particularly well I was also disappointed to see no bar area where food could be ordered when traveling a lot for business it is sometimes nice to be able to eat in the hotel without having to find somewhere in an unfamiliar part of the city , The overall appearance of the hotel was lovely very well kept and tidy The Staff were also most helpful recommending a nearby restaurant The room was a good size and nice to have a good coffee machine in the room Great location also if there for shopping with the famous department stores very near by 
178310,Hotel Park Lane Paris, The hairdryer was in the bathroom attached to a unit The hairdryer tube broke the first time I used it When I asked for this to be sorted the tube was reinserted and not sorted so it just broke again The phone in the room didn t work There seemed to be a strange stale smoke smell in the bathroom which we reported but this was not dealt with The room was quite small Only a shower No bath The shower head could have done with a clean The service to make up the room only arrived when we got back to the hotel at 5pm that day and by that time we were already in the room before going out in the evening and given the little space in the room it would ve been too difficult to clean it around us so we just said not to bother , Free WiFi which worked consistently The staff were friendly Comfortable bed Location was away from the main tourist areas which was quite refreshing after a day amongst the busy tourist crowds
