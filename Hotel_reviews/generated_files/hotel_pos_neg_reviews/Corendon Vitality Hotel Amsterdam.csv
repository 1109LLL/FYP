267115,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Shower bath was difficult to access poor coffee making facilities kettle still had water in from previous guests additional cost of spa wasn t really value for money about 20 25 minutes tram ride from central station but good access to Amsterdam stadium No body in shower room , Friendly staff size of room breakfast Easy check in 
267116,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, WC room its cold and there is no heating system where you could put wet clothes Also shower is good but bath would be exellent , Spa smoking cabin public transport stops near bed and smart tv

267122,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Certain reception staff were not at all welcoming I may as well be dealing with a robot whereas others went out of their way to assist but the latter were in few supply Hidden city tax 0 , Food was pretty good Good variety at breakfast Reasonably priced lunch and dinner but not much variety 
267123,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, It was not possible to put things i e breakfast which was extra parking on site etc on the tab Unless you paid for that privilege This was very inconvenient if you just wanted a drink at the bar or a coffee in the lounge , The hotel was very nice with excellent facilities The restaurant was good especially the breakfast Although on the outskirts of Amsterdam it was near the 2 tram stop so there was no problem getting into the City centre and back with ease Parking at the hotel was easy My husband has to use a non motorised frame for walking and he managed it all very well 
267124,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The parking cost 20 night but no one can tell you if you can stay for 24 hours for that price which indeed would be nice , The hotel is new modern clean comfortable and the staff friendly We enjoyed the automatic check in out really easy to use Had a drink at the bar at night which is a great place to crash at the end of your day Well connected to public transportation We enjoyed our stay

267132,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The staff would not recommend any where to get food we we re gonna get a pizza but they were out also took ages to make with only one person on at a time and making massive lines then and very very expensive, Very nice place most staff were nice but the night staff were very grumpy and not pleasant to speak to as if they were emotionalises robaots
267133,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Perhaps initial instructions on how to get to the hotel could have been better we ended up paying a lot more for public transport than we needed to , The bed was extremely comfy and the room was exceptionally clean the value for money was very good Unfortunately we didn t get to use the fitness or spa facilities during our stay but I m sure they would have met the exceptional standards of the rest of the hotel 
267134,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Poor room service almost always occupied number food served in room with plastic glasses forks cards just one extra blanket available Resto a little bit expensive, Professional friendly staff Excellent and well equipped designed spa good swimming pool Very good breakfast Good restaurent

267136,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing , Very comfortable and efficient hotel I ve loved the breakfast The burgers in Cor Don restaurant are delicious Rooms are cleverly furnished nothing disturbs your comfort Hotel s location is both close to Airport and downtown 
267137,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Location was further outside the centre of dam then we would have liked It dictated how long we could spend outside of the hotel during the evenings due to the lengthy journey back to the hotel It was mine and my partners anniversary and we planned to use the spa It was expected that use of the facilities was included in the price we paid we were dissapointed to find out that it wasn t We chose this hotel because it had those facilities and so we didn t mind the distance to dam as much Had I known we were expected to pay extra for use of the pool etc I would have chosen another hotel , The bed was the comfiest hotel bed I have ever slept on The staff were very attentive and friendly The hotel is very well looked after the furniture decoration is of a high standard 
267138,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, John at the Bazar in reception was brilliant Extremely helpful cheerful greetings always checking we had what we needed and seeing if he could help Nothing was too much trouble and he always had a smile on his face John is a real asset to the Corendon hotel We also really enjoyed the Spa it was lovely and we looked forward to going at the end of a long day sight seeing We didnt have any treatments but there was plenty to enjoy without them beachroom ask staff to put the ultra violet sun tanning lights on steam room saunas pool with waterfall etc
267139,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, the fact that if you arrived a few minutes late for breakfast you weren t allowed to get any food even to eat in the lobby only after complaints did we get our breakfast ,No Positive
267140,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Female staff are arrogant and unhelpful BLOOD on our bed to begin with only to be moved to a smaller room and offered one free drink Not made to feel welcome maybe if we had a briefcase and appeared to have more money we would have been treated better, The male staff are polite and accommodating Pillows are beautiful Tv is fantastic 
267141,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I wanted to book another night but the offer wasnt valid anymore 150e a night is too much The 108 i reasonable, I already stayed here I choose it again because they gave me again an interesting offer It is cloose to public transport metro and tram and bus
267142,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The area is still being developed Feels a little run down and not where you should find a 4 star hotel , The Spa was great the rooms were clean comfy and great value The staff were really attentive and polite Felt welcomed and always got help whenever we needed it 
267143,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, hard to use public transportation AT NIGHT above 12AM Takes couple block to walk from the closest station to the hotel , big room bed really comfortable smart tv allow you to connect to your smartphone good wifi clean room will be comeback to stay here and also free tap drinking water in front of lobby hotel
267144,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, there s an ice depenser but no water depenser and this could had been useful , the bed was massive and so comfy the room was just amazing i was impressed with the blinds that go down automatically when the sun shines too bright although they make a little sound 
267145,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I asked 3 times for water it never comes on my room i asked to bring shampoo because the bottles were empty in the morning and when i come to the room in dark empty again i have to go to the reception and then they finally help me to far from the center about one hour from central station with tram NR 2 and a horrible smell at the corridors , The air conditioner and WI fee
267146,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Lots of features operated by buttons which takes take to get used to and it really is about 25 minutes ish from everything central Close to trams and trains yes but you do need to take into consideration distance , Lovely place to be Extremely modern rooms and superbly equipped Lovely staff even at 6am in the morning Really comfortable bed and super spacious compared to many other hotels Highly recommended 
267147,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, just need to have a paid airport lesser than the cab, the hotel must have airport shuttle with payment every thing else was great specially the room size and the lighting the lamp shades design are super
267148,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was perfect purchasing tickets to avoid the lines trams was less than 200m from the property paid parking directly in front of the entrance and a great restaurant I will definitely stay at this hotel again when I come back to visit Amsterdam 
267149,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The smart TV connection was not so good Wasn t connected to the internet We were two groups and requested for adjacent rooms almost 2 months earlier and it was not done , The facilities 
267150,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Ceramic mugs would have been better than paper cups in the bedroom, One of the best night s sleep ever Quiet location comfy bed good air conditioning 
267151,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Unaware of city tax and then to find out I had to by an adapator for my uk charger cable which was faulty , I loved the staff everyone was very accomadating the spa was so beautiful it was a wonderful experience 
267152,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No notification in the hotel description that there is an additional charge for use of the spa Although it is well worth the additional euros one of the best hotel spas I have been in , Excellent and friendly staff The bed and room were really comfortable It was good that the fridge was left empty apart from complimentary water so that own drinks snacks could be kept cool The hotel is in a good location outside of the city centre where it was easy to jump on the no 2 tram and then a couple of minutes walk The restaurant did look very good but I didn t have the opportunity to use it 
267153,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Everything is an extra If you want to use the pool or eat breakfast you pay for it Water was never replenished in our room Internet very slow in the rooms , Good location It s within walking distance of the Tram and Metro so it s easy to get to the airport or town centre It has One of the best breakfasts I ve ever had or even seen in a hotel there is something for everyone We didn t eat in restaurant but it looked really good 
267154,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, That you coudnt book your own taxi company The menu in resturant had little choice , Close proximity and easy tram use Cleanliness and happiness of staff 
267155,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, If the restaurant is closed they will not even provide you with a drink Were told no on more than 3 occasions The restaurant is the biggest let down , If a guest would like a real coffee not one from the machine but in real crockery then they should provide it Was very disappointing that only one member of staff from reception went to make the coffee himself for us thank goodness He is the only reason I will even go back there again It sounds silly but there are no other coffee shops that are close by so they really should not have a self service and make this special 
267156,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We tried to book a table for dinner our last night and the young man said they were to busy and tried to offer me a table for one Seeing as we where residents I was not impressed , The bed was extremely comfortable and we loved the television and the bar man was so lovely 
267157,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Only free bottles of water on first day very poor in this day and aerial even then we had to request the water Shower gel not topped up or checked very soft bed 7 out of the 9 of us didn t sleep well on them snack items there very expensive charged 5 50 for a kit Kat and packet of crisps minor things but everything else was spot on especially the staff who were amazing,No Positive
267158,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, A bit far out from the main city centre hub however it was very easy to get to via public transport tram and metro stops very close by, Fab hotel great size rooms great staff 
267159,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Leverwurst available at the bar , Clean spacious yet vibrant A smart well presented bar although they were out of leverwurst which is a Dutch bar delicacy I look forward to Nonetheless I recommend this hotel so long as you don t mind being some way out from the centre They have a good sized selection of bicycles for hire tho 
267160,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, More variety in the shop as there was no local shops as we were situated in an industrial location the staff were excellent esp onzur she was super efficient anything we wanted she organised it straight away must say staff were very very helpful pity its out in d middle of no where but sometimes it was peaceful to step outside to no hussel r bussel , The cleanliness was super the room was cold till I turned up heating as we couldn t open window the conditioner was working so it regulates room nicely 
267161,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, If in the room is tea and coffee making facilities should also be new packages every day it was not done It would require a four star hotel in a more appropriate service For example separate shower gel shampoo and body cream not only single soap dishes in the wall , Good value of location and cost The hotel was an added convenience also Spa 
267162,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, At the 24hr shop different staff would charge me different prices which was quite annoying I also think city charges should be included when you book online instead of being told I need to pay an extra 15 euro on the day, The speaker in the bathroom and the fact everything was manual
267163,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Think guests should be allowed free entry to swimming pool thought 15 euros for 20 min swim excessive so never even went to look, Location was about 5 min walk from metro all clean and tidy
267164,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is located a bit far away from the city centre but it did not take more than 20 minutes by tram 2 I think the hotel is overpriced a bit compared to Norwegian hotels in the same quality , Great hotel good breakfast and wonderful spa Nice staff 
267165,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Location is the biggest issue there is nothing around the hotel The public transport is excellent though and there s a metro stop about 100 yards from the hotel , Room were excellent clean and spacious Food in the restaurant was tasty although the choice is limited Staff were all friendly and helpful 
267166,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel room wasn t to clean and the bed was roughly made when we arrived and the bathroom floor needed to be mopped The pillow was uncomfortable , Infra red light in the bathroom
267167,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, We spent our honeymoon at the Corendon Hotel and we were extremely happy with the overall staff attentiveness this was true from the cleaning staff all the way up to the management Would highly recommend a stay here Thank you 
267168,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything Comfy bed clean room friendly staff Will definitely consider booking here again if I visit Amsterdam again Although location is not convenient it is actually very easy to get to city center within 15 mins via public transportation The tram stop is just around the corner from the hotel which is very convenient Would highly recommend this hotel if you are not the lazy I dont want to walk type 
267169,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Everything was good , The room was very comfortable and close to the tram lines The receptionists were very helpful especially Sharon who was very knowledgeable and helpful The restaurant was very convenient and the breakfast was excellent 
267170,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, the temperature of the rooms were only able to go 2 degrees up or 2 down if you d been out drinking or even walking all day you want to come back and relax in a colder room , breakfast buffet was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful 
267171,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Good for it s money very clean and convenient A bit far from the centre but tram 2 saves the day Breakfast was nice and tasty but not sure it s worth 15 eur I paid option to buy museum tickets at the reception
267172,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The options in the restaurant could have been better I had a burger 3 nights in a row as there wasn t much else to order went in for lunch one of the days thinking there would be more lunch options but just burgers or salads again Especially room service options very limited , The bed is amazing and the staff are so friendly and helpful Have stayed twice already and would definitely stay again and recommend to others
267173,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Too expensive for the location and what it has to offer , closeness to tram Out of the bustle of the city but a 20 min tram ride to city centre privacy of room was good 
267174,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, there was nothing around the hotel no bars shops walks it was surrounded by a building site It was a trek on the trams to get to and from but the trams were plentiful a shuttle bus would be a good idea the food in the restaurant was very limited and not very good which was a problem because there is no where else to go, lovely hotel excellent service room lovely clean and well looked after the kiosk was very good and the ice machine was great the staff were very helpful and efficient Amsterdam though is fantastic and we will be back soon
267175,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Noisy air conditioning which would not turn off wife got cold bed seemed to slope poor tea and coffee facilities no bathroom commodities blind kept coming noisily down poor view over a factory like installation poor restaurant only a burger bar available swimming pool and spa cost extra per head and mandatory charge for footwear room glum and depressing , Location near trams and metro 
267176,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Although getting to the city was easy it took up to 40 minutes via the metro and trams depending on where you wanted to go We did not go in the vitality spa as although we found the entry of 15 euros per person per stay reasonable you are required to wear slippers which come at an extra cost of 7 50 euros per pair This seemed a little sneaky why not include the slippers in an entry price , The rooms were a good size and the hotel was a 2 minute walk from a metro station which made getting in to the city very easy The staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English 
267177,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Plastic cups in bathroom no shower caps no lotion Otherwise very little else to complain about, Great staff breakfast excellent very comfortable location a bit industrial at the moment but great to tour in a cost effective manner trains trams within 5 minutes walk Also excellent guest relations staff to help with all queries 
267178,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Really nice accomodation friendly staff and clean room The room is up to date and also included a smart tv with Netflix Spotify etc There is a restaurant and a small bar where you can buy small food and fresh juices I would recommend this hotel to everyone 
267179,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The only main issue with this hotel is the location as it takes about half an hour on the 2 tram to get to the center Even if you re not looking to go to the center there s nothing really around this hotel as its placed pretty much on a main road The annoying thing is the two single duvets for the price you re paying and the quality of the hotel it needs to have a proper double duvet , I have just got back from a short 4 day weekend away and stayed in this lovely hotel The hotel was perfect and the rooms were clean and modern Compared to other hotels in Amsterdam the quality of this hotel was amazing I would love to stay here again if the location was different 
267180,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Long time being served at the dinner although there were only few people in the room Our simple order 2 burgers took more than 45 min to be served But the food was delicious , Clean and comfortable rooms Friendly and attentionate staff I liked the spa and the pool It was very nice to be able to relax there after a long day on foot around the busy city Very good breakfast lots of choices fresh products Very good value for money 
267181,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Hotel was very cozy clean and modern looking Staff was really nice and helpful I would go again City center was about 20 min from hotel with tram 
267182,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Not knowing you had to pay city tax when you turn up was a downfall as we thought we had paid for everything an didn t get told we had to pay tax , Staff where absolutely amazing very friendly always happy to help TV on the wall with Netflix was just a bonus of a night time to chill out an relax an absolutely loved the little smoking area outside as a non smoking hotel there is still shelter an seats for you to sit in to smoke outside loved this hotel 
267183,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, f r fr m th c ntr l f u w nt t w lk t n ght ut n ght t m t r t ft r l ng d j urn c r nd n g d , th c r nd n v r m d rn cl n nd c mf rt c n rr v w th tr n nd ju t 5 m nu t w lk 
267184,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, So sad that we had to pay 20 euros for the parking , The staff is very helpful except in the restaurant Our room was very confortable and clean Tram 2 is only 2 minutes from the hotel so we can go to the centre of Amsterdam easily in 20 minutes 
267185,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is exactly what you want the only annoying thing is it is a long tram ride in to the center of Amsterdam , The hotel is friendly and well furnished with a massive comfy bed and a smart TV 
267186,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The shower room was not properly seal so the water could leak to the dry area in front of the sink in the bathroom It s not too bad but the towel looks a bit old , Good location Just 4 min or less walk to the Henk Sneevlietweg metro station Good free WiFi Friendly staffs
267187,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast could be a little bit cheaper Everything was good , Clean and new rooms Very cheerful stuff which some of them can speak Turkish so it s a good advantage for turkish tourists There is a 7 24 shop in hotel and has good prices You can go to city centre by tram which has beautiful city view Tram station is about 300 metres far from hotel and it goes to Dam Square in 15 20 minutes 
267188,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We had a great stay Fast track checkin worked well for 1 room but we had to do the other room in person This could be improved in the future We found that the staff member at the bazaar snack desk was too busy to sell food and tour tickets at the same time It would be better to have 2 staff members to do this or have reception sell the tour tickets or even better have a concierge desk The restaurant staff needs to be more attentive for example bringing menus cutlery refilling water without having to be asked We like the late hours of the restaurant and 24 hour coffee shop , The hotel is beautiful and modern The restaurant food is fantastic We like the late hours of the restaurant and 24 hour coffee shop The tour desk is very convenient to buy entrance tickets to museums and also tram metro passes 
267189,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No complaints, Everything was of a very high standard and a bonus was the TV which had Netflix which was great for watching a movie before bed Very nice modern facilities and is only a few minutes walk to the tram and metro which is 20 minutes to city centre and 30 mins to airport
267190,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, It s far from the center The transportation is incredibly convenient but the neighborhood around the hotel has nothing to offer travelers , The bed was unbelievably comfortable and the room was very modern with a smart tv and luxury bathroom Convenient public transport to the center as well as the airport and other attractions 
267191,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing we didn t like a thoroughly enjoyable stay , The bed was amazingly comfortable The staff were very friendly Overall a really good stay at the Correndon Hotel would definitely stay again Not directly in centre but an easy 25 minute tram ride which was outside hotel along with Metro 
267192,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, couldn t get the live premierleague games on , We was upgraded at no extra Cost to the Boeing 737 Room it was an experience and a pleasure to get to stay in this room it was unbelievable the staff we couldn t thank enough 
267193,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, They just had a bottle with 2 in 1 shampoo and for body They didn t have body cream or something like this in small bottle , I like their windows it s very big and the bed was very comfortable
267194,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I missed a human welcome My check in check out was self service which I don t mind but it would be nice if the staff at least greeted you when you entered , comfy bed close to public transport I didn t try the restaurant or the gym facilities but it s nice to know that they are there
267195,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Restaurant and drinks seemed a little expensive compared to everywhere else we ate in the city centre Maybe a bit out of the way for some but we were happy to commute in and ideally located for airport connections and Amsterdam Arena if on a football trip , Huge bed and very comfortable Excellent facilities New and modern Superb spa and treatments 
267196,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing really not sure about food as didn t use the restaurant, Staff where very helpfull always on hand The bed was very comfortable and the rooms where quiet No problem sleeping Although the hotel is s little out of town there is a tram stop a 2 minute walk away that takes you straight into the city There is also a metro stop 100m away that if you go 2 stops down you can get a connecting train to the airport without going to Central Station 
267197,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The break fast was lovely couldn t wait every morning to come so that I can enjoy the lovely breakfast the staff was also helpful rooms were bigger and easy access to the tram station I really enjoyed my stay will go back again 
267198,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, One bottle of water when we arrived and nothing on the next two nights Breakfast was very busy Pillows were a bit uncomfortable , Breakfast was very good Staff were very friendly and helpful
267199,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, i booked this hotel because it had a swimming pool even though it was further out of the town It didnt mention anywhere when booking that the pool wasnt free to use you had to pay 15 euros extra which i thought was terrible We didnt use the pool, beds really comfy and staff were amazing with info rooms were brilliant and restaurant breaksfast was fab
267200,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast was overpriced and of poor quality The massages in the spa were the same The location away from town would be ok if there was any food for dinner close to the hotel As there is not and the area can be slightly dodgy at night one is often confined to room service which is limited and not worth the money To top it all off the hidden fees including a 7 Euro fee to have the room service taken to your room were outrageous Would not recommend ,No Positive
267201,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, First morning housekeeping banged on the door at 9am waking me up from a much needed rest Left room at midday and room wasn t made when I returned in the evening , Clean contemporary friendly staff 
267202,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Couldn t fault hotel or staff, The bed was huge and very comfortable Rooms extremely modern Smart TVs in rooms meant being able to use Netflix so was an added bonus
267203,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing breakfast with a Turkish touch olives cheese fresh pastry I was pleasantly surpsirse by the quality and variety of the offer I long since stopped expecting much from hotel breakfasts in the Netherlands I liked dining at the restaurant too Turkish dishes were great 
267204,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff extremely friendly and helpful and the room was clean spacious and very comfortable 2 minutes walk from metro station which gave access across Amsterdam 
267205,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Just the location not terrible Easy links to the airport via train 2 mins walk away Tram into centre also 2 5 minutes walk away Tram takes 20mins to get into town worth considering , Great hotel clean and comfy Spa was great 
267206,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The external door with the wheelchair sign displayed does not give any indication as to how it works I was travelling with a wheelchair user and ended up ignoring it in favour of the main revolving door The pedestrain ramp at the bottom would be better without the little step For wheelchair use a smooth transition on to the road would be better where one older or less able person is pushing someone For me it was not a struggle This I mentioned to the staff and they tok a note of it I booked a twin room When I arrived in I had to physically separate the beds Not aproblem for me but I would prefer that it had been done Again an older or less able bodied person would find this a struggle Not to mention to potential for injuring themselves The light switches for the room behind the bed are not labelled in any way This means that one is turning lights on and off in order to find out which one is which A simple labeling would solve this Where this causes a bigger problem is where one wants to not disturb the other person to read or get up and go to the bathroom etc The self checkout is very efficiant It does however list a miscellaneous charge It is actually I found out by asking a staff member the Amsterdam City tax and thus I suggest should be written as such , I enjoyed my stay It is very clean comfortable and friendly We ate well in the restaurant and there was no external noise that I heard to keep me awake The staff listened and dealt with one complaint The travelcards sold in the hotel do not work on the 145 bus that stops near the aiport I feel that this should be made known to all guests at the time of purchase As I bought the two day ticket to use it on the second day I was surprised to find I had to pay on the bus the card does not cover buses not run by GVB The hotel staff refunded me for the second day and I was very pleased with the outcome This I think is the mark of good customer service The staff also took on board one suggestion I made see across Overall I enjoyed my stay and would stay again I have some comments in the what didn t you like section which I hope as a customer you take as customer feedback that is intended to help improve your service 
267207,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, A bit far from the centre Amateurish staff at the restaurant on Sunday evening Could not regulate or turn the aircon off at the room which was a bit cool No basic toiletries at the bathroom as a business traveller would expect from a 4 star I believe , Nice rooms and very good breakfast Good transportation to town
267208,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, N A, Facilities are spot on 20 euros for four hours of swimming steam rooms etc great value for money This is the best hotel I ve ever stayed in Really love this place 
267209,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Complimentary toiletries in the bathroom I couldn t get the room warm Terrible view from my room Turkish Hammam was fully booked the whole week , Pillows on the beds were lovely Toilet paper was good quality Staff were great Lobby area was very cozy
267210,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Small pool restaurant staff member was rude when we went down for breakfast on the first morning as we didn t prepay short older guy with glasses and it was over priced 38 for 2x people , Hotel was fine little far from city centre but the tram 2 line was perfect for getting in and out and it was 17 50 for a 72hour unlimited ticket rush hour can be a little cramped it nothing unusual there Taxis are far too expensive so look up public transport before you go lots to see and do in Amsterdam but if I was to go again I d book a hotel closer to the city as the spa facilities were okay but we hardly used them as there is so much to do in the city 
267211,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, For those who goes to RAI on business it is a good location However nothing there for a tourist Far form city center 7 minutes walk to tram 30 minutes ride No restaurants or anything to do around , Good breakfast comfortable modern room friendly and helpful staff WiFi Metro station is 2 minutes away Good location for RAI visiting business SPA facilities available didn t check it though 
267212,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Tea and coffee facilities in the room were a bit sad 2 small paper cups to make a cup of tea , Comfy bed no noise Good temperature in the room The hotel is out of town but very near either a tram or metro into town so there are very convenient options

267218,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, For a nice hotel and in a reasonable location it was let down by the Tea Coffee facilities These were provided but with minimal stock and also a paper cup rather than a china mug Restaurant while reasonable seemed a little over priced for the quality and quantity , Comfy Room bright and airy Facilities were good and Spa access was a bonus Conveniently located on the Tram Network meaning Central Amsterdam is easy to access Near Schipol Airport so taxi s are not too expensive or public transport is easily doable 
267219,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel was a 20 25 minute tram journey away from Amsterdam s centre and this was the only thing we didn t like about the hotel It was in an area that was under a lot of construction and wasn t close to any restaurants or attractions It was based next to a lot of housing estates and flats but we overlooked this as the metro and tram stops were only a two minute walk away so we had regular access to get where we needed to be , The hotel itself and the facilities were great The room we stayed in was lovely and the staff were really helpful and friendly The spa is absolutely amazing although you have to pay 15 when you arrrive to use it but the faculties there did the money justice The food they serve is also great The metro station was a two minute walk away as well as the nearest tram bus stop and the transport was every 10 minutes A supermarket was also only around the corner 
267220,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Unfortunately we chose a day when the spa was restricted to ladies and small children check ahead , The location was good near to a major tram line and several supermarkets and accessible to the airport The staff were pleasant and helpful

267232,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, that I couldn t get to use the spa cause you had to pay for flip flops think they should come complimentary as paying 15 euro a pair is too expensive would of been 30 euro for two of us, The bed was amazing was like sleeping on fluffy clouds the flat screen tv the temp control in the room Speaker in the bathroom was a lovely hotel
267233,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The staff within the hotel reception where extremely rude Talking in Dutch whilst staring at myself and and my sister laughing and looking at us I did complain due to the staff making us feel uncomfortable and we where given complimentary Breakfast however I felt that this was not the most sufficient way to deal with a complaint around rude staff , The spa is lovely Massages where lovely and the staff who completed our massages where amazing

267240,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The restaurant was abismal Staff were rude and ignorant Didn t feel like we were treated as paying guests we were spoken to like riff raff just off the street A sign was up to say restaurant open at 11 30 we waited half an hour until 25 to 12 just to be very rudely told that it actually wasn t open until 12 The waiter was visibly looking down at us I felt like I wasn t really welcome there We reluctantly returned the next day after 12 to grab a quick lunch which turned into a 50minute wait for a salad and a burger Guests who came in 15 20mins after us were being served and there was food lying on the kitchen counter very much resembling a salad for over 25mins which was ready to be served when I questioned the wait on the food I received a rude response saying a group which had made a reservation at 8am that morning were in so that s why there is a long wait First of all we were not made aware of this before ordering Secondly if the group had made a reservation surely the staff should have been much more prepared for this Thirdly just because there is a group of people who made a reservation that should not mean that 2 people wont get their food for almost 1hour I was absolutely appalled by the service or lack there of It has completely put me off returning to this hotel and will be sure not to recommend to anyone , Rooms were nice and clean Bathroom was best part shower was very relaxing and the heater on the ceiling was nice touch 
267241,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Menu in restaurant was very limited and there was nowhere else to eat within walking distance The room was cold It was set at 19 C you could turn it up to 24 by setting the temp and putting on the fan but that took hours Staff would go in to your room and turn the fan off when you weren t there so when you got back would still be cold Both myself and my partner got colds during our stay Snacks and bottled drinks were very expensive 3 50 for a bottle of water Would not recommend this hotel, Bed was very comfortable

267244,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Not close to any bar or restaurant but it is near a metro stop so you must travel if you want to go out for food or nightlife Instead of one large comforter on a queen bed there were two twin sized comforters Some may like this but I would ve prefer the queen size bedding , The spa is very nice and only costs 15Euro per person Room has a big window and a tv with a web browser 
267245,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The only thing that is questionable is their location because it s quite far from city center However I see no problem with that because you can take a tram which directly heading to the city center , The hotel was really nice We were staying in this hotel for 3 nights and ended up really content with everything The rooms were spacious and cozy and our beds were comfortable too Talking about staff they were always smiling and ready to help you And the thing that made this hotel extraordinary was their breakfast There was a huge selection of different food including freshly cooked eggs or omlettes
267246,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The restaurant though a nice ambiance needs now to revamp the menu already last time the food was not up to what i had the first time in sept i gave it another try as there is no other option in the area it was very disappointing too bad as the place looks nice but i left hungry and not happy , Simple layout clean confortable Corteous friendly helpful staff

267266,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The spa treatments and stuff from the bazaar I feel were a little overpriced The restaurant only sells burger meals and a few sides which was annoying because there wasn t that much variety if you wanted to stay in for dinner but the food itself wasn t bad The hotel is a bit far from city centre but easy to get to by Tram 2 The cleaners were quite annoying however would knock 2 3 times before the afternoon to ask if we needed housekeeping and often would let themselves in Apart from that it was a lovely stay and I would definitely recommend and hopefully be coming to stay again , The room was lovely after we changed rooms to one with a smart tv and one big bed instead of 2 smaller ones put together this was handled very well The Vitality spa was by far our favourite thing about the hotel it had many different facilities and it was great that our room allowed us free access to these facilities The location of the hotel wasn t too inconvenient and the staff were very helpful Everywhere was very clean and my queries were dealt with very well

267292,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The location is a bit out of the way and the hotel is in industrial area hence with not a great view Yet getting to the center is not a problem since there is a metro just meters away , The space is roomy and clean Modern d cor and comfy bed are so basic yet so rare You will sleep well here 
267293,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Location very misleading Not ideal if you are looking to spend most of your time in the centre Transport is good but it takes at least 30 mins to get into the centre, Lovely hotel staff were friendly and the bed was really comfortable Great bar as well 
267294,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, From the minute to walking in to walking out it was awful Order room for 7 5 euro They got it wrong We ordered breakfast they got it wrong More room service wrong Their service was the worst I have ever seen No friendly words The final store come to the bar and get the wine no no no they should get it for you The pool etc was restrictive The staff were rude There is nothing good I can say about this place , The beds were comfy
267295,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Only one tiny grumble and that is we didn t have flip flops with us and had to pay an extra 15 to purchase slippers so we could use the spa it would have been helpful if this was clearly stated on the website Otherwise I was happy with everything , Quite possibly one of the most lovely and luxurious hotels I have ever stayed at The spa was amazing staff were friendly and helpful and the bed was super comfy Even the sandwich I ordered for a late night snack was utterly delicious The hotel is literally a 2 min walk to the metro station so it s easy to get out and about Would most definitely stay here again Excellent all round

267301,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Second time going went mainly for the spa We were not given towels dressing gown or slippers We were asked did we have swimwear as it was policy However when we went into spa everyone was naked This made us feel uncomfortable The pool was closed and the spa was unclean and messy Other people in the spa were loud it wasnt relaxing we then had to dry ourselves off with toilet roll as there were no towels Very disappointed as i had been to the spa a few months prior and it was fantastic ,No Positive
267302,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, every room has coffee and tea available but haven t been replaced for the second day All the rest was just perfect , The hotel is on a very good location close to tram number 2 that tours all main attractions in town Clean comfortable welcoming staff great range of quality food for breakfast the rooms and beds are just so comfortable and the spa is just a little heaven 
267303,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Great staff Girl at the reception was very helpful and friendly just like the rest of the staff The location is a bit outside of the central area but you can buy a tram ticket for a couple of days and the tram operates every 2 5 minutes very nearby You can buy the tickets at the reception Very clean modern and spacious rooms Breakfast was nice although it s the same every day We ended up buying it separately as you never know is it really good or bad until you get to the hotel but I can also recommend prebuying it to save a few Bought separately it was 19 per person if I can recall 
267304,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Pillows were a bit too thick for my taste There was only soap in the shower no shampoo or other stuff , Location is 5 minutes away from the metro station and 3 from a bus stop Train station is 15 minutes away Center of the city is in 25 minutes ride by tram 2 indeed the most picturesque one in Amsterdam 25 minutes by foot from the Olympic stadium so quite convenient for marathon participants Self check in Great breakfast including fresh orange juice squeezed by a machine Comfortable mattress Good wifi 
267305,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The only problem was that one of the cleaning lady started cleaning quite lauded without carrying that someone else could sleep on that floor at 8 o clock in the morning into the opposite room and I just got a light sleep I just wanted to have a nice morning without any noise or alarm clock , The hotel was alright and the room was clean It s close enough to the city centre You just need to get tram 2 
267306,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I felt the location description was a bit deceptive as I did not know when booking it was so far from city center , Located in a quiet neighborhood off the beaten path which was nice for a relaxing vacation 
267307,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I don t recommend the hotel restaurant not great food for high prices one 75 cl bottle of sparkling water 6 50 , The hotel is clean and the rooms are comfortable It is isolated from the town center but you can get there in 35 40 minutes with tram 2 With the same tram you get to the main museum in 15 minutes 
267308,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Selection of snack and drinks especially in the room fridge there was only water Smell of a pretty sporty aroma all around the hotel It looks like to hotel is using a particular shampoo in every room which if you are lucky follows you all around the hotel, The general impression was just great Perfect burgers in room service 
267309,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel is situated quite far from the centre takes 30 mins on a tram and a bit longer by bus Trams run regularly but stop around 11pm on weekends Slow service in restaurant a very long wait for each course and restaurant not full , Comfy beds friendly and helpful staff good services excellent wifi

267312,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I think wellness centre minus the treatments should be included in the price Also the breakfast is a tad overpriced 15 if booked the night before if not 19 on the day , I stayed for three nights with my partner Upon arrival the staff were very helpful and polite and we were able to get our room key without any hassle The rooms are very clean nice comfortable beds and big clean showers There was also a mini fridge with complementary water The TV had various English channels so that was good to watch I feel that breakfast was a little overpriced being 15 but the food we ate there was very nice They had a mixture of hot food as well as the pastries fruit yoghurt and hot and cold drinks We used the wellbeing facilities once I also feel that it was not worth the 10 usually 15 had an offer on spend They had an indoor pool with a sauna that could fit two people as well as a vitality beach I think as guests that should be included The location is very near to the airport took us about 30mins to get there on the train and bus It is not near to central Amsterdam you would have to get Tram 2 which is about a 5minute walk from the hotel Takes about 25mins to get there but you do pass a lot of places that you would love to get off and walk around After reading reviews it mentioned that it was noisey due to building works I can say I m happy we didn t experience any of that The area was very clean and quiet There is nothing close by to the hotel We did find two supermarkets Lidl and Albert Hejen within 10 15 walk from the hotel so we were able to get a few things from there There was also a Turkish restaurant next door we visited every night Efem which was amazing and had great value for money and customer service So overall a lovely hotel not the best location but for me that was preferable as I wanted a bit a peace and the Tram is very easy to connect you into central Amsterdam 
267313,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is rather distant to the city centre but has an appropriate price considering this There is public transport available so it was a good compromise in my opinion , The room was comfortable and the staff were very polite The room was a little cold due to the central air conditioning but the issue was solved rapidly 
267314,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Wouldn t change a thing about the hotel , The hotel was amazing the best we ve stayed in Very friendly and helpful staff It was my birthday and upgraded our room free of charge with some free drinks also it was amazing Was a little bit away from the centre but 10 minutes on a tram and so easy once you got the system 
267315,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Service was spotty Upon booking we had to wait around for a while before the receptionist realised I had to pay some extra city tax Then upon leaving the guy who organised our taxi messed up the booking and we had to wait 45 minutes Location was a bit bland nothing to look at If scenic spots are your thing I d recommend elsewhere , Beds were comfortable Whole hotel in general was very clean and tidy Bar downstairs was good too I never used the spa so I can t comment on that Overall a really good place I d recommend it 
267316,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Close to a tram stop with v regular trams to city then only 10 15 min tram ride to the city Friendly helpful staff Lovely comfortable room high quality Restaurant food was delicious high quality for a reasonable price We ate here on both nights before heading back to the City Will definitely stay here again recommend 
267317,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Not getting the use of the spa as a quest in the hotel there should have been enough spaces left after all it was one of the reasons I booked the hotel So was really disappointed nit getting the chance to use the facilties,No Positive
267318,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is located in an area which is currently being developed A little out of town but tram only 3 mins walk and very frequent , The choice for breakfast was excellent The freshly squeezed orange juice was a lovely surprise Generally the hotel was excellent spotlessly clean and very good quality fixtures and fittings 
267319,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, One of the waitresses in the restaurant was looking down her nose at me but as I look alternative I get it alot so I m not bothered by it This is the only thing I could I could say that s bad about this wonderful hotel , The facilities were amazing staff top notch comfort and style Food was great clean and new Lovely place will definitely use this hotel again 
267320,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The spa was great But was not aware of the additional fee for using Should be clear available for free for guests staying more than 1 night Also was not replenished with water daily , I loved having access to the gym
267321,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No complaints, Very comfortable and clean Location is far from the city but there s a tram about a block away from the hotel that has a direct line through all the big tourist spots including the meusam district dam central the flower market red light district parks etc If you are doubting your stay here due to the hotels distance please don t It was such a value and so easy and cheap to commute back and forth from the city Hotel even has a direct line to the central station Bus 2 
267322,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Everything fine nothing to complain, Comfortable room a lot of small high tech fun stuff bed like in hospitals with up down electrical buttons curtains bathroom light friendly staff and good location a bit outside of city center but tram station near by so no problem also very easy to get to it from the airport 
267323,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The self check in and out was good but becausa of that you dont have any interaction with the staff wich mad the hotel a little unpersonal , The room was realy nice only thing that was missing was the minibar The location was good in a walking distance from the metro and took about 20 30 minutes to go to the center The room were realy clean and new I would deffinetly stay there again 
267324,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No faults at all , I liked everything about this hotel Staff were very Friendly and available 24 hours Lovely restaurant and bar I also liked the little snack bar that was open 24hrs for tea coffee and croissants Hotel 30 mins from central station tram 2 takes you out and then 3 mins walk Taxi to airport takes 15mins cost 30euro I t was very reasonable to stay in this modern hotel and I will recommend it to my I rish Friends
267325,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Location was quite away from centre of Amsterdam but with the trams and bus that run every 6 mins it wasn t to big of of a deal , Everything was nice clean big rooms Staff friendly and helpful 
267326,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, shampoo gel tube was almost empty during all 3 night stay and was not replenished , fresh newly open hotel rooms small but very nice decorated great location just few steps from tram no 2 which goes through the city perfect distance from airport can be easy reachable by taxi just 6 km 
267327,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The food was a bit expensive so sadly we didn t try any of it Also the spa facilities should be part of the price And we didn t know that it was women only through the week 12 5 should be stated on booking com , The hotel is lovely so clean and modern The staff couldn t have been more helpful with directions and kept our bags so we could enjoy our last day before our holiday Would definitely recommend the hotel 
267328,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was by far the most comfiest bed I have ever slept on the hotel had an amazing smell through out with little air freshness puffing smells ever now and then the staff could speak English very well they were very helpful and polite Good value for money and it was right by a tram stop so it was so easy to get around with a straight route to the city The breakfast was all you can eat for 15 each which is very good value when you compare it to what you can get outside the hotel but we decided to go out for breakfast and explore so I cant make a judgment on the food but it looked and smelt nice Wouldn t go anywhere else will definitely be going back Nothing negative to say at all 
267329,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Wasn t in the hotel enough to evaluate , Never really saw any staff didn t have breakfast or use any facilities The hotel was to far out of Amsterdam for the things I d planned for i couldn t just nip back for a rest if needed so having said this it s my only gripe 
267330,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, l Pretty expensive Have to pay to use the gym and pool Nothing around it I e shops cafes resturants Taxis are expensive to the centre from here and the tram takes about 40 mins, Nice hotel Bed was amazing
267331,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Not too much to say only that in description it wasn t stated that SPA is for additional fee still good value for money Gym has only few things and is just to warm up, Very nice SPA complex to chill and relax very clean and tidy In general very good impression of the quality of the hotel
267332,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Location it s very much on the outskirts of Amsterdam but is only a short walk to the tram or metro , Superb room in terms of both size and presentation Very helpful staff The hotel was spotlessly clean 
267333,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast was same all days House keeping did not clean the room and toilet very well and even did not leave bottle of water in room, Location and staff
267334,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Location was a 30 min tram from the city centre which made it difficult to maximise time Restaurant had good food but was quite expensive would recommend walking to Radion 5 min walk for a cheaper bite to eat, Very comfortable rooms Spa was good value for 10
267335,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, a bit more choice on the menu and the price for the breakfast was overcharged at 19 euros, very friendly staff the disabled access was excellent and the room even better with an electric bed which we have never seen before in a hotel perfect
267336,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was perfect So kind and helpfull staff and really good food in restaurant And also rooms are new and beautifull with really comfortable bed 
267337,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Self service check in extras over priced food bar snacks thermal suite not included in price of stay , Bed room access to public transport bike rental
267338,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, It is a very high standard great hotel the price is totally worth it because it not exactly I m the city center but the public transport is convenient We enjoyed quite a lot even so there was some guy accusing himself hotel service that we never asked and used chip card came into our room that scared us The last night staying someone was knocking our door at 1am very hard It was frightened we are lucky that we locked the door Overall I think the hotel needs to strengthen the security and control the ppl who are not clients or even suspected employees Nice SPA offer ,No Positive
267339,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The building site across the road from our room wasn t exactly aesthetically pleasing so we just kept the blinds closed most of the time, The staff were really friendly and helpful Good location it s nice and quiet as it s in a suburban area and the number 2 tram a 3 minute walk from the hotel takes you to the city centre in about 15 minutes It travels through the museum quarter my favourite part of the city right into Centraal Station It s about a 10 minute walk from Albert Heijn Lidl and a bunch of other local supermarkets so you can stock up on food there The massages in the spa are incredible after 25 minutes of the Relaxation Massage I was a new man The restaurant dinner was really nice and it was reasonably priced The breakfast buffet was also good definitely worth the money providing you aren t vegan The room was nice and clean and very spacious It also had a fridge a huge plus if you re looking to save money Netflix was pre installed on the television fantastic Good free WiFi
267340,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Perhaps the food was slightly expensive but that s being picky, 2 3 minute walk from a tram stop into the city centre one of the nicest hotels i ve ever stayed in Staff as friendly as you could ever imagine rooms modern spacious and extremely comfortable Can t wait to stay again 
267341,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We would have preferred a queen size bed rather than 2 beds but I think we did not have that option when booking on line , The bed was very comfortable 
267342,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel has a beautiful pool but that is NOT included in the price of the room an extra 15 euro a day to use it Breakfast was expensive so we didn t try it But breakfast items are available at the store for a reasonable price , Close to the airport but 15 minute ride on the tram to downtown Although it s not close the Tram 2 is a good route that goes through many fun neighborhoods Very comfortable rooms beds
267343,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Food drink and all other things expensive when at hotel Spa flat rate of 10 even if only going in for a quick swim Normally 15 as well to guests , Close proximity to good transport links in to centre 
267344,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Should I delve into one negative would be to highlight that should you wish to book a twin room you will infact receive a very large bed with 2 seperate duvets rather than 2 seperate beds Although this did not detract from a very comfortable nights rest , What a truly wonderful stay We were attracted to the hotel at first for the value for money with regards to having a spa and it being 4 436 for 4 nights at the Corendon would have only bought us an average 3 stay in central Amsterdam with no frills The hotel had a very new feel to it and smelt beautiful throughout the establishment Rooms were impeccably clean well proportioned and provided a lovely ambience with the automatic blind system that shaded the room automatically when the sun came out Exquisite spa facility truly one of the best I have ever had at my disposal It was evident that a lot of money had been spent in this particular aspect of the hotel taking into account the floor to ceiling marble haram Breakfast was a true delight with such a vast range of beautiful delicacies from smoked salmon to a traditional English breakfast Particularly drawn to the omelet bar where you could choose your own incredients and then have your omelet cooked in front of you The location despite being 15 20 minutes outside of the centre was just as fantastic being on 2 tram routes right outside the hotel lobby and an all night bus service stopping just 200 meters away A wonderful stay was endured and I would highly recommend this hotel to any visitor to Amsterdam 
267345,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The water was not very hot , We were craving pizza and the staff helped us order it and brought it to our room They were very helpful in saving us money in how to use street parking legally and for less than the hotel lot 
267346,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Room was too cold I could not turn the ac off The hotel was a half an hour tram ride from the city s center The distance wasn t too bad once I got use to it , The room was very comfortable 
267347,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, It was excellent , EXCELLENT ALL THE WAY AROUND The bed pillows were the most comfortable I ve EVER slept on The Spa was excellent Mandana was excellent as a massage person I ve been referring groups of friends on FB should they travel to Amsterdam When I return this is MY hotel Love the Disabled Accesibility I m a mother of a daughter in a wheelchair Breakfast buffet was excellent 
267348,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Pillows were too high Sheets should be on King size instead of having two individual sheets , Breakfast was very diverse and of good quality Eggs made on time and by request Silent and spacey bedroom Very friendly staff 
267349,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The location is a little bit further from Amsterdam centre than they claim it s not a major deal just an extra ten minutes on the tram but just factor that in if you re staying here Otherwise a really nice place to stay , Really really nice hotel Great staff very nice rooms really comfortable beds REALLY good breakfast 
267350,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff were extremely approachable and helpful answering all our questions about the city as well as the hotel The rooms were far bigger than expected extremely clean and comfortable The bathroom was also spacious and the facilities fantastic Good access to the city centre with a tram line only a couple minutes away as well as a bus stop in between 
267351,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Can t complain for the money very good hotel , The rooms were very spacious and floor to ceiling windows provide for a very bright room Well appointed bathroom and huge queen size bed gave the room a very luxurious feel 
267352,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything Big and clean room speed WIfi facilities Location quite far from the city center but guests can easily reach by bus line2 or metro which will take to there within 20 mins I don t think it s a problem So perfect and highly recommend 
267353,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No hot water only Luke warm Entire hotel is set up to upsell its clients like 8 50 euro for a 1 5 euro breakfast 10 euro to use the pool Really disappointed about almost a cool shower or bath for over 125 cdn a night , Good location to metro
267354,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The restaurant at the hotel had poor service some food arrived after we had finished our meal and then they had the check to charge for it Also when we asked for tap water for the table they provided a single bottle that wouldn t fill my glass let alone another, The rooms were very nice modern clean
267355,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, When the room was tidied on the second day of our visit the coffee cups were put back dirty Visibly dirty Also the location is a sight bit far from the center , The room was nice and clean and has all the essential amenities The spa especially the hamam was a reason in itself to revisit Also very nice breakfast spread 
267356,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, it took us about 30 40 minutes to get to amsterdam center via public transportation we always took the fastest route using google maps , the bed was amazing the staff was super nice spacious room very clean 
267357,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No restaurant and supermarket nearby about 12min walk to the supermarket , The location is good just 2 min walk to the subway station Breakfirst is good and delicious staffs are helpful
267358,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, hotel was amazing and the tram no 2 went straight to the city also busses running here all night worth getting a 3 day Amsterdam travel card from the airport though as this could get expensive 
267359,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Location is far out from main Amsterdam city etc Where the tourist areas places of interest are located About 10mins walk to the tram bus stop which takes you to the city and 30mins travelling time on tram If you are a smoker you have to come all the way down and out of the hotel to have a smoke if you get caught smoking in the rooms its a 300 euro dollars fine Windows cannot be open and fridge is not stocked empty no water No food drink menus in room might indicate no food room service Bring your own shampoo bath wash as its not included , Nice clean and smoke free rooms and polite well informed staff 
267360,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The only bad thing about this hotel is its location whilst it says it s only a 15 minute tram ride away that s a bit of a fib You can get the 18 and 2 tram to the centre and they both take at least 30 minute which we didn t mind but if you want to be close to the centre this probably isn t the best choice , Amazing hotel Absolutely loved how clean comfy and stunning the rooms and the hotel itself actually were can honestly say it is one of the nicest hotels I ve ever stayed in 
267361,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Couldnt find much to tweak without being picky, The beds are 1 of the best i have ever been in Food was good and drinks well priced All staff we met during our 2 nights could not have been more friendly and helpful
267362,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I feel like it s getting more and more expensive 2E for a croissant and as a french girl let me say how disappointing are those croissants The restaurant has terrible music tastes , As this is my third stay in two years I can only say how much I love the bedroom It s really cosy comfy There s a perfect smell in the entire building like a flower smell 
267363,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, It is outside the city You just have to be aware of that and see if it fits your purpose , Perfect interior Value for money Everything is there Functional with style 
267364,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Having to pay for parking should state on website that this is an extra cost , Staff we re friends and helpful good location into centre via a quick tram
267365,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The staff could have been a little more genuinely polite It felt forced , I liked that the hotel was very clean and the rooms were cosy Accommodated for plenty of light and late lie ins
267366,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, A bit far from the city centre but great connections with metro trum and bus inc night buses , Everything about this hotel is pretty great The rooms the bathroom the service are all exellent 
267367,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, the building work across the road woke us up early in the morning and the trip into the city centre was a little bit long, the rooms were decorated really nicely and always clean Staff were friendly and helpful
267368,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, There is construction across the street starting pretty early in the morning which was a bit noisy The hotel has a restaurant but we didn t see anything else nearby , Very nice modern room and bathroom Friendly staff Great value for the money compared with expensive older hotels in Amsterdam city center The 2 tram is a five minute walk away and takes about 15 minutes to get to the city center ending at the train station 
267369,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The bad for yang pair should not consists of two merged bed It is hard to keep together on such bad Floor in the room has some dirty and stuff when we checked in Not so many and not so hard but it could be different , All the rest is perfect 
267370,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Staff in restaurant The waitress lady had no a good attitude when she gave us the service , Confort and facilities in room Very nice and big Very good hotel I would recommend it 
267371,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The travel every day in and out of town there is also no where close to this hotel to eat so you either have to eat in the city centre before you get the tram back or else at the hotel which was a little expensive and not a major choice , Very clean very comfortable but a little bit of a travel to the centre
267372,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We could nt use the restaurant on Saturday night due to a wedding So had to leave the hotel for food Was treated like we wasn t welcome My husband couldn t use the spa from Monday to Thursday as its women only we booked the hotel with a spa for a reason, We liked the rooms
267373,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Most extra services came with additional charges For example you had to buy a pair of slippers if you didn t bring your own Far from the city centre and the surrounding area was just one big construction site when we stayed there , We liked the spa section The rooms were kept clean and the bathrooms in the rooms were nice They also had a nice little gym 
267374,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Room service time was a bit uncomfortable It got started too early at 9 o clock and service wasn t done when we got back at 5 o clock Aside from that everything was satisfying , The bed was soft the room was clean and staffs were nice 
267375,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The room had electrical issues the power kept cutting out Asked for it to be fixed 3 times before it was actually actioned, Bed was amazing good sized rooms and very helpful staff 
267376,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Menu was limited to western tastes although bacon was available for breakfast , New hotel but close to a building site Restaurant staff super friendly Close to tram station for centre 
267377,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, A bit far out of the city and rather expensive , Such a luxurious hotel everything was imuclate couldn t fault 1 thing definitely value for money we were totally satisfied with our stay 
267378,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Could have done with stocking up on teabags in room Us Irish love our cuppa , From the time we arrived staff were so friendly and helpful Everything u needed for a great stay was there Also contact and information about location of hotel before we traveled was excellent and all the useful information of Wat 2 do in Amesterdam was brilliant Will definitely be back to visit you again Thank you for making our trip so enjoyable 
267379,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, High bright girl that served dinner in the restaurant was rude she literally spoiled the soup in front of me on the table and did not try to clean the table Besides everything else it was great ,No Positive
267380,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Not a big issue but got 2 single duvets instead of one double, The staff were friendly and helpful Liked the fridge in the room The room was modern and clean and the en suite was lovely Electric sockets by the bed handy for charging phone etc Free wifi 
267381,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Bad odor in our shower cabin but this disappeared after taking a shower , Very nice breakfast with fresh juices many kinds of bread eggs croissants and other sweet breakfast rolls fruits yogurt and so on And we enjoyed the wellness center Especially the Finnish sauna and the Beach room were very nice Morning run to De Oeverlanden was peaceful and a very good start of my day 
267382,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Compulsory flipflops in the spa a tiny statement in the spa brochure goes completely unnoticed you only know it once you are at the spa reception already so make it bigger or more noticeable, Very confortable bed clean bedroom and spacious enough great hotel facilities Wonderful spa experience and one to come back to again for sure 
267383,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The staff were quite rude and seemed more interested in chatting to each other any time we approached reception to ask something or buy something As someone who works in the service industry myself I found it most surprising that they would leave people waiting there for so long while they continued to talk to each other on several occasions , The rooms were great and beds super comfy and the place was very clean Although not in the centre it was easy to get around the city from the hotel and to from the airport 
267384,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The only thing I found disappointed was how far away from city centre while I didn t realise before booking as I did I m afraid I wouldn t have chosen this hotel The staff was very friendly My delux, My delux room was very clean and the bed was extra space age and super comfortable 
267385,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Only enough coffee for one cup each on day of arrival and it wasn t topped up daily Air conditioning wasn t cold enough to cool room quickly , Clean comfortable room Hairdryer shower gel and soap coffee making facilities and iron and ironing board on request Staff were very helpful
267386,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I would of used the pool but it cost 10 euros I think this should be free to guests , Lovely clean modern hotel Very close to transport into the center and affordable 
267387,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Would have been better if more pubs around but that s not down to hotel just my preference, Liked everything rooms far better than expected tram stop less than 5 minute walk hotel cleanliness great receptionists couldn t do enough for you cartons of water in fridge a godsend 
267388,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I chose this hotel for the gym and the pool The gym is small but adequate The pool which costs an extra 15 euros to begin with though there was a special offer for 10 now and which fact is not mentioned on the website at all is entirely unfit for swimming It is tiny which is something you might expect from a hotel but they are boasting 2000 square meters for the area so instead of a dozen different rooms of saunas and very costly massages it would have been a good idea to start with a somewhat larger pool I have swum in small hotel pools but this one is way too warm therefore there are people sitting in it chatting away using the whirlpool features so there is no room and absolutely no possibility to swim At other times it might be empty so there might be room and no whirlpool features but it would still be way too warm for swimming The hotel should lower the temperature cut the whirlpool features and put up a sign that this is a pool for swimmers or alternately it should describe this as a wellness area rather than a pool I came out of the area after 15 minutes by the way no soap in the showers even though the cleaner had just left explained the above issue there and upstairs at reception No one thought of reimbursing me for a service which I paid for and which they failed to provide With no pool the hotel is too expensive , The staff are truly wonderful all the time The hotel is outside the centre but that is clear from the get go and it is very easily reachable by tram 2 in about 20 minutes depending on traffic Breakfast is pretty good with a choice of warm an cold food but for 19 euros they should be offering fish salmon herring the usual marmalade champagne and those other perks of a luxury breakfast Rooms are spacious and clean there is a turndown service as well which is great Reception has a selection of soft drinks fruits and pastries 24 7 with no shops in the vicinity also a good idea 
267389,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Bathroom glass door would not stay closed I was not given any cutlery when ordered room service an oversight I guess but very bad for room service Price needs to be more reasonable after all this hotel is in a business district , I usually stay at the Hotel Artemis few times a year while staying there I had to stay an extra night but this time they were fully booked so walked over to Corendon its a little more expensive but well worth the extra cost I like the self check in and the front desk staff were brill Will stay here again although the cost could be a lot lower I think for business travellers 
267390,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, A bit far away from the city centre Nothing much in surrounding area , Really comfortable We were arranged to stay at a quiet room on a higher floor just as what we requested The area is quite safe at night In close proximity to the metro station 
267391,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Our bed was comfortable but it was 2 twin beds pushed together common in Europe We did not like the seam down the middle , The staff were very helpful and friendly Everyone spoke English quite well The food was good and reasonably priced 
267392,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We could only lower the room temperature by 3 degrees since you can t open the windows it would be helpful to at least be able to lower it 5 degrees I have asthma And the room became Stuffy nite, The staff was great best masseuse Was Mondana I saw her 3 Times Hotel was clean and comfortable Food was surprisingly good Adding the breakfast plan was super for us 
267393,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, They didn t provide water in the rooms everyday Also the hotel is not in a good location quite away from the centre , I liked the cleanliness and modern look of the hotel 
267394,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel was a bit far from the city center around 30min away by tram bus but the stop was close and you get used to the transport fast There were no shops restaurants i e nearby , The room was spacious and it was cleaned everyday the bed was very comfortable the staff was friendly Easily you can reach to the hotel from the airport by train metro 
267395,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Slightly too far from the city centre but there is a tram stop a very short walk across the road and you are in the centre in 15 20 mins, Lovely clean hotel The beds are super comfortable the bathroom is lovely too
267396,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Be aware you have to pay extra to use the spa We chose this hotel as we wanted somewhere with a pool so ended up further away from town for this reason We hadn t noticed anywhere on the website or on our confirmation that you in fact have to pay 15pp to use the spa area You also need to wear flip flops in the spa oh wait you can buy theirs for 7 We always go to a spa hotel whenever we get to go away and this was the 1st time we had to pay to use onsite spa at a spa hotel , Great modern hotel about 25mins out of town 
267397,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Only thing the mattress were too soft , The room is very neat and tidy Very comfy Area is very nice and quiet Staff are very pleasant and always smiling 
267398,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The location is slightly far from the city center and no amenities around But there is a tram station nearby However it s fine if you are looking for a place to stay near Schiphol Airport , A good place to stay in Amsterdam Spacious room nice design comfortable bed Requested for baby cot a nice cosy matching coloured cot has been set up in my room upon check in The staff is friendly and helpful Travelling with baby can be a big mess Received a letter in my room that they are unable to clean the room due to my personal belongings but the housekeeping can be contacted anytime It s really a professional gesture Love almost everything 
267399,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, This has been the best Hotel that I have booked on the site It also matches the rating that it gets I am in Paris with a hotel that is rated 8 1 that is not even close to this hotel 
267400,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, This place is outside the city and it takes a good 20 25 minutes to the Dam Square The hotel does not offer shuttle service to the airport or to the train station which was a disappointment One of the staff members showed an attitude but the others were very helpful There is a tram station close by and we used it a lot , Good rooms and a nice ambience
267401,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Staff in the restaurant downstairs was very unprofessional and menu was very limited Messes up an otherwise excellent facility , Facility and cleanliness 
267402,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, It is a little out of the way but there is a train station and a tram stop within 10 minutes of the hotel And with a travel card going in and out of the city isn t really an issue, The spa and the room we had were all amazing and the staff were really friendly too Definitely come back again 
267403,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The spa wasn t great and the food and bar were far too expensive compared to the quality The hotel is great as a base and breakfast but get out into the city where it s cheaper and better quality , The location was great and the hotel was really nice and comfortable Good variety for breakfast 
267404,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The view wasn t the best of views but I don t think the hotel can help that very much , The spa The spa facilities are amazing The hotel staff are also very accommodating 
267405,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel is very remote from city centre and not easily accessible 5 City tax comes in addition to the room price which was not announced by Booking And beware to book breakfast the day before otherwise they charge you an additional 4 , Well equipped hotel with friendly and professional staff but slightly overpriced considering the hotel situation
267406,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing but the way to the center about 25 minutes tram bus but U will get used to it hotel surroundings there is nothing at all , Everything was fine staff breakfast room room facilities and the hotel is quite close to the airport just one station if u go with the train 
267407,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Complimentary use of the spa would have been nice rather than a paid extra, There are few if any negatives about this hotel Staff were very helpful and our rooms were very well appointed Although out of the city the location is convenient for the tram stop and Metro line

267412,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We thought that the spa facilities were free as stated on our booking But we found out at reception that we had to pay if we wanted to use it for 4 hours This would of been nice if it was included in the price but never the less there was only a small charge if you did want to use the spa facilities , Beds were very comfy Brilliant to come back to after a long day exploring around Amsterdam And the staff were friendly and informative Also on entrance the hotel smelt so good and relaxing it was lovely The 24hour hotel shop it was really good

267417,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Not the cleanest room I have ever been in but a long way from the worst Bedside power fitting was broken and looked like it had been that way for some time Stuffy room with no possibility to open a window The aircon was OK but was set to a standard temperature with only two degrees of variability either side permitted on the controls If you like to sleep with ambient fresh air in the room as I do then you may find this annoying It gave me a headache , Easy to find and drive to and easy to park Very helpful and cheerful staff The pool and 24 7 fitness centre looked amazing but I had no time to do anything other than admire them sadly

267422,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Climate control in the room makes the air incredibly dry Matresses are too soft and the bedding too hot for a room without proper ventilation , Location good and staff are friendly Rooms are very large and have a convenient little fridge 
267423,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, One thing location hmm difficult get to the center by tram ok fine it takes 30 min but in every way it cost 3 euro and It looks dangerous go by tram in the evening so if you want to keep safe is necessary coming earlier and you miss a lot of attractions in center But anyway hotel is very good , Breakfast tasty completly enough for first meal People around very helpful Ice dispenser in lounge Great idea It s nothing to say more about advantages because it s too much Very good hotel 
267424,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Room over looked police station yard, The position of the hotel between the Metro and the tram stops made access to the city center very easy The room was top quality as was the staff 
267425,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The weather but I don t think I can blame the hotel for that , Staff were very helpful indeed especially the customer relations manager Johan Auto opening bedroom door electric bed massive flat screen with 7 English channels were just some of the unusual benefits Near to the award winning Tram 2 route stop it only takes 20 amazing minutes to get to Central station via the city s best sites

267428,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Trippers should be told of the Airport QUICK bus service 197 to Amstelveensweg to catch Metro to Henk Sneevlietweg next stop 100 metre walk to Hotel 20 minutes Great link when the Trains service is STOPPED Far better than Tram 2 Rooms were too hot and air conditioning would not drop temperature, Close to Transport terminals both Tram and Metro in Downtown Centre in 15 20 minutes USE the TRAVEL CARD Staff SO HELPFUL Quiet location Kettle in room Breakfasts were a delight
267429,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The surrounding location seems quite dangerous The shower gel bottle was empty while we checked in around 10 pm and the manager said there was no housekeeper during the night Finally it took about 30 minutes just to find us a bottle of shower gel , The room was clean and spacious

267437,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, we didn t like that there is no option to open the main window in the room some times it was too strangled inside the room , Amazing Hotel Good vibe excellent staff members very boutique interior Great break fast deal the hotels restaurant has the best hamburger in whole Amsterdam 
267438,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Restaurant staff was a bit slow during dinner time I also think their air conditioning needs a deep clean because I caught a very bad head cold after leaving it on one night When I checked out I heard a lot of people at the reception with my same type of cough I prefer rooms with Windows that can be opened and vent the room rather than A C , It was very close to both metro and tram stations Very friendly staff and hotel food was of good quality 
267439,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Is far from the city center although you have bus tram and metro stations nearby Ammenities are expensive It s better if you buy bottles of water or sodas out of the hotel, The hotel is really nice Food at the restaurant is good too The room was perfect for a solo traveler and for the days I stayed there

267442,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Cost of breakfast way too expensive Should be reduced rate for people staying in the hotel 30min tram ride to the dam Tram stop is only a 3 min walk from the hotel though so very nearby , Dinner was amazing We got penne arabiatta and the best dish I ve had yet Amazing chef 72hour tram ticket available in reception is good value and means you can get the tram into the city and hop on and off wherever you like as much as you would like Hotel arranged taxi for us back to the airport 
267443,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, They were working on something across the street so the scenery wasn t really good to look at Wasn t enough tables for people to sit down for breakfast, Loved the bed and the bathroom always had hot water Staff are really friendly Easy to find and great location The food is amazing
267444,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The location is a bit far from the centre of the city While you have an easy access though tramway we find it a bit incovenient as there is nothing near to eat except the hotel restaurant to have a drink etc, The room was really clean and we have a lot of space The bed was very comfy and the hotel personnel really helpful and enthusiastic 
267445,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Not the best location or most attractive surroundings Staff seemed at times overwhelmed and did not give priority to a warm welcome Similarly there was a delay in a booked spa treatment and there was a lack of care about this delay , Nice spa good to get away Nice room and comfortable conditions 
267446,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The beds are not so neat there were wrinkles on the surface of the quilt It took half an hour to get to the central but luckily a metro station was very close to the hotel , A little bar is located on the ground floor sufficient to daily needs The restaurant was very good especially their omelette The facilities looks new and clean 
267447,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, This is apparently a hotel of the future largely self serve including check in and check out Most of the staff were very friendly and nice but we were put off 1 by the very slow dinner service 2 less than congenial welcome at breakfast 3 rip off price for water and I assume by extension other items and 4 the not so subtle hints to get out in the morning Reservations were made and pre paid on line Our expensive breakfast was confirmed and acknowledged at check in yet was not recognized when we showed up for breakfast I received a parking charge on my card after check out that was a total surprise I had asked about it when leaving I was told no its taken care of Sure was Dinner service was poor because two waiters were working the whole restaurant We were told there were supposed to be four wait staff Stopped by the counter to buy a couple bottles of water 3 50 each Rip off The breakfast room was very crowded and many items were not kept stocked but probably not possible given the crush of people Nonetheless staff were very friendly and tried their best Television was turned off from the front desk after 9 a m in the morning to discourage you from lingering Infuriating , The hotel is new and clean and has a good location convenient to the Metro

267452,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, That the spa was an additional charge over and above the room charge the snacks at the guest service were over priced but thats to be expected the view from my window was that of a construction sight but the area is under development and i expect in the coming years that it will be built up and a very good place for travellers to stay just outside the historic Amsterdam , The spa was lovely and the bar and restaurant staff and food very good also 25 percent off was a nice perk The quaint Pool and Hammam steam room were fantastic well done i hope you look after that little oasis thanks

267471,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We did not appreciate the personel at all Most of times it looked like they did not want to work For instance when we went to the spa of the hotel we were first asked if we had done a reservation if we were clients of the hotel And finally they said that it was a busy day and asked us we were sure we want to enter the spa Once inside there were maximim 10 people Same case at the reception If you want friendly and helpful saff you are at the wrong place , The hotel has excellent facilities and is very clean It is located a bit more far away from the center of Amsterdam but you can rent bikes at the hotel It will take ypu approximately 20 min to the city center I think it is an excellent hotel for those who want a quiet and relaxing place to stay

267500,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No coffee American style machine purchase of 4 oz cup for 2 euro Food less than enticing no iron in the room had to be requested each day Construction site across the street left view less than attractive , Room was decent size staff helpful 
267501,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel was a bit isolated and there didn t seem to be any amenities nearby To be fair I did not check into that when booking rapid change day after Paris massacres The hotel was near a tramline which made up for the slight isolation Also is coffee becoming scarce My fiancee and I drink lots and two tiny sachets was not enough When we requested more someone brought us three Don t be shy with the coffee , The staff were excellent and totally prepared for every question we had We needed help with local travel bag storage and taxis to the airport Everyone was friendly and eager to help This is a great example of how customer service should be We ate in the restaurant one night and the food was delicious The hotel was spotless and our room was gorgeous junior suite I will definitely stay here again 
267502,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Requested for a quiet room and got a room very next to the 7th floor cockpit suit where I had to sleep listening to the banging doors mostly used by staff , Friendly staff Gym Spa Breakfast
267503,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, That there was additional costs to use the pool and sauna as this wasnt shown when booking , It was my fifthtieth birthday and we were given a room upgrade free because of this the room was gorgeous the bed was huge and the most comfortable bed weve ever slept in 
267504,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The only downside was the distance to the centre of town although mitigated by convenient and cheap public transport Not really much around the hotel to do and the spa facility was expensive , The staff and quality of the hotels furnishings was excellent The restaurant meals and service very good Room was comfortable 
267505,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Communication between booking com and hotel very poor I had paid room breakfast vat city tax up front via booking com At hotel they said they hadn t received payment for breakfast and city tax Needed to show receipt from booking to prove I had already paid breakfast They insisted on charging me the 5 city tax as an extra Bit miffed Have to check with bank to see if I have been double charged , Close to Metro 
267506,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel has a convenient link to town centre however it is a far way away from the centre, Facilities were excellent prices however were not Hairs on mattress on arrival dust along bedhead 
267507,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, 1 Location there are construction works right in front of the hotel No noise but view was not perfect 2 Transport options are not perfect It is rather far from Damsquare you can not walk 3 Breakfast is expensive no other options around , 1 Room size and good conditions 2 Clean enough 3 Sound proof is ok 4 TV channels were ok 5 Innovative check in out 6 It looked like hotel compared to many places in Amsterdam 
267508,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, the Refrigerator should have some water everyday and may be beer cold drink at least during the first checkin i have experienced the hotel staff keeping couple of beers cola in the refrigerator in ROME though it was much smalled hotel may be 3 star , Hotel Close to tram station to central rooms where we stayed was big enough and very comfortable Njoyed a lot 
267509,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The only issue with this hotel I thought was that you had to pay to use the spa considering the amount you pay to stay at the hotel and considering most other hotel offer guests free use of spa facilities I felt this was a bit of a let down , Hotel staff were lovely and extremely helpful and friendly the spa was great and had lots of space and choice of therapies 
267510,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I didnt like the location its quite far from city centre travelling with a tram took ages The bed wasnt comfortable at all and it was really small Big minus u cant open a window ,No Positive
267511,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No where does it say you have to pay extra for the spa Awful view as opposite is building however once the neighbourhood is finished it will be lovely and you don t spend your holiday looking out of a window so it didn t matter to us , The staff were very helpful and the room was large and decorated very nicely 
267512,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, This hotel claims 4 stars but in rooms there are no toothbrush toothpaste bathrobes flip flops for room no shampoo conditioners and other small things which usually are offered by 1 3 hotels And only one has to buy shoes to go to sauna Plus not big variety of food in restaurant menu Breakfast could be better there is variety of cold food but nothing really hot not much cooked food for normal breakfast , Location is quite good only 20 minutes by tram Really comfortable beds 
267513,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, restaurant staff Was woken up in the middle of the night for bill payment even though I was given the option of adding it to my room bill which I did Restaurant manager extremely rude However reception staff were very good with sorting it out and was given free breakfast No apology from the restaurant manager though , Excellent hotel Very clean and modern rooms
267514,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The only minor thing I can think of is it s two metros to the central area Don t get a taxi as it cost us nearly 30 euros You can get an all day metro for 7 euros 50 so you can hop on and off all day , The staff were friendly and helpful The rooms were lovely very clean and the bed is by far one of the best beds I have ever slept in So comfortable Beautiful hotel and I would definitely stay again 
267515,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Parking costs are terrible 20 euros a day I d recommend parking out on street much cheaper TVs are locked down so you can t connect your own tablet or similar to watch TV but luckily they have all the UK channels Spa costs not included in core costs so not so much of a deal bit gutted as fancied a swim which is often included in other hotels The rest of the area around the hotel is a right dive currently being knocked down rebuilt and redesigned I m sure it ll be nice once complete but it ll take a while , Brand new hotel so everything is new clean and great Lovely rooms with mod cons Good wifi Breakfast okay their egg counter is handy as they ll make whatever egg you fancy fresh Nice spa on bottom floor though be aware this is NOT included in the cost as I was lead to believe thanks booking com Two food places but both quite expensive and limited menus for me anyway Location just right not too in Amsterdam but not too far out 
267516,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, low price rooms very small bathroom lights operated by motion sensor, close to metro station brand new clean everything working friendly atmosphere lobby restaurant bar 
267517,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel it s self is rather expensive for basic items aswell as the food but other than that nothing to fault, Staff are excellent and very helpful it s ten minutes from the centre of Amsterdam with easy transport access 
267518,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, When I booked I asked for a hi room with bath and quite room When arrived was on first floor but it was quite No bath but they had rooms with bath but would have to pay an extra 30 euro a night for a bath not sure about that but an email would have been nice We were there for marathon but no running food on menu , These easiness to travel The spa 
267519,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Not so much of a bad experience but I suggested before for a 4 hotel to have small cups and no biscuits on arrival was a bit poor but I got over it there is a shop not far from the hotel Biscuits are quite inexpensive , Having stayed here before I thought it was an excellent place to stay not far from the centre and also not far from the airport 
267520,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast is terrible for the money The mattresses are foam so you sink in them not great if you suffer a bad back I had a double bed but two single duvets , Clean Modern looking and helpful staff 
267521,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, How far from the square it was but no other hotels in the centre looked as nice the food wasn t the best, staff was very friendly the spa day was lovely
267522,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel surrounding wasn t that much although tram line 2 takes you directly to city center No close by any amenities not even a gas station , Nice and comfy bed decent size room Nice and easy going bar with free pool table 
267523,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No late checkout option was available had to pay for a full night as my fight was mid night The roam were not cleaned serviced 2 days during our stay , Value of money New Friendly staff Clean Location is not central but metro tram bus stations very near by 
267524,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The location is outside the city center in a sort of commercial office park type area Walk from the station involves a long staircase , 2 Bottles of drinking water every day great facilities breakfast and showers 
267525,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The view sucks the Hotel it s in the midle of nowhere though you may catch the tram to the center the mini bar is always empty and even electronic sigarette is not allowed c mon people it s Amsterdam ,No Positive
267526,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, From one night on this hotel we found a bugs Midnight shift staff is one of worst staff I meet before if you re trying to receive your room on this hotel don t not do that ,No Positive
267527,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Just a bit of a journey from town so couldn t nip back really during the day once you re out you re out , Close to the airport which was good tram into town not far away 
267528,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, during our stay there were some demolitions going on across the street which gave a little depressing feeling about the area, big beautiful cosy room really nice personel you can get to the hotel using the tram no 2 form the Central Station great plus when you carry luggage
267529,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing really Transport by tram to city only took 20 mins, Friendliness of all staff Restaurant to have meals was great Nice and quiet compared to staying in Amsterdam 
267530,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I had to wait for around 10 mins for someone to take my order when i went for dinner twice on separate days in the restaurant located in the hotel The first time i did order the food after the wait but when this happened again the second time round after a few nights i left after waiting for 10 mins without ordering food Not sure if this wait is because i was alone or non european and so they didn t want or bother to serve me , 1 I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights It is located away from the city centre and takes about 30 mins to get to it by tram bus So i liked the quiet location of the hotel 2 Staff at the front desk was very friendly helpful and informative 3 Breakfast was good 4 Facilities in the room were exceptional 5 Wi fi in the room was also very good 
267531,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Some of the receptionists were rude and blunt Location is half an hour away from Dam even though it s a direct tram Overcharged for food , The way the building looked the cleaning staff were very friendly 
267532,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I chose to stay here because it was close to business meetings that I was having but the local area has nothing in it With this in mind the hotel should offer some less expensive breakfast options 19 Euros when I want a tea and a slice of toast is ridiculous They also couldn t cope sometimes They couldn t see our booking when we first arrived They had a particularly busy night in the restaurant and left us waiting for an hour They lost some washing and recovered it Always apologized and gave us some money off or free wine but it seemed a bit like the place had just opened and was suffering teething problems , Very comfortable hotel 
267533,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, A cranky night shift employee working at the bazaar downstairs but didn t affect overall opinion of the hotel , Everything was excellent from Service staff hotel etc 
267534,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t like the fact reception office was reduced to only 2 front desks several self check in and check out machines nobody wanted to use because obviously people have always some questions to ask so in the result there was always a queue with long waiting time to be served I also didn t like how the taxis were arranged when the drivers made guests wait in the cold until they finish their chat , I rate the location the best close to the airport close to RAI and at the same time with good communication with the city centre tram no 2 and metro line next to the hotel 
267535,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, 40 minutes far from the city center by public transport Towels didn t smell very good, 15 minutes far from the city center by car Nice 4 stars in a nice neighboorhood Nice and helpful staff Quite hotel We were upgraded Super comfy King size bed
267536,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Disappointed that the swimming pool was not free and not open to late in the morning that was my main reason for booking the hotel but I didnt look at the smallprint,No Positive
267537,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, A bit far from the city centre but the tram near the hotel takes you there in 20 25 mins Also there is not much of a view as they are currently building in the hotel s vicinity, Room was nice clean decent size 
267538,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Minor things Telephone needed replugging to first work safe found locked and sink drain needed obstruction removal All quickly resolved by staff Key cards did not work one day and required reprogramming by front desk but that seems to be a problem with the technology since it occurred to us at another hotel during our trip , Very nice new facilities in an area which would appear far away from tourist attractions However the hotel was very well connected to downtown by tram 3 min walk less than 15 min tram ride to train by metro 3 min walk 5 min metro ride and to the airport by metro rail less than 10 min rail ride It was at the end of our holiday so we wanted to be close to the airport 
267539,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The area its in isn t the most nicest of areas construction work going on across the road there s a police station next door and on the other side a TV station tracel to Amsterdam is half hour on a bus, We enjoyed the hotel we went for a little break after are wedding the hotel staff was polite spoke English the hotel was gorgeous couldn t asked for anything better sauna is out of this world but is not in with the price you pay for hotel which it should be 
267540,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The only bad point was the check in procedure There was one member of staff trying to check people in answer the phone as a receptionist and help people to check in automatically when the software was not working correctly She did here best but the software was clearly not fit for purpose , Room was comfortable and everything worked 
267541,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent hotel u can check in and check out by yourself no waiting excellent modern facilities nice rooms and good bsr and restaursnt staff are excellent one of the best hotels ive stayed in
267542,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The location is not perfect but then again it depends on the purpose of your visit It is close to Amsterdam Zuid which is convenient for Schipol and many businesses located in the area The area is in transition an not the most attractive , Fantastic facilities very modern and clean Brilliant spa pool sauna hammam massage etc
267543,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The air conditioning was chilling and could not be regulated in each bedroom Like spending 5 days in a freezer There are no restaurants or bars in the surroundings and the personnel can t give you much info on practically anything, Very good beds the lift and the internet Wi Fi 
267544,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The price quality ratio is in my view bad For this price I could also be in the centre of Amsterdam Room was rather small , It is okey hotel happens to be close to my appointment But that is about it 
267545,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, First impressions of the location are not especially good what with the building site on the other side of the road and the hotel being surrounded by industrial units , The hotel is good for transport links into the City Centre Our room was very comfortable and quiet and the breakfast was excellent All the staff we had dealings with were extremely helpful and friendly and made us feel very welcome 
267546,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, The lady is the spa was really rude to us grabbed me by the arm and tried to tell me off for not listening to her when all I was doing was looking in the direction she said the changing rooms were in Felt really disrespected and I didn t even want to stay in the spa due to how uncomfortable she made me feel , Hotel is well designed nice and clean Really welcoming country dutch locals are lovely and really helpful
267547,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Poor location 22 30 taxi or uber in to the Amsterdam City Centre or a 45min worth or public transport on few routes not ideal at all, Good facilities and comfort
267548,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, No kettle in room although they did fix this quickly when we pointed it out no bar downstairs to sit in and a little card with directions on it would have been nice , Managed to accomodate an extra person without hassle at very short notice staff very friendly and fixed things quickly 
267549,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Cost to pay for a swim it should come on the cost of the room 15 00 each person was a bit much so put me of using facilities could not open Windows as design not meant for this felt stuffy, Staff were very friendly and helpful location was good for metro and tram
267550,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, the location was a bit off but very manageable It is very well connected via tram 2 and metro 50 , fantastic place very well maintained and great staff the rooms weren t small very adequate happy overall
267551,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Everything was broken the night time manager security was rude and grumpy You don t get any real benefits as a guest the view neighbourhood is a shambles and its far from the town centre , The rooms where spacious the hotel was clean and the vitality spa was beautiful 
267552,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, There was some disorganisation in regards to our room booking perhaps some of the staff were new inexperienced either way issues were dealt with promptly , The Spa and the Spa staff were amazing They were extremely kind and performed all services to a high standard Thank you so much for the incredible treatments A wonderful room was provided Some of the hotel staff were very accommodating and helped us with some sightseeing planning 
267553,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Possibility to pay only for Sauna suggesting some weekends packages Room Sauna or Hamama or both, As an Oriental person I liked very much how tea is prepared for breakfast not tyhe ugly tea bags as well as its availability in the SPA
267554,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Did mention upon booking that we were on a honeymoon trip but nothing was prepared or offered for the occasion Wifi was ok but shaky at times Carpet stains could have been shampooed Even as guests we had to pay for spa use , Hotel is modern and nicely located with easy transportation links Check in was smooth and room was to my convenience Staff was very warm and helpful Had a great time in the Spa and facilities were enjoyable 
267555,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Pool was unavailable until the final morning of my three day stay It was worth waiting for but I booked the hotel because of the pool and it s closure was unfortunate , Splendid friendly staff Seda at reception lady with glasses in the spa very helpful and efficient 
267556,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We booked a junior suite as it had a separate seating area but the room we had didn t Didn t really go out their way to help We ordered food at the Spa but it never arrived again they were full of apologies promised that someone would contact us to make it right but again nothing was done , No complaints about the staff room was huge spa was great It was also very quiet with pretty reasonable access to the city centre 
267557,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, So far away from the center It took like 45 minutes from the Central Station by tram Then 10 minutes by walking The safe in the room was broken even though it was a new hotel Had to wait to get it fixed , New and clean
267558,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Found some staff unprofessional They asked us to pay for breakfast before we sat down even though we had already prepaid When they realised the mistake the offending staff member didn t apologise ,No Positive
267559,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Attitude from security gaurd to the manager all bunch of unprofessionals, I left my clothes in the wardrobe hanging when I called back they went on like they don t know who I am I had 6 rooms booked there one off my guest was traveling in late so the night staff thought that they can resell the room to somone else when I had checked the room in and collected a room card 
267560,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Overall a lovely hotel however there was a mess up with our booking and we were given a twin rather than a double which we were not happy with The hotel managed to give us a double from our second night onwards ,No Positive
267561,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Rude staff at reception Had to pay an extra city tax Awful service and food at ay restaurant at the hotel Cold burger and raw salty chips and really undercooked Staff were very slow and had no knowledge of menu We decided to have breakfast one morning and had to pay 19 euro each I got room service one night and the room cleaner did not take it away we also stripped our bed as we wanted it changed however they staff made the bed up with no sheets , Bed was very comfy The room was nicely decorated however some parts of the wall closest to the ground were not finished I e missing wall paper Good spa however pool was not working but we got it half price Massages very nice Breakfast was hood however very expensive Little shop also good 
267562,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We couldn t turn off the aircon in the room , You couldn t fault the staff they were super friendly and helpful The gym facilities and spa was an excellent addition it certainly made our stay a lot more pleasant I would stay here again 
267563,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, We had to do self check in and out and then once again personally with the receptionist The breakfast was so expensive that we did not tried it finally It was no use to turn off the aircon because later it automatically turned on therefore it was constant cool in the room , Tea filter instant coffee sugar and water boiler in the room were my favorite 
267564,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Too far from the center of the city We had to pay extra for everything parking spa breakfast the hotel was expensive itself and than you have to add all these things Lack of balcony, Clean comfortable hotel with a nice spa Very nice personel Modern Free wifi

267569,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Very kind personnel but at the check in they could have given us some info about the area and especially a map situating the hotel tramway station and facilities in the area Only when we were about to leave we saw they had touristic maps they could have given to us The check out is a kind of self service a little bit too impersonal , Very comfortsble room Very good location near 2 tramway station Supermarket in a 10min walking distance Ice dispenser in the enyrance hall

267573,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Long queue at the check in reception desk The lunch and dinner options were good but rather expensive , The combination of the spa wellness opportunities Close to Amsterdam center with fast public transportation Parking on site in front of the hotel
267574,Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam, Guests should not have to pay for spa access There was no soap in the shower and also the body soap and shampoo were the same thing which is disgusting No conditioner There are no windows that open in the rooms so if you don t like air conditioning good luck , The spa is beautiful but guests have to pay a fee of 15 euros
