323302,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is not 4 stars just about 3 stars The first night our room was not available we arrived late and clearly the room had been given to someone else The staff was very rude about the situation and not at all helpful The room we had that night was right by the entrance reception overlooking a main road so was very noisy We were moved the next morning to a better room which was clean basic but had no comforts such as tea coffee facilities The bathroom shower floor was not tiled at all so had to shower in flip flops We asked to speak to a manager about our first night and was told the manager only showed up around 11am 12pm for an hour We waited and the manager did not appear Overall this hotel is fine if you want something basic cheaper than central Amsterdam but still walkable into the city centre The local area bars restaurants park etc make it a much better choice, The hotel is situated in a nice neighbourhood which has a lot of restaurant bars and shops There is a supermarket very close to the hotel The area feels safe and the hotel is next to a police station 
323303,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The finish in the room wasn t great pieces of metal around edging could ve hurt if caught on foot TV wasn t great only had 5 6 clear channels rest were covered in white noises , Staff spot on location nicely out of town and good prices Big spacious clean room with immaculate bedding 
323304,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Room uncomfortably hot no air conditioning water in shower dangerously hot and could not be regulated We informed Reception staff about these issues on our first morning but no repairs were carried out Our sleep disrupted by fire alarm on one night and on our last night at 4am by a guest thumping on our door yelling and using very offensive language Despite alerting the hotel staff to these issues we had to pay full price emails asking for a refund remain unanswered , Location easy access to terrific public transport nice district with lots of restaurants and bars
323305,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Ground floor rooms were super hot No shampoo in the rooms only 2 in 1 body wash and shampoo which is the same thing as soap Not great for long hair and as a 4 star hotel I think there should be a shampoo just for hair Fire alarm started going at 8 am in the morning Noisy once trams start working early morning, The location is a walking distance from the Conference Centre easy to get to the town centre Bed was supper comfy and sheets very soft 
323306,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, There were no tea coffee or mini bar in the room As we booked without breakfast it was not comfortable , Location is good Tram line is at the doorstep Easy to get to city centre Staff is very helpful and courteous 
323307,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Just to leave a short review of the place During check in the lobby assistant did not get up and handled most of the conversation from her seat 3 meters away from me before finally coming to enter me into the system I took a lower floor on the staff s recommendation for better internet it was still very slow and disconnected often I paid an extra amount for a later checkout because of an afternoon meeting and in sequence the cleaning staff cleaning staff manager and hotel lobby assistant asked me to check out because they did not know despite me repeatedly telling each of them The room wasn t fit for a 3 star hotel how did this place get 4 stars In short this is not the hotel you re looking for , Nothing Mate if you re reading this close this tab Just do it Look at one of the other hotels The price Even for this price it s not worth it Come on that s it just move that cursor to the close button Nothing to see here 
323308,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Booked two rooms one was okay the other had broken AC Wasn t able to get it fixed over the duration of the stay and was only given a small desk fan Made the room unbearably warm Also parking was pretty difficult late night when trying to check in , Location was good easy walk to RAI Lots of good restaurants and cafe s nearby Staff spoke well enough English 
323309,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The Hotel was excellent The facilities were clean Staff very friendly I did read other comments on Tripadvisor that left me feeling that he hotel was going to be a disaster but it wasn t Had no issues at all We even had a balcony 
323310,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The air conditioning was broken in the first room The second room had broken air conditioning and a window that wouldn t open The final room had broken Air conditioning but a window that tilted outward to let the breeze in and maintain a degree of safety , We likes the staff they were great The rooms were a nice size and the bed was very comfortable
323311,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The A C wasn t working and it got really hot at night time They didn t have a fan or something and they did nothing to fix the situation , The installations and breakfast were really nice 
323312,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, There were two remotes in the room 1 I don t know is for what very old 2 for the tv I managed to deduce that from the printings remaining and had drained batteries, Very good location But when called wasn t informed there is so much available street parking I was told that there was no parking available 
323313,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Was not informed that the Aircon wasn t working before arriving it wasn t mentioned when we booked in excuses and apologies not good enough as the temperature was in the high 20s It wasn t fixed during our stay a very basic hotel that doesn t live up to its 4 star rating ,No Positive
323314,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, I requested and reserved a room with 2 beds but was given a room with 1 bed Having just been released from hospital I was not up to arguing By the time my husband joined me the next day there were no other rooms available The Wi Fi wasn t working for most of our stay The room was constantly very warm and by the 3rd day the air conditioning in the entire hotel quit working The windows were locked with a key a safety hazard and the front desk was reluctant to unlock them They did finally agree and the room was more tolerable after that I was not given any paperwork itemized bill when I checked out and have requested one by email twice I still have not received it My stay should be covered by travel insurance because of a health emergency but without the billing statement I don t think they will reimburse me for the room or for the mediocre breakfasts we had The price was far more than the accommodations warranted I feel like I was robbed , There is nothing good to say about this very subpar hotel The only thing positive was Loetje s Restaurant at the end of the block 
323315,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The air conditioning did nothing to cool the rooms which meant they were very hot when the weather was good We asked for a room with a double bed and got two single beds instead but were moved to a different room on the second day We also booked a single room which turned out to be a tiny loft room with poor lighting a slanted ceiling and exposed beams as well as a very bad bathroom with a concrete floor The cleaning could have been better we saw cobwebs in the corners and dust on surfaces , The hotel is right next to a tram line which takes you right into the city centre It is also next door to a police station and the area feels safe There are lovely caf s restaurants and shops surrounding the hotel There are plenty of easily accessible sockets for chargers etc in the room Staff were willing to help when asked 
323316,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Air conditioning not working or fixed for three days we were there the hotel was like an oven Pillows one and one without a cover were awful Bed felt like I was at sea No tea and coffee in the room breakfast was poor range no fresh juice concentrate that had to be watered down No bar or facilities ironing board the size of a child s play thing Some guests arrived same time as me and got a refund and walked out I waited for a lift with my bags and also a family with a buggy We waited for ten minutes and it didn t come so I walked down two flights with heavy bags I was embarrassed that our client guests stayed there with us I walked in first day and the guy behind reception was far more interested in his paperwork than even saying hello If the window shut in your room there was no key to open and I had to find a grumpy housekeeper to open again I felt like I had done something wrong Have you ever watched Fawlty Towers well this place must be the re make of the TV series , Convenient to Hotel Okura for meetings 
323317,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The air con was broken it was 31 degrees that particular weekend there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room and you weren t allowed to take the cups upstairs No assistance when asking for help with taxis The lights in the restaurant were always off and no one in the kitchen The room was basically a sweaty little box with a miniature double bed in The towels in the bathroom were ripped The fridge didnt work so we could t keep our own drinks cold ,No Positive
323318,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Very good breakfast choice including eggs bacon and OK croissants The property has a pleasant Art Deco touch and is conveniently located outside of the crowd yet reasonably close to both the airport 30min and downtown 11min by public transportation 
323319,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel ambience property management room bed service breakfast everything is a disaster It is a 2 star hotel Never a 4 star If anybody opting this hotel will be a big disaster and disappointment , Nothing to compliment Very very poor and disaster
323320,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Two rooms and no heating in either I was cold and could not believe this was meant to be a 4 star hotel The price was 4 star though The staff tried very hard to fix the situation so were faultless , The staff tried hard to fix the situation 
323321,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Huge price for overall very poor hotel not sure why it has 4 stars Breakfast with NO FRESH food Towels in the bathroom almost in rags , Location was convenient
323322,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Everything, Wanted to put me in basement finally upgraded me to a room where light was falling down side night light hanging floor in bathroom was rough ciment looking horrible
323323,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The room was very very small internet access was very slow and or not available bathroom was very small too Luggage storage does not have luggage tags so basically anybody can take your bag , The hotel is in a very good location The staff was very helpful breakfast host was exceptional 
323324,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The floor of my room was not very clean and there was a sort of vaguely unpleasant smell that came into the room now and then My room was otherwise fine but the family member traveling with me had to be moved twice before she was put into a room with functioning electricity and phone and she was still very cold all week despite trying to turn up the room temperature The WiFi in my room was okay on my first couple of days but it became more and more spotty until I could not get connected by mid week and my traveling companion never did manage to get connected to it in her room In short it was sad that a staff that truly seems to want to create a pleasant stay for its guests has to work in a facility that is so poorly maintained My travel companion an older family member was unable to sleep until placed into a functioning room on her second night there and I need to try to purse a refund for at least her first night , Bed was great breakfast was fine they didn t set out more food than they would use and the woman who monitored the room provided fresh eggs and bacon when asked The location was quiet and in good walking distance from the RAI center where my conference was held Trams were easy to catch within about a block of the hotel ATMs were nearby good restaurant choices nearby and the staff was friendly and helpful 
323325,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The only search parameter I used to find a hotel in Amsterdam was Free WiFi It did not work at the hotel at all So out I go to buy an ethernet adapter to connect to the ethernet outlet in my room Which did not work The hotel all in all is ok but it s year 2017 the WiFi has to work ,No Positive
323326,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, This is not a 4 star hotel Small room with no facilities that one would expect in a 4 star hotel More like a 2 star hotel Too expensive for what it offers Breakfast very poor , Polite staff 
323327,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is 4 star rated seems to be at most 2 I wish icould get my money back , During 2 nights we had to cjange rooms 3 in fact in batroom sticky floor no facility in bathroom even to dry a towel poor soap in didpenser no tisdues in the box broken lamps tv poor or non reception heat warming mal function intrrnternal phone is not workimg Each trouble or two in any room 
323328,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Small room in old and not renovated hotel and expensive 156 euros with breakfast per night with city tax included high price for this hotel as well as poor breakfast The hotel charge me twice on the same price before attending into the hotel and after my complain they returned the money back on the master card after some days , location of the hotel which was important for my business trip 
323329,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Maybe the space under bed is not a good storage place for broken phones and such on Was expecting a queen size bed but got 2 single beds with wheels The bed sheets could be with better quality if it is a 4 star hotel , The area nearby is quiet and nice to have a walk 
323330,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The double bed made of two separate beds and mattresses Not convenient for a couple No water teapot in the room The shower hose was leaking Wi Fi signal is very poor , The staff was very friendly and helpful Quiet in the room Luggage storage room is safe and spacious Wasn t too difficult to get to the city sights but I believe the staff could have a list of tips about local transport 
323331,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Very decent price quality relationship Small hotel in a nice neighborhood De Pijp The room was comfortable enough and very clean The staff was helpful and discrete 
323332,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, I booked a double bed it was two single beds together that were extremely uncomfortable Also the shower area was very dirty, Staff were nice and helpful
323333,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The accomodation is not worth the money wifi and the shower didn t work the room was small and with no amenities cheap decorations , Good position and friendly staff
323334,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Otherwise simply not good value for the price , The location is perfect for anyone attending an event at the RAI convention center The Wi Fi connection is free and fast 
323335,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, We wanted to stay two nights in Amsterdam Booked Savoy as 4 star hotel Drop our luggage in the room and enjoyed Amsterdam Coming back the room was cold The heater was on but not working In the morning we were completely under cooled My wife is at the moment undergoing Chemo in the Netherlands and was looking forward in a few days away and this really did not help They wanted to offer us a different room but the damage was already made by them Reading other reviews it seams we are not the only once complaining about cold rooms Then the hotel has really an issue Never the less you would thing the hotel would have the decency enough to refund you No management refuses It become even worse Via our credit card they even charged us double and after phoning them they said they could not see it in there system and I should send them proof I don t understand this hotel at all they are in Amsterdam at an ok location but they really mess up business in a big way ,No Positive
323336,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, i didn t stay too long too make a note on anything bad We didn t have breakfast or any drinks in the hotel Only thing I would say is that there was too glasses but no kettle or tea coffee , The beds were very comfy The shower was good and stayed nice and hot The tv was good with uk channels and was nice and quite From inside and outside Good location
323337,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Size of the room temperature was a little bit low in winter and I couldn t change it, The room was clean and well furnished even if small for 1 person approx 13m breakfast was ok and position of he Hotel very good for any professionnal need at RAI 5 minutes by walk 
323338,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, It was freezing during my stay in Amsterdam The room itself was cold ditto for the hot water coming from the taps The AC did not make a dent in the air temp I m surprised for a Savoy hotel and one rated at 4 stars Before I forget the curtains were not full length about a foot missing from the bottom so enough street lighting was able to blaze through ,No Positive
323339,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The toilet is terrible the water turns cold suddenly while showering the room s smell isn t good there was cuts in towels and they don t look that good and the room was noisy someone was knocking on the ceiling from the upstairs , The bed and lights were ok
323340,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, We booked a twin room with two single beds but the beds were pushed together and we were unable to separate them If we had wanted this we would have booked a double , Good comfortable and clean accommodation great location for RAI 
323341,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, 2 5 stars Worst managed hotel I have ever visited Went for 1 night with 12 o clock check out Got woken by housekeeping at 10am again disturbed at 11am Holes big enough to fit 3 fingers in towels Mattress never been turned sunk in on one side No Do Not Disturb sign or other hotel info in leaflet it was empty Had to ask for wifi info which we struggled to connect to No lotion or anything in bathroom only soap Went to complain and said I had just wasted my money Was then offered a drink at 11am in morning as compensation offered extra hours in room housekeeping maid brought to our room to apologise Was SO embarrassing for us both inappropriate This hotel has NO idea how to deal with customers Please do not waste your money here ,No Positive

323343,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Smelly room 4 stars is misleading has the feel comfort of a 2 star hotel rather If you approach this hotel with the expectation of a 2 star it s pretty OK , Good location Helpful courteous staff Decent bed comfort Decent value for money
323344,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, When we arrived our booking was not on their list and the staff member said they were full Their internet was down so it looked like we were going to be stuck in the small lounge for the night Although my booking had been confirmed by BOOKING COM weeks ago the hotel had no record of us I should have got suspicious when I had not received an e mail direct from the hotel after booking It was very worrying but after staff contacted the manager who was at a different hotel we were able to be accommodated Don t ask me how if the hotel actually was full , Location was OK We had room 302 which compared with our friends in 103 was reasonable size but still quite a lot less roomy than a UK Ibis or Travelodge Theirs was very cramped and they were not able to get a more comfortable room Bathroom shower toilet was OK Room lighting was pretty dim though 
323345,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, dirty floor carpet rosty radiator in bathroom repaired but unpainted ceiling TV was not working prepayment, it was near to our destination and centre of town

323347,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, This hotel is rated as 4 star but should be 2 star or less Terrible choice and I feel some part deceived as I paid somewhere north of EUR 180 for the night there I do not recommend this hotel Here are some points 1 My room was not clean or at least it felt and looked unclean There were coins on the floor when I arrived and they stayed there the whole trip 2 Towels in the bathroom had dirt spots on them they were also worn and torn The bathroom had a large window in the shower towards the street and beneath the window there was a rusty radiator it did not add to the hygiene level of the room 3 Lights were hanging loose on the fasteners above the bed I was just waiting to get them falling in my head 4 The air condition unit started some loud drumming at 100 decibels or could be even more in the mid night Not able to sleep I complained but the hotel was fully booked and nothing the staff could do When the radiator finally got quiet I ensured it was off for the rest of the stay 5 The bed was a foam rubber mattress far too soft for any regular sized 80 kg weight man to sleep in 6 There was not an option to ask for privacy as no placards signs were available to hang on the door 7 No coffee or any beverages available in the room 8 The TV had only regular TV broadcast stations in bad quality with bad pixels no cable or any HD broadcasting not that I would have enjoyed it in the soft foam mattress bed in the unclean room This hotel is rated as 4 star but that is extremely overrated in my opinion Should be closer to 2 star or even less ,No Positive
323348,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Toiletries very disappointed also no tea maker thought that was poor and only one bedside cabinet for a double room , Bath but wall dispensar for all in one shampoo and soap No info on free coffee available 
323349,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The room was clean but everything looked very very tired The carpet had visible stains and the washbasin had cracks in it the window wouldn t close properly and the light over the desk was leaning against a nearby shelf Around1 30 at night the smoke detector alerted reception of a smoke issue in my room They couldn t call me as we found out the phone in the room was not working so they had to open the door and wake me up After investigation the alarm appeared to have sent a false alarm and it was impossible to reset it The duty staff told me that everything was fine as he would disable the alarm hence I could go back to sleep and he asked me to reduce a little the temperature of the room heating as a precaution against what I had to expressly ask to change my room The following morning reception staff were not puzzled at all by the fact that I had two keys and even after learning of the problem of which they seemed to know nothing none of them thought of apologising for any inconveniences created ,No Positive

323353,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, What didn t we like Everything Where to start We paid 630 on a special deal for 4 nights stay The rooms were small The decor was very worn and old with a cigarette burn mark on one of the covers My towel had a rip in it which tore more when I used it The place smelled of stale cigarettes There was a cigarette burn mark on our bath The lift had a sticky wet patch on the floor in a different place every day from what looked like the bottom of a bin liner There were bleach marks on the carpet by the lift on the second floor which looked like vomit One day our room wasn t made up by the time we got back at 3 30 we were then just given clean towels , The Air Con was good There was plenty of hot water
323354,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Apart from the reception area everything looked very tired Our bedroom boasted two large windows which was nice but one set of curtains were beautifully ironed while the other set looked as though they had just come out of the washer and were extremely crumpled and creased The bathroom had a strange heater sitting on the windowsill which was very rusty The bedroom fridge bar was empty even though there was a price list in the room a bottle of water would have been very welcome , Lovely reception area comfortable bed and very efficient air conditioning

323366,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, I found that the staff were really rude and did not have the best customer service skills also my bed had a dip in the middle were it had been broken and fixed with a piece of wood , I liked the location as it was just on the outside of the city centre and easy to commute to via tram 
323367,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Room wasn t so clean A lot of things was broken and old Absolutely not comfortable bed and sheets And they tried to scam me for 45 euros , Room wasn t small 
323368,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Chek in starts at 14 00 We were there at 14 37 and yet the room was not ready Receptionist offered us to wait another 10 minutes I had to re claim the room after 10 minutes again because it becomes painful to wait for the room after 5 hours of train We re given a room with a thick layer of dust on the nightstand and the phone dirty blankets Also the sink was cracked and the water dripped on the floor through the hole in it One of the bed controls did not work as well It took me 10 minutes of intense conversation with administrator to get aother room Then another 20 minutes till that room would be ready We moved to the other room only at 15 40 Another room was clean though Nobody ever apologized And all that cost me and my friend 150 euros for two days and one night The hotel has a 4 star rating but to us it rather has just one star , Good location not so far from the center Police department is next door 
323369,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, At the check out the receptionist did not give me back the deposit of 50 I paid at the check in She also did not give me an invoice for my stay This was a month ago and after sending 5 e mails and having two phonecalls with the hotel reception I still do not have the invoice for my company nor my own 50 euros back I do not even have a written reply from them You caused me a trouble Shame on you guys , Breakfast was good nice roomview to the backyard excellent restaurant nextdoor and city center within 15 20 mins walk

323373,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, A bit far away from where we wanted to go but we soon learnt about the trams and bought a four days card No problem, The staff was very helpful smiling and made us very happy Excellent breakfast
323374,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, They didn t have an electric kettle so we couldnt make coffee which os a shame Very basic Also the shower head was damaged and had a hole in it so water flow was slow, It was close to the business area and stuff are very polite Room is ok too 
323375,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast personnel facilities like WiFi and TV set No real good service but only personnel that is there to earn money And worsed of all this price for this 2 5 star hotel is really way put of balance On top of that the atmosphere in the hotel the lobby what lobby and the restaurant what restaurant is really out of date and not attractive , It was close to a venue where I had an event Other than that it sucked 
323376,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Website advertises free tea and coffee available yes from machine in dining breakfast area staff thought we had to pay but agreed no charge when told about website No tea coffee making facilities in room Decor a bit tired Handbasin did not hold water properly Air conditioning not very effective Didnt like liquid soap dispensers Rooms adequate but not generous size , Staff friendly and helpful Beds adjustable and comfortable Free in room safe Good TV with BBC Rooms serviced well 
323377,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Was charged 80 euros more than was quoted on Booking when I arrived at the hotel I asked what this was for and was shrugged at Air con didn t work Spacious room was tiny Had to share a double bed with my son when it should ve been a twin room Room should ve had a sofa but just had a small chair, Friendly staff
323378,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The bathroom was modern and clean The room was small but absolutely perfect for a solo traveler also the staff was easy and friendly If you like walking I recommend exploring the area and find your way on foot to the city center 
323379,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, We booked 2 separate rooms at Savoy Hotel Amsterdam costing around 1000 euros total and each room was infested with bed bugs We confronted the staff on the first of our two night stay and were ignored Upon checkout we showed the staff dozens of bites on several members of our group The staff then took 1 breakfast worth 15 Euro off of our bill Awful service We will not be using this method of booking again and most certainly will not be staying at Savoy Hotel on our next visit , Amsterdam itself was beautiful 
323380,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Staff should handle customer document during checked in time one by one to avoid confusion I travelled with my spouse and my sister decided to stay in different rooms During arrival my sister and I go to the reception counter together just to ask if we can get room next to each other After that the staff took both of our passports to proceed for the documentation at the same time My sister booked room for 4 nights i booked room for 2 nights only As result the staff mistaken which one is us since we had same surname Keep on mistakenly gave me my sister s document credit card receipt to sign and vice versa And later on next day when my spouse and I decided to add on one more night stay the reception staff found out that her colleagues who handle our checked in the previous day had made mistakes by double charged my credit card she reported to her manager and he come to see us and apologize He explain and sort out the issue During our checked out time also the staffs 2 ladies do some mistake at my credit card charged extra charged Lucky my spouse checked one by one the amount stated in the invoice and realized there s a mistake However the staffs had done an excellent job on handling those mistakes And the overcharged amount had been credited back to me on the same day , Very clean and cozy room Friendly and helpful receptionist staffs even though some are not so fluent in English but she tried her best to serve and help us with the nearby directions Keep up the good work guys 
323381,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Cleaning personnel could wait for the room to be empty to do their job We were exploring the city and were out almost most of the time but they would come in starting cleaning while we were having rest All the rest was perfect Thank you Savoy Hotel , Perfect Location Extremely friendly and helpful reception staff Thanks for your smiles Breakfast is very satisfying In short highly recommended to spend a couple of unforgettable days in Amsterdam 
323382,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The air conditioning was non functional which made the room uncomfortable , The location was excellent The room including the washroom was clean and tidy 
323383,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Bathroom was dirty Marks on walls food stains Stains on matress showing through TV signal on channels Poor WiFi connection Unhelpful staff Poor breakfast options Asked for a double bed got 2 singles Aircon not working I could keep going give the place a miss needs a refurbishment would rather stay in a hostel, Handing back the key to leave Night staff
323384,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Airco didn t work windows couldn t open so we definitely didn t get what we paid for which is a good night sleep on a hot summer day The staff was not very helpful and no kind of reimbursement was possible A really bad stay actually , Rooms are ok location quite nice too 
323385,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Room could have been a little bigger, Lovely receptionist very helpful Helped us get a European charger when we found out we didn t have one Very comfortable beds Good location lots of places to eat 
323386,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The room was out dated and not clean with worn bedclothes The little fridge was not working at all and a bed socket was broken Also a basin was cracked and blocked so most of the time we had dirty water sitting in the basin The staff was not helpful when asking about transport to airport They offered only hotel taxi service and no other alternative, It s within short distance from center of Amsterdam

323392,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The room was too little for 2 people and it hasn t a window The hotel is at 30 mins from center by step The hotel seems like a 2 3 hotel ,No Positive
323393,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Considering the price paid a room service option may have been nice considering everything closes by 7pm And the only other option to get a quick cheap bite is a tram ride away into the city centre Also breakfast was not included in the price of the expensive room , Comfy bed polite staff and nice and quite after a loud busy day night in the city centre
323394,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Room was very small for 2 adults and a toddler, Location cleanliness helpful with us with a late check out when we were catching a long haul flight with only a small charge
323395,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, When we arrived we was told we had to pay a 75 deposit Which We wasn t made aware of when we booked the customer service was pretty poor as we questioned why we had to pay this when we wasn t made aware and all we got told was every hotel in Amsterdam charges it which isn t true as we stayed at easy hotel last year and wasn t charged this We had also booked a double bed and when we got into the room it was 2 singles But the man on reception did move us Also we paid for 40 euros to have breakfast for 2 mornings but when we come down in the morning there was no one in the restaurant so we was looking about for the breakfast as we was told they serve English breakfast but then we see 4 stone cold boiled eggs Beans with a thick skin on them where there been sitting there for hours some dried out scrambled egg and burnt bacon all left under some Heater on the side There was also cereal and some fruit Quite frankly I wasn t eating that or paying 40 it looked disgusting so I got my money back wouldnt say this hotel is 4 star, Room was clean tidy and comfortable
323396,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The lady at the front desk was so lovely and helpful The number 12 tram stops right outside the hotel And to get the Center of Amsterdam is not too far of a walk alternatively you can walk about 500 meters up the road and catch tram 16 or 24 both these trams go to Amsterdam central station as well Rooms we clean and beds were comfortable We really enjoyed our stay 
323397,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, no kettle as a 4 star hotel I even couldn t have a cup of hot tea in my room although I brought my own tea with me no slippers due to the poor design of bath after shower there are a lot water on the floor so I have put my feet on wet floor since there is no slippers tiny room the smallest twin room I ever seen wife is poor, bathroom is clean

323400,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, No complementary soap body jell shampoo or toothpaste in the room A couple of the light bulbs in the room were dead Dim lighting of the room in general The room is quite small for a double room , Situated near to my conference location Okura hotel Quite near to a lot of good pubs and restaurants Very quite Away from the noisy city centre There was a safe to keep my valuables 
323401,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Although we are young adults aged 24 28 I think the gentleman initially greeting us thought we were young and reckless He soon lightened up roughly minutes into a conversation with my partner , I really enjoyed how informative the reception staff was and how polite and welcoming everyone was I also was more than satisfied with the housekeeping I was happy with the 3rd floor room as we had access to windows and doors that led to a little patio which was handy for a quick cig Although a non smoking hotel it makes you mindful not to leave a mess while out there 
323402,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The air conditioning had a strange Odor , The room was clean and comfortable for one person but small The bed very comfortable which was appreciated after a long day of walking 
323403,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, We couldn t succeed to heat our room even though we turned it on to 30 degrees and slept in total freezing state Also the third bed was the most uncomfortable bed in the world so we all slept in the conjoined single beds , We booked at the last minute so 40 off for a 4 star hotel was a pretty good deal The room and the bathroom were perfectly clean It s not so close to the city centre but still easy to access

323408,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, This property is a fraud for the following reasons In reality this is zero star property while they advertise themselves with four stars Health inspection should review this property as in MHO it should be sanitised before use Room they offered us is in the basement and it rather looks like some kind of interigation room in bed Walt Disney movie I am not sure how are they allowed to use name Savoy but I guess no authority is controlling this Overall I strongly recommend bench in the nearby park rather than stay in this facility, Absolutely nothing

323414,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, No remote control in the room and no TV channels Probably a isolated issue, Great central location loads of parking on the street Very quiet property and right next door to a police station Keeps the riff raff at bay

323422,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, I arrived late due to luggage delay transit flight problem I walked from the tram stop to the hotel 10 minutes in the pouring rain and was soaking wet Despite this the person at the reception made me wait standing for about 10 so he could locate and print the receipt before he even started preparing the room key He finally handed me the key saying that this was the only room available 206 The room was small max 3 x 4 meters and the king size double bed also very small one and half size at the most aproximately 2 x 1 3 meters The room did not appear to have been made before occupation The lights by the bed were not working There were no toiletries later provided and a radiator by the bath tub had rusty connections Wireless Internet was slow stopping and not satisfactory , Located in a good neighbourhood some of the staff friendly and very helpful
