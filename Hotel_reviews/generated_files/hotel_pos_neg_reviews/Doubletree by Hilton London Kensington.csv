24588,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I was not informed at the time of booking and paying the full cost of accommodation that the hotel was undergoing noisy refurbishment The room had opaque film over the window which opened just a crack to look out onto scaffolding and sheeting which covered the whole of the front of the hotel The lighting system was faulty We were moved to another room after we shared our concerns which was even worse Again screening over a window which didn t open It was like being in a prison cell Despite requesting a bath this room had shower only , The location was excellent for visiting London s main sights and access to public transport It s also in a great area for bars and restaurants there s a nice buzz in the evening 
24589,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, They did clean the room on daily basis and also always forgot to refill the coffee BTW as I paid my first night to the hotel directly while following nights via booking com they have charged me wrongly Supposed to charge 269 pound but they charged 299 pounds by the trainee staff pls help to follow up with the hotel to refund Thanks , The location is good One staff is good but forgot her name

24592,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Air conditioning was a complete failure We had to move twice Room 112 it wouldn t get below 24 next room 412 it didn t work at all finally 224 it worked As hotel was fully booked first night of our 3 night stay we were give a noisy cheap fan which rattled away Even the tap water was warm I tried to call their Customer care line but no one answered it After moving ourselves we got no acknowledgement of our troubles not even a drink voucher One staff member told me it was an old building and wasn t coping I heard this at breakfast and the cab driver said he hears that complaint a lot Don t stay here if it s hot They are also renovating and all our 3 Rooms had scaffolding in front of the windows Wouldn t you give customers an upgrade after what they went through Once settled in room 224 was good but faced inwards so was dark , Location was very good near museums tube and shops bike hire right out the front so getting around was fun and quick Lobby was great comfortable seating TV with tennis on and attentive bar and restaurant staff Buffet breakfast good and was included in price Free newspapers in lobby not all but set thing to read was good

24594,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The mattress was really too soft not good for the back , Excellent location lots of nice restaurants in the vicinity very close to city center Good value for money 
24595,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Cost of off site parking The fact the outside of the hotel was covered in scaffolding and we hadn t been informed Worst thing were the bedroom lights They were on a movement sensor You couldn t quietly get up in the night without all the lights in the bedroom coming on daft idea Turn them off , The location and the fact we were on sixth floor Aircon was good 
24596,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, My husband and I were very disappointed with our 2 night stay at the Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington We came to the UK from Abu Dhabi for 5 days the main purpose of the trip being for me to have an operation We booked the hotel expecting to have a relaxing and comfortable last 2 nights in London post operation We booked a Queen Guest Room and couldn t believe what we saw when we arrived to our room a tiny dark and pokey room with no space outside of the bed and about 2 inches from the window was a concrete wall it felt like a prison not the kind of room you would find in a Doubletree by Hilton hotel and totally overpriced for 165 pounds per night We complained and as an act of goodwill one of the managers moved us to a suite for the same price He showed us the room and as we were rushing to go and grab some dinner neither one of us asked why it was so hot assuming the air conditioning was just switched off In actual fact the air conditioning was broken we had just one fan and this was during one of the hottest spells in the year So what appeared to be a goodwill gesture was indeed nothing more than a disingenuous token to shut us up as the manager would have known the air conditioning was broken when he offered us the complimentary upgrade When we returned from dinner and moved rooms we came into a hot and stuffy room which although better than the first room was very uncomfortable We had planned to stay in the hotel room the following day so I could relax post operation however this was not possible due to the lack of air conditioning We were given an extra 2 fans which did not make much difference so spent 2 sleepless nights in the hotel During our stay we noticed other guests complaining about the lack of air conditioning and issues connected to it like leaks in their rooms The staff were not overly concerned about the complaints , The breakfast was fairly good 
24597,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Try to choose a room at the upper floors and avoid the inner courtyard Was a bit noisy and not enough daylight into the room The wifi signal wasnt good always , The personel was really helpful and with a good and positive attitude The breakfast was good and the room was clean Not that big though Excellent location Overall good quality staying in London
24598,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Our room wasn t done when we returned back about 4 30pm A few minutes later the room maid came to clean the room and my son was in the bathroom I asked her to return in a few minutes as we were going straight out again She said she was going off duty and would ask someone to do the room later It wasn t touched when we returned at 11 30pm It was disappointing as we were there 2 nights and it would have made the visit so much nicer , The Reception staff breakfast and staff at breakfast 
24599,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, pillows too soft air conditioning totally ineffective no fridge in room no mini bar in room, great choice of breakfast shower very efficient bed comfortable
24600,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The breakfast was chaotic Very busy fine but the actual buffet area was very small and badly organised For example the plates for a cooked breakfast were on the other side away from the serving area so people were milling about to try to get what they needed I had stayed in the Doubletree Hilton in Glasgow the weekend before and the breakfast and hotel overall was much better , Perfect location We were going to a concert at the Albert Hall and it is comfortable walking distance Mind you that is why I chose this hotel 
24601,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The first room we were given was awful The window was frosted up so you couldn t see out and the shower smelt disgusting as if it hadn t been used for a while We asked to move rooms and there was no problem and the second room was better , Very friendly staff and good breakfast Very clean hotel and good situation as we went to the Albert Hall

24613,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Maintenance work going on but I wasn t told about this at the time of booking even though I only made the booking the day before arrival and the scaffolding up against the hotel clearly indicates the work is long standing It did stop at 17 00 on the Friday but I wanted to sleep for a few hours upon arrival but that was impossible due to ongoing hammer action drilling, Location

24619,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, One night the room was not cleaned at all I found the cleaners and got towels and told them to forget about it Another night we returned at about 4 and the room still was not made up we left about 5 when someone came The stairs on the hall would have been difficult to negotiate if someone was a little disabled The TV control did not work and was changed but would be nice if this stuff was checked periodically , The breakfast was nice The room was a little small but for the price it was ok 
24620,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Renovations occuring which are were not mentioned on any website Despite hotel not being full I was still given a room for 5 days on first floor directly above where workmen were unloading throwing away cement etc very loud , The location of this hotel is excellent easy walking distance to museums hyde park tube station and good local restaurants Staff very friendly

24623,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, room small and cramped no view and tucked away down an isolated corridor Wi fi poor and intermittent Good location and proximity to tube station This kind of failure makes we seriously question why I should remain a member of the Hilton Honours club , Very Confused I am a member of Hilton Honour s club and selected this hotel to add to my account On arrival I asked reception staff at the hotel to credit my account They agreed so to do 3 weeks later Nothing registered When I queried I am told that I do not qualify as this booking was made through Booking com Very disappointing communication from staff Unable to resolve via e mail Hence these comments First time I have been disappointed at a Hilton establishment

24626,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Driven out of our ground floor room between 9am and 5pm on two days by intolerable hotel construction noise which only stopped at the weekend Staff unhelpful and off hand during check in we had back to back reservations and when we complained about noise just agreeing it was awful Finally we insisted on leaving or being moved to an upper floor which was accomplished another half day later New room was small with only a shower and lacked amenities but was thankfully quiet Ironically we went to London for a few days to get away from our own home reconstruction , Good location 
24627,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, The staff were very friendly The room was very comfortable and we were given a complimentary warm cookie which was a nice added bonus The hotel is close to plenty of restaurants and shops It is also close to Hyde Park and many of London s museums 
24628,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, This was the second time this week that we stayed at the hotel What a stark contrast it was I was told that I should park my car on the other side of the road when there was ample parking space infant of the hotel I ignored this as there was no reason for me to move my car The staff were not as welcoming as last time and when I had a query about my Hilton Honours points it was going nowhere Therefore never again , Good location

24630,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Requested an accessible room didn t get one Had to move room as first option offered was a minuscule L shaped box room which was totally unacceptable for 3 people Second room ok but keys stopped working half way thru stay For the money charged should have been a lot better Frankly stayed at couple of Hiltons in London and there s always some stupid irritating problem with every stay Typical corporate couldn t give a damn attitude No more Hiltons thank you , Recently renovated Nice reception staff 
24631,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The room was very small was not as expected for a 4 hotel The area around the hotel was very noisy very early in the morning we were situated at the rear of the hotel so it was not due to traffic noise but more likely deliveries to the hotel , Staff were friendly Area offered plenty of restaurants it was in easy reach of the underground

24637,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, For a Superior room there should have been a fridge with a possible mini bar and part of the wardrobe should have had space for hanging long items of clothing without a shelf at the bottom of the wardrobe stopping clothes to hang and fall without the bottom screwing and creasing the clothes, The Twin beds in Superior room were very comfortable
24638,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Were not offered a restaurant table when ordered evening meal it was served in the lounge and tables quite low restaurant staff did not explain menu correctly one dish was described as potatoes and came with chips Limited dessert choice and were recommended a cake with berries after my husband explained his dislike for chocolate He was served a slice of 3 tiered cake covered in white chocolate shavings no sign of any berries Bedroom was too hot , Rooms very clean and nicely presented Bed extremely comfortable Nice pisition overlooking the front

24684,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The room was a little small , The location was fantastic Near to the Museums and the Royal Albert Hall South Kensington and Gloucester Road tube stations 5 minutes walk Couldn t have asked for a better location 
24685,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, On Friday 7 am the alarm went off twice within 10 minutes and on Saturday 8 am once Not pleasant and obviously no sleeping possible afterwards Unappropriate handling of such alarms in today s world as no reason given ,No Positive
24686,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The upkeep of rooms has to be improved Recently taken over an existing hotel and still needs to be brought to Hilton standards Thought the price was much higher than deserved , The location is great Close to the museums The breakfast was good And the staff was great special mention for concierge roberto and staff at the restaurant 
24687,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The room was very small The decor in the corridors and on the stairwells was quite unco ordinary and there were marked walls and scuffed carpets about The approch to our room was very narrow and not user friendly The room temperature was too cold Poor choice of breakfast food for vegetarians , The foyer and room decor was tasteful The night time lights in the bedroom were an excellent addition The staff were helpful on the whole The coffee at breakfast was very tasty The outside of the building was impressive and it is a well located hotel 
24688,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Housekeeping were not very good One bed had to be made up by the night manager , The reception staff were excellent nabila for her help and assistance with changing rooms and the concierges Alex and Thomas 
24689,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The air con in the room was a little noisy and the temperature was a bit erratic at times , The friendliness of the staff overall The buffet breakfast gives you an excellent start to the day 
24690,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Unfortunately the a c didn t work and we woke in the middle of the night to an extremely hot stuffy room The hotel was fully booked and so we were given a fan I m now awaiting a response from the hotel as we didn t sleep due to it being unbearably hot , Lovely hotel and a nice quiet location
24691,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, Very quiet room apart from the fire alarm going off early n the morning because some idiot probably American as all the guests seemed to be from the United States started smoking 
24692,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The rooms did not have a mini fridge which was a surprise to me but when I asked the reception helped us keep the milk and brought us back when we called So overall it was not too bad for not having the fridge , Staffs were very friendly especially General Manager He was very helpful and friendly 
24693,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Check in was slow had to wait about 25 minutes for room to be ready , Bed was very comfy but room was very small for 3 people was supposed to be luxury king size room 
24694,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The self help breakfast is served from one location and tables are spread over 3 rooms bad luck if you re seated miles away from the food House cleaning came at inconvenient times between breakfast and going back to brush teeth on the one day On another day they were busy with the room at 4pm when we got back from a long walk you just want to freshen up and rest in your room No response from reception when we complained about this inconvenience , Great location 
24695,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, No sky TV anywhere in the hotel Cold water takes a very long time to change from warm to cold pipes probably too close together Very noisy outside at night, The bed was very comfortable staff very friendly 
24696,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Marks on the wall off the room wasn t as clean as it could have been Breakfast was a little more expensive than I had hoped, Nice welcome and breakfast was good
24697,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Pillow quality is poor No additional alternative pillow in room Bed quality is poor and with sound when I lie on it No room size on booking com for consideration I didn t expect the room is so small The room photo shown in website is much better than the actual room I booked , Hotel staff service is great 
24698,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, We had to swap rooms on the 2nd night of our stay due to a fan and other humming noises which got louder throughout the night Also we are having issues with the pre authorisation on our account blocking 300 and the hotel do not seem to understand when we have contacted them and asked them to send a fax our bank telling them our bill has been paid so the block can be remove ASAP They keep on saying we have paid our bill , Close to tube and museums 
24699,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Again it s a great bargain it IS London after all with few if any faults , The staff are very friendly and helpful Best of all the hotel is a great bargain for a perfect location offering easy access to all forms of transit etc Eateries abound nearby and are varied and most affordable Our 4th stay and we ll be back 
24700,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, First didn t have a nice room send me to a basemente room Then had to wait for the new room till half past 3 or 4 Didnt have enough soap and bath cap, Staff and location and breakfast nice lobby bar etc 
24701,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, The staff were so friendly helpful Alex Iriine helped us negotiate cabs directions tours The bar dining room staff were delightful the food drinks delicious 
24702,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The bed for our daughter was an old sofa bed It offered no support and was completely inadequate We were not offered a suitable alternative so we left The hotel has refused to refund us ,No Positive
24703,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, We were in a room with a door outside for the corridor the second floor everything someone went past and pushed the door it would slam shut , Location was good and staff friendly
24704,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Our room was quite small Trying to separate the two twin beds was difficult because of the lack of space and the night stands that were fixed to the wall , Very good location within a ten minute walk of South Kensington tube station Friendly and helpful staff 
24705,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, It is annoying to queue for breakfast in the morning The hotel is even well aware of the issue Why don t you offer breakfast free of charge outside of rush hour to alleviate the issue The rooms at the Hilton Honors floor are ridiculously small It is like coming into a room in a Manhattan hotel All claims regarding rooms being in sophisticated style should perhaps be augmented by saying that it would help if guests are not above 4 11 and or 42 kg Then there is one annoying detail which the reception should be aware of but apparently they are not as they are handling customer s credit cards all the time Instead of asking upfront if the customer wants to pay the hotel bill upfront the hotel staff makes reservations on your card checking if the card is ok What they do not realize is that standard MC and AMEX services are such that reservations get stuck on your card effectively for a month Thus I got away with a small bill paid in full the hotel is not that expensive but the reservations on my card were at the same order of magnitude being very annoying Travellers like myself who are travelling often would not like to have outstanding reservations on our credit cards at the same magnitude as what we spend per month on hotels I can live with the small room but I am annoyed about this kind of ignorant rude behaviour towards even Hilton H members , The location on Queen s Gate is unsurpassed Try living in South Kensington with 200 meters up to South Kensington Station which is I admit a bit difficult in terms of getting luggage to and from the Piccadilly Line platform and if you have a car Queens Gate is the only street in the vicinity where there is a decent chance of getting a parking spot Walking distance to Royal Albert Hall and to Kensington Garden brilliant Location is close to a 10 
24706,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, The staff welcomed us the second we stepped out of the taxi at the front door and their attention continued right up until the last second of our stay Perfect location for visiting the museums 
24707,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, It would be great if there is a mini refrigerator in the room although its size small as much as House keeping staff could be more careful since there is rubbish on the floor when I come back to the room in evening , Breakfast and registration staff are wonderful to treat gently and genuinely Many thanks for Khadi and Irene 
24708,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, My only complaint will be about air con in room Wasn t good enough for the heatwave London experienced on week of our visit , Very clean and lovely room excellent location wonderful staff Excellent breakfast
24709,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Only doonas on bed No sheet under doona and no blanket in cupboard It is always good to be able to have a choice of bedding preferences available without having to wait for staff to bring it if available No shower cap provided , Great location Comfy beds 
24710,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Front desk staff Our dry cleaning was not picked up when requested Both my brothers room and mine were charged for his and my dry cleaning Had great difficulty getting this sorted out Rang the foom at 10 00pm to renegotiate the cost of the room Will never stay there again , Location and cleanliness 
24711,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, Fantastic hotel with amazing courteous staff Room had everything you would expect from 4 star Hilton I had a room at the rear of the hotel so there wasn t any noise from the busy street 
24712,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Cleaning of the rooms is soo bad never seen this before they dont even wipe the water stains from the vanity and sink mixer my hair was left there The mattress is so bad my back still hurts Housekeeping started cleaning the room next door at 8 am on a saturday leaving the door open while using the vacuum how nice is that , Only the convenient location close to the station
24713,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, No fridge as per most UK hotels Maybe hotels need to consider getting rid of the bath Hard to climb over the side of the high bath and dangerously slippery at times thats common in most UK hotels also , Staff very friendly and efficient Room a bit small side but very comfy Could walk around the beds ok 2 suitcases hard to Place Shower fine Breakfast excellent Hot choices and pleasant dining area Excellent wifi and tv reception Location perfect Late check out 1200hrs and given an extra hour also that was lovely Also able to check in earier than advertised time much appreciated clean rooms 
24714,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Maybe the option of a mini bar fridge in room and maybe some toothpaste However this is me just picking I will be staying again Thank you , Staff were amazing and offered our every need Lovely location and very clean would be staying again 
24715,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, waited in check in queue for a good 20 minutes and then charged 30 in advance for any potential room charges Air con didn t work Went down to front desk at midnight to request a fan which never arrived , very comfy beds very central location near to some great little eateries and 5 minutes walk from South Ken tube
24716,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, Swift check in and check out Staff very friendly and helpful Room clean and comfortable Free cookie on arrival was a nice touch Good location plenty going on nearby 
24717,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, To be honest nothing , I was wondering why this hotel rate is 7 9 It was a great hotel with great service and attitude from the staff Even the Internet which mainly all comment talked about is free and so fast it better than any other hotel 
24718,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The Front Office staff who checked us out 3 different rooms is not knowledgeable incapable in the individual billings I was charged twice to my credit card for one invoice FO staff needs training and be flexible to request for changes to names in the invoice , location
24719,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Breakfast and size of room, The staff were very helpful however the size of our room was tiny and I wouldn t class it as a deluxe room which is what we paid for the breakfast was tasty but cold 
24720,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Our air conditioner was broken and the room was very hot The staff seemed somewhat indifferent They did offer a fan and suggested we open the window Sadly the street noise was unbearable so we closed the window and sweated it out for two nights as the hotel was booked full The third night they did move us to a cooled room which was wonderful We were grateful for that In the second room everything was clean and well kept All the glassware in the first room had obviously been used By prior guests as there were lip marks and fingers prints on them We had expected the second night we would have received clean glasses but we got the same ones over again For a hotel which could be top notch with such little effort this was disappointing I wish I could give top marks and really want to say I loved this place but it fell short They are so close to having a really great hotel so I hope they will address some of these issues , The beds were comfy and the public areas were all very nice The breakfast and the dining room staff were wonderful The location could not have been better just blocks from South Kensington tube and Kensington palace Museums very close walking distance We enjoyed the neighborhood very much 
24721,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The shower door didn t close and we didn t receive a welcome cookie on arrival but these are only very petty niggles otherwise a pleasant stay , Great central location clean attractive d cor the hotel in general has a nice feel to it Breakfast also good 
24722,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, I m gluten and dairy free I was really looked after and couldn t have wished for anything better I was even offered soya milk and got gluten and dairy free bread which was a bonus Couldn t thank them enough as I was able to eat the same as everyone else instead of feeling like the odd one out 
24723,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I booked 2 suites and their was only 1 available They gave me a 20 rebate on 1 suite but I feel they could have done more This was a very special week end for my family as we were celebrating my daughter s 30th birthday and also her engagement Not a very good start to the celebrations ,No Positive
24724,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, i Wish the windows would open as I don t prefer air con ii Parking is difficult however there is a suitable car park albeit rather expensive near the hotel whilst on Sundays we parked on single yellow lines, i Breakfast buffet was good and cooked food tasted fresh most important ii The staff were very helpful iii We enjoyed the location iv Premises and rooms were very clean
24725,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, The hotel facilities and location was excellent Very handy to the tube and tourist attractions Kensington is such a pretty place great shopping and restaurants 
24726,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, We stayed for 7 nights and the food was exactly the same every morning Some variety on the breakfast buffet would help Also our daughter s roll out bed was not comfortable, Fantastic location Very friendly staff
24727,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, In a two week trip through 3 countries this was the only bad hotel accommodation and it was the worst I have ever experienced at this level hotel in US or abroad The rooms were awful The bed and pillows were hard as rocks It was so hot in all 3 rooms we tried A C broke in first room Moved from a suite to a twin after begging for a room with A C Originally told they didn t have another room They were going to force us to stay in the broken a c room and rent the one we ended up in probably We were lied to repeatedly Hot in the new room as well and 3 of us on 2 twins pushes together At 3 am I had to go to desk and ask for fans Next time we had a Room with a loft for the bathroom and double bed The loft was so hot It was on the top floor Heat rises There was a small box a c that ran continuously but never cooled off the room There was a crying baby in the next room that sounded like it was in the room with us The traffic outside was so loud in the room as well That happened in 2 of the 3 rooms There were 2 green lights on the ceiling of the loft I think to light up the stairs that stayed on permanently and it was like daylight in the bedroom It had a skylight with no cover so at the crack of dawn more light streamed in After repeated attempts with management we had prepaid in full so they didn t care we literally left in the middle of the night and went to a much more expensive but lovely cool quiet beautiful hotel to get one good night s sleep in London It was the best move we made and we should have left after the first incident This is our 4th trip to London always in the heat of summer and the only bad experience we have ever had with our hotel accommodations I have never had to complain to management about a hotel room before in London after over 20 nights worth of accommodations Management was barely apologetic , Location was fantastic close to a tube station museums Hyde Park and lots of great restaurants 
24728,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The room and breakfast were prepaid and still we had to pay 30 deposit We booked a twin superior room and got a room on the 6th floor just under the roof very hot small window no curtains airco didn t work good They offered us another room on the same floor which we didn t take because other guests on the 6th floor had all the same complaints If you book this hotel don t accept a room on the 6th floor even is it is a superior room , Good location and friendly staff breakfast was ok but nothing special 
24729,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Air conditioning did not work in the room and was very hot Staff could not help but offered a fan The breakfast was the same food every day and hardly eatable , The beds are comfortable but smaller then American standards The rooms are puny Location is what defines thins place 
24730,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The room was not ready when we checked in second time We were not expecting it to be ready at 12 30pm when we first arrived but when we tried to check in after 14 00 when they said it would be ready we had to wait 30 minutes and we were not the only travellers who had the same experience One couple were checked into a room which was already occupied There was no leadership of the reception staff and there was an element of chaos which could have easily been resolved by some senior staff present to reassure guests The hotel has only recently been taken over by Hilton and they need to sort this out quickly as this is a very popular hotel for returning guests Breakfast was ok but not worth 18 50 which you would have had to pay if it wasn t pre booked , We have stayed here before when it was the Regency Hotel and wrote a very positive review about the attention to detail of the staff and of course its wonderful location It is also a lovely building and our room a queen room was beautifully air conditioned This was definitely essential given the hot and humid weather in London 
24731,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The bed mattresses were a little too soft and not very supportive Small rooms , Great wi fi Great service Clean rooms Lovely modern clean bathrooms Close to wonderful restaurants parks underground Lovely local community 
24732,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, No mini fridge had to climb stairs to rooms on 2nd floor elevator doesn t go to second floor , Nice location quiet and close to an underground stop
24733,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, A C broke in middle of night It s rarely hot in London but this summer has been an exception It s unbearable Asked for A C to be fixed while we were out for the day Came back about 12 hours later ready for bed and a c still broken No one ever came Took 2 hours to get moved from a 2 bedroom suite to a single room with 3 of us in a new room Ridiculous Spent time on phone with manager Had to go to front desk to get action and that still took an hour Moved to a small cramped room that heated up about 2 am Had to go get fans from front desk then Absolutely no sleep with a small hot rooms and 3 people on 2 twin beds pushed together Barely apologetic the next morning Noted they are renovating and have had trouble with a c so they knew about it but only wanted to give a small discount off the down graded hot room we were moved to Poor customer service I warned them I would be posting a bad review for their service and asked for it to all be corrected They didn t seem to care so the best response I know is to follow through Would not stay here again if I had an option , I love staying in Kensington as it is out of the way of the busy part of London but close by tube to the heart of the city There are better hotels to stay in than this one 
24734,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The 2 hour delay in checking in The large crack in the window that meant that the traffic noise is early morning was unpleasant The automatic light in above the bedroom door which would not go out final solution from night porter was to disconnect the fuse , The location
24735,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Some of the reception staff were unfriendly and rude The air conditioning didn t work properly in the room and it was like a sauna We also requested room service which took 2 phone calls over the period of an hour and a half to arrive , The beds were comfortable and the hotel was in a good central location 
24736,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I have stayed at many Hilton hotels and found that the room was very small for the price I paid There was hardly any room to move around in the bathroom and I am not a big person ,No Positive
24737,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Room was like a broom cupboard with sanded but unfinished patch of plaster on wall Breakfast was ok but nothing to write home about and the second morning most items were tepid at best , Location Staff all attentive and friendly 
24738,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I am 90 yrs old and there was an uneven floor with a 4 inch rise where I could easily have fallen and broken my neck The room was ready 46 minute after it was promised Instead of a room the receptionist offered me a cookie hardly what I wanted , Convenient location for my purposes 
24739,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The breakfast was not included in the price which was very disappointing We also reported that the shower light was broken at 1pm on Saturday afternoon By the time we had a shower at 7pm it still wasn t fixed resulting in us showering in near darkness , The location was key to us booking it as well as being able to check in before 1pm The Staff were very polite 
24740,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The hotel was over booked and the place was chaotic breakfast was a complete shambles and totally disorganised The rooms were small and in need of a makeover Definitely not 4 , The beds were very comfy and the hotel was is a good area which was within easy walk of the nearest underground station 
24741,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Arrived early and wasn t expecting room to be ready When I returned at 2pm to check in I had to wait until 3pm for our room A little maintenance needed in the room as the window was broken and door hinges covered in oily residue , Check in staff very friendly Bar and restaurant staff very helpful Hotel main areas very well kept Breakfast buffet good selection 
24742,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, No fridge in the room The bed is clearly near the end of its useful life The room was much smaller than I expected pretty tiny especially for two people Pokey gym , Desk in the room Clever and attractive lighting Location close to several underground lines served by 2 stations in a beautiful suburb 
24743,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, The hotel is particularly well placed for the museums in South Kensington This is the third Doubletree that I have stayed in they have all been clean comfortable the staff have been helpful 
24744,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The air conditioning unit in the bedroom was noisy but very minor problem and made up by the very comfy bed , Excellent service upon arrival and a lovely touch for my partners birthday by leaving a cake and truffles in our room The bedroom and bathroom were lovely and confortable and the breakfast was great the next morning 
24745,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, They delivered our room service to the wrong room and then lost the room number that they should have delivered to Took an hour and more than 3 phone calls to fix , Room was very comfortable and not as small as some city centre rooms I have stayed in Location is brilliant South Kensington is a very handy tube stop and only 5 mins away 
24746,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Cleaning staff careless on soap replacements and water replacements Rather than cleaning an obviously dirty linen they just turned it upside down Cleaning staff leaves used towels on the sink neither replaced nor put away Have travelled a lot and this staff was below par for such a hotel chain The official shampoo lotion in the rooms virtually impossible to use they come in these lean tall cylindrical bottles that are too hard to squeeze any product out of and the rubber top too tight for product to be shaken out What a waste of product money Don t think this was EVER tested by those that designed those bottles Water pressure in showers very low Not THAT close to subway stops , Welcome staff concierge friendly and helpful 
24747,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Avoid the terribly overpriced breakfast joint nearby It looks nice but tt was quite terrible, Comfortable and convenient if a bit pricey But that s London I suppose Twin room a little small but well equipped and perfect for a two night stay 
24748,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Night staff not so good manager shouting at staff on reception bar staff slow got wrong orders forgot order Kettle in room leaked , Day staff were great 
24749,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, No shaver plug for my toothbrush wi fi erratic no bottled water and tap water tasted grim TV did not afford radio room quite cramped, Close to the museums and restaurant we visited
24750,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, If a fridge and a coffee maker are installed it would be more comfortable , Staff is frendly and listen to my requests very nicely Good access to the locations with tube and bus Supermarket cafe and restaurant just in minutes walk 
24751,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, My room wasn t cleaned for two days despite information to the reception three times After the third time I went for dinner when coming back they had literally thrown some towels on my bed thats what they called cleaning see photo attached if you don t believe it I couldn t trust my eyes seeing this In a four star hotel that is I then insisted on receiving another clean room In booth rooms the aircon was not working it was boiling hot Water pressure was so low that water only comes out dribbling when i tried to order dinner to the room I was told I will receive a call back which I never did As it was already midnight when I returned from work I then went to bed hungry reception desk staff doesn t know the area I was sent in the wrong direction twice when asking for the way to the Themse ,No Positive
24752,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Rooms were very cramped with a huge carpeted step not clearly marked which was a big trip hazard You had to ask to get adequate soap and towels Staff struggled to speak English There was no fridge at all in room I have never seen this before in a 4 star hotel especially a Hilton I requested an iron twice and it never arrived although I was told it would come straight away both times In all a very disappointing experience Then to top it off when we checked out we were charged twice We realised immediately and were told this was normal as they process the credit card on registration so you pay up front although were were clearly told pre authorisation is NEVER PROCESSED but then on discharge you pay bill completed with extras They do not reverse original charge for up to to a week later Their attitude and handling of our complaint on this was very much that they don t care In all this was my a good experience I would never recommend this hotel and will not stay at Hilton again , Room was clean As it should be That s the only positive I can find 
24753,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Nothing, The minute we walked in the door we felt so welcomed by all of the staff and throughout our stay They were so nice The bed was so comfortable and the rooms were very quiet The breakfast in the morning was brilliant The food was extremely fresh and there was loads there The location was excellent with only a short walk to the many restaurants and South Kensington Station 
24754,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Air conditioning did not cool the room enough The shower was absolutely horrendous It basically dribbled on you The bed was uncomfortable And it was my partners 21st and I requested something a little more for his birthday maybe even a balloon to make the trip perfect but that seemed to be ignored , Room was very clean Reception area very lovely In perfect location 
24755,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Arrived at hotel 2 20pm to be told our room not ready Very disappointing when we were told we could book in from 2pm We needed to get ready as we had early table booked at a restaurant and evening show When finally showed to our room just after 3pm the air con wasn t working and the room was very warm We were moved to a smaller room around 3 20pm which left less than an hour to get ready This did somewhat spoil our experience as we had a long journey so no time for a rest The air con in this room stopped working in the middle of the night which meant a very uncomfortable nights sleep The staff were apologetic and did try their best to help but there seemed a lack of overall leadership in the Reception area which probably needs addressing Surprisingly for a hotel of this standing there was no visible bar so when we ordered drinks they weren t poured in front of us The staff disappeared to what may have been a kitchen and then reappeared some time later with the drinks When paying 17 for 2 drinks it would have added to the experience to have seen them being poured at the bar , Breakfast was excellent as were the staff waiting on Very attentive friendly and helpful Very clean Staff helpful and cared for luggage on day of leaving so that we could sightsee without it 
24756,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Thick wire hang in a loop along 1 wall near ceiling not a good impression although not dangerous , Room was clean Bed very comfortable Great bathroom Breakfast was lovely Staff efficient and friendly Late check out 
24757,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Maybe extra milk capsules and coffee in our room I know we could order more with room service but sometimes its just the ability to have another when we want one and not when we order one , The friendly staff the lovely entrance the spacious dining room and comfort of our room
24758,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Aircon although set to coolest setting was almost unnoticeable This could be improved , Room was clean well furnished and location was fantastic Good value Perfect for Kensington palace and the museums Great local restaurants

24762,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Breakfast Plastic ham and cheese on offer Small selection Cramped room even though it was a superior queen room Not my idea of a 4 star hotel , Good location
24763,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I informed them well in advance that I would be arriving early and asked for my room to be ready asap I was kept waiting for hours for my room I was told if I upgraded I could get a room immediately I found this inappropriate Only when I asked to speak to a manager there wasn t one on duty did I suddenly get a room The air con didn t work and despite informing them early in my stay it was never repaired My room wasn t cleaned on the one day either , Gerald in the dining room was the only pleasant and customer orientated person in the entire place

24765,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Fitness room a big disappointment Too small and insufficient equipment which was why I had booked over other options , Very clean room with comfortable bed Good location and quiet for Central London 
24766,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Average breakfast fire alarm sounded twice for no reason once at 11pm and once at 6am empty bottle of beer and red gel nail under the bed so much for cleaning , Location is excelent quiet area lots of restaurants and supermarkets nearby 5 minutes walk to subway walkable distance to city centre next to Natural History Museum Science Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum

24768,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, It was very nice Great location The concierge helped arrange airport transport to and from hotel The concierge also helped arrang a day tour for us Very helpful and friendly 
24769,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The very noisy air conditioning unit It was still noisy even when switched off This was reported to the reception about 6 00pm but nothing was done therefore a restless night , The location
24770,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, the room was quite noisy on an evening therefore I would ask for a room without a street view Child s pull out bed was very narrow and the metal frame when opened I thought quite dangerous , Staff were very friendly and efficient The location was perfect and within walking distance of the tube station with lots of cafes and bars located nearby 
24771,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Room location was a bit up and down Evening eating service was not good waited over an hour for soup roll and fries which were cold Sound proofing could be better 5am showering and shaving not appreciated , Friendly staff on arrival and in the breakfast room Room clean and adequate

24851,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Not exactly major but the breakfast choice of only two small conserve pots marmalade and strawberry jam on each table is plain daft if not downright mean There should be a much wider choice available say near the toast machine so that clients can select what they want and not what they re told to have I m quite partial to honey and I don t want it out of some big pot as was the case , Polite friendly and helpful staff A lovely comfortable building Excellent location

24863,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I was unaware the hotel had changed hands in October until I received an e mail from booking com the day before our visit not sure who was at fault booking com or the hotel for that one I had booked a club suite in June as a special treat we arrived at the hotel early so booked in stored our luggage and went out for a while We returned later to get our key and were given our room number We went to the room to find that instead of the suite we had booked we had been given one of the smaller rooms in the hotel When we returned to reception and spoke to the manager he told us that the room was being worked on and that we couldn t have it None of this had been said either before our visit via e mail to booking com who had my details nor during the booking in process or when we collected our key despite the fact that the receptionist had the booking details in front of her printed from my computer at the time of booking us in It felt like it wasn t important and that they hoped we would just accept it and not complain As a result of our complaint we were given a discount on the room Initially this did put a damper on the weekend and had there been an option we may well have left Having said all this as indicated above we were not unhappy with the service the hotel provided my issue is with the communication and lack of understanding of the effect their actions regarding the room change had on what should have been a special weekend IF we return there in the future I will certainly be checking we get what we ordered , The accomadation was clean and comfortable and the staff friendly The breakfast was plentiful and good 
24864,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, We had an awful experience at this hotel 1 We had booked the Duplex Suite however on check in we were told we weren t able to have this room because it wasn t available Why let somebody book a room that is unavailable We were offered 30 discount and an alternative room but as we had booked the top room this room didn t match up to our expectations 2 We were not told before arriving it wasn t advised on the hotel website that on the day we were booked in to stay the hotel brand would be changing to Doubletree by Hilton The staff were all over the place and didn t have a clue what they were doing throughout our whole stay It also felt as though the General Manager was unable to actually help us and just kept repeating that it was due to the brand swap and next time we will have an enjoyable stay 3 This may sound petty but I know it bothers a lot of women I know when staying in hotels the mirror at the dressing table is quite high in comparison with the low seat to do your hair make up 4 Due to the inconvenience at check in we then didn t have enough time to grab some dinner before going to a show we had booked We stayed in Covent Garden for a couple of drinks before heading back to order room service which we had seen on the 24 hour menu in our room When calling reception room service was unavailable because of the hotel brand swap Why put menu s in rooms Therefore we didn t eat at all as it was too late to go anywhere else 5 After complaining about the room service scenario we were offered either a bottle of champagne in the room or a two course meal we took the champagne offer after seeing the restaurant the evening before didn t fancy sitting in an empty restaurant with zero atmosphere They then said they didn t have any so we got a cheap bottle of white wine , The only thing I can comment on about this hotel is the fact it is only short walking distance from a tube station and it is in a very nice area of London 
24865,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The hotel was undergoing major construction I wasn t made aware of this at the time of booking The staff were poorly trained and we experienced unnecessary delays at check in ,No Positive
24866,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Building work going on early in morning Security lights in room came on to disturb sleep Room much smaller than picture suggests Desk staff not helpful , The location was great for access to west end 
24867,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I was given noticed of change of hotel 9 hours before check in Very unprofessional by both Hilton and booking com both will never get my business again , Not much maybe the welcome fruit 
24868,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Only that we booked their sister hotel near where we were for the evening and we were moved with very late notice for me to find another closer hotel due to refurbishment Otherwise all good , Staff were so helpful and friendly Food very good Clean comfy room Good bar area which was spacious and well decorated for Xmas 
24869,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The rooms are very small and you can hear every breath If someone walks in the corridor it feels as if they are in your room There is massive constructing going on which we were not told about prior to booking The hallways are filled with workers Wifi in the room didn t work There was an Xmas party going on until 2am with drunk people running through the hallways and the base and music irritating anyone who wanted to sleep After several requests nothing was done Wouldn t recommend staying there,No Positive
24870,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, We upgraded our room as we were offered discounted upgrade a few days prior to arrival The room was dark and dingy looking out onto a brick wall Changed back to our original choice which was light and airy and much more pleasant The club lounge was very poor continental breakfast was dreadful Only went in once There were refurbishment works ongoing throughout the hotel We were not pre warned about this It was rather noisy with workmen and fire alarm going of continuously on one morning , Staff were polite and helpful 
24871,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The fire alarms were being tested on the Tuesday morning a note was placed in the lifts telling guests this but not all the guests had read the note maybe individual notes to each occupied room would have been better , Even though the hotel is undergoing refurbishment it did not detract from a lovely stay All staff we had contact with couldn t have done enough to make our break more enjoyable 
24872,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, It would have been nice to have been informed of all the building works that were taking place prior to our stay There were builders and dirt everywhere, The location was great very close to tube etc

24875,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The room was small especially the bathroom which could only just about fit one person in My partner is 5ft 10 and only just fitted under the shower The room had some unfinished aspects for example wall sockets have been removed leaving behind undecorated square patches The most annoying aspect of the room however was if you turned on the bathroom light a large light in the bedroom then came on which couldn t be turned off very frustrating in the middle of the night and you are woken by it , The location was good the staff were pleasant and the room was very clean 
24876,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I staid in club room which was tiny and very cold There was much noise and dirt as they were reconstructing hotel when I was sraying there No hairdryer One bottle of washing gel for all body hair , Great location and very friendly personel 
24877,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Sadly the hotel was let down by the male staff in the main entrance concierge and reception There were no smiles or greetings from them and in fact we had to smile or talk first before even getting a response All three men we encountered seemed less than happy to be there The female staff were a lot more friendly The beds were the most uncomfortable I have ever encountered with my mattress sloping to one side and no springiness at all There is also a ridiculous lighting system in the room When the bathroom light is turned on the light by the door and also a main bedroom light also switch on You can imagine in the middle of the night when one of you goes to the loo and the whole room lights up Worst of all is you can t turn them off I called reception and was told the lights are connected and on a timer so you just have to wait for them to turn off By this point though you are both wide awake Someone has to change this as I ve never seen anything like it Also the fire alarm went off in the morning as we were getting up but we weren t told there would be a drill , The location is excellent very close to the tube the park and shops It is a very beautiful road The decor and presentation of the hotel is also very good modern and clean

24879,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, Great location close to South Ken tube shops etc Nice having the restaurant they made espresso too Only a easy cab ride from Paddington so travelling in from Heathrow Express was very easy or you could use the tube too and then it would be a 5 minute walk 
24880,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The room was very hot I do not like air conditioning because of the noise and naturally we did not have the heat on and we couldn t open a window This is ridiculous and unhealthy Also the pillows on the beds were like slabs , The hotel is very nice and I appreciated how clean it was The beds were extremely comfortable and our room was very quiet This was all marred however by the fact that the room was sweltering and we couldn t open a window WHY 
24881,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, No real bar Breakfast dreadful , location good Free Wifi Club suite was a good size Clean modern bathroom Check in staff very friendly and helpful

24886,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, We paid for the breakfast on our 1st day and was disappointed when the food left the kitchen I think it would of been good but after sitting under heat lamps it all dried up Cook less more often and rotate more often The glass barrier on the stairs in the duplex suite needs extending I kept missing the last step because I kept thinking the stairs ended where the barrier ended , Excellent customer service Location was ideal Very clean
24887,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Early morning I have been woken up by heavy noise coming from the corridor infront of my room due to maintenance work in the hotel Nobody had given me notice about this disturbance when checking in and at check out the front desc staff was careless and unpolite when explaining them what happenend ,No Positive

24894,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The breakfast was the normal buffet fair with rubbery scrambled eggs and shoe leather bacon all for the very reasonable 16 I was staying at the hotel due to its proximity to The Royal Marsden as my wife was having a serious operation I had booked 2 nights stay while my wife was to be in Critical Care unit On the Saturday it was clear she would be staying another night So I booked another night I was preoccupied and tired with the stress of my wife s situation I assumed it would be at the same rate as I had paid through Booking com When I checked I had been charged 159 which more than the previous nights I checked on Booking com for their rate which was 128 When I pointed this out the Recepyion staff shrugged their shoulders I had been charged the hotel full rate and she would not consider reducing the price I was too tired and preoccupied to put up a fight at the time as I wanted to see my wife This left a disagreeable taste in the mouth and I would not recommend the Regency to anyone I know , The room was nice and the facilities ok I would have excepted a fridge in a room of this price 
24895,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, 1 The deposit is not needed at all One should also be able to choose of mode of payment especially if you are using different currencies and cards 2 Evertyhing looks just fine but you can even hear the flush of the next room and they are supposed to be a 4 star hotel soon I don t get that ,No Positive

24910,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The staff wasn t the friendliest I have encountered They were not very personable but more like robots One morning we had only hot or scalding water coming out of the tap as mentioned by another reviewer We also lost wifi for several hours and had a false fire alarm at 1 am which was frightening The room was extremely small club twin as was the bathroom It was quite overpriced for the size of the room , The memory foam beds were quite comfortable and the rooms were clean The location is great for South Kensington with two major underground stations very close by and many restaurants and grocery stores all in very close proximity 
24911,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I tripped on entering falling face down leaving me with 2 blackeyes and swollen nose and swollen lip Fortunately at the moment nothing more serious The step is not easily visible needs some thought Perhaps better medical help more available like a serious ice pack , cleanliness immaculate staff very helpful great value for money

24914,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Very small rooms noisy thin walls and an old type of windows make sure that you won t get good sleep weak airconditioning uncomfortable bed just like unfriendly staff with one exception the young male who was helpful but for example young woman in glasses should work in a tax department not with travellers who come to the hotel looking for smiled staff and friendly service I see it in some hotels fortunately not often unpleasant office people at the front desk who know the rules and regulations and know how to work on the computer this is too little to make it a good place to stay, Excellent location close to the underground in a beautiful part of London
24915,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The reception staff were chewing gum as we checked in the room was booked as a club double room stating on your website a king size bed on arrival we we on the top floor of the hotel with the view blocked by a 1 2 wall outside our window the room was opposite a lift which could be heard in our room the bed was only 5 wide and wifi for our room was 10 extra The amount paid was 258 for one night which we consider very expensive for a disappointing experience was this because it was booked through Booking com I m beginning to wonder , the hotel was in a great location and the room was clean
24916,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Hotel tried to put us into a much smaller cheaper room than the one originally booked Was not impressed thankfully I had the photo of room booked and only by insisting that we had this room did we eventually get it , Location and staff very helpful and pleasant
24917,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, There were no slippers in the room and no q tips I never carry these things on me as they are always available in hotels The floor area infront of the closet and the bathroom was extremely cold It would Have been nice if they included these little vanity things as they can come in handy , I didn t spend much time in the hotel but it was quite very clean and comfortable the room was nice the staff extremely helpful and friendly Check in and check out was very quick unlike many other hotels I have stayed in

24925,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Only criticism was that we requested a room on a high floor overlooking the front and end of corridor away from lifts We got everything except the location away from the lifts We were opposite the lifts and had frequent disturbance from the lift noises and noisy guests which in the early hours of the morning is inconsiderate on the guests part , The hotel is located nicely between Kings Road and the museums V A Science and Natural History Good point from which to get buses and underground to other destinations Hotel well presented clean and comfortable with friendly and helpful staff

24934,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Air con machines right outside my window noisy all through the night 6th floor Bathroom fan did not cut off Very hard mattress and pillows A friend stayed on the first floor and he could still hear the air con machines Front of the hotel traffic noise would have been preferable , Fabulous convenient location The room was very clean and although compact had everything needed for a short break 
24935,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, food that we chose was not well cooked and nothing was done to compensate this Shower doors were too small no parking for disabled people and the room was much too small for the price charged, the friendliness of the staff was quite good
24936,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Mattress was too hard for our liking but understand this probably differs from person to person but it was hard, Clean tidy staff very pleasant and nothing too much trouble Excellent location for what we were doing and parking free after 1 30pm on a Sat 
24937,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, nada, The cleanliness the staff and cleanness of the hotel beauty newly rebuilt etc Complementary breakfast and afternoon vines and beers in a nice surroundings and very nice servicepersonal was appreciated The room was quite small but well organized 
24938,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, As we only stayed 1 night there is not a great deal to say except that we loved the size of the room and bed Everything was spotlessly clean and all staff were very pleasant Would definitely stay again if we have to go London 
24939,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The room was very small quite dark and and drab The floor hadn t been vacuumed well and was frankly dirty and there was someone else s hair in the shower The rubber seal had come away from shower door and was very obviously hanging off Nobody made an attempt to repair it during my stay not a surprise as there was no evidence of cleaning during my trip The toilet seat was too small for the bowl or was not fitted correctly so you end up sitting partially on the rim of the actually toilet utterly gross No complimentary toiletries such as cotton buds nail file body lotion which you would certainly expect at this price range I don t mind basic although expensive for this standard but cleanliness is a must Therefore would not recommend , The hotel was very conveniently located extremely close to Natural History Museum and a quick stroll to the tube station Reception staff were friendly 
24940,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Because I had a screen shot that said free wiki they didn t charge me the 10gbp per day When it didn t work in my room when I wanted to change my airline reservation they didn t have any computers to accommodate guests and that there was probably something wrong with my cell phone I was told He was yelling and surly toward me with his French accent at one point when I was obviously upset There I was in my pajamas in the lobby of the Regency Hotel because it was now 2am and he refused to come to my room to configure my cell While in the lobby my cell miraculously worked On checking out the receptionist asked if my stay was pleasant just then another guest complained his wifi was also not working , Great location by museum row 
24941,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Just a couple more of the little milks in the room would be good as we ran out and had to ask for more , I love the Hotel its beautiful inside the lobby with Orchids the restaurant is wonderful and cheerful The hotel is in a great area for the underground and museums The staff were very friendly and helpful
24942,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, We originally booked the hotel because of the location and being very close to South Kensington station The rooms are old and outdated and the hotel needs a bit of love and care When we booked we advised that we had a 1 year old baby and requested a cot On arrival we were given a room on the second floor While there is a lift to the first floor we then had to work our way up to the second about 10 stairs with a pram not ideal and should have been considered when organising us a room The hotel also has stairs into the lobby I can recall about 6 or 7 times that I walked into the hotel with the staff standing behind the desk and watching me struggle to get the pram and baby up the stairs Staff in general weren t overly helpful and really quite miserable Room was average but definitely not well thought out or planned small space under the bed but can t even fit a suitcase for example new showers in the bathroom but very little pressure I understand London is expensive and you don t get a lot for your money but I definitely expected a lot more I wouldn t stay here again , location and access to public transport
24943,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Waited almost an hour to check in when we had advised our arrival time When our room still wasn t ready we were swapped to a room with three air conditioning units outside which hummed all night , The hotel was modern clean and comfortable 
24944,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, No marketing of facilities didn t realise there was a hotel bar until the next morning probably a good thing in the scheme of things , Great Night s Sleep and good hearty breakfast Very helpful staff

24946,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, Nagi the manager is very helpful and the rooms are terrific The location is wonderful it s like being in the countryside but moments from London
24947,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The value for the money is just not there You re paying for the location which for some will be worth it The staff seemed like they thought they were doing you a favor by being there The room had some pretty major issues for people less easy going than we are the wall unit A C consistently made noise varying from a rattle to a loud bang some of the outlets were broken and there was next to no space for clothing to be outside of your suitcase I will say this we didn t eat there so we can t judge that But with the area there s no reason to eat in the hotel And for women or men with long hair bring your own conditioner They use that body hair everything soap which never feels like it s doing anything , The location wasn t just great it was perfect For that reason alone it s worth staying in I also liked the modern bathroom When traveling internationally that s often an issue The room may have been nothing special but the bathroom was exactly what I was looking for 
24948,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Two staff helpful one good dinner recommendation and pleasant remaining staff curt and indifferent, Location excellent for Victoria Albert Museum and easy walking to the City 
24949,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, We are in 2015 and you don t provide a free wifi You are not a Four Seson hotel you are just a cheap hotel unbelievable The bed was very poor there was something worng with the materess As usually happens in the UK it seems that you are making a favour to the staff to have reserv a room in their hotel , Pretty clean and the position not bad
24950,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I couldn t get more tea bags 4 just isn t enough for one day, Helpful staff who have good local knowledge and help you find everything in this someone what confusing city 
24951,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Wi fi was not dependable which caused us problems with staying in touch with family at home and friends we were meeting in London for two of our seven days Breakfast was too expensive so we had to find it close to the hotel for a fraction of you cost , Location and very good use of space in the room Welcoming lobby flowers lots of places to sit as well as an efficient and friendly staff 
24952,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, My stay was very unpleasant the air conditioner was making horrible noise and was not working properly and I had to change the room the next day however the AC was still not working properly In addition the mattress and the pillows were not comfortable at all The staff reaction to the AC issue was not satisfying they even did not apologise to the horrible experience I went through This stay is the worst experience I ever had in london ,No Positive
24953,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Incompetent staff Need to pay for the poor Wi Fi Basic breakfast need to pay extra for a cappuccino any warm dishes like omelettes etc, Close to tube and museums 
24954,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The attitude of staff very dictatorial The fact that they wanted to hold on to 50 per room on my card for 3 days although I checked in at 11pm and left by 7am the next morning The size of the rooms The lack of an iron and iron board and the disinterestedness in collecting one for me from another room which meant I had to go to work the next day with creased clothes , Not much There was a bed to sleep on 
24955,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, included breakfast is only complementary thus not an extended buffet , Perfect location and very helpfull staff The room was clean and confortabel We decided to take the higher price to have complementary breakfast and wifi included in the price We were located on the 4th floor rooms of the 1st and 2nd floor have higher ceilings and Windows 
24956,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Unfortunately there is no free wifi , Very close to museums area and transportation Personel was helpful and kind The hotel is very clean and smells like flowers I enjoy the breakfast In my next London visit I m planning to say in The Regency Hotel again 
24957,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The front desk failed to send a guest to the restaurant when we specifically asked and gave them a note to do so when she arrived Caused a lot of anxiety for her and us Also we returned from dinner to find a VERY strong smell of cigarette smoke in our room Made us concerned as to who might have been in there Mgr apologized and assured us the property was totally non smoking Not sure where the odor came from , This was a lovely hotel in a great location near South Kensington Hyde Park etc The room was beautifully updated and the lobby and restaurant were impressive as well They accommodated our very late arrival nicely 
24958,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, There was no washing facilities e g small toiletries The room did get rather warm at night Also it seem to be quite nosey in the corridors could always hear doors banging people walking up and down etc Maybe a little over priced The bathroom was very small which may effect some people but wasn t a problem for me There s nothing that would stop me staying here again , The staff and door men were very welcoming and helpful upon arrival and departure The room itself was very nice nicer than expected and the bed was really comfortable The room had a nice layout and was very clean Good option of channels to watch on TV Overall very good
24959,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Having to pay 10 extra for WiFi Bedroom was clean and functional but even on the 5th floor could hear traffic mouse and the walls are quite thin so could hear my neighbours footsteps and TV , Good location for Imperial College South Kensington 
24960,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Location to see a show is a little far out but generally a good location , Slick check in and check out Staff helpful but we didn t need them very much Hotel very clean and we slept very well 
24961,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Restaurant facilities are very poor sort and amount of food in breakfast is unbelievably very poor the personell is rude non tolerant especially restaurant manager is a disaster , A good hotel for a short stay in London

24963,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, On the corridors to the rooms guests were loud , Staff very thoughtful and attentive of their guests I was waiting for my taxi at the lobby and suddenly started to cough Immediately and unhesitating one member of the front desk asked me if everything was OK and If I would like some water The next day the same staff member was making sure that everything on the front desk was organized and spraying a very nice scent in the air The staff at the breakfast hall also very thoughtful The bathroom very clean and no mold or dirty corners Well done Please keep it up 
24964,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, The first night we received a room with no air conditioning and we were only transferred to another room the next day No compensation was offered Secondly the wi fi disconnects automatically every few hours and you need to call the reception in order to re operate it Third the shower flow is very very weak , The room was comfortable and clean The location is great Very nice neighborhood and close to south kensington station The staff was pleasant

24973,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Hot water out of the cold tap had to run it for ages The tv in neighbouring rooms was disturbing , Nice place clean rooms and good facilities but no more than youd expect for the price

24980,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Only issue was having to pay for wifi with our room Restaurant was expensive so never ate there to comment Staff ok although one on desk at night maybe not suited to reception , Location Location says it all Close to many museums and sth kensington tube restaurants and other attractions Hotel recently refurbishedwith good facilities 
24981,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, On booking I paid for breakfast but it did not say it was just for a continental breakfast So like many other visitors who thought the same as ourselves we walked to the breakfast room and told to go back up a tight hallway past the gym and find a room where we were to have our meal The breakfast was pure misery of pickings of fruit with no taste yoghurt thick with watery whey on the surface Coffee was bleak and croissants that needed butter but none to be found , Very Comfortable room
24982,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington,No Negative, The staff were very friendly they have a 100 from the start The Hot breakfast was very good and the choice for the cold breakfast was varied excellent

24986,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Everything really The staff is unprepared to deal with the customer When I arrived I thought I would enjoy my day in the hotel but it was quit the opposite I felt a bit uncomfortable when the guy carrying our bags went inside the room without even asking but ok nothing unusual there I was awake since 3 30am so I decided to take a nap before going to the event I needed to attend that day Unfortunately after a minute or 2 inside the room I realised I could hear every single door in the hotel being shut down and every person on the corridor That started to annoy but I was so tired that I tried to sleep anyways After 10 minutes I was so frustrated with the doors banging every 2 minutes that I called reception to complain and inform I could hear everything outside the room The receptionist was incredible rude and told the hotel is like that he said there was nothing he could do He had the courage to say if there was guests talking at the corridor he could not remove them from there But my point was not that I was irritated that the hotel has no soundproofing I expect at least a minimum of privacy so I can sleep while on the phone I also informed the receptionist that one of the light bulbs inside the room was flicking uncontrollably and I needed someone to come over and have a look He told me he would send someone from maintenance This was around 12 20pm By 1 20pm I started to prepare myself for my event and no sign of anybody coming to check the light I called once again and this time another receptionist told me they would send someone to check Another 40 minutes and not even a call to let us know the maintained was busy So I call again to inform I will need to leave the hotel and no sign of anybody coming to the room She then promised again to send someone quickly and I also asked for an iron This time took a good 20minutes for housekeeping to come in and bring 1 complimentary bottle of water , Nothing Location is good but i can fins better hotels in the same area
24987,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, No fridge in room Annoying when we had a 2 week stay We could use restaurant fridge but a hassle , beautifully designed small but very comfortable and clean room Lovely staff

24990,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I didn t like the size of the rooms as they were very small Also rooms in the first floor were like a maze where we had to go through additional stairs after leaving the elevator to reach our rooms , I liked the hospitality of the staff and the comfort of the bed I also appreciated the cleanliness of the rooms 
24991,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, the room was very small and very basic the toilet and shower were squashed into a tiny space the bedroom was very small for even a family of 3 with no ironing facilities for 200 a night I would have expected a bigger room with better facilities it was probably on par with a travel lodge this was a surprise for my wife for our wedding anniversary and it was a total let down 4 stars 3 too many , the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful

24998,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, Only two power points in bed room on dressing table none next to bed This needs addressing as totally useless if one needs to charge phone iPad laptop whillst using , The cleanest hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in 
24999,Doubletree by Hilton London Kensington, I appreciate that rooms need to be cleaned and was woken up by the vacuuming I then get housekeeping knocking at the door at 9am There should be a system to check when guests have checked out rather than waking them up , I had an enjoyable stay thank you I think there should be a system however when people check out that housekeeping can see rather than them knocking on all the doors early to clean then apologising for disturbing I would have liked a lie in
