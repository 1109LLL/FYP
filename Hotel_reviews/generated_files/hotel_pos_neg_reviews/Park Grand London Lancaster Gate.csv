48224,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The room was in the basement lower ground and required going down and up some awkward stairs The room itself smelled as if it had not been used aired for some time like a damp cellar , Breakfast was good Staff were friendly and offered to help Room facilities were reasonable 
48225,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,No Negative, It was my birthday and when we returned the room there was a small bottle of Prosecco and a slice of chocolate cake on a plate iced with happy birthday It did make me feel very special so a good touch 
48226,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, For the price you pay and the fact that it is a 5 star hotel I find it disappointing that they give you rooms in the basement that have windows looking into the corridor and you feel like the underground is passing right next to you feom the noise luckily after my first complaint to the hotel at 7am the next day they moved me to a higher floor in a matter of seconds the staff was very helpful but in my opinion hotels with 5 should not have guests on lower ground rooms overlooking the corridor , Staff was very friendly Breakfast and afternoon tea are great Room amenities are great
48227,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The rooms were exceptionally tiny and cramped You could barely inch yourself around the bed no space for bags or belongings Given the price I expected a room to be at least double the size No real lounge or other downstairs amenities , Clean room 
48228,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Not able to have late night drink outside at tables as residential area and not licensed Shame would have finished the day off nicely, Great location exceptional staff made very welcome at reception Room terrific bed super 
48229,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Creaky floorboards of the room above , It was the little extra thought that made this hotel the best a cold flannel when you arrived and a refreshing fruit drink Letting you know the weather forecast for the following day and then to top it all fresh towels arranged as love swans when we returned back to the hotel made for great memories Will certainly be back thankyou 
48230,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Rather than boutique the essence of the hotel is actually bijou My room was small no space for a chair and no convenient place from which to watch the television The en suite contained a shower but no bath From the spacing of doors along the corridor it was clear that the other rooms were no larger The staff were helpful but with a touch of a mixture of obsequious and supercilious I have stayed in more congenial hotels in the area for half the price , The hotel is in a quiet road very close to Paddington Hyde Park and Queensway very convenient for central London The neighbourhood is respectable Victorian Edwardian with no intrusive high rise Although I did not try one the afternoon teas looked impressive There is a pleasant looking patio but the weather was not suitable for using it 
48231,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, There is really nothing not to like Upgrade to a club room for bigger space with all amenities , The staff was top class Bordant was fantastic and Tina Truly exceptional service at its best Close to restaurants but on a quite beautiful street 
48232,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Nothing everything was really nice and lovely I suppose a breakfast being included would of been nice , We have stayed in many London hotels varying in price and this was very reasonable but it exceeded the standards of even the very expensive hotels we have stayed in as the hotel is very personal and have little touches that make it special and make you feel so welcome rather than out of place 
48233,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, For 250gbp my room was in the basement below ground level there was no possibility to open the window to get some fresh air inside and in addition it was a very small room,No Positive
48234,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, noisy street car wash across the street my room was changed on arrival to an upgraded one which is located in basement, easy access from the airport friendly staff
48235,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, More facilities and lounge areas, The 5 star hotel room service like replacing the towels cleaning the room etc and very friendly and professional front desk staff 
48236,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Room was too small OK for a night but very cramped with little or no space to put your bits and pieces , Staff very friendly and helpful Hotel Bright and well presented with everything done to a very high standard Good selection of complementary refreshments in the room 
48237,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,No Negative, A wonderful boutique hotel in Bayswater The best stay in London ever I ve visited London more that a few times in the past Facilities are exceptional and the overhaul service was great Breakfast not included was very rich and great value original plan was to eat outside A lot of attention to details All in all a very pleasant stay 
48238,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,No Negative, The room amenities were excellent The staff attention was superb I was received with a beverage They have chocolates and apples available Excellent location close to paddington underground and train station 
48239,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The rooms are smaller than what we expected but the level of service cleanliness and staff made up for the lack of space It seems like after 11pm there wasn t much of an option for food or drinks from the bar Bar is tiny more of like a window in the restaurant but there were a lot of bars local to the hotel so it didn t matter too much , the location was great close to tube restaurants Hyde Park Kensington etc the staff was amazing Helpful pleasant eager to help you and make you feel welcome Staff always followed up after room service or any request to make sure they got it right and we were pleased we really appreciated this For my husbands birthday they put a little cake prosecco and balloons in our room as a surprise It was really nice and thoughtful We didn t expect that We would come back 
48240,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, If I would say one negative it would be that the rooms downstairs do hear a fair amount of noise through the ceiling when guests come through the front door It is not all the time and not enough to warrant a room change but it is a shame it is so well sound proofed from wall to wall but there is that slight noise there HONESTLY THOUGH this is finding a minor fault and not something that would put me off staying , I have returned to the Park Grand Lancaster gate around 4 or 5 times now I believe it will always be my number 1 choice in London now The staff are great Really helpful They are accommodating to your needs from the moment you arrive until you leave It is just a very tightly run ship that prides itself on customer satisfaction Location is fantastic I love that part of London shops restaurants transport and easily in town in a few moments The rooms are great Elemis toiletries are a lovely touch My Club Twin is such a good size I honestly would find it hard to pin point a negative Great stay Cannot wait to stay again 
48241,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The room service was very simple and was only a range of four sandwiches when I rang to get some room service there did not have any of the four sandwiches that there stock We also went to the bar to have a pre drink before we went out for dinner and the bar and restaurant are very small and was really just a room set up for afternoon teas and breakfast, The staff at the hotel were amazing and really made the stay extra special for me and my husband It was his 30th birthday and when there found out we had Rosie and a bottle put in the room for us aswell as a a little happy Birthday cake We also got upgraded for free which made the day even more special for us The room was amazing and the bed was very comfortable 
48242,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, I was in room 007 for as far as I can remember Ground floor right corridor right last room But this room was very small Yes I was travelling alone but the room was mabye 3 meters long But its width I could touch the both walls with a hand , Got a good welcome on arrival free welcome drink The room was quite very clean and had everything you would need Even has a microwave oven The wifi is very good the best I ve had in London so far Skype streaming video is no problem at all
48243,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, We were put in a basement room even though we had booked three nights there Poor source of natrual lighting and no view We could hear the underground trains running all night , Very friendly service and our room was cleaned spotlessly each day Fantastic location close to Paddington Station and Hyde Park 
48244,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The dials for the heating system should have been explained to us the heating was blowing cold so my husband turned a dial up thinking it was for the room but when we returned to our room it was still cold but when i walked into the bathroom with bare feet i thought the floor was was on fire so i turned the dial down again and sure enough the under floor heating in the bathroom cooled down , The welcome in reception was perfect the patience with our autistic grandson was excellent we booked 3 rooms the two twins that our daughters occupied were perfect but my husband and i were in a double room with very little room at the end of the bed this made moving about the room difficult 
48245,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, 1 room was tiny 2 had to go through restaurant to go to room 3 pillows and bed could have been more comfortable 4 room was decorated in very dark colours not a good idea for a ground floor room with courtyard view 5 Booking com star rating was not appropriate Overrated as a 5 star More like a good 3 star , 1 The shower was was good and the bathroom clean 2 front desk staff were polite and friendly 
48246,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, My room was a little nosiy but this has been resolved for a future stay , The staff are exceptional I have stayed in many hotels of all levels around the world but the staff at the Park Grand are probably one of the best I have met Fact

48249,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, I do understand that in a Victorian building it can be tricky to build hotel rooms in general Ours was a bit small for two would have been just great for one Well equipped with bath , Wonderful staff Very friendly and always eager to help This was our 25th wedding anniversary holiday and what a wonderful surprise we got A bottle of bubbly in our room and our bed decorated with rose petals Free mobile phone to take out to town with City Guide unlimited data and unlimited calls was a pleasant unexpected addition to the services 
48250,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,No Negative, Great price and location Upgraded to a club room Beautiful bathroom and really comfortable bed For my next trip to London I will check this hotel first for availability and price 
48251,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Spot on service for the money, We did get super king size bed for standard price they welcome people with hot towel with lavender smell free drink and apples Bogdan shoved us room and was very friendly In room more surprises like towel in shape of rabbit with card wishing good sleep when we came back from restaurant they have recommended to us

48255,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,No Negative, I was made to feel very welcome from the moment I arrived The room was great spotlessly clean and very comfortable I didn t use it but thought the microwave was a valuable addition Never stayed anywhere that provides a FREE mobile phone for use inside and out of the hotel so useful Breakfast was lovely only tried the continental everything was very fresh and a wonderful selection

48258,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The room was very hot on the first night It was quiet enough to have the window open during the night though which helped the following night , Free mobile phone for use during our stay which saved us having to find our own solution to have maps available plus it came with useful tips and some offers 
48259,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Be mindful when booking that it s a Victorian building therefore the rooms tend to be small The one I had initially booked turned out a almost a train coupe size If space is important pick a higher category room and it will be OK , The attitude of the staff is amazing and the hotel is very cozy and home like Great bathroom with tropical shower and floor heating The rooms are comfortable and the breakfast is very good Paddington station is literally 5 minutes walk Hyde Park 7 10 minutes walk

48262,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, If I was pushed I would say I wish I had asked for a bath in my room , It was the little touches like hot chocolate when you came in from a busy day with a little treat of a cake of something nice The staff were very keen to ensure you were comfortable This is certainly a quiet area for central London and a very restful hotel stay We didn t have afternoon tea but it did look excellent value for money in an extremely expense city

48437,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, room 409 has a constant motor noise from ventilation system that cannot be disconnected It is fairly loud when lying in bed seems to be central ventilator on rooftop We asked for quiet room was offered to swap but chose to stay due to family staying in neighbouring room and wore earplugs during night Bathroom fairly cold , Staff very serviceminded and attentive Area quiet Nice clean rooms but small 
48438,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, It is difficult not to mention the size of the room We had a club room 207 which ticked so many boxes but its size for some may be unacceptable The bedroom hallway is very narrow My son was in a single room single bed room 7 and it was very small verging on claustrophobic , Location from Paddington and underground easy walk cleanliness comfortable bed quiet room room was a nice temperature not too warm excellent warm shower good sized safety deposit box and plenty tea coffee biscuits
48439,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Some smell in the shower space though it was clean , Very friendly stuff Georgia at the reception was able to find me me available room for early check in This is much appreciated by me after 10 hours of travel 
48440,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The room was too small There was about 20cm clearance between the foot of the bed and the wall meaning it was easier to climb over the bed to get to the other side than to sidle through the gap Ridiculous , The hotel has recently been renovated to a high standard The large walk in shower is particularly good Complimentary water and fruit 
48441,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Room far too small Gap between wall and bed less than 6 inches Silly Bathroom tiny Had to open shower door to towel myself dry , Good location excellent connections Quiet location Well appointed room

48448,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Every thing OK, 4 Very clean hotel Modern furniture Well equipped Good location Warm staff Very good toilet has floor heater There is elevator Has fridge in the room They provide fruit and water bottle for first night The weakest point is the size of the roomclean hotel Modern furniture Well equipped Good location Warm staff Very good toilet has floor heater There is elevator Has fridge in the room They provide fruit and water bottle for first night The weakest point is the size of the room I was single so no problem at all Really I will book in this hotel if I come back to London
48449,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The rooms are too small considering the price one pays but the biggest problem for me was the lack of soundproofing in the hotel One can hear everything that happens in the upstairs rooms and next door I think that the partitioning between the various floors was poorly done no concrete used perhaps, The location and the cleanliness of the hotel from the linen in the bedrooms to all the facilities including the public bathrooms and of course the fantastic and friendly personnel
48450,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, If the front line is not sure of guest s surname they could pro active ask During my stay they called me in different ways Ms Ka Ms Wai Just to let you know I m Ms To , In my booking I did mentioned that my fight will be arrived at 5am That I requested early check in Because I ll had a meeting at 9 30am Needed a room to refresh myself Unfortunately it was ignored Your front line staff did there best n came with a solution to move to hotel on the corner Paddington Court suites Thanks to them I could quickly refresh n be on time at office 
48451,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, mattress too soft could hear the noise from the bedroom upstairs the guest from the room next to mine smoked and the smell came to my room during the nigh, staff service location quiet neighborhood 
48452,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Our room smelt kind of damp I guess this was because of the poor ventilation in the bathroom , The staff at this hotel are amazingly helpful especially at breakfast We found we had everything we needed the location is great very quiet with good links to the very center of London There are many places around to eat The price is also fair OK it s still a lot but in comparison to other hotels in London it s a steal

48454,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The people at reception made me pay my stay the night of my arrival during check in This was clearly not nice and not an appropriate way to welcome a guest especially at 11pm when you are exhausted The bedroom and bathroom were not very clean sheets sink and shower The bedroom was small in comparison to what the pictures showed and the price of the room , The bed was quite comfortable and breakfast looked fine although I didn t have a chance to try it 
48455,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Considering the price the room was uncomfortable and cramped especially the shower room could not sit on WC as located too close to wall Room d cor too dark Could not open ground floor window for ventilation Bad odour in corridors breakfast area Difficulty understanding English spoken by foreign staff , Flower display outside hotel Large TV Wi Fi Nice area 
48456,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Only downside was tiny tiny bathroom in our twin room , The staff could not do enough for us They were genuinely helpful Enjoyed the complimentary wine soft drink and snacks provided

48460,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, Some of the rooms have no lift access and the stairs were uneven It is also difficult to hail a cab we had to walk at least two blocks to a busy street But using Uber is a great alternative cheaper too The bed sheets were rough so were the towels Free bottled water wasn t replenished daily , The staff were so friendly chatty and helpful To accommodate our requests we got moved from Park Grand Lancaster Gate to Park Grand Paddington which is just around the corner of PGLG it is newly renovated The neighboorhood was quiet with a cafes and small ethnic restaurants within one block radius There s a pharmacy and marts as well

48463,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate, The room I stayed in the first night was ridiculously small located down in the basement without any Windows if I hadnt complained to the staff I probably would have been expected to stay in that room How the can expect people to pay for that room has got me beat , The position of the hotel was great
