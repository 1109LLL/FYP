342039,Hotel J ger, The hostess on the evening shift was not nice Unfortunately one blanket cover was dirty and the hostess said that maybe we are responsible We explained that the dirt was dry and old only then she replaced the blanket cover and said she is sorry Old room decor and disappointing compared to the pictures on the site The bathroom is very small and not modern On the table in the room was a small bottle of water with 4 Euros written on it Too bad they did not attach a note with a more pleasant explanation, The hotel is in the middle of the main street close to restaurants and supermarket Excellent breakfast comfortable beds Large towels Convenient location close to public transport

342041,Hotel J ger, everything was great thank you , Hotel Jager was a fab find Located on a busy street it is a small and quiet idyll with a nice green garden where we had our breakfasts and held work meetings 3 ppl All staff are very friendly responsive and helpful It was very hot in Vienna on the days of our stay so we had some nice fresh water with mint and lemon offered in the hallway as a complement very appreciated The rooms were comfortable light and very clean The single bed was quite big actually a very welcome surprise Our team of three which stayed in the hotel for a business meeting really enjoyed our stay and recommends it to others
