77236,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Amazingly rugby louts singing at the bar long queues at check in dated decor , It was available last minute the staff were very friendly it s a bit 1975 but otherwise perfectly good 
77237,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Can t think of anything, The location was perfect for Regents Park The room was very comfortable and very clean The bar lounge area was very comfortable 
77238,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The room was in First floor looking at the hotel carpark early morning I heard engines , service and staff were very professional at the same time friendly 
77239,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, There isn t air conditioning in every room so we had to open windows to cool down which then meant traffic noise, On site car parking real bonus 30 a day but worth it very handy location to Lords cricket ground Regent s Park shopping cafes in St Johns literally across the road 
77240,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, When we arrived we were given an old room and they quickly moved us when we did not like the room We had problems with the electric cutting out in our room 3 or 4 times not very clever when you get back and it s dark being told to put the card in the electric switch but there was know electric switch in this room it was down the corridor The staff were really friendly and helpful When we told them they did reset the trips for us quite quickly When it happened again in the morning they arranged for Chris the electrician to sort it out Chris was a star and offered to move us to another room but we couldn t face it When it happened again Chris replaced the light then all was OK Chris gets 10 10 , Stayed here quite a few times and it is a nice hotel 
77241,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The room was a bit claustrophobic and the double bed was small when you are used to a queen bed as a minimum In hindsight I would have booked a bigger room A few drinks in the room s fridge would have been good Some of the bar staff struggled to understand our orders they weren t complicated drinks just scotch and dry , The hotel is in a fabulous location just a short tube ride from the centre of London The hotel is adjacent to Lord s Cricket Ground a five minute walk to the beautiful St John s Wood High Street with its wonderful cafes shops and local pub and about 7 minutes to the underground station Don t hesitate to eat at the Duke of York but book first Sahara or Carluccio s The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful the bar was good and the concierge service was a bonus 
77242,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, They didn t have cakes at tea time Not important for us but we noticed other residents surprised that they were offered the dessert pudding menu when they asked for a cake Nothing there , Good room a cricket ball s throw from our destination 
77243,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The bathroom in our room was very small and the air conditioning didn t appear to work very efficiently and as it was during the hot weather spell it made it a warm night , It was very convenient for us as we were attending a wedding at London Zoo so it was only a 15 20 minute walk weather permitting and it was to the venue The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable The buffet breakfast next morning was excellent We checked out the following morning we were still able to leave the car there as we wanted to have a walk to Regents Park which was across the road Staff were all very friendly It is also a convenient place for the cricket at Lords as that is only across the road as well 
77244,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Room very small the bathroom no where to hang towels or put toliteries only one hand towel for a double room The extortionate price for breakfast Easy access to coffee shops and cafes nearby for less money Not enough milk for coffee in mornings To charge 30 a night for guests to park never been charged at a hotel before , Comfortable bed good view easy acesss for underground good area for food and drink
77245,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, I have to say I was annoyed about the breakfast Buffet breakfasts are easy because basically the staff just offer tea and coffee and clear and lay tables Yes like all London hotels they can get very busy but I was not offered any tea or coffee when I arrived the room was half empty but virtually no spare clean tables as they were are all had dirty cutlery and crockery not cleared away I never felt they were on top of it at all Sad because the food was good , I have stayed few times and is a perfectly good and reliable hotel that is ideal for Lord s and Marylebone station 
77246,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Adjoining door to family with baby Not too noisy but maybe put families in rooms without joining doors At least 10 minute walk to tube, Would have thought breakfast could have been included But a lovely clean comfortable stay
77247,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Confusion when booking in as my mum had paid for our stay as a gift and we were made to feel untrustworthy As she was not with us on our trip This must happen when another person has paid for the booking Couldn t understand the member of staff who spoke to me in broken English , Location and facility s
77248,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The internal temperature of the hotel in general was hot In the room I opened the window and also turned the air con right down The duvet was extremely hot to sleep under ,No Positive
77249,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast wasn t replenished quickly enough No croissants bacon or even bread to make toast with , Bed was lovely and comfortable Room was immaculately clean 
77250,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Paper thin walls so got to enjoy the next door room television until 2 in the morning Bed very uncomfortable too and woken early by people passing by in the hallway , Very helpful concierge who are very quick at getting you a taxi
77251,Danubius Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Good value and location Carpet and facilities are tired but price reflects this Helpful friendly staff Ok gym Breakfast not that good for vegetarians
77252,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The wash basin was cracked and looked like it had been for some years The toilet tissue was of very poor quality The general air of a room which was advertised as Superior was of being tired and past its best Only one hand towel was provided for two guests and I had to request an extra one each night definitely not superior , The main benefit for us was the proximity to Lords cricket ground As an hotel it was adequate 
77253,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The hotel felt a bit old and tired there needs to be a better balance between tradition and innovation, For cricket lovers this hotel is perfect just across the street from Lords The pub area was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful The light meal menu in the pub and the large screens for sporting events added to the positive experience There are a few tube stations close by 10 20 minute walking distance and lovely parks a few minutes away from the hotel 
77254,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The breakfast is over priced unless included in the room price and although the buffet is reasonable the hot food is bland in flavour , Very comfortable and pleasant facilities and staff Good bar food 
77255,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Nothing could not find fault, It s just a great location for the cricket at Lords Staff are friendly and very polite service is very good Breakfast always has a very wide variety of choice 
77256,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, There is nothing to dislike about the Danubius London , The Danubius London is a delightful hotel The Danubius is strategically located for just about everything a tourist has an ambition to do For persons like us on a relatively static pension level the latest tariff for accommodation and parking has become a cost burden meaning that sooner or later we shall give London a miss when visiting the United Kingdom 
77257,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, 1 take care more for the old customers 2 the housekeeping need more care , The reception staff very kind The philipino porter very very nice and kindly 
77258,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Our room needed refurbishment badly bathroom was the worst part it was not a proper bathroom for a room in 4 star hotel Our neighbour next door was smoking and the ventilation was so poor that we woke up at 5 am because our bathroom was full of cigarette smoke and the hotel could not do anything for almost a whole day afterwards we even considered to change the room Personnel was very polite and smiled a lot but was not very effective in changing the situation Overall if you can find another hotel not far from the area please do it , Personnel was helpful lobby is nicely decorated breakfast was good very near to Regents park and the area is nice
77259,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The room interior was very run down The armchair at the desk was torn from use , English breakfast was excellent Great location close to Lords Cricket Ground Regent s Park London Business School Wellington Hospital Surrounding neighbourhood St John s Wood High Street and Park very picturesque
77260,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, There was significant noise in the nearby room before 6am I assume this was housekeeping Reception staff is not service oriented at all The hotel decorations bring you to late 80s I guess , Good Internet connection more or less central location
77261,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, A common microwave between some rooms or at the floor would be helpful In case of international travelers like me who fly across continents the hotel may consider giving a free delayed check out until 4 PM, The room was large and comfortable with a good view and natural light It is located in central London surrounded by many beautiful parks that one must visit and enjoy 
77262,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Minskey s restaurant wasn t open and we had tables very nicely set out in less intimate area adjacent to bar but still paid full restaurant prices Having to pay ridiculous amount for on site parking , Lovely staff Relaxed ambience Great fast lifts In general good food 
77263,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Took a while to find the correct booking name when checking in due to a room being previously cancelled from our booking , Location price friendly staff
77264,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The beds are on rollers which means every time you move the bed moves The beds are also incredibly soft and bouncy which doesn t help if they re on rollers We booked a twin room but were only given one flannel and one set of toiletries We asked 5 times over the space of 5 hours if we could have an additional flannel and toiletries Eventually they were left in our room In the room description it says the room is equipped with an iron and ironing board but in fact you had to request them again it took 5 requests over the space of 5 hours The iron and ironing board were delivered but as we weren t in our room they left them outside in the corridor which meant that I had to then lug a huge ironing board into the room It was so big it took up the entire space in the room There is a sign in the room saying that it has been newly renovated but there is a rip in the leather chair which has been badly mended and the room just looks old and tired As with a lot of these hotels there were no sockets by the bed which is ridiculous in this day and age Considering this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel the food is poor We ordered a Quinoa Salad and a Salmon open sandwich and the salad had more walnuts in it than quinoa The sandwich came with crisps which is normal but they were really potent cheese and onion flavoured Not the best with salmon We asked if we could have cocktails but were told that cocktails were off that night because they were re printing the list We asked if we could have a mocha and they didn t know how to make it On the 2nd morning I decided to treat myself to breakfast in bed and ordered a continental breakfast so was surprised to discover a full english instead The coffee was cold as was the toast All in all we were not impressed with the hotel considering how much we paid and considering that it is in such a smart location I would not recommend this hotel to anyone , The foyer
77265,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Room advertised as junior suite but was very poor with two beds made up and little room Television is very strange position Hotel itself was ok with good staff but room poor for what was advertised , Staff where pleasant
77266,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Didn t eat there so cannot comment on the food , Bed was really comfortable and although hotel is a bit dated the room was spotless Fantastic location with rhe beautiful Regents Park just across the road The staff were lovely 
77267,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Finding a sweet in my bed obviously hadn t been changed finding a pint glass with liquid in it by the kettle definitely not ours Complained at reception verbal apology and room was fully serviced the next day but no other recompense offered , Comfy bed
77268,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Wasn t very impressed with the evening meal and the young waiter took my plate away before my wife had finished , Friendly and helpful staff Location of hotel 
77269,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Not being able to access from Lodge lane before check in despite pressing the buzzer , Very convenient for my course in St Johns Wood ten min walk Staff were consistently friendly helpful and attentive Very impressed 
77270,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Needs a refurbishment somewhat tired Carpets look old Toiletries can do with an upgrade to a better quality , Good location also near public transport Bathroom very clean with new bathtub and although very small it was adequate Had dinner one night and food was delicious 
77271,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Nothing, We stayed here in 1976 when it was called Tge Westmorland It left a good impression so we came back It still looks the same with an abvioys facelift but brought back good memories
77272,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, not cheap underground is far but you can take a bus in front of hotel to downtown directly, wonderful hotel in london You know it is not so easy to find london hotels with parking lot This hotel has parking low easy to park easy to take out and safety Also there is resents park You can go prim rose hill by walk beautifulllllllllll
77273,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The buffet breakfast was disappointing Other than that our stay could not have been better , The hotel was easy to get to and had parking and it was outside of the congestion charge zone which was very convenient The hotel was a stone s throw from Regents Park which is beautiful The staff was very friendly and helpful And the room was spotlessly clean and comfortable 
77274,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, One of the 2 beds was way to soft to sleep in Would reccomend to change some matresses , Great location gor us as we knew the area easy access even by bus to city centre Great hotel huge rooms for being London good service nice breakfast im sure we will come back 
77275,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The staff were surly the room was quite small and the bathroom was so narrow there is nowhere to put or hang your washbag or towel , It is nice to overlook Regents Park and the bed was comfortable The breakfast was ok
77276,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Room service No wine menu the staff had to read me the wine options over the phone Very unsatisfactory I got a splinter in my hand from the table 28 00 to park my rental car for one night , Location
77277,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The hotel has good Decour for the time it with built but it is a bit dated and could use a refurbishment Although despite this the staff is helpful and the location is great , We liked the friendliness of the staff who were also very helpful We left a valuable item in the hotel safe and after a couple hours after we checked out we called the hotel and they searched for our item and found it We stayed at the junior suite and it had plenty of room and was very comfortable for us We found an excellent Italian restaurant Firebrand that serves wonderful seafood pizza for a very good price the pizza is cooked in a traditional Italian Oven The hotel is close to the canal which can be used to walk beside to various destinations that are close to the hotel The view from the room was very good as we were on the seventh floor 
77278,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The bed was too soft Main entrance is closed and you have to use side entrance An outside shisha smoking area is located beside the entrance which is unpleasant Room is a bit dated Housekeeping want you out of room by 12noon to clean , Nice room on a higher floor Good wifi speed Located very close to Regent s park with good bus links to the city centre e g oxford st Friendly reception staff 
77279,Danubius Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, This is a large hotel but it has the feel of a boutique hotel thanks to the attentiveness of the staff from the receptionist to the porter concierge cleaners and restaurant staff all go out of their way to make you feel welcome and are immediately responsive to your wishes The room was excellently proportioned and the bathroom easily passed the swing a cat test Breakfast is outstandingly good value with a diet challenging selection of tasty starts to the day and an endless supply of really good coffee The location is great not only a short 5 10 min walk to West End shopping but also for visits outside the central area 
77280,Danubius Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, We were very well welcomed and attended to The food was excellent and the beds very comfortable All in all a very nice time even though it was short 
77281,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, It would have helped if there had been a seat in the disabled shower so I could have used it without soaking wheelchair But as it happened it would have helped even more if when used the shower hadn t flooded the bathroom hall and into the bedroom , STAFF WERE FRIENDLY ON THE WHOLE
77282,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Confusing entrance to hotel hotel exterior ugly and in need of renovation hotel rooms tired tatty and in desperate need of refurbishment , Friendly and efficient staff 
77283,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The air conditioner is a bit noisy in my room but that is fine one flaw cannot obscure the splendor of the jade, The staff was super polite and professional The double room I had was clean and cozy They have a bathtub in my room which is definitely be a bonus point Everyone would like a hot bath after a long tiring day right 
77284,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Location didn t work for me I was there with my 6 year old and nearest tube was St Johns Wood which took us about 20 mins to walk alone would have been about 10 mins and had a bad experience walking back one night after dark which made me feel unsafe walking after dark However if you want to be near Regents Park and Abbey Road don t mind the walk to tube or plan on taking the bus I m sure it will be fine Photos of exterior didn t look like ones on website , Hotel looked nice inside and it was comfortable staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms looked like the photos on booking com
77285,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The facade of the hotel looks very tired and dated The room was very dusty and quite dark as only had one window in a junior suite Also the sofa and carpet were stained but for the price these are very minor complaints as otherwise the facilities were excellent , Great restaurant Excellent choice for both buffet breakfast and carvery evening meal Very attentive and friendly staff

77291,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, My husband ordered soft poached eggs and kipper they arrived on separate plates and the eggs were hard extremely The coffee at breakfast was disgusting Car parking at 28 per night for residents is too pricey , Closeness to Regents Park and the fact you can drive there avoiding the congestion zone 
77292,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Nothing , We liked everything The staff were polite and helpful Room was clean and adequate for our needs The room had s good view and the location was perfect for exploring London 
77293,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, In the booking process I wasn t made a aware that there was going to be an extra charge for the breakfast this made the cost of the hotel for the night quite high I ve paid less for a much nicer hotel The photo s were enhanced the external surrounds and stair access to the gym were not great and not so clean The Hotel had construction works going on in the lobby area so this also detracted from the experience The food was a very high in price Tea and scone for two 16 , Staff were really nice 
77294,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The beds were on wheels so everytime I turned over in the night I felt the bed slightly move , I liked the decor the staff were friendly and the restaurant food was fab

77300,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, See above but most certainly attitude of staff member who checked in my colleague Mine was ok her was very rude , Reception staff rude on check in breakfast very poor quality and choice location was only fair as a frequent visitor to London I would not use this again

77305,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The hotel is not super close to the tube although a 10 15 walk is not the end of the world and there is not a lot of restaurants and supermarkets within walking distance , The overall comfort level was quite good for the price with above average bed and room size The furnishing is starting to look dated just like the building but the excellent service and the fact that the hotel is being renovated is a good sign Being so close to Regents Park Camden Market and the famous Abbey Road is a big plus Room is very quiet 
77306,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, There was some misunderstanding with the advance payment but finally we worked it out with the staff, second stay here a comfortable hotel they started to improving the facility bar food and ice cream available at night

77319,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, There were some building works in progress that resulted in a temporary bar being set up in the corner of the restaurant not great , Got upgraded to a very nice suite but the bed was a little hard for my liking Breakfast was excellent and staff all very pleasant Location was good for morning walk Regency Park and not too far from the underground stations 
77320,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Restaurant was smelly of old fish and not inviting at all No bar service , Excellent location if you just need place to sleep Room was larger than average for London and no street noise Bathroom OK Everything was clean and in working order We paid half of the usual price limited offer online for the booked dates and it was very good value otherwise it would have been a bit pricey

77325,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, It might be a little out of the way in a rainy weather the 13 minute walk from Baker Street tube station seems interminable But I suppose the hotel staff can do nothing about it so that s ok too , Very nice restaurant and good breakfast Normally I prefer breakfast within the price but ok the option to have breakfast and pay on some mornings and not on other mornings gave us the flexibility we needed on this trip The room was not small or cramped The staff was friendly and helpful The bed was high easy to stand up from for people with some mobility issues

77341,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, We were very happy with everything , What seemed like a basic room on arrival absolutely exceeded our expectations on our return Fresh fruit wine and a White Company gift set had been left for us As we were soaking wet from dreadful weather it was just the boost we needed while we changed to go down to eat The bar was very comfortable the food very adequate and delicious Not to mention the staff who looked after us well 
77342,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, staff are mostly trainees and nervous no slippers have to buy some, size of the room is certainly a plus especially given the price will certainly go back buses 13 113 82 274 all take you to oxford street which is a bonus

77347,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The food was fine but not of a high standard particularly for the price The air conditioning in the room was far too cold , The proximity to Lord s is ideal The 24 hour room service was pretty useful as was the breakfast room service Both were efficient in their delivery A smart clean hotel with well catered for rooms A great base to explore a snazzy part of London 
77348,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, We requested a quiet room but were awoken early each morning by the noisy cleaning staff as their storage cupboard was opposite our room 808 They appeared to ignore our Do Not Disturb sign Walls between rooms are thin and room doors close noisily , Very good breakfast Good location next to Regents Park and St Johns Wood 
77349,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Nothing else was to my expectation at all I will not rate this hotel more than three star Poor value for money , Near The wellington Hospital where my business is

77359,Danubius Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The Receptionist on my arrival was absolutely excellent many thanks The location next to Lords Regents Park is great and the good bus service available into central London is a definite plus for anybody not liking the Tube 
77360,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The mugs for the tea making were dirty as they were near the hairdryer and someone had done their hair and it had fallen into the mugs The TV was bit hit and miss , The room was lovely with nice larger than normal comfy beds and clean white sheets The staff were helpful and friendly 
77361,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, I stay at rum 513 and the bed mattress was really uncomfortable by the wall nearside in my opinion it will do it with a emplacement , Excellent location very peaceful area and the personnel in the hotel were absolutely friendly and helpful

77365,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Had to pay extra for parking was not made clear on website Price was too expensive for one night and no breakfast Had to surrender my car key unless I wanted to go out in it Why I still don t know I was chased down the road when I went for a walk for me to surrender my car keys Concierge was rude when I gave up or requested my keys back like I shouldn t be asking , The location 
77366,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast was not very good cold coffee and the main food had stood for sometime the eggs were solid the bacon cold and stale also the cost of the drinks expensively, The closen system to Lords the purpose of my voyage
77367,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Nothing , The staff were attentive and friendly throughout the hotel The food in the restaurant was good served by excellent staff We were grateful for the extremely efficient air conditioning in our room as there was a heatwave whilst we were there Its close proximity to Lord s Cricket ground was ideal so we attended two of the days play 
77368,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, I don t eat alone in a restuarant so use room service breakfast was ok but cold I hate those fried potato things why not proper saute the bread thing is excessive I wasted most Room service dinner is very uninteresting and poor menu wise , the service etc were good location good Car park convenient but expensive 
77369,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, An incense type of smell in the room also a little overpriced but it is London after all , Very comfortable stay good room service and attentive staff 
77370,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Only thing I found fault with was my bacon it needed to be cooked more for me and I am sure had I asked it would have been accommodated , Everything about the suite bed comfortable ample room the hotel location just far enough out of town to feel relaxed but not to far to travel from with a bus stop at the end of the road 
77371,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, No aircon controls in the room which made the room very hot and uncomfortable at night Staff couldn t locate any aircon controls in the room either Shower was hot and turning temperature down didn t help still came out scalding hot , The hotel was clean and spacious as were the rooms Parking on site was good and convenient

77379,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The rate we paid was much higher than for my husband s stay earlier this spring The pedestrian approach to the entrance leaves much to be desired It would be good to have free wifi in the room The heavy steel plug for the bathtub was disguised as an ornament at the back of the soap dish instead of being identified or placed in the plughole and the facecloth disappeared after its first use never to be replaced we had neatly hung it with our towels for re use but apparently the maid prefers to remove anything used once despite the notice on the bed about conserving resources Two face cloths and two small towels would have been nice since we were two people but even the stack brought to us on request lacked those The fire stairs were not an attractive alternative to the lift For future reference a question can guests at the hotel for a reasonable charge use the airport transport that serves the airline personnel saying at the Danubius , Yes the bed was excellent the room restful with no traffic or train noise and with good light excluding curtains It was clean and very well equipped with a bathtub wardrobe with enough hangers we appreciated the steel water heater for coffee and tea packets of cookies and the small fridge The lift wait was usually not long and the ride was very fast The fitness room was a pleasure to use The concierge sent someone quickly with a generous supply when we needed more milk and towels 
77380,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, This Hotel exceeded all expectations and there was nothing I didn t like about it , The bed was enormous and the room was very clean It is a really large and spacious Hotel even the corridor leading to the room was very wide and bright 
77381,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The exterior of the hotel is horrible It looks like a 1960s social housing block The lobby looks like 1970 Soviet style hotels It is very odd to have a property in such a location and with such poor design , Staff is friendly and rooms are clean and tidy albeit very small
77382,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Air condition not working and the room was so cold and I couldn t sleep I called them several times but they told me the engineer duty finished 9PM And they couldn t find any solutions for me And in next day same scenario They don t have Landry service When you ask for a service from concierge you must pay a tip at anytime otherwise they will look you like this The quality of the Soap was terrible , They allowed me to check in early prior 4 hours 9AM 
77383,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The hairdryer was situated by the tea and coffee which made it a little akward , The room was spacious and really comfortable The breakfast was devine and agreat selection

77386,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Bar very dull and un inviting Food was never really hot either in the bar or at breakfast Large TV on a wall in the bar showing cricket and another smaller one showing football Most people were interested in watching the football but staff didn t have the sense to swap one for the other One side of the room was empty whilst the other side was very full , Good variety on offer at breakfast Fried eggs not greasy and well presented Entrance very grand Bed very comfortable Decaffinated coffee as well as ordinary coffee and nice biscuits available in the room Large flat screen TV in room and no sound from the TV or occupants in the room next door even though it was occupied Very close to the Wellington hospital where I had an appointment Very quiet stay

77393,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, As above could do with twin beds in disabled room, Would have been nice if we could have eaten in the restaurant as my friend is disabled and the lift was not working the bar staff did not know how to make an Irish coffee properly
77394,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast warm milk on the cornflakes Conjeeled fried eggs Toast that you had to make yourself and an over eager staff to clear your plates Noise from the laundry room which apparently is in the basement and we were on the 9th floor but they kept spinning away all night and woke me up , Friendly staff Convenient for the tube station Parking facilities
77395,Danubius Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The hotel is of a high standard the staff were both courteous and gave very good service The restaurant both food and service was again to a high standard 
77396,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Service at breakfast disappointing Room not as good as anticipated a bit tired looking otherwise ok, The location and access to public transport excellent 
77397,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The bar is too noisy with television showing male sports e g football The food choice is limited with high carbohydrate and fat content Lots of pre prepared food and the room service and bar menus lack imagination All very 1980 s, The hotel works very easily when on business staff are friendly and the public areas are easy to use 
77398,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast room understaffed Lucky to get a table , Comfortable room even though not so big Reception staff and concierge very helpful Great gym Good breakfast Very handy location if visiting Lord s

77410,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, We had specifically requested that 2 rooms be put next to each other especially as we were seeing our friends family after a long time But looks like this request was no coordinated by the staff properly as the morning reception said it was okay but the evening person said we had a different room , The location is perfect if you want to visit Central London and around 
77411,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, We were made to feel a little uncomfortable with waiting staff constantly hovering over us I know it is professional but we felt hurried both at a leisurely drink and breakfast When an order was made the wait was too long before arriving Breakfast was of a very poor quality considering all the positives , Very Clean Staff very helpful Everyone smiling

77425,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, They pre authorise payment card and also take payment So you have 185 held for 5 days and the 185 payment taken so a 370, The hotel was very central and had 24 hour staff
77426,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Service at breakfast wasn t good As we expected it was busy and didn t mind waiting to be seated Needed to ask for the table to be set up after initially waiting Asked again for a pot of tea after another wait It appeared other tables were being tended to even if they d been seated after us Didn t seem to have enough staff for the breakfast rush Food couldn t complain about Very tasty , Excellent service at the check in desk Early check in upon arrival which was great All areas around the hotel were smart and clean Rooms were comfy and cosy with neutral tones

77430,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, We were awoken at 5am by a loud conversation from the corridor outside the room which later moved to the adjoining room and lasted for at least half an hour Seems a connecting door may have allowed sound to travel further than it should for a hotel of this standard Very upset , Location friendly and efficient staff Fantastic breakfast with the Nursery Ground in view 
77431,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, bed was too soft Wine serve in the bar was not up to standard red and wine served too warm Bar wine menu very unprofessional e g an Italian was was said to originate from Pays d Oc in France and a South African Stellenbosch was said to originate from Australia Staff missed clearly skills in serving wine as well as serving beer from the tap , quick check in helpful concierge cleanness of room and bathroom
77432,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, No real bad experiences worth mentioning other than there is such a small bar for such a large hotel so you can have a wait if wanting a drinking late evening Also we took an executive room but didn t get the bottle water bathrobes and slippers which are what make exec over superior Didn t complain but mentioned at checkout so got parking for free instead happy days , Great location friendly staff good sized rooms parking available on site 
77433,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, shower bath kept getting wet all over room set up a bit weird staff ok but took too long to get served at the bar restaurant, location decent room size

77441,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, The room service The reception was not really welcoming They forgot their cleaning towels at the room once Didn t provide me with the water 3 times that I needed to ask and the breakfast was the same for 6 days , The only advantage was the location is near to LBS 8 min Walk And the old man at the door was so nice
77442,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, room cleaning service was very annoying calling every 10 minutes and asking when it would be possible to clean the room no toilet washing facilities only toilet paper for intimate washing you need to use for example bottle that was very uncomfortable no daily bottle of water you should buy it at bar for approximately 3 GBP , hotel location 24 hour room service breakfast dinner at Minsky Restaurant bar service reception staff late check in and check out

77448,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, Most counter staff had little knowledge of London and several of my questions for example about local parking the hotel s own car park being both ridiculously small and expensive were merely met with don t know couldn t care less shrugs Despite a 6 temporary discount large extra charge for even the most minimal breakfast which may have been in the small print but I ve not experienced elsewhere Not allowed to use e cig in bar adding to a sense of not being particularly welcome other than as a source of revenue , Pleasant enough location just outside vehicle congestion charge area Clean and comfortable 
77449,Danubius Hotel Regents Park, I booked executive suite but given standard room without even telling us First day they offered complementary breakfast for all days bottle of alcohol and fruits although breakfast was not included in my booking Second day we realized they were trying to cover it I spoke to duty manager Hussain as I remember and he advised us to cancel the booking i made through Booking com and make another booking from hotel Which is impossible in the second day And when i argued why i have been given standard room their excuse was at first no rooms available and later on they said because you wrote a note asking for a room near by elevator Ok I have paid for an executive so I expect executive whether near by elevator or not After arguing we ve been given an executive room which means room were available , Location compared to price
