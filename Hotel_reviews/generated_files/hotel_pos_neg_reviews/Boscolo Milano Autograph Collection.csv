304609,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Poor noise control very limited ammenities poor restaurant selection of food and quality of food some staff provided poor service and were rude I tot the high reception desk staff taking down to guests upon checking was a very interesting concept showed how little awareness they have on service and client relationship The only other place they have such concept is probably in a pawn shop in Hong Kong It s a very poorly maintained boutique hotel that started well but ended up more like an Ibis with a posh address Housekeeping and Bell desk are the most friendly , Location
304610,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection,No Negative, Me and my wife visit this hotel for aniversary they offer to us the presidential suite for the same price an give us chocolates and champagna Grat service 
304611,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, They have to check up on the room before sending the guests in Although we had to wait 2 hours to be checked in the first room was hot and the air conditioning was not working properly so we had to change the room and the next room there was a problem with the safe and i had to call to get it fixed, The location was excellent 
304612,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, There is no face towel or tissue box in the bathroom Also there is only 1 rubbish bin small for the entire room which is not that convenient Otherwise everything is perfect , very helpful staff especially when i needed to book the Last Supper ticket and when i lost my pair of glasses at Rinascente they were very attentive in following up with the Lost Property dept of the store On the day of our departure we needed to get a taxi to the airport the hotel offered us their private vehicle at the same standard price as the taxis EUR100 as we were informed which is very nice 
304613,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, a bit expensive Rooms REALLY small nothing like the pictures Windows are stupid they are small covered with curtain and facing a huge wall , Breakfast was nice and great location They also have an awesome Spa
304614,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, It has a five star price for a four star hotel the property was extremely noisy you could hear the next door moving the cleaning was not so good and the breakfast was not tasty at all , The location is the only advantage for the property due to being so close to the shopping and the duomo 
304615,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, 1 Breakfast needs several improvements e g provide the toaster dispensers for tea coffee Poor quality Indian food items 2 Staff could try to be friendlier One or two were good , Breakfast needs several improvements e g provide the toaster dispensers for tea coffee Poor quality Indian food items 
304616,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, the rooms were filthy the maintenence of the hotel was very poor with masking tape in plain view paint peeling unclean floors the staff were poorly dressed and for 780 room no bath the bathrooms had mould in the grouting and the staff were unkept ,No Positive
304617,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, parking to small take care what car you have parking to expensive floor of the Hotel rooms strange Remembers me Shining doors not isolated so you hear all the noice shower not working just boiling hot no bathroom door so noisy if someone stays with you just ONE pretending window hole with a white curtain you can push away he curtain but then you look on a wall ONLY elevators and no stairs So claustrophobias STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE , The location is great and the Hotel smells so good and is super clean 
304618,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Nothing really 6th floor room quite , Beautiful modern room Staff very friendly and have excellent service Was great to be the heart of the hotel and they also made an effort for our wedding Ann Spa included which was nice too 
304619,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, We ve expected more for the price we had paid There was no change of towels the breakfast was rather modest uncomfortable shower overall nothing special in respect that it is a 5star hotel There are better hotels in the same location , Location 
304620,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, i thought the cost of drinks was well over the top more expensive than the maderin oriental hotel was cheaper for drinks plus a world apart from the boscolo also the spa treatments were well overpriced , great location and nice hotel 
304621,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The wifi signal was low in our room so made it nearly impossible to use and had to keep reconnecting Also sound proofing wasn t very good as was next to busy main road which was very busy till 1am , Staff were great and really helpful Location is amazing for shopping 
304622,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Dated interiors very poor acoustic insulation everything that goes on on the corridor might as well happen in your room acoustically speaking the hotel needs a makeover, Great location close to the dome and the fashion streets friendly and professional staff room size ok
304623,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The room service was trouble I ordered a mozzarella sandwich which came in burn out bread and a sweet which look like nothing like the photo in the menu They charge us extra money i dont understand why More than the 5 tax It is almost 100 euro for the 2 nights, Location 
304624,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The overall interior of the hotel looked word down and tired It seems they haven t had any refurb since it was built Limescale in the bathroom and lack of basic toiletries such as earbuds and toothpaste was not what i was expecting from a 5 star hotel , Location of this hotel is truly fantastic fairly good price too 
304625,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The staff of the hotel ruined our stay here first of all the front desk were the worst of all staff they couldn t help us in any situation we faced whenever we ask for something they always don t even try to help they insisted on charging us twice even though I got the message from my bank when I told them that I paid they said no it says here you didn t pay the bathroom of the hotel wasn t clean ecpicially the bathtub it was all stained and had moles in it if you want to have a great time don t come to this hotel, The design was nice
304626,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Staff members broke into our room in the morning with loud noise from 10am vacuum cleaner was on in the corridor and that was very disturbing Our car was scratched on the parking of the Boscolo hotel Room everything was good except the bathroom ceiling were scratched and the water in the shower wasn t strong I have stayed there for many times and this one was the last one , location
304627,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The lobby is really not comfy They were having repairs outside in the inner court wake us up at 6 50am with scaffoldings and without warning about the works when booking Standard Room looked a bit old fashioned and not in good condition feeling of empty places , Great location in the center 5 minutes from Duomo 
304628,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Not a 5star 2 lights not working in the room you check in like in a airport hotel and join yr room with yr luggage , Location and comfort of the bedding
304629,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection,No Negative, Very elegant colorful and charming hotel Prime location in Fashion District and a 3 minute walk to the Duomo I ve requested a room with balcony when i booked through booking com and I was glad that my request was answered by the hotel s management Breakfast was great Overall very satisfied and would definitely recommend 
304630,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Everything was so not nice How can there be no door between the room and bathroom Everything felt so dirty The materials used to make the rooms and especially the bathroom were quite bad I would never stay there , Location And the concierge was very helpful 
304631,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, I think it should be renovated it s quite used , The location is just perfect and very clean also the food from the rooftop restaurant it s very good 
304632,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, That the swimming pool was under maintenance during the time of my stay Hope next time the hotel would add a note before reserving at the hotel since i was looking forward to swimming at the pool Thanks,No Positive
304633,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Lack of maintenace Bathrooms really need to be taken care of also cleanliness is a problem No soundproofing whatsoever cleaning ladies woke me up at 6am with laughter and smashing doors , Staff at door and parking was really helpful Not like the people at the front desk too busy to exchange gossip then take care of the customers 
304634,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, 60 Euro for 1 night parking is shear stupidity Wifi not working only at reception area not even at the back of the breakfast area only in front I expect a 5 star hotel to solve its wifi problems in an hour and not take more as a day Checkout took forever as one of the receptionists was in a hefty discussion with her colleague instead of helping guests , Great design hotel Perfect location for Milano Great staff and friendly 
304635,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The spa was out of order which was the main reason for booking this trip However the hotel said this had been the case for some time so we are very disappointed in booking com for not making us aware Having a spa was one of our key filters for our search , The location was perfect
304636,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, price outrageous poor facilities not worthy of a 4 star hotel no spa or pool available bar closed for private events Unattractive breakfast , staff tried very hard to improve the situation despite difficulties
304637,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The restaurant for dinner breakfast were disorganized particularly breakfast Nobody kept an eye on food running low so all food was always running out Table clearance they could never keep up quite poor , The staff were excellent the position in Milano was perfect The view from the 8th floor is spectacular 
304638,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Very bad house keeping did not do her job sleepers small wc towels only one bathrobe at second day the room key in elecrtic plug hair dryer and shoe horn were missing also she s taken chocolates where i ve put my bed side Very bad spa staff they did not make a reservation at late hours on saturday evening allthough they have spare time check the revz at satuday eve 24 09 no sleepers loud music not enough pro staff Room need maintance water goes to wc and inside when have shower Also we have forgetten a new bottle in a bag in airport transfer car but no one called us back for it, Location
304639,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, I was in Boscolo 2 years ago and it was perfect Now bathroom in room was not very clean tiles were dirty and I was afraid to go without flip flops Breakfast also was worse than two years ago, Hotel is in a very good location there is parking and really good service 
304640,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Room Luxe Really disappointed by quality of services for a 5 SPA wasn t available because of Work without compensation Room wasn t correctly clean We stayed 2 nights and shower never cleaned Cup in the room never washed etc traces of rust on washbasin Pictures on their website with Beautiful view on the Dome and when we arrived we had view on building wall and we could not open curtains because of windows in front of Parking really expensive 140 for 3 days and you don t have access to your car if you don t make a request before Honestly I will never go back to this Hotel, Situation is really perfect to make shopping and to visit Milan
304641,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The pool was closed for maintenance , The decor was out there and funky The hotel was spotlessly clean and the toiletries awesome My pillow was so comfy Top quality helpful staff One of the most enjoyable hotels we have stayed in ever 
304642,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Some rooms that near elevators are noisy because the floor is not covered with a carpet and thus trollies used by staff are bothersome , This hotel looks much better in reality than the pictures on the net 
304643,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, There are details of the hotel as a whole the rooms staff breakfast and the small spa wellness that don t make it quite 5 star The gym has 4 machines and there was no staff in sight to provide info or towels or pick up the phone for room service The rooms are quite cramped and a glass of wine on the terrace was 20 , The bathroom amenities are great and the hotel has a very interesting modern design The location of the hotel is great for visiting the Duomo and the view from the rooftop terrace is lovely as was our burger 
304644,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Language barrier I know I do not speak Italian but for an international hotel I would have thought their English would have been better , Very clean and friendly room service was good although the menu had no price list for it and this was not a good thing and I wonder if that puts people off ordering We had to ask for individual prices of things we were interested in having 
304645,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, We would have liked a view in the room for the amount of money we paid The spa pool area wasn t really taken care of no one to greet us the drink water jugs were all empty used towels left around and we wished there was hot tub , The concierge was awesome and sent us to some great places we were close to everything Our room was a great size and very cool style but didnt have a view the spa was a cool design and relaxing after a long day of walking 
304646,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, In the room they should have even one use brush teeth I forgot mine and in the hotel they didn t have one , The location staff was very friendly and helpful the food was great 
304647,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, I have a really bad story regarding my staying here A shirt of mine got robbed and no one did anything about it A real mess , The localization is very good 
304648,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, room flooded first day after a shower very noisy hotel couldnt sleep for three first night room located by the elevator so noisy and also you can hear the vleaning lady from the floor above you in the morning the second and third noght after changing the flooded room there was a party on the terrace and loud music was playing up to 12 30 at night talked to the recrption but the couldnt do anything,No Positive
304649,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, We had a room on the first floor and it was noisy outside car parking area for a while very early in the morning 6 am which you could do without when on holiday, The hotel was extremely well located and the rooms were a very decent size All staff were extremely professional and helpful Facilities were good 
304650,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Nothing it was great, Great location friendly staff All staff spoke English which was a huge bonus A really comfy bed Great options of up to 16 products of bath gels moisturisers hair shampoos conditioners A roof top bar 
304651,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, I booked this hotel mainly because it had a Spa however the spa was out of order every day Not 5 star standard compared to other 5 stars we have stayed at, Location is good walking distance to attractions
304652,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, While check in it was taking a long time and gave us a wrong type of room During the time no one ever told us the swimming pool was closed on that day and no one ever apologized for this After checked in no one showed us the property and leaded us to the room The door lock was not sensitive to the key card And some outlets in the room were broken And in the morning the whole room were out of power for few minutes And it was taking 10 minutes until the hot water coming out in the shower While checking out the receiptionest charged wrong money The total for 1 night stay was 450 euro I think the value is not worth If I know I will receive this kind of service and facilities I might just pay 100 euro for an Airbnb which might provide better things to me , Only location
304653,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Room very noisy Loud rock music well past midnight and had to complain Also room had bad smell covered by spray I eventually figured out the sewer like smell came from the shower drain I had to keep the windows open at all times , Staff friendly and helpful
304654,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Very noisy every time anybody closed there door it sounded like it slammed shut our door vibrated the hair dryer was faulty the metal silhouette on the window was falling off , The location was excellent 
304655,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection,No Negative, Great location within walking distance to all Milan has to offer Shopping cafes Restaurants and the Duomo all within an easy flat walk Our room was very spacious and comfortable the size of a studio apartment The roof top bar at the Hotel is worth enjoying for sunset drinks as you have an excellent view of the Duomo lighting up as night falls Our photos of this and the city skyline were magnificent Recommend 
304656,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, There are restrictions on swimming pool access for kids and it is not mentioned anywhere during the booking or check in kids and baby only allowed between 10 00 am and 12 00 So you ll pay a crazy price to not have expected access , Design off this hotel is nice but it is getting old 
304657,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, basic room with no view poor breakfest italian style , Great location kindly staff roof bar great parking in centre without problem in hotel garage
304658,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, No bottle opener supplied in the room even though many of the bottles in the mini bar needed it Initial response would that a member of staff would come to the room every time I needed a bottle opening then he came back and gave me a spare to keep for the duration of my stay No coffee making facilities in the room this is a first for me even at the lowest end of the hotel scale including B B I have been able to make a coffee Price of the roof top bar was expensive 24 for one small beer and one glass of prosecco Wireless internet was dreadful in the room even after I was told it had been reset I was on the 7th floor but had to come down to reception restaurant to get a decent signal, Clean large room Great pool
304659,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Italian minimal style wich is not my favorite but nice and colorful design elements So it is interesting , Friendly staff confortable bed and a great location for shopping
304660,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, They only have small rooms the bathroom is bigger than the room itself makes it pretty cold to shower in and there are no door to separate the bathroom from the room , Perfect location well furnished and staffs are very helpful 
304661,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The only observation that I have is the set up of the bathroom and the shower as they are open to the room and there is privacy in case kids are in the room, The staff attitude and support at all times in addition to the great location
304662,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Our pickup car from centeral train station did not show although it was reserved several days before our arrival King bed was actually two beds which was not comfortable at all, Location is fantastic Concerge team are very helpfull and knowledgable Rooftop Terrace is an amaizing place to spend unforgettable nights 
304663,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Too much focus on design over practicality Sink too far to bend over wardrobe did not open unless toilet door was slid back No tea coffee facilities in room Jacuzzi in pool had to be operated by staff so most of the time remained off Bathrobes were changed but one replaced instead of two , Breakfast and location were good
304664,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, In 3 days stay WiFi not working in the whole hotel repair was always ongoing No Internet available at all even in business computer Detail quality sketchy from almost burned omelette served at breakfast a la carte to missed bed turn down Miserly policy of only one small bottle of complimentary water per stay rather than per night, Super central position arty design restaurant with view of Cathedral
304665,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Prices are extremely high for drinks and food etc A jack Daniels will run you 25 euro breakfast service is messy some staff is borderline rude unless you are wearing designer clothes , The pool the location modern room decor food room service most staff was courteous
304666,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The lady at the reception Alexandra she was unpolite first I made this booking 5 months ago and requested for baby bed when I reached she said there is no request and when I insisted that I made a request she said u did through booking com and they did not inform us then said even if u did its not guaranteed Also she charged for city tax for 3 people although I have infant and I ve been in Italy for 2 weeks in 4 hotels and none charged me for the baby the room she gave is totally disaster I wish if someone from the mana gent can go and check it The AC was not working plus many broken things in the room and finally the night shift man changed my room at 1 am , Remaining staff were nice but not Alexandra she does not deserve to be in 5 stars hotel 
304667,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The quality of the rooms and items in the room were of a cheap standard Our shower had mould all around the floor tiles and the water pressure was non existent The bed sheets were like cardboard and pillows were rock hard In order to reach the toilet paper one had to get up off the toilet and reach across the other side of the room as this was its location Even the tallest of people would still have to do this The hotel price is very high and the quality is that of a 3 star hotel We were supposed to stay for two nights but left and went to a 4 star hotel close by that was excellent Hotel Manzoni Again the staff were great but unfortunately the quality of the rooms was very disappointing , The staff were very helpful and did everything to make us feel welcome and at home They also went beyond with a birthday gift for my partner waiting in our room for when we returned Location is also very very good
304668,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The price of the hotel restaurant The food was lacking in quality to be honest and very overpriced Drinks were ald overpriced I ordered an English breakfast to be delivered to my room It was 16 and nothing like an English breakfast , Beds were really comfy View from room was amazing Staff very attentive and helpful Spacious rooms Excellent facilities overall and use of toiletries provided in the room 
304669,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, I cannot say anything, Very good service exellent breakfast with so big choise of everything Bid bed good choise and different kind of shampoo lotion swoer gel and so on location exellent good and friendly service in reseption 
304670,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection,No Negative, Housekeeping was not that good as rooms were not cleaned well and robes and kettle kept being taken from our room and we had to ask for new robes and kettle each day We would however recommend this hotel as very stylish and perfect location to all shops and places of attraction Richard
304671,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Dust on the chairs dusty courtains bathroom with no privacy dust on the armchair Room was close to the elevator and quite noisy Insulation against noise was very poor At 6 00 we have been woken up by the bellboy with room service which we didn t ask for In fact he knocked on the wrong door In the bathroom the toilet paper was fixed on the opposite wall compared to the WC and it was impossible to get without standing up and walking there The mirror in the bathroom had a broken angle inferior left and was dangerous in case you were touching it In general considering the brand and price level I wasn t expecting to find these issues Quite disappointing , Design style position in the city center behaviour of staff spacy rooms
304672,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, It was too noisy we keep hearing high heel steps day and night One of the reciptionists was a bit mean, The location of this hotel was very good and very close to the Duomo It s very clean Almost all of the staff were so nice and helpful
304673,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The breakfast was not nice at all this was the only let down for us bacon and scrabbled egg was cold and the bread was hard and hardly any choice We eneded up eating breakfast out of hotel Found a fab little restaurant left and left again out of hotel So if booking this hotel don t bother including breakfast , Loved this hotel right in the heart of Milan went with group of girls so great location staff were very helpful and loved the decor and style of hotel defiantly a wow factor would 100 stay here again just would not include the breakfast
304674,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, no turn down service at all when I asked the front desk why a so called 5 was not providing such a service or any water on the bed night table bring your own it it will cost you 5euros from the minibar I received a very unpleasant answer but a promise to have one for my second night well it did not happen Personnel around the hotel is just very unpleasant Also Forgot my electric toothbrush in the room called only a few hours later and they had thrown it away Will not go back , Location
304675,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, They need to get new towels as they are worn out or coloured from the laundry They also need to reduce their prices it can be compared to the catogary of St Regis Ritz Carlton etc Or maybe it was cause I was there during the Milan Expo 2015, Location 
304676,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, In the second and third day the towels and the soup did not renew and it take too long to have them , The location is perfect The hotel have modern design and filling new The elevator are fast not so obvious in Milano The light in the room is design and still you have the option to see 
304677,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Pretentious setting with cheap finishings No bath in room Clearly rooms were remade but the finishings are poorly performed Bed not a real bed seemingly lots of work went into saving money and pretend to have high level furniture but it is clear Ikea would have done a better job, Nothing really
304678,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, the hotel is starting to fall apart the pool area is broken looking the floor boards our room were broken and cracked and the bathroom area a little beat down, I love the location and the staff
304679,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, On both nights of a very expensive stay the widely advertised rooftop terrace was being used for weddings so wasn t available , Top quality toiletries Idea of romantic rooftop cocktails however 
304680,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Found dirts on ceiling and one unwelcome restaurant attendants only welcoming local guests and who is speaking French generally not attended to any of English speaking guests for a coffee and tea , Welcome staff especially front desk and the hotel porter and great location near Duomo 
304681,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Housekeeping entered room on two occasions without even knocking Plastic green monster chairs in the room questionable No bar at night restaurant often booked for special events leaving guests with no place to, Location design lobby parking all great
304682,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Staff were not overly friendly as expected for the money you are paying The weird shade above the bed which was dirty , Location was perfect minutes from the main square shops restaurants etc 
304683,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, Must improve mattress of bed The a c make sound all night There wwre mosquitoes The poool looks better on photo than it is Overall its overpriced Need to focus on comfort details, Location It is very modern and stylish 
304684,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, The price compared to value suite was great in design but lacked simple items such as tea coffee making facilities mini bar outrages price suite was large but was worn and needed refurbishment, Location pool excellent late checkout
304685,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, When in bad you could hear people passing through the corridor as if they were passing through your bed The concept with no door at the bath washing compartment brought the sewage smell widely in the room Owners should try to rest in one room and then make their own opinion upon the part of the hotel , Location
304686,Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection, 1 the location in the city center but no shops around you you have to walk more than 15 min to find supermarket 2 there is no tea and coffee tray in the room when asked they provided a kettle only 3 swimming pool is too much small compared to the huge number of rooms so it is always full I have stayed there two nights and didn t find a time to swim or use the Jacuzzi 4 break fast buffet has many thing missing a five stars hotel should have bigger buffet with a multi options 5 they don t have an airport shuttle bus while it is clearly mentioned in Booking com site that they have 6 it is mentioned that they have a good terrace on roof unfortunately they have closed it and made it a restaurant so anytime you go there to relax they will keep bothering you by asking you to make an order for food or drinks ,No Positive
