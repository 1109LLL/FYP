340345,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Slight glitch at check in but that was more a technology fail more than anything Quickly resolved , Hip and vibrant hotel located along a canal in the heart of Amsterdam The staff were extremely friendly and helpful very down to earth and welcoming

340349,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Not one thing , Very chic and hip Like NY Chelsea area hotel Food is outstanding Staff went out of their way to help us extend our stay I will refer everyone I know to stay at this hotel A friend who lives in Amsterdam and had never been to the Hoxton also said he would refer anyone visiting to the hotel A very cool place Loved our stay
340350,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Rooms were a little small but comfortably appointed in a retro sort of way Early morning street noise was inconvenient for those of us who do not like to wake up at 5 30AM ear plugs mostly took care of this problem, Great location convenient to public transportation Smiling helpful staff In hotel restaurant had a varied excellent menu One hour per day international calling was a wonderful and useful surprise Complementary bag breakfast was a great healthy way to start the day Bed was soft but worked fine for us 
340351,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable Our room was beautiful and every recommendation was thought out and brilliant Nothing was too much trouble I will definitely be coming again 
340352,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Nothing, The hotel feels like home and the staff are my best friends My time there is filled with Joy and my 5 year old girl wants to live there forever 
340353,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Rooms located on the 1st floor were a bit noisy disturbing sleep Moved to 4th floor on second night and had a great sleep Although food was good the Food menu at evening could do with having more choice , Bed was superb comfortable Great location
340354,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Our king river room was on the ground floor and had an emergency exit door rather than all windows whilst the room was nice I would have preferred to be higher up to get a better view of the canal I did ask to move but it wasn t possible Next time I would request this upon booking , Location and staff were fab 
340355,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff are amazing here super friendly and went above beyond to help us This really made a difference for our stay and as a result I will always book The Hoxton when travelling on business in the future 
340356,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The thumping sounds of the DJ on a Saturday night, The canal view room bath products comfy bed helpful staff the free bottles of water the free granola and fruit juice for breakfast the location
340357,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Quite a few odd steps up and down when winding to our room can imagine coming back to the room slightly intoxicated would not be fun No tables available at the restaurant and had to go elsewhere which was a shame Room was on bottom floor by the canal and was pretty loud in the morning with people talking outside , Beautiful hotel lovely rooms Nice staff comfortable bed 
340358,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Lobby bar sometimes too busy with locals and guests at hotel could not get a look in Had to go out of hotel to have a bar drink as no room to sit in lobby , Staff were friendly and courteous 
340359,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff was super helpful and friendly Ahead of our stay Dominique the receptionist had booked us some awesome restaurants for dinner and made a list of other places not to miss for brunch The detailed assistance that she gave us made the stay quite memorable 
340360,The Hoxton Amsterdam, It was extremely noisy overnight on the other hand that s part of having a hotel in the midst of the city center, Room and bathroom very comfortable
340361,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Breakfast with fresh home made breakfast would be better , Great hotel very friendly staff Best value for money in Amsterdam if you want a cool luxury hotel 
340362,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were so friendly location was amazing Having stayed in Amsterdam before this location was great as you are so close to the shopping district but also all the museums The room was beautiful and very clean Decor is very different and unique not a plain white wall in sight I m definitely going back 
340363,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Little bit of money but I was due for a comfy bed on my trip, Absolutely the best customer service I have ever had in a hotel Amazing lounge in the rooms were Super killer
340364,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Avoid room 508 if you are over 6 feet tall I am 6 foot 3 inches tall and had only 2 inches of space between my head and the rafter beams in the middle of the room none around the sides The surface area of the room was reasonable but not the height This was not good value 239 euros for one night in an attic room I suspect that this problem may well be common to all rooms on Floor 5 at the back of the hotel , The sleep quality of the bed was very good The staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful 
340365,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfy and the decor of the room was very classy Lovely vintage touches like the phone and radio and huge windows with beautiful views Also the room was much bigger than I thought The photos do not do the hotel justice The staff were more than happy to help with anything giving us maps and drawing easiest routes to get to places and suggesting good places to visit Also even though breakfast not included you get a breakfast bag in morning with banana granola and orange juice which was a lovely touch Will DEFINITELY be returning 
340366,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, Great location with a buzzing atmosphere The staff are very friendly and helpful The design of the hotel is trendy and quirky Breakfast bags delivered to your door in the morning are a nice touch too yogurt with granola an orange juice and a banana We would definitely recommend the Hoxton and I m looking forward to staying again when we return to Amsterdam 
340367,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The only downside is the bar closed quite early around midnight , I wasn t expecting to be staying in Amsterdam I was supposed to be flying to Mexico City but air traffic control failure at Schiphol left me overnighting in Amsterdam Rather than stay at KLM s designated soulless airport hotel I asked to stay in town I m familiar with The Hoxton in Shoreditch so deciding where to stay was easy It s a cool hotel and it ticks all the boxes My room was small but perfectly formed Wifi was fast and reliable The restaurant and bar area is excellent with a good atmosphere Best bits There s a 2 bottle bar for residents to take a beer to the room A breakfast bag is included in the room rate hang the bag outside your door and they ll leave you some yoghurt fruit and juice 
340368,The Hoxton Amsterdam, I d struggle to find anything I did not like , really nice experience Friendly staff welcoming and comfort atmosphere nice lounge and all the details in order 
340369,The Hoxton Amsterdam, No real dislikes friendly service and good location view from the room was poor ugly as we were at the back of the hotel but on the plus it was nice and quiet , Nice touches like a small breakfast bag of granola and fruit to your room and a fun gift on arrival Comfy well thought through room although small A really enjoyable stay 
340370,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Rooms were small but well laid out Bar was very busy with non residents, Cool hotel in excellent location Great bar with excellent DJs nice cocktails Nice on site restaurant
340371,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, Quaint and modern rolled into one inviting property Staff was extremely helpful and friendly Breakfast in a bag delivered to door at time requested in morning Free 1 hr phone use even overseas 
340372,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Toilet doesnt have a toilet brush i know its awkward to mention this but trust me its a nuisance Design over function is great until you have to clean the toilet They give you a breakfast bag that you hang on your door Its a joke of a breakfast a banana a granola and a pseudo fresh orange juice Realistically people that are paying the kind of rate Hoxton is charging dont need a banana and a granola in the morning Its a hipster touch that I didnt appreciate to be honest Maybe if it had a croissant inside If you are willing to pay 10 15 euros you can always have brunch at the hotel restaurant which was fantastic eggs benedict on point , The bar is lovely Has a great atmosphere with groovy music playing The food is decent too Hoxton is more than just a hotel The bar and the restaurant attract a lot of people who are just looking to start their night out I think the vibes you get in Hoxton and its understated luxury is what makes it special The hotel is very easy on the eye with lots of pretty details that take great pictures The decoration is flawless 
340373,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The mattress in room was way too soft I woke up with back ache on first day and spoke with staff who said the bed didn t have proper support and they had fixed it It helped a little but I did not sleep well on any of the 3 nights The room was very cold it has big open windows and I could feel the draft on my back every night and I actually got flu staying at the hotel it was very cold in Amsterdam but I definitely could feel the rooms were chilly My biggest complaint is the fact that your paying 220 a night and the tv kept losing signal It has over 60 channels and most of them are Dutch speaking but you would think there would be options to rent a movie considering most of the people staying at hotel are english speaking etc perhaps this was just the wrong hotel for me but I would not stay here again Also on my last day checking out I was told that someone had billed my room for over 40 for food which I didn t eat which is a bit crazy I don t know what system they operate but you would think they would be able to manage people s bills etc in an orderly fashion, Decent location 5 mins walk from dam square
340374,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Lack of reliable timing of having room cleaned We had 2 rooms and both suffered with after 5pm cleans or no clean We had our room ready signs out prior to 9am however after returning having our ritual and delicious spicy Bloody Mary wanted to go and throw our feet up read and rest prior to dinner we were unable to this on 3 of our days I would say either understaffed in this area or mis managed Everything else was delightful, The comfortable atmosphere and energy of staff genuine and friendly
340375,The Hoxton Amsterdam, There was a regular noise like ventilation noise outside the room It was not the neightbours it wasn t very strong but present all the night The water of shower is not very hot Small details but at this price we can be exigent, Location is excellent and the lobby is designed with lot of talent unlikely it s open for everyone so sometimes you can t have a table even if tou are client of the hotel 
340376,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Nothing at all, Staff so friendly and helpful and the building is beautiful Small things like you can buy drinks at supermarket prices rather than the usual expensive mini bar are a great idea 
340377,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The prices at the attached restaurant and bar are very high The staff is very nice though , The ambiance was amazing and the room was so comfortable Nice big clean bathroom Complimentary healthy breakfast delivered to your door 
340378,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was lovely and comforty just like we were wandering in our very own bedroom The prices are quite high but you really get all the bang for your bucks and very friendly staff at the desk for reception and eager to help you around localising your favourite places You also get a neat city map that has note of some cosy places to eat that are out of the overwhelming tourist area You re also straight in the heart of the 9 straatjes district of Amsterdam Best of the best Please do try and get a table at the restaurant down below it s well worth it They serve delicious italian food as well as classy cocktails and small side dishes and nibs it s always full so book in advance we we re very lucky to find a lonely corner 
340379,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The lights in the room could have been a little brighter , The free breakfast bags in the morning to kick start your day the staff were amazing and never had any problems with any request asked of them 
340380,The Hoxton Amsterdam, There should be a Hoxton on every street corner , Jorinda jojo on reception was amazing Funky laid back brilliant hotel with amazing staff Great rooms great food and the most amazing soap in the bedrooms Really didn t want to come home 
340381,The Hoxton Amsterdam, We made a special request gor a cheese platter and mohitos on arrival day in advance I emailed to cancel the request as we had to leave right away My cancellation email was obviously lost The girl bought it up anyway i said to her we cancelled this yesterday And she said i dont know and walked off So i was charged 55 for it Didnt complain at checkout as it was the first day of honeymoon Then the security deposit wasnt back in the acc after the room had been checked I had to call reception twice and was told i had to wait as they couldnt even find our booking So im 150 out for food and drink i didnt want that wasnt taken back and still waiting on security deposit Bit of a rough start to honeymoon , The atmosphere of the room was wonderful Well decorated and moody Perfect for a good nights sleep 
340382,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Walls are a little thin Could hear everything in the next room Also would be nice if the hotel hired out bikes , Everything Coffee food service Decor Toilets 
340383,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Really love and appreciate the breakfast bag but that yoghurt was disgusting Didn t smell nor taste ok , The rooms are really pretty have exactly what you need Also i slept like a baby in that bed 
340384,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Nothing , Tidy classy room Nice shower Good light breakfast included with room Nice bathroom essentials and blow dryer Staff were very nice and helpful Will be back Good value 
340385,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Little noisy where our room was located because of the bar restaurant area downstairs Didn t bother us too much but might bother other travellers , Breakfast bag each morning is a great touch and the decor is beautiful 
340386,The Hoxton Amsterdam, having to leave , We loved the whole place The staff were extremely helpful and anticipated our needs The hotel itself was quirky which makes a huge difference compared to your bog standard hotels the little quirks made us laugh The room we had was perfect for us the bed was super comfy we didn t want to leave the hotel 
340387,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The food at Lotti s left a little to be desired I would eat elsewhere They forgot to clean on one day even though we had put out our sign No big deal though really , A beautifully designed hotel with a vibrant feel The staff were helpful The rooms were spotless The breakfast in a bag is a novel ideal 
340388,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The room was much smaller than the photos on the booing com and Croxton websites but it seemed to be that we had actually been given the smallest room on the floor We could see this from the fire escape plan map in the hallway It would have been nice to have been allocated a larger room considering we had just gotten off a 24 hour flight It was difficult to open and store our luggage in such a cramped space , The interior of the hotel is beautifully designed especially in the lobby and restaurant bar areas The breakfast in the restaurant was fantastic so we ended up eating there each morning 
340389,The Hoxton Amsterdam, That I didn t stay there longer, One of the best places I ve stayed anywhere Save yourself some time hunting for a good bargain This place is the best bang for the buck 
340390,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Only minor issue was slowness of service in the restaurant They were rushing around just not enough of them to get someone s attention Don t let it put you off Food was excellent and the staff very friendly , Wonderful place The experience is exactly what I look for in a hotel Personality comfort and decor spot on You ll get excellence but in a casual and accessible way I could wax lyrical about the helpfulness of the receptionist but I m too busy soaking up my final few minutes in the velvet wonderland of the lobby 
340391,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Breakfast is a banana and a yoghurt hung by your door , Bar is buzzing in the evening staff are very friendly The rooms are full of character we had crystal wine glasses and loads of exposed industrial features 
340392,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Our room was a little cold but it was ok with the heater air con unit set to maximum We were only staying for two nights so it wasn t a problem but I was surprised that there wasn t a wardrobe or much storage space even though we had a large room A robe would have been nice too especially at this price point We had a brunch in the restaurant which was pretty disappointing The menu and presentation looked great but the food was very forgettable , The bed was enormous and really comfortable Nice busy lounge Great location The breakfast bag with juice granola and a banana delivered free to your door was a cute touch but I thought at the price a real breakfast could have been included in the price 
340393,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, We booked this hotel for my parents they were treated sooo well and I also received an email from the hotel telling me my parents arrived safely and were all settled amazing customer service my parents adored the hotel
340394,The Hoxton Amsterdam, the fact that at 11 50pm there was no food available at the hotel room service or a light snack menu would be nice , the comfort of the public areas the ambiance the breakfast bag
340395,The Hoxton Amsterdam, No closet No dresser but drawers under the bed , Great job of taking a tired hotel in a great location and completely revitalizing it Super new mechanicals top quality shower worked into the usual compact bathroom double pane windows that open fully I had a sunny courtyard room no view but very pleasant vintage Scandinavian reading chair that could not have been more comfortable good pillows good bed They took a smallish room and made it really comfortable efficient and stylish in a kind of retro mid century way It felt more like a good guest room at a friend s house than a hotel room Will never be confused with a Holiday Inn 
340396,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, Lobby cool Staff cool Room cool Bed Comfy View from Room On fleek Bathroom perfect Hair Dryer On Point Restaurant Understaffed on Monday night but everything delicious Drinks refreshing 
340397,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Reception area very dark Staff were friendly but did not engage in conversation re your day or where the guest had visited It is fair to say that The Hox suits the very young visitor to Amsterdam Lotti Restaurant too dark for eating service just average , Location very central to major museums Room very large and comfortable 1 hour free international call per day excellent internet access 
340398,The Hoxton Amsterdam, We were very satisfied with The Hoxton Travelers should be prepared for a small room This is a typical of the older buildings in Amsterdam , The friendliness of the staff They would help with restaurant suggestions and reservations and help to navigate the tram lines The breakfast bag is nice and filling Lotti s restaurant in the lobby is convenient with good food and excellent service if you don t want to go out or have a bigger breakfast 
340399,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, The friendly staff at reception the small touches such as leaving you a breakfast bag in the morning on a hook outside your room Comfy and spacious beds Perfect location will be staying there again

340403,The Hoxton Amsterdam, It wasn t clear I needed to pay 50EUR extra for a deposit so make sure you bring your credit debit card with you , The staff was awesome and super dedicated The lobby area is really cool to spend some and have some drinks with friends They allocated me in the Monumental room a large suite with a 18th century vibe but with some modern gadgets it was different from what I ve seen before I liked it 
340404,The Hoxton Amsterdam, For the price and star rating of this hotel I would have liked a bathrobe in the room and perhaps some slippers A wider menu from Lotti s would be good as I ate there for several meals in the three days I was there as it was easier for work and a little more choice would be good , This is a super hotel and in a great location I had never been to Amsterdam before and loved the quaint area that the hotel is on Ask for a canal view room it is worth it So beautiful to wake up in the morning to The food in Lotti s the restaurant at the hotel is delicious and the staff are just incredibly friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them 
340405,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Nothing whatsover , Lovely message for me waiting in the same room I d stayed in before I really like that level of personalisation It happened to be my birthday too so it felt like a real treat I m coming back for sure Home away from home Oh and the bed Lush 
340406,The Hoxton Amsterdam, At the weekend there were longer waits for attention and the staff were unable to be as helpful it was understandable there was more for them to deal with but the service when we left wasn t as good as when we arrived, The initial welcome and service mid week was fantastic
340407,The Hoxton Amsterdam, We had a free upgrade to a room with view on canal The room isn t well isolated thin glass windows so we could hear the people talking outside the hotel The whole bathroom floor got wet when using the rain shower Minor thing there wasn t any body lotion , The entourage and interior decoration are very well done Super cool and stylish Employees very helpful and friendly Comfy bed and nice high ceiling

340414,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, Posh boutique hotel close to everything you need Quiet at night but close to a busy main street The basic room is small but it s comfortable and the complimentary quick breakfast was good The snacks they carry at the front desk were awesomw too 
340415,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Really nothing to report re dislikes but the external appearance of this great little hotel could be enhanced with some stylish tubs planters and some greenery , Staff team members were all really great and could not have been more courteous or helpful Modern and trendy interior in all public areas Comfortable rooms some may view these as a little basic but ours was very clean and all we needed on a 3 day city break

340419,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Some of the staff were super friendly and super helpful especially the bar staff who found me a cocktail that suited me perfectly The restaurant staff though we re a little all over the shop We didn t really get what we asked for and it was a massive effort to say that we have a tab to pay before we went home too as we wanted to pay them together In the end they had lost our tab but still managed to say to reception that we had a tab so we had to chase it up ourselves and retell them everything we d bought in order to settle the bill Not a massive downer on our perfect trip but just a bit annoying, The hotel is gorgeous and it s only a 5 minute walk to the main square It s easy to find your way back too as well as its on one of the main canal rings so you can just follow them until you find it again The room was really nice too It s quirky and finished to a really high standard too We loved to vintage photo booth too We took photos every day of our trip 
340420,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Maybe think of adding more options to breakfast bag And having more drinks stocked in the mini bar But still thought it was great to have a concept where there are no nasty hidden mini bar charges Also would have been great to have a few extra amenities in the bathroom like body lotion and cotton wool buds , Staff were really friendly Restaurant bar and communal areas around the hotel were great Amazing cocktails Bed was very comfortable

340447,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Service in the bar restaurant can be very slow and while the food is genuinely excellent the portions are pretty small for me anyway I would have loved gym facilities but that s not really a complaint but it s one thing that would definitely enhance my next stay there even if it was a partnership with a nearby gym , Style and atmosphere of the hotel it feels much more like a residence than a hotel Staff are exceptionally friendly and cool Bedrooms very nice even the tiny ones and the beds unbelievably comfortable Free wifi and phone calls a nice touch that seem simple but many hotels I ve travelled to use them to get a few more euros out of their guests Food is very high quality too best steak I had in Amsterdam after trying a few supposedly famous steak houses 
340448,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Our room looked on to an internal light well, The staff were very professional and efficient The hotel is very well located and has a comfortable and relaxing restaurant bar area The room itself was well equipped with an extremely comfortable bed 
340449,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Honestly there was not really anything that I didn t like about the hotel In our two weeks of travelling across Europe this was easily the best most softest bed we stayed on our trip Even this didn t like section has nothing but likes that s how much I loved this hotel , I loved everything about this hotel From the courteous staff to the location great vibe and atmosphere of this hotel The Hoxton was a perfect stay to a perfect vacation 
340450,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Good central location but slightly far from the station when pulling a wheelie bag along as kept getting caught on the cobbles would recommend getting the tram , The bed was super comfy and absolutely massive It also had BBC1 so I could watched master chef Also offered room service which I don t think the hoxton in London does so an added bonus
340451,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Although check out is stated at 12 noon we were bothered quite a lot in both venues , Our bed was amazing and upgraded to a room with a view which was super as it was our anniversary we also had a welcome message from you guys when we arrived at the hox in shoreditch You have the best bloody Mary s ever 
340452,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Ignored by receptionist when trying to check in Told the bikes were not available add they d been reserved after being told by another staff member that we could absolutely not reserve bikes as it was hotel policy , Great location Wonderfully comfortable beds and pillows Very high standard of cleanliness Great style very hip 
340453,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Menu being same every day was disappointing Did not like having to wait until 4pm every day for our room to be cleaned , Bed super bathroom fittings high quality No wardrobe so we requested extra hangers Rather strange having the drawers for our clothes under the bed but at least there was room for our stuff Liked the upstairs lounge area where you could see the canal We would have liked a canal view room but forgot to book that in time 
340454,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Some of the staff at the restaurant was inattentive and unprofessional The food at the restaurant was okay but did not live up to the expectations , Very nice rooms with all amenities extremely friendly receptionists cool concept to stock your own minibar at reasonable prices 
340455,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, I have never met such cheerful and helpful staff all across the board We enjoyed the good feel environment of the lounge restaurant area Our room was amazing with the view of the canal the food at the restaurant was top notch Overall it was a seriously enjoyable stay 
340456,The Hoxton Amsterdam, nothing, The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful We had a cosy double room which we expected to be small but it wasn t at all probably the wrong name for the room The communal area had a great buzz and was used by lots of different people both hotel residents and locals alike We hadn t booked breakfast but a light breakfast was still delivered to the room 
340457,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Too many stairs for guests with heavy luggage Beds too soft Furnitures too basic So called free breakfast in a bag should be improved providing choices to avoid waste , excellent wifi
340458,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Perhaps a little help with the bags but other than that nothing We loved it , Great vibe as soon as you walked in Everything was exactly as the pictures showed on the Internet Not a large hotel but that s what we like Close to all forms of transport or easy walking to the centre of the city Loved the bed so comfortable loved the bathroom in particular the heated towel rail The idea of the free calls for an hour to anywhere in the world is great Also loved the free brown bag breakfast 
340459,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The very loud music which started at 9 30 on Friday and sometimes staff a little too laid back , Location spot on building and interiors were gorgeous a design lovers dream Food was fab and the Apple Macs in reception were very popular with daughter 
340460,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, I loved everything about this hotel I wish all my business travels would have a hotel like this groovy design with good taste and functional room with overall good facilities 
340461,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Better not to have a bkafst bag than having a bad one the breakfast bag is very disappointing while understanding wanting to offer bfast it in a cool unusual way the bfast bag placed at the door handle puts you down i have got during my 3 days stay 2 times a super ripe old banana muesli yoghurt and orange juice from a local franchise called Stach choice could be better or if on a budget better offer nothing instead, location cool and kind reception staff inconsistent service at the restaurant Lotti s 
340462,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Would have liked a bath but just a nicety not essential , The bed was very comfy lovely pillows and duvet The staff were friendly and helpful The room was very clean and the breakfast bag and free 1 hour international call were a nice touch The restaurant served gorgeous food steaks and burgers were amazing The bar had a good selection of drinks Nice quiet road and easy to find 
340463,The Hoxton Amsterdam, I can t say there was anything we didn t like , Everything about the Hoxton was top notch but especially the staff at the front desk We stayed for a week and every person we had contact with was professional helpful friendly and just plain fun to talk with The other best thing about the Hoxton for us was the location It was in a perfect location neighborhood with plenty of terrific restaurants and within walking distance to all of the sights The Hoxton has a lot going on including a lively entertainment bar area that was hopping most of the time At night maybe weekend nights only not sure there was a DJ We had been in a first floor room and were awakened to the beat of the bass Thankfully it ended at midnight The next morning we asked if it was possible to be moved to a higher floor hoping it would be quieter and they were able to accommodate our request We enjoyed our stay very much 
340464,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The free breakfast is fine delicious actually but got a bit boring everyday would have been good to mix it up a little , The staff are particularly welcoming and helpful That made such a difference when we first arrived and to our stay generally They generously took time to find out want we wanted to do where we wanted to go and what we wanted to see in Amsterdam and explained how best to do it The canal view from our room was fabulous the location really perfect for seeing the city The bed was very comfortable and the shower great too The restaurant downstairs serves delicious food and along with the bar is bustling and funky 
340465,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Breakfast at 9 30 had run out of muffins The guy running the restaurant was OK but not as service focused as the people at dinner the pervious evening, The staff in restaurant at dinner have improved significantly I would now consider taking clients there but before I was less sure The food has always been good 
340466,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, design details were great made it feel like travelling a back to the mid century free breakfast is nice staff is friendly location is awesome The restaurant is definitely a hip scene in of itself good food very lively Feels a little like a small version of the Ace hotel in Manhattan

340485,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Continental breakfast has to be included in price yogurt and juice and banana provided by the hotel is not enough for breakfast , Great place It took me 25 min of walk from mainrailway station to the place I would mark that it was rather difficult to see the hotels signs from the street The place itself was wonderful Great design and spirit of hotel and its interior small but so well fitted and cosy rooms retro soviet clocks books retro style radio with usb socket for playing music from Ipod water and milk for free Great bathroom with shower and smooth design Great personal friendly and open minded I liked it Definitely will stay more next time 
340486,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The room was TINY If we had been there for more than one night we would have left there was nowhere to put our things at all There was a lot of noise for about an hour from 6 30am outside our hotel room we think it was the bins being collected As the windows didnt shut properly it was very frustrating , The staff were amazingly helpful and friendly the little free breakfast was a lovely touch and the hotel is beautifully designed 
340487,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Room smaller than expected, Bloody Mary s were excellent Lively buzzy place all hours we hung out in the cafe lounge area a lot more than you usually would at most hotels

340490,The Hoxton Amsterdam, This hotel is perfect for younger people a dream hotel if you are 35 The reception desk is part of a great room which includes the very busy lounge and restaurant space In the evenings the hotel was vibrant full of people and very noisy which has a great appeal for many but was not ideal for older travellers like myself and my husband both of whom are over 50 , The hotel is lovely and in an ideal location for sightseers Our room was beautifully and thoughtfully decorated and the bed was very comfortable We were awoken after midnight one night by guests in the room above us making a lot of noise and the hotel management dealt with that problem very quickly and effectively All of the staff members we dealt with were helpful and professional

340498,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The complimentary breakfast yoghurts arrived frozen and the shower wasn t hot in our first morning However these problems were rectified within moments The staff couldn t have been more friendly or helpful , The staff and the atmosphere that greeted you when you walked into the hotel or down from your room were the best bits The downside was that it was quite difficult to find somewhere to sit as a resident but you just had to look hard The location was absolutely perfect too within walking distance from Centraal seconds from the treats of 9 Streets and a very quick cycle ride from all the sights Brilliant 
340499,The Hoxton Amsterdam, the room was a bit small, Great location in the heart of the nicest cosy canal streets hotel design atmosphere deco very friendly and professional service super cool lobby restaurant bar lounge areas A beautiful building inside and out 
340500,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The first thing the lovely young receptionist told me about this hotel when checked in was hey the hotel would charge you for your entire reservation no matter you stay or not no matter how long you stay no matter you want to change your travel plan or not Well this is way too impressive Please also note NOT to carry BIG luggage No one would help you at the door according to my own experience and observation of many others In total this is a good hotel and deserves all guests recommendation , Design of the hotel Nice staff almost everyone The restaurant on the ground floor Best of all is the location of the hotel easy to everywhere shopping museums park And the room service is delivered IMMEDIATELY

340504,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Hard to find something to improve Maybe take slippers with you since the beautiful wooden floor is a bit cold to walk on with naked feet , Design and location of the hotel Staff is very friendly and helpful and restaurant on the ground floor is excellent and cozy
340505,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Only we were disappointed not to be able to get a table in the restaurant for dinner but on the flip side we found a nice restaurant nearby in the Ambassade hotel , Nice location nice atmosphere in the lobby bar restaurant area with lots of hipsters Room and bed were very comfortable Breakfast was tasty 
340506,The Hoxton Amsterdam, good decoration but no comfort room not user friendly stayed in double room it is tiny we could hardly move plus there is no space for laguage just under the bed no wardrobe, location atmosphere decoration cool helpful staff

340508,The Hoxton Amsterdam, If you re a light sleeper you may want to avoid a room with a canal view as there was a bit of street noise not enough to keep you awake but I did hear the occasional car alarm honk and trash truck rumbling by one morning , The entire staff was always friendly and helpful even the housekeeping and maintenance staff said hello when I passed them in the hall I stayed in a cosy room with a canal view 518 and loved it the layout was perfect the decor was inviting and the view was awesome The rip off free mini fridge in the room was a welcomed treat two small bottles of water and a pint of milk The hotel is very conveniently located to all the major attractions and transportation hubs in the city 
340509,The Hoxton Amsterdam, There was a bad bar fly issue in the bar during our stay which was a bit off putting while sitting at the bar for a drink , Great location and very friendly staff and one of the comfiest beds ever 
340510,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Everything was great no complaints, Stayed here recently for one night and will return I love this hotel warm comfortable and funky with friendly staff Lotti s bar very busy and buzzy I will be back

340513,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Cleaning can be more attentive , The room was available on arrival before the noon time Room service is excellent including morning breakfast Staff is very helpful 
340514,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Food was a bit average and drinks weren t up to the standard i would expect of a hotel like that Need a bit of work with the bar staff, Beautiful venue probably the best hotel in Amsterdam
340515,The Hoxton Amsterdam, They did get our room booking wrong on arrival and could not find our second room they switched our rooms to allow for twin beds for one of our party who was pregnant but then gave another guest the same room and the guest walked into our room unannounced thinking it was their room apparently something wrong with the system we ordered two beers on room service and they never arrived 2 hours later we went down and cancelled them and they still appeared on the bill the following day so we had to explain again that we never received them Having said all of this they did correct where they went wrong and were very amenable , I loved the style ambience and staff in this hotel It s charming relaxing and in the perfect spot for exploring the restaurants and shops nearby Additionally Hoxton recommend places to frequent such as eateries and spa s three of which we tried and thoroughly enjoyed 
340516,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Breakfast service often slow food not particularly good and poor coffee sometimes bar service slow as well although understandable as very busy , Location style of reception bar rooms comfortable bed In general very friendly staff 
340517,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Nothing I didn t like I would only say that the lobby was very active busy with a party atmopshere which I hadn t expected so it was tough not possible to get a seat there in the evenings would say hotel should hold 2 3 tables like the Mandarin Oriental does for hotel guests Also re the breakfast bags would say there should be a no cost alternative to the yoghurt for folks like me who are lactose intolerant I tried to get alternatives but was charged in the end for the croissant and muffin But again these are small nits the hotel overall was amazing and big kudos to the staff you are the best , The front desk staff was superlative helped with everything from dinner reservations to directions to taxis The room was very nice all mid century modern and relatively quiet and the cleaning staff ensured excellent clean rooms every day again superlative Location was perfect right in the middle of the 9 Streets shopping area 
340518,The Hoxton Amsterdam, The size of the room that I was said to have booked is more like a studio which was unbeknown to me that it was even small but at least they gave me a free upgrade and I ended up in a reasonably sized room My visit being during autumn didn t help with the cold weather but that is no fault of the hotel establishment, The hotel is very close to the canal and it was a hive of activity just a pity that it was tired and as such I didn t have the energy to spend time at the restaurant
340519,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Bit difficult to get served in bar for pre dinner drinks Though excellent cocktails, Great lively hotel Excellent location Cool vibe Free wi do water etc couldn t fault it

340524,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, Great position fantastic staff and the most comfortable beds I have slept in Simple free breakfasts in the room a bonus Wouldn t stay anywhere else 
340525,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, Loved the quirky and uber cool interior of The Hox The bed was super comfy and had one of the best nights sleep snuggled up within it Breakfast was a healthy bonus and the opportunity to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon relaxing drinking and eating along with family in the sumptuous bar lounge area was most enjoyable 
340526,The Hoxton Amsterdam, We did not receive enough towels for the second and last night nor tissue paper and toilet paper After contacting the reception for several times we could eventually have them We had to ask for them in the morning and received at night Very horrible experience , The hotel is absolutely beautiful and elegant 
340527,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Everything was great besides the fire alarm at 3 30am It s a little concerning that the staff seemed disorganised during the false alarm However I was reassured by the manager that a review of procedures is under way By way of apology for my disrupted night they waved my room service bill which was classy , Perfect location great cafe bar and speedy wifi 
340528,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Need more light in room Rather dim, The Hoxton is a hip boutique hotel and even though my husband and I are an older couple we were treated exceptionally well The staff is great I highly recommend it
340529,The Hoxton Amsterdam, A bit noisy but that s probably because it s in the centre of Amsterdam and what is expected , The hotel is warm inviting Staff are friendly and could not do enough for you Nothing was too much trouble Rooms are modern and comfortable beds especially No other hotel leaves milk water daily and toiletries are NOT your usual tiny ones either 
340530,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, The front desk staff were super helpful and friendly Fantastic location The Hoxton has a great vibe the rooms are comfortable with a great modern flare The breakfast bag with a banana yoghurt granola and orange juice was a great touch There is also a wine bottle opener in the room along with beautiful glassware Complimentary bottled water and milk in the mini fridge upon arrival We would recommend the Hoxton for sure and will return without a doubt 
340531,The Hoxton Amsterdam, While sitting in the hall outside the restaurant area it s sometimes taking too long for restaurant staff to approach you and take an order Experienced it only once though , 1 the staff was very helpful and agreeable 2 The interior design 3 Comfortable and cozy atmosphere 
340532,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Was travelling with 2 large cases for work Just took a little longer to bring my cases up and down the stairs but managed , The location interior and rooms The Hoxton had it all Was presently surprised with the room that I had Not only did my attic room have a view it was roomy and had some really cool details Oh yes the breakfast bag is a must try

340535,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, 1 The extremely helpful friendly staff 2 The fun informal but very competent service 3 The amusing very strong hotel branding 4 The excellent location 
340536,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Although the breakfast bags are a nice touch make sure to include a spoon for the cereal or make it obvious where one can find utensils in the room I was in a rush couldn t find a spoon so had to skip the good looking cereal Just a minor issue for sure The somewhat steep room prices are a more significant issue but common on this location , Nice atmosphere friendly and helpful staff comfortable rooms
340537,The Hoxton Amsterdam, As we wanted good cabal view room so it took 2 hours to get it ready and we checked in at around 5 30 pm and when we requested staff to do late check out for one hour got a reply I need to pay extra euros for that I did not like that rest everything was fine , Staff was very friendly and helpful 
340538,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Everything was perfect hope to be back soon , The location of the hotel is excellent just a short walk away from Dam Sq and Anne Frank s house The hotel is lively relaxed with great service throughout and our cosy room was perfect overlooking the canal with tea coffee water and milk in the fridge full size toiletries and great hairdryer in the bathroom We also loved the breakfast in a bag hung outside our door every morning The Herengracht canal area is lovely with some trendy shops and cafes 
340539,The Hoxton Amsterdam,No Negative, Brilliant hotel discreet and not showy appearing like a Dutch town house Don t be fooled though this place has all the trappings of a good hotel sumptuous beds comfy furnishings and spa bathrooms You ll find staff warm helpful and knowledgable but not intrusive it s like you ve arrived to stay with friends It s a unique blend of art fashion shabby chic and retro Add to this as divine food a great wine list well made cocktails and a playlist you would choose to listen to and you can t go wrong I can t wait to go back 
340540,The Hoxton Amsterdam, Room service forgot its cleaning cloth in the room 1 2 Free breakfast bag was only served for one person whereas we requested for 2 , Interior architecture design the trendy Lotti s restaurant inside the hotel and the Mojito
