314606,NH Amsterdam Noord, wifi network is way too restrictive I tried to access my development server online and could not do so Really don t understand why an hotel feels it needs to put in additional restrictions to those put in place by ISP I am a paying guest not an employee nice to have kettle and instant coffee in room but would then make sense to also have milk , hotel staff were super nice and helpful both in reception and breakfast room comfy bed very nice recently renovated room

314623,NH Amsterdam Noord, There is no system for the shuttle bus which results in long waits when people appear out of nowhere and disregard if you were waiting Not directly an issue for the hotel but some sort of ticket system would help this Particularly for large groups who are holidaying together A payment card does not hold your room They pre authorise it before hand We had 7 rooms so my card took a battering and I have still not had funds returned to my account This was not made clear and The staff were not prepared to listen to this and were not helpful This was after showing them the booking conditions Reception could also use some training on serving people in order as more than 3 people were seen to after we had been stood politely waiting , Rooms were clean and comfortable Shuttle bus to centre was used regularly and didn t take long Drivers of shuttle were lovely and helpful 
314624,NH Amsterdam Noord, The pillows were very poor Different sizes and very flat although I have read that new pillows and mattresses will be getting updated in some rooms soon , Superior room was big and clean staff were excellent and the free bus is a brilliant service and probably the best thing Without it probably wouldn t stay here again but looks like it s a big part of the hotel 
314625,NH Amsterdam Noord, the location and time of the shuttle to the city center would need earlier shuttle this is hotel for business means that we have to work in the morning earlier then 09 00 i was also disappointed to learn that the sister Nh hotel close to the central station is not willing to keep baggage of NH noord it just create another travel to Noord ,No Positive

314636,NH Amsterdam Noord, we booked the hotel for it s proximity to Ceuvel Cafe unfortunately due to extensive roadworks in the area what should have been a short 5 minute stroll was more than doubled the rooms are ok but nothing special Once you re inside the big yellow box there s nothing to distinguish it from hundreds of other chain hotels overall poor value for money, rooms were very comfortable and good size compared to other properties in Amsterdam the shuttle bus to the ferry is a great service equally the journey to the ferry is just a short bike ride away
314637,NH Amsterdam Noord,No Negative, From the central station this hotel is 3 minutes by ferry and about 10 12 minutes stroll from the centre of everything it is a peaceful hotel with staff that could not be more helpful and friendly top marks for a really warm welcome though it was well after midnight by the time we arrived 
314638,NH Amsterdam Noord, Can be a little noisy early morning when crew are leaving doors banging , The staff were very friendly and the free shuttle bus is a bonus The breakfast is great for the start of the day We asked for this to be included prior to our visit Although the hotel is not in the centre it is ideal for a city break 
314639,NH Amsterdam Noord, We weren t informed of the free shuttle bus from the ferry to the hotel before we arrived and the breakfast was pricey in comparison to other places we stayed in, The beds were excellent and the facilities good

314644,NH Amsterdam Noord, N a, Was a wonderful hotel in a perfection location for me roughly 20 minute walk into central and also had a free shuttle bus service to and from the centre Was great value for money and the staff couldn t do enough for us I emailed asking if we could check in early due to an early flight unfortunately there wasn t a room ready but the staff went above and beyond to ensure the safety of our luggage so that we could go and explore this beautiful city I would highly recommend and i will definitely be booking again next year 
314645,NH Amsterdam Noord, When it comes to the shuttle not that it runs every 15 20mins but do not that if you ask hotel to call for it they will not help and just tell you to wait It s best to just wait and eventually it will come Breakfast is nothing to write home about It is a simple buffet has a few options but that s about it , Very nice location that is not too far from main train station About 15mins walk to the ferry that brings you into town which is free or even use the Hotels Shuttle which is 10mins from hotel to main train station Staff is friendly and rooms are quite comfortable and clean

314647,NH Amsterdam Noord, Would have been nice to have known about the happy hour in the bar This won t apply to most people but one reason we chose this hotel was because of the advertised Electric Vehicle charging point However it needs updating for newer type vehicles with one of the sockets being the latest socket or an adapter available staff also need training in procedure for hooking up Travellers from overseas will also need a complimentary connection to the charging network as Dutch network uses different smart cards to activate charging , Good sized room Lovely bathroom Regular shuttle into town Happy Hour in the bar This hotel is used as a layover for Delta airlines flight crew so the bar was buzzing with friendly chatter and life 
314648,NH Amsterdam Noord, The TV design was a bit too big for the size of the room Not necessary to have a huge box to frame the tv, The staff were very friendly The shuttle bus service was fantastic The shower was good
