430226,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, It was perfect , The hotel was lovely and in a perfect area close to the Staatsoper The staff was extremely kind and helpful i needed a doctor and called from the train and they managed to organise it all for me even though it was a Sunday evening Otherwise the room was very nice and clean and we benefitted from the hotel s many facilities 
430227,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, My only little criticism is maybe to check if guests are vegetarian vegan which would save them with the cold cut spreads on the breakfast platter , Vienna can be a tricky place to find cute comfy decently priced rooms and this is one place There are a few rooms which means extra staff attention to detail The breakfast was beautiful with staff doing what they can to accommodate you Little details matter including new fruit infused water concoctions daily much needed during hot Vienna summer days I wish I could have stayed longer and would definitely consider returning 
430228,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Nothing, Nice large and quiet room with aircon Excellent breakfast but not cheap Access to free hot and cold drinks in reception Good bathroom with nice toiletries 
430229,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, The breakfast was very good and the staff very friendly The hotel is very cosy and the location is very good it s not in the center but near Karlsplatz a friendly and quiet neighborhood about a 20 minutes walk to the main places to visit in Vienna like Belvedere Museumsquartier Hofburg and Stephansdom 
430230,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, There was nothing we disliked There is no 24 hrs reception you use a code to enter when there s no one around This did not bother us at all but might be an issue to some other people , Great location a short walk to Karlsplatz from where you have good connections everywhere Appr 15 min walk to the Opera and K rtnerstrasse Spacious and unique room we loved ours Nice breakfast room and good breakfast The menu is limited though more suitable to adults than children A lot of cafes and restaurants around 
430231,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The only downside I can think of is the lack of proper working table so if I had to stay more than one night it would be challenging to work on my laptop If this is not an issue for you than I have no other cons , Everything was just perfect the staff friendly and helpful the room was large and comfortable everything was clean and the wifi was good 
430232,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, We informed Sarah at reception thatwe would be leaving a half hour prior to breakfast She made sure that we were able to have breakfast earlier than they usually serve buffet In addition the breakfast was very good Plenty of options 
430233,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, Even though I booked small double room the spaces were organized in a comfortable way The design of the room was nicely done in a minimal and relaxing style the bed was very comfortable I really advise you to have a breakfast in the hotel not only because of the good quality of it but also because the atmosphere of the dining room is charming and it s a great way to start your day The position of the hotel is quite central and it s easy to explore the city by foot 
430234,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, If I really have to find something the wooden room floor could make some squeaking noise in some areas as you walk on it that might be disturbing to a lightly sleeping partner but not an issue for single travelers , Super nice cosy with a big dose of personal touch hotel The whole place is very beautifully decorated It provides everything for a pleasant stay The personel and the breakfast are from the very best I have ever come accross and I travel a lot 
430235,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, It was really loud I could hear thumpinall morning when I was trying to sleep like someone runningnup and down stairs on stop, I like the room it was comfortable
430236,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, View from our room of construction The room was warm and didn t have a fan and the A C controls didn t work , Good location for easy access to subway and tram Good breakfast and service 
430237,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The breakfast wasn t the best for vegetarians that said there was enough to not go hungry and it wouldn t stop me staying again , Amazing bed really comfy Friendly staff great location I would stay again anytime 
430238,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, the loo is blocked by the sink and corner shower Challenge for tall folks or physical limitations , This Is definitely a quirky boutique hotel and we loved it Our room was comfortable and spacious The room had it s own iPad to look up hotel info and local restaurants and attractions all the rooms are on the second floor of a condo It has a homey feel Best of all is incredible location By the market museums opera We were able to walk everywhere 
430239,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Noise from other guests rooms sound insulation not great Was unseasonably warm during my stay and the staff couldn t override the system to turn on the air conditioning so had to sleep with the window open moderate street noise , Great location just 2 min walk from Karlsplatz underground Lovely breakfast but despite B B being in the hotel name breakfast is 12 50 per day extra Nice staff all speak English 
430240,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The breakfast is quite expensive so we didn t have the chance to try it , Our room was wonderfully decorated and the bed very cosy The tablet in the room was a nice addition It is close to the city centre so most sights are within walkable distance I really appreciated having my tickets printed by the hotel as well as the suggestions about the city in their blog 
430241,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The bathroom is a bit too small , The staff is extremely helpful and friendly The room is very well sized The bed is comfortable The bathroom is modern water pressure is good ventilation is good The location is great The hotel is within walking distance to all of the major attractions but if you don t feel like walking the public transportation is very close We arrived in Vienna with the train and the hotel is only 2 stops away from the main station We would definitely stay here again 
430242,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Very cramped tiny bathroom which would not fit large people no air con so stifling hot very noisy with window open, Comfy beds stylish hotel pleasant staff great location
430243,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Breakfast was not included in the price Reception is not 24hrs A tv issue was fixed the next day when reception was open Our room had no view at all and in combination of the dark colors of room was a bit darkie , Property was close to center 10 walk to the Opera Quiet place Security there is a pin number for the 2 entrances Staff helpful Lovely decoration Comfortable bed Spacious room Good bathroom Very clean we stayed 4 nights and every day it was cleaned and tidy Many books at the reception area 
430244,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Bit dark Room hot but we might not have understood the air con Not that I didn t like it as such but there were times when we felt like the only people in the building might have been the times we were in and out of the building Would go back again , Style tasteful and location fantastic
430245,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, It might sound funny but the room was too hot , Tastefully decorated a small hotel in the city centre a few steps away from Karlsplatz I was there during the lunch break got a code to open the door and my key was in an envelope on the desk The room I stayed in was really very comfortable The shampoo quality nespresso machine well supplied mini bar says that they really care about guests considering the price it s perfect 
430246,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, the comfort of the bed could be better, perfect location very smooth administration good staff nice rooms high quality shower gel and shampoo everything was perfect
430247,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, nothing, Amazing location restaurants and bars nearby as well as all major sights museums shops The staff was super friendly we traveled with a baby and everyone tried to help us in every way The room was very clean and comfy I highly recommend opting for breakfast as it was also amazing 
430248,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The pillows were not great too small and flat I could not ask to swap because Reception was closed at the time I had difficuties opening the Hotel door but the Cleaner was there and helped me out , My bedroom was really spacious and nice The breakfast was sensacional they brought fresh made smooth to my table The decor was fab The staff were so helpful and attentive to details Defo going back 
430249,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Wifi was very slow and kept cutting out so we couldn t look things up for very long Could hear noise very easily from the room above The room was very hot They only give you champagne during happy hour which is when most people aren t at the hotel anyway , Beautiful hotel great location near a couple great cafes and restaurants Appreciated the black out drapes The staff was great even though there isn t a 24h reception We appreciated the tablet in the room 
430250,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Had to wait for two hours to check in because my room was not ready by the time I arrived , Very nice and trendy hotel perfectly located and easy to access Hotel is located less than 5 minutes from Karlplatz metro station Room was well designed warm and the beds were comfortable Nice addition to all said above is malin goetz cosmetics in the bathroom Definitely a place to stay in Vienna Very good value for money 
430251,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, ask reception for parking recommendation We didn t and just parked at Wipark Garagen at Operngasse that charged us 40EUR for 1 night stay , fresh design spacious room great location glass of champaign to calm you down just upon arrival living like a locals well preserved city house
430252,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, Perfect location 2 blocks from the market lots of offers for food and restaurants Also within walking distance to the Belvedere I also walked to the city center every day as it was very pleasant and not far a all On the day of my return I even walked back to the train station 20 mn to catch the airport train 
430253,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, There was a fluff of hair on the bathroom floor when I checked in the room carpet in room was stained , Location size and decor of the room comfortable mattress nice and attentive personnel at Reception 
430254,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Nothing as it represents good value for money but none of the main line hotel facilities if that is your thing , Great position and a quirky little hotel Loved the unusual decor and the fact that it does feel like another big corporate hotel Great position to explore the city and very close to Karlzplatz station 
430255,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Tea and coffee in reception rather than in the room Internet access was very poor There is a building site opposite which may be noisy during weekdays we were there at the weekend so it didn t affect us , Great location and easy access to underground Interesting decor Able to leave luggage after checkout but not in secure place Breakfast available if preordered Staff helpful when asked but not overly welcoming maybe it s a cultural thing 
430256,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Bathroom space was very limited For working the room is not good as there s no table but for vacay optimal Lastly that s not a problem of hotel but problem of its guests advice them about how to behave at 1 2 a m no one cares about noise of the Italian group , Excellent location close to Karlsplatz so city centre in the walking distance Wifi worked well 
430257,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, There was a musty smell to the room Breakfast selection was poor especially for a vegetarian and I would advise avoiding the scrambled eggs , Not much was expecting far better having read previous reviews 
430258,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, We didn t care for that but our windows looked out on the other part of the hotel s building In our booking it was written that check in is at 11 but the room was ready only at 12 , Great location near Naschmarkt and Karlsplatz The hotel is cozy The room was spacious and interestingly furnished not your usual boring hotel room But one thing made it even more special a glass of champagne upon arrival 
430259,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Tiny bathroom Our room faced into adjacent hotels restaurant only a few feet away great for when you step out of the shower Champagne available but at an additional price , Close to public transport Quiet Staff friendly 
430260,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, We were charged for an extra bed which was a sofa bad that was already part of the room furniture also there was no proper front desk we had to guess our way around when we arrived , Location was very good although there are much better located properties for the same value 
430261,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, We had trouble with the tv system which could not be resolved free breakfast was offered upon request to compensate , The establishment and rooms are very well presented and they endeavour to make it a great experience Staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was pleasant and recommended 
430262,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Breakfast was a little expensive so we went next door to the cafe which was excellent value Unfortunately building works were going on next door which rather ruined the peace and quiet but we spent most of the day out anyway , The rooms were very pretty and the beds extremely comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful The location was very convenient for all the major attractions 
430263,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Bathroom was pretty small but clean so it was not too bad , Location was great Rooms were spacious with a reasonable price Very close to the subway and only two stops from the main train station 
430264,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Hotel breakfast at 12 50 EUR per person including little kids overpriced so we ate in Radlager at Operngasse nearby a bike repair shop combined with a caf , Great boutique hotel at a great location with helpful staff Underground parking as well as public transportation nearby 
430265,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, The hotel was very well positioned close to public transport links and with most museums etc within fifteen minutes walk There was also a very good cafe restaurant outside on the corner The room was very comfortable with all necessary amenities including good pillows The air conditioning worked well for us on some very hot days 
430266,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, This place has old school charm although it s totally contemporary Excellent staff You feel very intimate and welcomed A noisy construction site opposite of the hotel during daytime but double windows keep the noise out 
430267,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Minor but TV not working to receive international news channels Checkin not helped as we d arrived early from overnight train to Vienna but couldn t check in till after 12 30 Probably just unlucky as previous guests stayed till last moment, Great location Comfortable spacious room Friendly and helpful staff Produced a kettle so I could make tea in our room
430268,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The only problem i had was that the fire exit ledder was placed next to my window so I did not feel safe to let the window open during the night and it was quite hot in the room I could have used the aircon but I always prefer the old way with open window getting the cool air directly from the outside , The room was very modern and nice and comfortable I liked placing the bathtub in the sleeping room 
430269,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, All was good but we had little to no view in our room but it was really not an issue actually , Wonderful location directly in the city centre The themed rooms are a very nice touch and the beds are very comfy All the tips available in the hostel are also good to get the best out of your visit to Vienna 
430270,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, I would have preferred there to be a security door chain or something similar to lock the room while we were sleeping , Good location nice design spacious room and the staff was helpful All in all a very good hotel and a pleasant stay 
430271,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was lovely Even the honesty bar in the reception Breakfast was fab staff so helpful bed so comfortable There s building works going on opposite You DONT even notice them so don t be worried My friends were over from Australia and had no trouble sleeping double glazing in the front rooms so didn t even flinch I loved this hotel a complete gem of a find If they had these hotels in different countries wed book there again at our next destination Thank you for a wonderful stay 
430272,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, One of the staffs was really not friendly Some wall sockets were out of the wall Looked like not safe When we woke up in the morning there were no electricity for light It was not easy to connect to the wifi It showed that there were too many users ,No Positive
430273,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Entrance of the building is not very welcoming nor clean Wi Fi sinal was unstable and there was a bad smell at the room on the first night solved later , Spacious rooms excellent breakfast and very convenient location The kindness of the servi o is also noteworthy 
430274,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Entry the the building was a little tired and not a good impression Howhever once you get to the B B on the floor all is good , Was quite a good location being only 5 minute walk to the Opera House and 10 15 to centre of city Train and tram also very close Rooms very comfortable Laundry Drycleaner in same building and a restaurant beer garden basically at the front door 
430275,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, For those visitors coming in a car the staff needs to provide much better instruction about parking There is actually a parking garage quite nearby which offers a very reasonable daily parking price if arranged through St Shermin But unfortunately the details and location of the parking garage were only disclosed AFTER we arrived which caused us a good deal of confusion at the outset of our visit So please next time be sure to explain the parking upfront as this will make the whole experience at St Shermin get off to a much more comfortable start , Location was great staff were very nice 
430276,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The noise outside but it is city s centre after all and we could close the double window and use air condition The background music in breakfast room not to everybody s taste perhaps , I am not going to list all the things I liked at Saint Shermin because next time I want to stay in Vienna the place will be booked up and it will be very upsetting This is one of the nicest hotels we have ever been in 
430277,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The pillows could have been better The bathroom was small Better for leisure than business , We very much liked the breakfast and the amenities used in the bathroom were very nice 
430278,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, There is nothing I did not like , I like the location even though there is construction going on at the moment with extra noise and dust This should not last very long The location is very convenient one can reach the metro at Karlsplatz in a few minutes or keep going and stroll by the opera house and toward the old city in a quest for restaurants and ice cream parlors 
430279,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Maybe the pillows could of been firmer, The little extras such as the sweets when departing the staff were the friendliest and most helpful The rooms were delightful A little gem of a hotel Can t wait to go back
430280,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, There was nothing to complain about , Stylish unique and individual It s was pleasure for me to stay in a non hotel chain location where not everything might be super professional but very charming and personally 
430281,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The breakfast was overpriced and it was strange arriving at night because their reception was closed The the name is a little misleading as we received zero champagne Also the bathroom was a little cramped , The room was very comfortable with couches and was incredibly clean the staff answered all our questions about the city and provided us with lots of information 
430282,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Pillows were not convenient and one plug was broken , Rooms were spacious and the property is located near to the Karlsplatz Metro station U1 U2 U4 and 15 minutes walk to the main square 
430283,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, We were family with 2 children and the room was a bit squash and squeeze for all of us The rest was excellent , I loved the interior design of the hotel with attention to details It has a character My room had a nice street view but without the street noise Bathroom products were lovely 
430284,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Not a massive problem but would have preferred one double duvet on bed rather than 2 singles , Rooms were spacious but very cosy Appeared to be extremely clean Very friendly staff and a lovely reception area with a free capsule coffee everyday Breakfast was very good value for money Had a room overlooking the street but it was very quiet Code for doors made it feel secure also Added bonus chocolate on pillow on arrival Very close to the Naschmarkt also which is great fun 
430285,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Room was very warm even with the airconditioning on There were 2 coffee capsules provided in the room both decaf weren t replenished during stay 4 nights Reception staff only available at certain hours so not easy to complain about this , Fairly well located Big and clean rooms Good shower Big and comfortable bed No noise from the streets 
430286,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, A very minor issue I had was that their was no English Language TV Channels available in my room I also could hear noise from the other rooms , Nice and helpful staff in a great Location and a very comfortable room 
430287,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, NOTHING, EVERYTHING the location 3 minutes walk from the Opera house and hence from evrything the rooms the breakfast room the breakfast the interior decoration the champagne at breakfast the staff and even the bar below
430288,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, We have absoultely loved the design of the room it was something different than all other hotels we ve been to Everything in this hotel is tasteful and nice The personnel is helpful and kind 
430289,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The bathroom is small soundproof is not excellent but acceptable , The design location and friendly staff the room is lovely and extremely well designed Good price Highly recommended I would like to repeat if I go to Vienna again 
430290,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Staying similar places breakfast as well as a complementary drink has usually been included Staying a place that prides itself with breakfast and champagne it was unexpected that neither breakfast nor champagne was included , Good location Interesting rooms Great breakfast but you have to pay quite a bit for it 
430291,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Very little staff interaction but for our itinerary over Christmas it didn t really matter , Location effciency and very clean room Nice shower and large bed Free water and cookies and Nespresso 
430292,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, Friendly replies to questions and parking arranged for us on arrival Very nice room great breakfast and parking arranged to continue after stay so we could see Vienna 
430293,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The bathroom was too small for us though we are fragile No luggage room strange smell in the hall and stairs , The staff was nice the room was clean an early check in very close to the city centre but in a quiet neighborhood Will stay again for sure 
430294,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Breakfast was good at best The space was super small and cramped Would have probably just opted to eat at a near by cafe next time , Awesome location for a fair price There are tons of awesome restaurants and cafes near by And parking is only 20 a day at a near by garage would definitely come back 
430295,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, The room was too hot not really a problem but worth mentioning Avoid the restaurant LEANBACK just accros the street which was expensive offering low quality food, Location just a 6 minute walk from center Spacious room Friendly staff
430296,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Reception is only open from 07 00 to 13 00 This was not clearly mentioned on the presentation The hotel occupies the first floor in an apartment building The room was small somehow cluttered with furniture the room was very dark the windows opened in a very small inner court filled with some tubes In the morning there was water or something running in these tubes made a lot of unpleasant noise WiFi was free but with a browser login system that is very annoying you have to log in EVERY time again and again , Very good location within walking distance to Opera Museums and city center close to Metro station Karlsplatz
430297,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Bathroom smell of room 13 was a little bit unpleasent but not a serious concern , Very nice and helpful staff and a great breakfast Good champagne service 
430298,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, PIN sent by SMS for opening the main door was not the right one Suggest to check the PIN by phone prior to arrival especially in case of late check in , Arrived late in the evening everything was good thanks 
430299,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Room small location good but but not great The building in which the the B B is housed smells like frying oil although the B B itself was very clean and smelled fine , Staff very helpful Breakfast very good 
430300,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, Excellently run familly owned Boutique Hotel although they call themselves a Bed and Breakfast Tastefully renovated Centrally located We walked to all of the major sights we wanted to see Many good restaurants surround it If you need a grand bathroom in your room do not stay here
430301,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, Very friendly and clean Good location only a few minutes walk from centre of city and only a couple of minutes from the underground Good value for the money 
430302,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Hard finding place when we first arrived as it s on a street that doesn t go through , Charming Much nicer than expected for the price Fabulous breakfast included in our daily rate with complementary champagne Staff very accommodating about our late arrival departure Location great 
430303,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, Everything was excellent Location near restaurants and bars Very clean and cozy room Personnel very attentive and polite Very nice concept champagne Overall 10 Thank you again for this wonderful stay in Vienna 
430304,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Reception is only open 4 hours a day With the name being Bed Breakfast and Champagne we expected at least a welcome glass on arrival but no it was apparently suppose to be offered with breakfast however we only saw it one day and it was not replenished for other guests who arrived later to breakfast You could always buy champagne but we expected a bit of luxury already included that wasn t there There are tea and coffee facilities in the lobby but you only have access to the coffee capsules put in your room by housekeeping unfortunately ours were never replenished so we could not have coffee , very cute boutique hotel the bed is beyond comfortable staff very helpful when they were around the location is perfect for walking anywhere in vienna We would definitely stay again 
430305,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, it is not a hotel it is a pension staff worked from 7 00 am till 1 00 pm and from 5 00 pm till 8 00 pm and then no one to talk to we where shocked when we arrived at night the door was looked and we had to open the door by using a code we hated the entrance , it is located in the heart of downtown of Vienna opera stephensplatz church shopping street karntner strasse st metro station it is very clean room new l decorated very good wifi breakfast is good staff are very nice 
430306,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, Not really bad but The reception person when she was there very limited hours always had her back turned to the front door We could have come in the front door and no one would really know if we were a guest or some crazy person robbing the place cause no one would turn around and say hello or even acknowledge us No effort to be welcoming which was disappointing Nice hotel but it s sort of really self service To be fair we didn t sign up for breakfast Maybe that s where the hotel people meet guests I don t know We like the personal touch in these smaller hotels and thought it would be a family run type of place but it wasn t very friendly at all Bathrooms were small but that is minor A C didn t work too well the first day but was fine subsequently , Very stylish rooms Clean Tall gorgeous windows Creative design and color scheme that was modern thoughtful and enjoyable 
430307,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne,No Negative, Room is well maintained looks new and fresh and well equipped Enough but not too much furniture gives places where to sit and put your stuff aside from the bed A welcome glass of champaign was also a pleasant surprise 
430308,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, When I got there the man at the reception didn t know I was by myself there was some sort of mix up and as he showed me the room he was wondering if he should take off the sheets from one side of the bed since I was by myself I found this extremely unwellcoming Luckily he left the sheets but took away the extra towels , The room was lovely spacious and beautifully decorated Great value for money and excelent location 
430309,Saint SHERMIN bed breakfast champagne, I think it would be fair to inform the clients that this is not a hotel nor a pension but a few apartments transformed in rooms with a small room where breakfast is served The view from our room was a wall and we could of hear every single sound from the other rooms including tv and conversations We thought this was a hotel it isn t , Wifi good location
