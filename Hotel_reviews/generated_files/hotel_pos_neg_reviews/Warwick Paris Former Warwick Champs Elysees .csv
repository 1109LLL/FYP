201261,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , nothing all good, The hotel is nice and the location is great right in the heart of Paris Of course you pay for that but the cost is much less than larger hotel chains right around the block Worth the money simply for the location and staff 
201262,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The furniture is becoming old, Very good location Also I would like to thank Sophia who is working in the reception She was kind and helpful and find a nice room to me even I come so early morning 
201263,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , There was unpleasant smell in the room and the bed We couldn t sleep well because of the noise outside the hotel , A great location very friendly and professional staff 
201264,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Breakfast was lousy not at all good Very limited options Room service was not upto the mark Not enough anenities like shower gels shampoo etc provided , Location of property conceirge services
201265,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Nothing , Got an upgrade to a bigger room with a balcony overlooking the champs elysee Amazing view and excellent staff The bathrooms are equipped with WC washing supplies The rooms are huge for Paris and the location is on the champs elysee street with department stores next to the hotel Will defintly go back 
201266,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Bathroom smells bad needs new furniture Pillows are too soft and air condition is not cold at all a c system has to be fixed , Excellent and fast service you ask for anything the door will be knocked in a minute Very helpful staff
201267,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , More variety on English TV , Bed and pillows were very good Nice bathroom too Staff very helpful Location is par excellence for non business travellers 
201268,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , They didn t put free water in my room as hospitality and they put to my freind When I asked the reception about that he said it s the fourth visit for your and but my freind said it s his first Also they put a bill doesn t belong to me and i was suprised by it when i was checking out , The hotel location is perfect
201269,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , To have more restaurant in the premises The seated area in the lobby is very little despite rhere is an empty area can be furnished under the mirror , Thd warm welcome of the staff variety of food at the breakfast is quite enough The express check out service bill took no time to be ready settled

201271,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees ,No Negative, The staff were so friendly ready to help and spoke fluent English which was great as my partner and I were worried we would struggle only knowing a little French 
201272,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The fact that the bathroom toilette is in a separate room than the main bathroom that has the washing basin and the bathtub which was not very practical or comfortable since you have to go from one room to another to wash your hands after using it If you are not staying with a close person this may become an issue especially if you are the kind who prefers to wash your hands before you pull up your pants Just joking LOL , Location location location first It is right off the famous Champs Elysee i e a minute away and a few steps to George V metro station which is directly connected to the bigger Charles De Gaule station which has the RER It is also close to a lot of very good restaurants and cafes including the famous Georges V with its tasty hot chocolate and desserts and shopping centers as Monoprix Zara H and M Sephora and great brands as Kenzo and Louis Vuitton The room size was good for a family of 3 We took the Executive room that had a queen sized bed that was comfortable in addition to a double sized sofa bed that can accomodate 2 We were shown the Junior suite which was bigger and had on top a small dinning table but it turned out to be a 100 euros more expensive per night and frankly did not think it was worth it especially since we were not planning to eat in the room The heating system worked very well which was a blessing since the temperature was around 1 C i e it was freezing The room had a very good sized closet an easy to use safe and a small fridge It had also a writing table and a chair and enough space for the lauggage The bathroom though was a little impractical since the toilette was in a separate room than the washing basin and the bathtub but the size was great and spacy and the magnifiying mirror was well located something of prime importance to me and my daughters to apply makeup easily The room lighting was good though it could be made better since you need to put each light on or off separately There was a little issue with the electricity sockets which were in impractical places and we had to go down to plug our phone chargers and i believe they should have been placed in a higher locations to give people easier access Also i realized unfortunately too late that the plugs located near the room entrance will shut down once the main corridor lamp is turned off i 
201273,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The AC not great in the room too hot , Excellent staff greeting and upgraded without question due to the amount of luggage we were carrying as we were driving through Europe skiing The hotels suggestion 
201274,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , To have to wait for our breakfast because too many clients and not enough sitting space for everybody, Location and breakfast The help and smile of the personnel 
201275,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , We had five rooms and one of them was on the 1st floor above the nightclub the base was very loud until 5am and we should have been warned We would make sure we were not on that floor next time , Convenience of location very good staff 
201276,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The receptionist did not agree for early check in although the rooms were available and I requested this early They promised upon availability Also she asked me the credit card and I told her to charge the amount from the same amount reserved on time of reservation She promised to do that but she reserved another amount On the time of check out her colleague informed me that she don t need to do that because the amount reserved in reservation is enough You know while traveling you don t want extra reserving with your credit card , Location

201282,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Breakfast was pretty good but no surprise considering its price 24 Euro which was not included in the fare Sometimes room cleaning came lately in weekday When I backed to the room in 5 PM one day it was still not finished Besides after I had been out for dinner the room was cleaned again in the evening I m not for sure the reason , It was located in very convenient place close to Arc de triomphe 2 metro stations George V and Franklin D Roosevelt are available

201290,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Had to pay more eventually cuz a baby isnt free even though he sleeps with us in the same bed they charged us for a deluxe room , chic the hallways smell delicious breakfast is nice reception isnt that friendly but then again the whole of france is like that the room isnt that small as other hotels and best of all the location

201293,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , We are usually traveling to Paris 2 3 times a year for business and leisure We have stayed in much smaller hotels typical of Paris too but our stay at Warwick was our worst ever stay in the last 18 years The name is too big for this hotel with Zero standard We were in a Deluxe room with extremely dirty curtains walls and bathroom The curtain walls and ceiling had dirt marks of insect killed on them that were not removed The phones in the room were not working The pop up blockers in bathtub and wash basin could not be opened but to be removed ON 4TH NIGHT MY WIFE WAS SCREAMING OF SEEING A COACKROACH IN THE BATHROOM We complained about hygiene and poor condition of room the next morning in the afternoon we noticed the cleaners had not properly vacuumed and cleaned the room and even intentionally left bunches of hairs on table wash basin and bed So rude Even scattered our slippers on the floor After our complain and opposition we were moved to an executive room which was a bit less outdated but strangely the cleaning and room maintain service was completely different In our 8 night stay we could finally sleep 2 night a bit comfortable The breakfast dishes are mostly dirty with food and oil stains This hotel is suffering of a serious hygiene issues I do not recommend this hotel to anyone expecting stay in a starred hotel It can be a cheap dirty hostel , The only positive point of this hotel is location although the homeless man sleeping off the street was also enjoying the same location as us but we paid Euro 220 nigh that he did not Good for him 
201294,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Restaurant is closed on the weekends but room service is available , 5 minutes from Arc de Triomphe and just off the Champs Elys e We had a private balcony with a view of the top 3rd of the Eiffel Tower Expensive to stay here if you just turn up but we saved 50 using this site 
201295,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Bathroom toiletries only for one person though it was clear there were two people in the room and nothing was replenished on the last day night We ran out of tissues and almost toilet rolls Check in very pleasant helpful receptionist but checkout was very different another receptionist left us for over five minutes deciding to deal with another customer who was a distance away from the reception area with his wife because he asked her a question about the contents of a box he was holding Meanwhile my credit card was being processed the amount was charged in the wrong currency I felt very concerned for the security of my card as during this long period while the receptionist was away I could not see my card and there were other customers hanging around the reception area On her return I expressed my concern and the currency error but her explanation was not satisfactory and to placate me she offered the hotel pen as I left which naturally I declined , Great location breakfast fair choice except scrambled eggs too runny for my taste Beds comfortable and well presented interior Tea and coffee making facilities everything clean and tidy in the room 
201296,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Breakfast staff were a bit unhappy and the timing of breakfast was quick till 10 am if it was 10 30 will be better They don t accept any food to bring from outside resturants what if I have children and they don t eat but particular things or Somone can t eat any kind of food must be something particular , The location was amazing and the staff were welcoming
201297,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Bed size too small for 2 persons cushions not comfortable curtains need to be replaced Improve cleanliness of facilities such as the hair dryer hose Improve speed of responding to complaints , Excellent location friendly staff
201298,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees ,No Negative, The location of the hotel was perfect for a family traveling as tourists to Paris Being near to Champs Elysee provided us with that extra zing and taste of the parisien life after a full day 
201299,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Breakfast was cold even 30 minutes after opening poor hot plates to maintain the heat of the food The hotel restaurant and bar was closed at weekends , The location was excellent and the concierge and staff were very helpful in arranging transport and activities bookings 
201300,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Noisy when you open windows being centrally located , Centrally located if you want to be near Champs Elysses good breakfast clean and very reasonably priced Near shopping area
201301,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees ,No Negative, Good location very comfortable bed and pillows Staff organised a bottle of Champagne and macaroons on arrival to celebrate my husband s 60th Birthday We had a room with a terrace which was a big plus 
201302,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The fact that the hotel stole 200 euros from us and have refused to answer our emails When we booked in we were told that the cost of the accommodation would be held plus 200 euros for any extra expenses If we paid on the same card when we checked out the 200 euros would go straight back in It did not and the full amount of 1 482 euros was kept even though we had a written quote for 1 280 euros for accommodation and did not use any other of the hotel facilities The cost was one of the reasons we chose the hotel in the first place Had we known they were going to keep the equivalent of another night s accommodation we would not have chosen them In spite of contacting both the hotel and booking com nothing has been done about it This is theft pure and simple and booking com as we booked through you you are resposible Also we were asked if we had any special requests We requested a quiet non smoking room and guess what We were put right next to the lift Great service I do intend to pursue getting our money back by whatever means possible I believe the Warwick is one of a chain of hotels and if we have to go straight to the top man we will , Nothing particularly 
201303,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees ,No Negative, My wife and I went for the football and found the location of this hotel great for taking in the sites and being able to spend more money than planned in the shops
201304,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , During breakfast you must pay extra if you want to change the type of eggs Example fried eggs you must be extra Ommlett must be extra This is never happen to me before Could be the French rules for breakfast , Smoking in the room 
201305,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , the room is just a little bit a small but its fine, the staff were friendly and helpful luxurios rooms with good AC the toilet is provided with water hose and that s is a most for some ppl the location is just view meters from the champs the parking is just near by the hotel and there is a lift inside the hotel for it
201306,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , I don t think the staff was very welcoming or nice Actually when we arrived there were 4 of us because one of my kids was staying with my mom in another hotel but I wanted to check in first Since the room was only for three they were claiming that we were 4 and not 3 and although I let them know my older son was not staying in the hotel they were doubtful about it and rude They cleaned our room very late although we usually would go out before 10am Overall it was clean but the toilet had stains it is old but they need to change it because it looks dirty We left glasses with water or juice and when we came back they were still there the cleaning lady would not take them away which is also not very thoughtful or clean , The location is great literally a couple of steps from Champs Elysees The room is nice and bathroom is very big which is a plus in Paris where they usually have tiny spaces The toilet is in a separate space than the shower which is also great 
201307,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Worst experience using Booking com Booking recommended a Deluxe King Room to me for 2 adults and 2 children however when I arrived at the hotel they told me I can t stay in that room because We have 4 people even though my little daughter is only 8 months old I have to upgrade the room to a Junior Suite and cost me 200 euros more It s a terrible experience and I contacted Booking right away but got no reply until now 12 days passed , Great location 
201308,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Not nearly enough pillows And it seemed rather pricey but I guess you pay for the location, The view from the roof top bar was excellent and the food very good
201309,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , A little bit expensive A room a little bit small, Great location near Champs Elysees avenue where all the shops and restaurants are George V metro station is close by Arc de Triomphe is also within walking distance If you like cabaret Lido is also near by
201310,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The service in the restaurant should improved when the breakfast buffet almost closed since staff took away my dishes and spoon when I need to eat the fruit on the table i need to take another spoon from buffet area but the staff just told me buffet are closed I noticed the time and wasn t going to take any food in the buffet area but they didn t known guest s intention and thought I want to take food plus the food was still there Which made me very uncomfortable I wish service really need to be improved if hotel wants to have good reputation and sustainable development in hotel industry , Honestly everything was perfect EXCEPT the service attitude of receptionist a lady is very bad impatient and rude for instance I called reception she didn t wait for I finished talking just closed the phone which was really shocked me When I came down for asking some question and check out she was super impatient and bad attitude Well I m a student from hospitality and as the knowledge I ve got from school should not be like this such a good hotel with this bad staff I had very bad impression about that Hopefully she could improve the service attitude trying to be nicer to the guest Because the guests deserve basic respect since we paid much money 
201311,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , I don t like the view of the room small lobby , Excellent location good breakfast u can buy a SIM card ticket for tour in the city and in the river from concierge desk 
201312,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Doorman don t really help us to carry the luggage and the entrance door is quite heavy to pull , The location is really good I like the toilet room size and decoration 
201313,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Nothing Would have liked order an egg of my choice at breakfast But otherwise the selection is quite reasonable , Everything about the hotel Hospitality was great which is very unusual for Paris Concierge is exceptional Room very comfortable Very close to the Champs Elysee 
201314,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Nothing all was just perfect, The staff were super hospitable friendly cheerful and very helpful I recall yoaan on reception his female colleague very helpful cheerful manner an attitude rarely to find in other paris hotels we visited in the past This friendly attitude led us to reserve again for three night in September 2016 
201315,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees ,No Negative, Hotel stuff always were ready for our help Consierge team was excellent We stayed there for honeymoon They upgrated our room Also Housekeeping team made littile surprise for us 
201316,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , It was incredibly noisy We heard sirens and horns all night and couldn t sleep I was very glad to leave and that we were only there one night The room also smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though it was a nonsmoking room Aesthetics and services were great but the rest was a major blow to the experience , Bed was comfy Room was spacious 
201317,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The female concierge was uninterested forgot to book our taxi didnt return our calls when she said she would Poor customer service from this staff member Paying for our stay was inefficient and was very convoluted , Bascially the location was the main attraction to this hotel

201320,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Only complaint is we asked for an iron and it never came Had to ask again and that time they brought it to the room Very minor complaint given the rest of the experience at this hotel The location is great to get around the city but Champs Elysees doesn t offer many great affordable food choices within walking distance Most of the restaurants cafes are either outrageously expensive or not very good Suggest researching and venturing out of the area for that , Excellent stay Location was great for sight seeing and right near a subway station making it easy to get around the city Person at the front desk was lovely and upgraded us to a deluxe room free of charge The bed was incredibly comfortable Hotel is nice and seemed very clean 
201321,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The view I had an internal view Not good The breakfast is good but too expensive , Comfortable A lot of space in the room Location Overall very nice hotel
201322,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The card keys didn t always work in the lift but not a big deal , Breakfast was very good and a lovely treat served up to our room Why on earth would you go downstairs for breakfast when you could eat it on your own private sunny balcony The room was a good size very clean and all the amenities were what one would wish for On the first night we ate in the Warwick s a la carte restaurant the food was delicious and the service was excellent thoroughly recommend it as it was one of the finest meals we ate in Paris that weekend S
201323,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , This is not my first time staying in Paris but it will be my last staying at hotel Warwick Reasons Extermily small rooms even for Paris standards the bed is only size queen made sleeping uncomfortable The shower was just bad Pricy for the level of the hotel, Good location one minute walking to champs elysees

201329,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , One of the things which i didnt like it is that i have to pay 20 dollors if i want to buy a food from outside the hotel and eat it in my room, Just a location and the lovely staff
201330,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , If you want check in early make sure that the hotel will take an advantage of you in my case the Receptionist Sofia almost forced me to upgrade my room for the whole stay to benefit from the early check in and the discounted rate of the upgrade although when i checked online i found availability of room the same type of my original booking and also i found a cheaper rate for the upgraded room the Receptionist claimed it was discounted Rooms facing the street are very noisey because of the night club near the hotel Internet signal is weak in the room My honest opinion is to book in California Champs Ely ees hotel, Location close to Champs Ely se The cleanliness of the room
201331,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , There was nothing special for the honeymoon couple as we thought of There was nothing complementary too as we were there for our honeymoon though we choosed your property out of all ,No Positive
201332,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The only issue we had was on arrival being forced to purchase a second room Booking booked our room for four and the hotel didn t allow 4 in that particular room It was money we didn t plan on spending and was a huge bummer , The staff was amazing and couldn t have been more helpful The location was perfect and our trip was anazing We d certainly stay here again 
201333,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The furniture is a little bit old And all standard rooms have bad views Also the toilet seat is separated from the whole washroom which was a bit of a hassle But all these are tiny infront of its benefits Its a little bit expensive but I think for Paris prices this is normal, Location is the best part Also the staff is very welcoming and helpful The AC was not working in our room and in seconds after we complained they changed the room and upgraded it which was amazig
201334,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , Staff at reception especialy the dupty manager lady she was very rude I made my reservation included breakfast but at checkin time i have been told that your reservation without breakfast, Location

201337,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , There are some clubs around so if you re staying in a room with an outlook to the inner square of the building it can be annoying at night , I liked the staff to be honest they were very friendly and the location is perfect 
201338,Warwick Paris Former Warwick Champs Elysees , The hotel it self is very old you can the floor crak ander while you walk on the halfway The staff was the worst , Beds are really comfortable Location is exatcly what I was lookint for
