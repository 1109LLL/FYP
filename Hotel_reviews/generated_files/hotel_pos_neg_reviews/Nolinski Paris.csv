62183,Nolinski Paris, double bed is not the most convenient to sleep for a couple the mattress rocks around when one person is moving there seems to be no option in the hotel for a room with 2 separate beds , amazing staff great restaurant beautiful design convenient location quiet room large TV 
62184,Nolinski Paris, Nothing, My wife and I spent 4 excellent days in Nolinski Paris and we will definitely return back Location is perfect and everybody do their best to make you feel special and comfortable Thank you all for an amazing stay 
62185,Nolinski Paris, There really isn t anything I didn t like , The service was outstanding The hotel was beautiful and had wonderful rooms The look is modern but beautiful The hotel is near everything imaginable We loved our stay The staff go above and beyond to be helpful Thank you Tiffany and we loved every minute of our stay 
62186,Nolinski Paris,No Negative, The attention to detail through out the whole hotel was incredible From the facility to staff to the food The staff were so accommodating and friendly They organised a private driver to take us to the champagne region along with booking fabulous dinner locations The hotel was within walking distance to everywhere on the city you need to go Or there was a metro stop at the front door 
62187,Nolinski Paris, Rooms are very small I tried lunch at the restaurant and it was probbaly the worst steak i ve ever had , The staff were absolutely amazing It made all the difference The spa is out of this world 
62188,Nolinski Paris,No Negative, The decor is cozy there s a sense of privacy intimacy and comfort Once you enter the hotel you forget the busy Paris The spa and pool keep the same spirit Subliminal 
62189,Nolinski Paris, Let s get back to the Spa Experience I really had the worst pedicure manicure experience in my life The lady was not skilled at all She went far to deep and even the bleeding yes 4 fingers were bleeding didn t stop her from scratching with her instruments deep into the flesh She reacted even angry when I told her to be more careful LOL Even 5 days later 3 fingers are still infected The late check out policy is interesting I had a massage shortly before my checkout I asked for a late check out and they offered me one hour A high price hotel more than 1500 for 3 nights including extras I paid almost 2000 should be able to be more generous Offering me only the time I spend at the massage was rather outragous A newly opened Hotel should always try to make the new guests regular guests But not with this policy , The Nolinski Paris is a new and small Hotel near the Louvre and the Opera The Location is convenient if u like to be close to those sightseeing spots All Hotel rooms in Paris are rather small compared to Berlin Munich London Dubai etc So the Nolinski is no exception You have to take it or leave it I d like to point out that the concierge service was exceptional The Concierge Pierre organized all tours for the Louvre the Opera tickets and made all restaurant reservations Very good Also the Spa experience was extraordinary The Deep tissue massage by massage therapist Julian was one of the best I ever had I can highly recommend 
62190,Nolinski Paris, Breakfast is largely overpriced , Location is great just a few minutes walk to form Louvre and Opera Rooms have fair size not common for Paris and nicely decorated Service is great 
62191,Nolinski Paris,No Negative, Phenomenal location beautiful furnishings and what a pool As a dedicated swimmer the 16 metre heated pool was sensational The staff were extraordinarily warm and friendly Highly recommended
62192,Nolinski Paris,No Negative, Exceptional hotel on every level highly recommended Amazing service great location and most importantly the friendliest and most polite staff that will always do their best Certainly made my stay 10x better than staying at any other establishment 
62193,Nolinski Paris, The location didn t seem as classy as the hotel but in all promixity to attractions transportation and city center is very very okay , The design and deco of the hotel is fantastic It is clean and fresh Very polite and smart staff Nice boutique hotel for a modern traveler 
62194,Nolinski Paris, Nothing the place was great , Beautiful hotel great location fantastic decor comfortable beds Breaskfast in the brasserie downstairs was excellent and relatively good value The swimming pool in the basement is located in the spa and is candlelit a great place to spend a couple of hours in the afternoon or evening to relax The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly 
62195,Nolinski Paris, Minor point really sauna could be a bit hotter The double bed was a bit small and jumpy when you turn your partner is springing up at night Hotel is pretty difficult to find blending into the street especially when you drive The room and bathroom was not huge but they are very tall so it gives enough air and feeling of space , Fantastic staff nice spa open 24 hours Great design Good food in the bistro Fast wifi 
62196,Nolinski Paris, I did not recognize any shortcomings , This was our first time staying at the Nolisnki The service at this hotel was the finest I have ever encountered in my entire history of staying at luxury hotels I will never stay anywhere else when I am in Paris 
62197,Nolinski Paris,No Negative, The attention to detail in the hotel is awesome nothing is over looked no corners cut the staff are incredible I forgot my camera in a taxi by the time I arrived back after my meal the camera was at the front desk 
62198,Nolinski Paris, Toilet paper and tissue boxes They don t match the quality of everything else including the amazing staff , Exceptional service standard Nothing is overlooked Staff are willing to do anything for you 
62199,Nolinski Paris, All good Price is for that special stay , Staff fabulous friendly and helpful Amazing architecture and conversion Really good location Quiet rooms Good breakfast Free phone for stay Recommended for a special stay in Paris On honeymoon Double deluxe room 
62200,Nolinski Paris, I would have liked free tea and coffee facilities maybe the lounge and an option to have breakfast included in the price , The hotel is an oasis of calm in a frenetic city Rooms are beautifully decorated and equipped and the quadruple glazing made it very quiet 
62201,Nolinski Paris, Only the view but I didn t go to Paris to stare out of a hotel window , The hotel is brand new with strong modern interior design and good quality finishes All of the staff were friendly and helpful as expected in a hotel of this calibre The swimming pool is dark and tranquil with a sauna and a steam room The pool is open 24 7 and other pool facilities available after 11pm by arrangement with the staff 
62202,Nolinski Paris, Room was a little small But Coming from the US i m not sure if thats just the Norm in Paris Other then that hotel was great, Awesome hotel Staff is super friendly 
62203,Nolinski Paris, For the rate of the room I thought it would have been bigger Whilst it was incredible the room itself didn t have an abundance of floor space despite booking a Superior Double , The hotel went to an extra effort to put on some food and drink requested before check in so I could surprise my boyfriend Wonderful The room was gorgeous and real luxury and the location couldn t have been more perfect for our weekend excursions 
62204,Nolinski Paris, Their is nothing not to like I really can t think of anything , What a wonderful place It s one of the best kept secrets in Paris of a place to stay The spa and pool were fantastic and truly relaxing Rooms were comfortable and large for Paris We had the junior suit Breakfast was great It s not cheap but you get what you pay for Everyone is pleasent and helpful 
62205,Nolinski Paris, n a, Staff was excellent very polite and obliging Beautiful well designed and modern hotel rooms Further the location is prime Definitely planning to come back the next time I m staying in Paris 
62206,Nolinski Paris,No Negative, Incredible hotel with excellent service One forgets the buzz of Paris The place is intimate cozy friendly superb spa and had an excellent therapist 
62207,Nolinski Paris, Rude service maids which is v important in a 5 property pool needed to be heated facilities in spa steam room and sauna just need adapting as not as powerful, Brilliant service from front of house staff good facilities great location Excellent service overall only maids need changing 
62208,Nolinski Paris, Just a little thing We did not want to leave the hotel on the second night There was only a tapas menu in the nice bar It was ok though the tapas were delicious , I could not find anything to complain about The staff were very nice and helpful We felt very welcome and enjoyed every minute in the hotel 
62209,Nolinski Paris, location on a very busy street takes a bit of the charm however it can also be considered a plus as you have metro station right in front of the hotel , Excellent choice Brand new hotel with a superb spa and great staff Food is also amazing Will be back for sure
62210,Nolinski Paris, Service by the staff We came to check in and we were informed that they will get to seperate the beds afterwards We checked in at 3 pm and went out and came back at 5 the beds weren t separated and the luggage weren t sent as well I called the concierge and they said they will sort it out I get a call back from reception from the lady telling me I told you at night the beds will be seperated not now I even once called the hotel and they were asking what do I want Looool what type of 5 star service is this, Spa decor and the comfort is amazing
62211,Nolinski Paris, We had booked a restaurant through the hotel and when we got to the restaurant they said they had no record of this reservation, The rooms were lovely location brilliant and staff extremely helpful 
62212,Nolinski Paris, The rooms were small even for junior suites Bedroom had a closet in it that took away a lot of space All in all interior design and conception is off Bathroom only had one sink which we found weird for a junior suite in a 5 star hotel , The location is fantastic as well as the small spa Beds very comfortable 
62213,Nolinski Paris,No Negative, Loved EVERYTHINGGGGGG I ve been talking about the hotel all day long The decor and customer service is beyond superb they really made me feel welcomed and pay attention to detail to ensure I was comfortable Honestly I could go on and on overall amazing world class experience 
62214,Nolinski Paris, One firm pillow would have been suitable minibar refrigerator was noisy, Wonderfully detailed interior thoughtful staff car packed for departure by valet breakfast from modest size towards gourmet
62215,Nolinski Paris, The room was VERY small Breakfast is served in a caf Who gave this hotel 5 One thing is for sure prices are 5 , Staff 5 really well done they are really giving it their best The pool is also nice 
62216,Nolinski Paris, The pseudo chic design at the cost of function and practical life ir really irritating Also the restaurant is below par Why aim at 5 stars when clearly management is not up to challenge , The location is great and the rooms were silent
62217,Nolinski Paris, Service at breakfast was slow for an almost empty restaurant Public spaces are limited in size , Staff was second to none Beautiful decorations fast wifi excellent craftsmanship throughout 
62218,Nolinski Paris, Not a lot to complain about but the following details could be improved temperature in the Grand Salon was a bit high room was quite small but this is a very central location in Paris , New hotel with great design Attention to details Great spa and the swimming pool is amazing The staff has always been very friendly professional and always helpful Amazing stay Last detail the slippers are amazing 
62219,Nolinski Paris, Would have liked a coffee machine in the room, They knew our names after check in and nothing was too much trouble We were welcomed by name at the front door The service really is something else

62223,Nolinski Paris,No Negative, I absolutely love everything about the Nolinski This was my second time here and being in town for a longer time gave me the chance to enjoy the swimmingpool in the evening after a long walk It was magnificent And our suite Ernest was absolutely fabulous Room service was perfect and delicious and breakfast in the Brasserie Rejane was lovely as well This is one of my favorite hotels in the world and definitely the most wonderfully designed the attention to detail and the level of service is amazing And the absolute bonus point of the Nolinski the staff remembers your name and they are genuinely happy to see you again try and find any other hotel or establishment where this happens I don t think you can the staff here is truly charming and smart 
62224,Nolinski Paris, Coffee not to my liking Spa very romantic but would Like sauna much hotter Everything else perfect Will return soon I hope, Staff where very welcoming Nothing was too much Very helpful in making bookings for restaurants excursions etc Special thanks for making it a wonderful time in Paris to Tiffany Diana and John
