397274,Condes de Barcelona,No Negative, The bed was huge and comfy and the views from the roof top bar were great The personal touch of giving us a free glass of champers for our minimoon was also lovely 
397275,Condes de Barcelona, Our two rooms looked very tired and in need of a renovation on our executive suit one small coffee table with a very dirty chair with rips in the arm rest you would expect two chairs with this table the second chair was a desk chair not suitable for the coffee table House keeping not consistent out of the 4 days only one day was satisfactory Also our executive room window view was into the back of buildings with renovations been carry out not good for an executive suit I guess we were unlucky by not getting a street view room Overall very disappointing , The location 
397276,Condes de Barcelona, The breakfast was overpriced Specially in a city like Barcelona where you could have an amazing brunch at La Pedrera cafe just across the street for around 80 for 4 people, The hotel is very good overall staff location and facilities We also found the on site parking very useful since we had our own car 
397277,Condes de Barcelona, It would have been nice for the staff to be more intentional and we needed an iron but we didn t find one in the room Also there was no ice machine These are minor things but it did not hinder our experience , We loved the central location and being able to have transportation nearby I e train bus taxi that could take us anywhere in the city The room was absolutely amazing and we had an amazing view of la sagrada familia and a structure designed by Gaud 
397278,Condes de Barcelona, It was all good , The staff were brilliant and extremely helpful as well as warm and friendly The breakfast was amazing The top floor bar area is wonderful at sunset The pool area is great and the pool though small as you would expect in a central location went down very well with my daughter 
397279,Condes de Barcelona, Rooms facing the front are very noisy , Location is great Restaurant very good and price very reasonable Restaurant manager and staff are very friendly and professional 
397280,Condes de Barcelona, Bed was too hard for my back but the location its really worth it , Location is the best Breakfast at Loidi is excellent in flavor and variety But The Terraza Al Aire in the roof is the best chill area in Barcelona lunch offer simple insuperable Love Al Aire nights drinks and tapas And the view from there is the best in barcelona center in a very nice surroundings area Expecting to go back soon I recommend it to all my friends traveling to Barcelona 
397281,Condes de Barcelona, The only problem we had was working out the train situation to get from airport to hotel not very clear instructions and no signs in English but no complaints about the hotel itself , Beds were unbelievably comfortable room had everything we could want and more Amazing hotel would definitely recommend 
397282,Condes de Barcelona, Surprisingly there were old cigarette butts on the balcony I think the staff should be reminded to check it between bookings Otherwise we thought the cleanliness superb , Loidi the view over Paseo de Garcia the comfort especially the bed Helpful attitudes expert advice about what to see and how to get there 
397283,Condes de Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent hotel in a great location Would highly recommend it to anyone Within walking distance to lots of bars restaurants and easy access to metro and bus stops to get to the sights slightly further away Staff very friendly nothing was too much to ask Hotel is a in a lovely area much nicer restaurants near the hotel than in Las Ramblas where you pay for the location and poorer quality food easy to walk to this area if you wish Would recommend visiting La Bouqeria market in Las Ramblas Got a taxi to the airport which costs around 30 euros and takes about 20 minutes well worth it Roof top bar quite expensive as expected but lovely views Rooftop pool is an added bonus to the hotel We didn t have breakfast in the hotel so can t comment on that but loads of restaurants cafes close by to grab breakfast Would definitely stay in this hotel again if we came back to Barcelona 
397284,Condes de Barcelona, Gym was very disappointing For the size of the hotel and the price it should be bigger There is a big seating area in the first floor which was largely empty during my 4 night stay which is adjacent so this could be better IMO , Perfect location room was a good size the WiFi was good staff were very friendly and helpful 
397285,Condes de Barcelona,No Negative, Hotel was located near the main attractions ie Casa Batllo Casa Perdrera Sagrada Familia La Ramblas etc Breakfast was excellent lots of choice always a great start to the day Roof top restaurant was fantastic great food great service great views Very helpful staff

397287,Condes de Barcelona, At first I have received a room with a view to a major building site The room was lovely but the noise was unbearable I asked for another room I have received a dark room with a window facing the lift shaft One could hear all sort of noises from the corridor upstairs etc I was to tired to change the room again and the staff was not very helpful I must say ,No Positive
397288,Condes de Barcelona, most house keeping staff could not speak english and we had trouble getting them to understand simple things like coat hangers iron We spent our first night with broken air conditioning took front desk manager on second day to get us moved to a better room with air conditioning , location
397289,Condes de Barcelona, We got the not renovated room and spent the most awful night in the hotel The sound proof was close to zero the staff was not helpful the bed was like in an old dormitory the linen was beyond simple and outdated Since we were not moved the same night to the renovated room we asked for that the next morning We were offered a smaller but renovated room However we decided to move to a different hotel fearing the same bad experience If you stay at this hotel you need to make sure you get the renovated room , The location is great

397297,Condes de Barcelona, the staff in restaurant were not very hospitable i e when I asked for the sault and peper or other things they didn t serve them to me but asked me to go and take them from the buffet table , The value for Money and the location Also the reception friendliness

397299,Condes de Barcelona,No Negative, Staff was very helpful and kind at all times Beautiful new designer hotel and rooms with amazing view and location Just cant get any better The roof terrace Alaire offers the best way to spend the evening with a great overview of all Barcelona and great cocktails 
397300,Condes de Barcelona, We took a regular double bed room and it was a room with an inside window to the lobby Only the rooms that are pacing p s de Gracia are with a window that opens outside, Location was great the rooms was very clean
397301,Condes de Barcelona, The rooms could have been a bit larger Very poorly lit No comfortable chairs to sit in Closet small with bad hangers Not enough towels , The staff was extremely helpful and friendly The breakfast buffet was divine The rooftop bar was fabulous Great central location
397302,Condes de Barcelona, Breakfast seemed expensive online so we booked at the hotel and were offered a discount , Beds great view lovely Bathroom very well designed Nice products and good quality towels

397304,Condes de Barcelona, During my stay somehow there was a cockroach in my room I believe this is the first time i ve ever experience having a cockroach in my room and i was staying in the 5th floor Which makes it more confusing When i was ready to sleep something walks by and because it was wooden floor i can hear it as well I turned on the lights and there it was a big live cockroach I screamed and called the receptionist and they killed it They moved me to another room which was supposed to be an upgrade but somehow feels like a downgrade because i like the previous room better And finally moved 2 times to the same grade room Overall it was my first time ever experiencing that and i wont forget it my whole life , I usually love everything about this place 
397305,Condes de Barcelona, Parking too expensive 22 Euro a day , Great location very modern style and clean Located on the main street of shopping in Barcelona perfect to visit all monuments in the city walking Beautiful view from top floor terrace On the right casa Pereira on the left la Sagrada familia Just 10 minutes walk from playa de Catalunya 
397306,Condes de Barcelona, The breakfast is a bit unambitious Better try the numerous cafes around Strange smell outside likely from the used water lines having air outlets in this area, Best location the roof top bar the executive roooms have great a terrass
397307,Condes de Barcelona, I did not like leaving I could have stayed another week, Top Tier property located with in 3 blocks of 2 Gaudi exhibits Locations is like 5th Avenue in NYC near Rockefeller Center Hotel is beautiful the staff was first class The rooms and bathroom were beautiful
397308,Condes de Barcelona, Only downside was there wasn t a coffee shop or restaurant that you could get a coffee or drink during the day , Hotel was lovely and the staff where very helpful polite and friendly
397309,Condes de Barcelona, Nothing really we really enjoyed our stay I noticed after we arrived that if we had booked direct with the hotel rather than through booking com we would have saved 30 on the hotel breakfast There s not a huge amount of early breakfast options nearby so this would be a good idea for a future stay , Lovely modern hotel with decent sized pool and great rooftop bar Very comfortable rooms extremely clean and well serviced The hotel is in a good location a little away from the hustle of las ramblas only a 10 15 minute walk from the nearest metro stations Great shopping nearby although it s not cheap 
397310,Condes de Barcelona, The room for 3 is actually just a double room with an extra bed got a little cramped We didn t mind much as we were out most of the day All communication had to be through reception as bell boy or housekeeping didn t understand English We booked a room for 3 which was confirmed at check in but there was only a double bed when we arrived at our room The bell boy and housekeeping got us a chair when we asked about the bed which was rectified once I spoke to the lady at the reception on our way out to dinner , The lady who checked us in was lovely friendly and efficient She gave us a couple of nice restaurant names and helpful reviews on tourist spots Nice and well maintained hotel in a great locality Taxis were available in front all the time Close to casa mila and casa batillo Quality of breakfast was very good though options were limited You have to walk out of the hotel and go next door for breakfast 
397311,Condes de Barcelona, The morning stafff at the front desk werent freindly their welcome was not What I spect of these Hotel The floor was not clean at the room when I ask for ice they told me go to the bar and asked them , The localization was great Very ice area waking distance to retaurants and stores 
397312,Condes de Barcelona, Could hear neighbours having sex in the next room A little more soundproofing would be a good idea but they eventually stopped Lol , Beautiful cozy super stylish hotel Was pleasantly surprised by our last minute booking choice From the beautiful lobby to the gorgeous room to the pool rooftop terrace this hotel was amazing Fabulous location too A lot of great sights shopping and restaurants just outside the door 
397313,Condes de Barcelona, Bathroom was not in best shape Faucet taps were stained Shower door handle was broken No note paper or pen were provided Telephone instructions were not in the room could not call reception or housekeeping , Room was very quiet 
397314,Condes de Barcelona, Only slight disappointment is the pool area looks larger in the pics its ample for a quick dip though , Fab area for eating out and shopping comfy bed and good size bedroom we were two friends enjoying a city break without the kids 
397315,Condes de Barcelona, Hidden charges between booking Com Hotel Noise from top floor but couldnt be helped i guess , Lovely woman working on reception Ageuda Ageuna Helpful and really nice Asset to the hotel Tbh all staff were great in hotel Nice view from room 
397316,Condes de Barcelona, The bathroom was very tight impossible to be two brushing your teeth Indoor parking very tight compared to north american standards , Location few seconds from La Perdera and a few minute walk from Casa Batllo walking distance to Pla a Catalunya and La Rambla We discovered the street behind Condes parallel to Passeig de Gracia Rambla de Catalunya that has many restaurants with terraces in the middle of the street Did not have a chance to eat there but looked inviting Nice view from roof top terrace 
397317,Condes de Barcelona, Every time the lift was used We could hear it going up and down and it was very noisy causing disturbance to our sleep , The staff were great and we were given an upgraded room with views 
397318,Condes de Barcelona, Rooms are a lot tighter than the pictures they show you Breakfast was not good The selection but more so the quality The scrambled eggs were cold everyday even when they brought out a brand new tray of it Reception always too busy you don t feel you have access to a concierge service Probably works better as a business trip hotel, Location
397319,Condes de Barcelona, The pillows were uncomfortable and the hot water heater was broken and leaked Also the multiple elevators was a little confusing so make sure you check which level it goes to especially with luggage , Loved the location and the views from the room as well as rooftop Room was a good size and I really liked the layout 
397320,Condes de Barcelona, Reception staff On arrival I was effectively ordered to wait whilst the surly staff member did something terribly important on his computer for fully five minutes Finally I was checked in by a second employee who had been chatting the whole time with another person However I m STILL waiting to be welcomed to the hotel During my five day stay only one staff member offered friendly greetings as I came and went It seems most of the others especially Mr Surly don t know the value of a customer Sound proofing in rooms is excellent in blocking out street noise but between rooms adjacent and above footfalls cupboard doors and water noises were disturbing , Location was perfect of course The room was well spacious and well appointed housekeeping staff were excellent and the rooftop bar was extremely pleasant We enjoyed a beautiful pizza with drinks and found the staff up there to be quite delightful full of smiles and very friendly The hotel has modern attractive decor and is pleasantly light 
397321,Condes de Barcelona, If there is anything negative it would be that the swimming pool was a bit small, Location is important to us The area around Pass de Gracia is great It s within walking distance to various sites and easy access to metro and La Ramblas It s also a safe and clean area
397322,Condes de Barcelona, The cleanliness could be improved On day 3 housekeeping only made the bed and didn t clean the bathroom just wiped a bit I complained about it but I guess they went back to wipe a bit and not real clean Had breakfast there 4 times but not sure it s a good value for money in terms of choice , Great location modern rooms with perfect sound proofing silent A C great beddings and amenities Amazing rooftop bar to unwind for a drink after a long day in Barcelona Located in the best street for upscale shopping and easy location to get to other parts of the city Would definitely come back
397323,Condes de Barcelona, The noise in the hallway of our room And a bit outside the street whereas its supposed to be soundproofed , I like the interior and exterior design of the rooms and hotel 
397324,Condes de Barcelona, The swimming pool was small and not enough space to sun bed at the roof top , The location is right in the centre Rooms are clean and spacious the staff are very friendly
397325,Condes de Barcelona, The swimming pool is very small dirty piegons were drinking from it the hotel seems to let outside guest come in the swimming pool not ver smart as the number of places is very limited No bath robe in the room, Location Overall nice and modern hotel 
397326,Condes de Barcelona, No negatives , Everything best hotel on our European tour Very modern quality fixtures and fittings staff very friendly and professional very comfortable bed great location Thanks

397328,Condes de Barcelona,No Negative, Perfect location lovely modern friendly staff clean hotel with fantastic facilities Loved the pool and also roof top bar had some fantastic views 
397329,Condes de Barcelona, I was a little disappointed in the rooms we had the first room was a basic room with a balcony but the balcony was facing just roofs of nearby hotels no scenery we then asked to move rooms and the room we got the second time was just the same room but facing another hotel in close proximity I had seen the rooms on the website and was hoping for something a little more luxuries all in all a great stay though and would definitely go back I would just specify before hand which room I would like and with a better view , I loved the location it was great It was so easy to get to everywhere and as I had a broken ankle and was on crutches the staff were more than helpful coming outside to walk down the street and hail me a cab 
397330,Condes de Barcelona, The in room minibar was a vending machine style and quite expensive The gym was also very basic , Location and room was great Close to public transport and restaurants 
397331,Condes de Barcelona, I would prefer a fridge that is usable rather than a coin operated machine Unable to store drinks or food , Great location close to shops and restaurants Rooms well appointed and comfortable with spacious bathroom and quality toiletries Enjoyed the outdoor bar too Staff friendly and helpful 
397332,Condes de Barcelona, If you re driving the basement car ark is a little hair raising Both lifts failed on our 2nd evening but to be fair one of them was working after a few hours , Great feel to the hotel very luxurious and all staff were very attentive The rooms are pure luxury and the roof bar is the ideal place to have pre dinner drinks didn t actually eat there so unable to comment on food The location of the hotel couldn t be better situated among the top designer shops and iwithin walking distance of The Gaudi Building and the Cathedral Familia 
397333,Condes de Barcelona, A room with a balcony would have been better Didn t bother with breakfast as it was expensive but lots of cheaper options to eat out just minutes walk , The staff were very helpful and pleasant 
397334,Condes de Barcelona,No Negative, Super super good location Located in the middle of shopping area next to all kinds of shops like La perla rolex feels very safe walking around at night in this area for barcelona not far from good restaurants Really convenient Very nice room designs spacious comfortable and clean helpful staff great wifi Except one small thing that caused slight inconvenience the fridge in the room basically worked as a vending machine meaning you cannot open it but can only select what drinks you want from the screen and they come down so we bought some yogurt packs from the corner shop and couldnt store them in the fridge and had to finish them in the evening after dinner which was slightly annoying But otherwise this hotel was perfect for barcelona 
397335,Condes de Barcelona, Huge construction next door of which I was not informed of very noisy and uncomfortable Rooms very not clean and the bathrooms were moulding , One of the top location the city center Just 5 minutes walk to La Rambla and many famous historical monuments Close to lots of restaurants and shopping 
397336,Condes de Barcelona, Tea bags and milk sachets were not automatically replaced The rubbish bin in our bathroom was broken not good for this level of hotel , Great location fantastic roof top bar with a direct view to La Pedrera and La Sagrada Familia in the background

397340,Condes de Barcelona,No Negative, Good location nice breakfast and reception staff were friendly and helpful Over charged in rooftop bar which staff rectified but no apology Overall nice place to stay
397341,Condes de Barcelona, Shower leaked generally the place shows some wear and tear Front desk staff was not particularly helpful at check in with tourist advice , Beautifully designed rooms Fabulous top floor bar with great views Awesome location near Gaudi apartments and high end shopping Minutes walk from historic part of town and the waterfront They offered us 30 off on the buffet breakfast which was great 
397342,Condes de Barcelona, There was a strong scent of flower like poutpurri in the lobby which was too much, Location location location Rooms were beautiful and confortable
397343,Condes de Barcelona, The only bar area was on the roof terrace would have been nice if the first floor lounge had a bar coffee service as well Also it was very noisey in the bedrooms but it is right in the middle of the city can t have everything , The beds were extremely comfortable and for anyone that likes their complimentary toiletries they had thought of everything
397344,Condes de Barcelona, More storage with drawers , Great hotel in fantastic location The staff went out of their way to help us at all times friendly and professional The roof top bar is super nice we enjoyed the complementary drink the tapas were good and the view was wonderful We stayed in the classic room nice size comfortable bed with pillow menu The breakfast was amazing and the service outstanding Would stay again 
397345,Condes de Barcelona, Reception staff were very unfriendly We had to go in and out of the hotel with a stroller and many times the doormen didn t help us with the door The mini bar was actually a vending machine Rather tacky Got stuck because couldn t put my young daughter s food in the mini bar I asked the reception staff if the items could be removed and I got a flat NO in response The other receptionist must have seen the look on my face and offered to keep the food in the fridge at the reception which is rather inconvenient when you have a young child and you have to go back and forth to the fridge The shower was awful It suddenly becomes hot and then goes back to the temperature you set it without warning The worst part is that it was happening while I was giving my toddler a shower It was a miracle she wasn t scalded I stayed there a week and to be honest only gave her a shower once I d much rather have her stink then burnt It kept happening even with rest of the family members but at least with adults they can quickly move out of the way , The variety of breakfast items was nice The view from our room was nice We paid for a room with a view and a balcony and we weren t disappointed Despite being on the Passage de Gracia you couldn t hear the noise from the street
397346,Condes de Barcelona, I was there for a short stay so did not find anything that was a negative , A very comfortable hotel Staff was helpful and courteous Location was excellent 
397347,Condes de Barcelona, pool wasn t available I would say it is better to breakfast in the cafe around the corner The cost of hotel inclusive breakfast was too much , The location was perfect easy access to all parts of Barcelona The room was wonderful 7th Floor with large balcony like an extra room and amazing view 
397348,Condes de Barcelona, house keeping knocked on the door every morning around 8am which was a little annoying But apart from that minor issue everything perfect , Couldn t have asked for a more perfect hotel Location spot on as it was on the main road just facing Gucci and 1 2 minute walk to the metro room and bathroom great sizes bed extremely comfortable Would 100 stay here again amazing value for money 
397349,Condes de Barcelona, hotel itself is not worth for the money you pay the room they gave have broken lock to the balcony broken shower electricity suddenly out and tv having problem You have no way to use the fridge in the room as they lock it only for their own refreshment Staff not clean the room nicely Toilet got flood after shower , Location of the hotel is great which is in the center of the town 
397350,Condes de Barcelona, We had a good time and found nothing to gripe about , The Condes is located centrally in Barcelona providing us with easy access to see and do everything we wanted to whilst holidaying in the city The staff were helpful and considerate whilst letting us get on with it 
397351,Condes de Barcelona, Reception staff not very helpful in fact 1 guy very dour Questioned about having paid bill in full before arrival and tried to charge again Had to go on Internet at 8 in the morning while taxi waiting to take us to airport to find proof of payment in full Please keep a copy of payment until checkout not check in Felt like we were trying to leave with payment Very embarrassing , Great location and room cleaned every day 
397352,Condes de Barcelona, Everything was perfect, Amazing helpful staff permitted us to extend the check out time for two more hours helped us to carry the bags and get the taxi outside we had a room with an amazing balcony and view on the 7th floor on Gaudi s house and Sagrada Familia 
397353,Condes de Barcelona, first of all nobody cares for the notes or requests in the booking com apparently i have requested a double bed not twin we got very easily seperating twin beds I requested an upper floor if possible we got 1st floor I requested a quiet room we got room facing pg de gracia that is filled with people in the night yes and 1st floor so not a thing they just did everything opposing to the requests section let me be clear we didn t make the reservation a night before but months earlier so this is annoying very annoying especially that I also mentioned that we visit Barcelona for the birthday of my wife That s why it is an indicator that they don t give a f other than that hotel properties itself the toilet door is glass and do not close like a normal door it s about half a centimeter short If you like your partner to hear ur farts it is perfect if not really uncomfortable the only access to the hallway to the rooms even 1st 2nd floor is only possible by a small elevator no stairs so even you need to go 1 floor downstairs u need to wait for the elevator to come and come empty which lasts like average 5 minutes you could literally go up and down the stairs 5 times in that time but hey no stairs blocked asking for credit card by check in for guarantee even u paid everything upfront 2 5 months ago is disturbing I live in Germany and believe me in Germany not everyone has a credit card no seriously it is a very new thing around here people use german debit cards or cash here whatever it is annoying to sum up we don t recommend here to anyone and we will not stay there ever , location but it is not the best either 
397354,Condes de Barcelona, Intrusive background noise from air conditioning Dim lighting in room Room setup to good standard except for slippery floor in shower and no grab rail but without very much comfort or character Not especially strong value for money compared with apartment choices in Barcelona , Good location very attentive staff excellent housekeeping 
397355,Condes de Barcelona, When we arrived we couldn t find our hotel very well even our taxi driver was confused by the address I gave him as we couldn t see it until someone came out to help with our bags The first night we stayed we tried to leave the room after dropping our bags off and our keys wouldn t work We were locked in our room The phone was not connected and when we plugged it in it didn t work We had to use our mobiles to call reception and explain we were locked in the room They were a little apologetic and offered us a new room 3 floors up However the room itself was ok but the bathroom was not in great condition Theshower leaked in to the bedroom taps were rusty and the hair dryer provided was not in very good condition considering it was in the bathroom the wire casing had split showing the wires inside The second night we asked where the bar was but what was failed to be mentioned when we arrived or even before we checked in was that the hotel was under construction The bar was shut reception had been moved and there was construction work being done on the room floors as well It wasn t a problem it would just have been nice for this to be mentioned when we checked in , The staff were really helpful throughout our stay The location of the hotel is good just off passeig de gracia so very central The layout of the rooms was great and the Michelin star restaurant looked lovely even though we didn t eat there 
397356,Condes de Barcelona, The mattress on the bed was very hard could not sleep well The phone in the room was not working and could not call to get extra pillows , Location is excellent Friendly staff

397359,Condes de Barcelona, Theroom was quite noisy with some traffic noise but there was also some noise during the night from the building site across the road , I liked the location we could see Gaudi s La Pedrera and Sagrada Familia from our window The room was a typical city hotel room but it did provide coffee making facilities Very impressive 7 storey light fitting in the atrium 
397360,Condes de Barcelona, Generally unfriendly and unsmiling staff Its not too much to expect reception door or breakfast room staff to greet you warmly and look at you when arriving and departing Here staff were too busy staring at their desk top computer screens or requesting my room number to even say good morning afternoon or evening , location size of room view from terrace over Passieg reasonable breakfast
397361,Condes de Barcelona,No Negative, The location is right in the heart of the city Accessible to taxi and other transportation Also love the design of the hotel is very modern The staffs were informative and helpful
