41889,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Service at breakfast was shocking Staff unfriendly often no glasses or bowls st the juice cereal buffet One day the room hadn t been cleaned when we arrived back at 8pm after a busy day in the city , The concierge chaps were really good at providing advice guidelines maps 
41890,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Service in Carluccios was very slow parking expensive and pool a little on the small side , Staff were incredibly helpful rooms comfortable and immaculately presented Great location easy to get into town and perfect for the cricket 
41891,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We stayed 3 nights in a family room 4 people and our room was not cleaned for a day When I complained to the staff the staff did not even apologise I wasn t angry at all at first but their careless reaction made me very furious and just asked if I need anything because they cannot clean my room anymore since it was late in the evening I just asked for some towels as my family just came back and we wanted to rest but after 30 of waiting no one brought any towels I had to actually come to the reception and ask for the towels myself Anyhow the communication and the way the staff handled the situation was very unprofessional for a reputable hotel like Marriott Also it was sometimes hard to communicate with both the reception staff and the restaurant since most of the staff do not speak fluent English Moreover the breakfast was the same everyday for the three days that we stayed It is very difficult to order tea coffee because all the staff are busy Our tea came when we already finished breakfast I think with the amount of money my family have paid we could have received a better service at another hotel This was a rather unpleasant stay , Very clean and in a nice area near to the tube 
41892,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The front desk lady by the name of Slyvia barred entrance into our room on our last date of stay The reason being no sufficient deposit held by the hotel I think this could have bern handled in a more courteous manner , The location and food at Carluccios was fantastic 
41893,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The breakfast facilities could be upgraded more variety of foods and perhaps a self help coffee tea station as service was quite slow due to to few waitresses , Lovely Hotel very clean and organised Wonderful helpful staff members Great location 
41894,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Receptionist gave us the wrong room and the key didn t open the door I had to go downstairs to be reassigned another room , Room size is good Big for London 
41895,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The italian restaurant coz there is party on weekend music will be very loud people will be loud until late nite The noise It s under renovation there was drilling hammering as early as 8 30 very loud and we weren t being notified warned about it at all they could have told us or slipped a note through our door told us when we checked in even email us disappointed we stayed for a week the renovation work goes on the whole week stay away if you want some quiet moments the toilet door it opens outward and there is nothing you can keep it opened it bangs loud if you miss to hold it the room make up service there is none do not disturb sign for you to hook none such kind of light to switch on The staff ran into our room with his her key while we were still sleeping at 0800 and he she banged the door shut without saying a word that could be a very bad embarrassing scenario , Breakfast buffet is tasty and good The italian restaurant has a great choice of food price very reasonable the quality is good 
41896,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, It would be nice to have a separate bar that is not part of reception, Honesty We were told that there was refurbishment but we never heard a peep Friendly and welcoming staff
41897,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast not included and super expensive Exterior needs a facelift , Loved our room Was not big but suited a family of four Newly refurbished rooms 
41898,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The hotel was amazing except for the fact they had a private function on the Saturday evening our room was directly above and the base from the music was vibrating on the bedroom floor When we complained at 11 30 apologies were given but nothing could be done until the function finished at 12 However when we complained again the next morning we were then offered a visitors up grade to the Members Lounge This was the only criticism of the hotel the hotel staff are very pleasant and friendly we will stay there again 
41899,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Couldn t swim lengths in pool as was full of kids said it was spa but only had a little steam an sauna room, Food was fantastic staff brilliant very friendly and helpful
41900,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, With me having a hearing issue Sounds in reception echoed so poss get sound panels to supress sound helps in high open areas like their reception area Plus being woken at 8am in error by housemade not happy very apologetic manager offered carparking for free happy, Clean Pleasant atmosphere Brilliant friendly staff 
41901,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, It was perfect My only observation was that there was only one robe in the room and we were three female friends sharing We did request more but they did not arrive It wasn t a problem though , The hotel was beautiful Recently refurbished it was very modern but still very welcome and friendly 
41902,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The tea coffee making facilities were in a very small and awkward position with not much room Considering that there was a huge empty space further down in the room that could have accommodated a table where it would have been much easier to make the drinks The room could also have done with either a desk or dressing table , When we checked in to our room we checked the bedding We had to get the housekeeping staff to change all of the bedding as there were some hairs ugh on the sheets 
41903,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Parked my car in the underground car park and a ceiling waste pipe leaked over my car and has damaged the paint , The staff are very friendly and helpful
41904,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The lady who let us in and took our room details each morning for breakfast was not very friendly, The location and helpfulness of concierge and front desk staff
41905,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The fact that two people sorted out our checking in and failed to tell me we were room only as I never book that as part of my daughters hotel experience is the breakfast and I feel I paid a lot of money just to sleep there and it spoiled my daughters birthday treat as I was not going to spend another 60 more that day just for breakfast so it made me very angry and I don t think I shall go there again i was also not very impressed that I got up early on the Sunday morning to go swimming and half the pool was cordoned off for swimming lessons as it doesn t tell you about it anywhere but then I could have stayed in bed longer as I never got breakfast anyway I gave my custom to costa instead , The revamped rooms were very nice and stylish i also liked the fact that it had a swimming pool to relax in after a long day going around the tube 
41906,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Parking was expensive I guess its the same everywhere in London , Excellent front desk staff John helped us with the smooth check in He gave us great information and tips for a great hotel stay and experience We were very happy with the staff 
41907,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The barman who seemed to be into discussing Politics with guests describing himself as a talented immigrant worker but then let himself down by calling me mate unlike the other staff who appeared to all refer to guests by their name such as Mr or Mrs or as Sir or Madam , The onsite Carluccio s Restaurant the swimmimg pool the onsite parking the ease of getting there and the location close to Regents Park 
41908,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast pricey so we got some out instead Would ve been good to have had it included , The beds were really comfy Huge TV and good access to Spotify so boys were happy We had two teenage boys with us in a family room and beds were easily large enough for them to share comfortably I think ours had been newly renovated but cleanliness and room service excellent Was a bit worried after one or two reviews but no need I could see that some parts were still being worked on but didn t affect us we walked up through Regents Park to reach it then on the last day walked over to Camden But Swiss Cottage tube close by which we made use of too 
41909,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, It was not possible to switch off the air conditioning The carpet below the beds hadn t been hoovered for some time otherwise the room was clean and newly renovated There was some noise because of the renovation but only as of 9 am The room delivery boy was unpleasant all other staff extremely friendly The swimming pool water very warm and the pool is not deep enough to do a proper swim good for relaxation only s, The room was spacious with two comfortable double beds and a small balcony Huge tv good wifi The shower was excellent The staff was very friendly and helpful except for the room delivery boy who was fed up by the fact that he didn t get a personal tip in addition to the obligatory 5 pound service fee that I had to pay The gym was nice and had very flexible opening hours I was impressed by the way the hotel kindly remembered my birthday celebration Thank you very much 
41910,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The fact that when you arrive the Marriott charge you an extra 50 per night Holding fee The Hilton don t do this And nowhere on your website or theirs does it explain this So we had to give them 100 of our spending money and didn t get it back until we got home Disgusting We were also informed on check in that they were maintaining other rooms and building work was taking place so 9am 6pm nothing but drilling and banging Again nothing on their website about this , The bed the view Gordon Ramsey s maze grill Not on site 
41911,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Housekeeping could have done a better job restocking room amenities surfaces not cleaned , Spacious and comfortable room and beds Great having the Carluccio s restaurant especially breakfast 
41912,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, There was construction through the day which I can dral with however at 5 pm when I went downstairs and asked them to stop the guy was like if u don t like it leave so I did despite the fact I had one more night stay and the slick manager john promised to refund my room which I never got obviously no one even helped me with my bags I hurt my neck carrying my bags out the road with the rude staff snickering behind my back you should be ashamed Marriott this is the only one in the world they should be trained with customer service and not just conventions will never stay there again nor will I stay in a Marriott because of it there s lots of options out there, New rooms
41913,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Only 1 robe and 2 pairs of slippers in a room booked for 4 adults I asked a member of staff for some more which she appeared to acknowledge but they were not provided We were woken early by Housekeeping which wasn t good as we had had a late night but also frustrating as we hadn t checked out so they should have known the room still had guests , We were in a newly refurbished room spacious 2 double beds which were very comfy Large TV Food was amazing Pool sauna and steam room very nice and we were able to chill out on the loungers Most staff very attentive some a little difficult possibly due to language barrier All in all a fabulous stay and I would definitely book this hotel again and as I m a hotel snob that s a very positive feedback 
41914,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Quite pricey but that s London isn t it , Newly refurbished rooms lots of parking close to Camden market and M40 Carluccio s on site excellent breakfast leisure club and swimming pool 
41915,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The staff went over and above to ensure my parents had a wonderful stay Very clean and pool facilities are super Excellent service and would highly recommend this hotel 
41916,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Colluchieos restaurant Smoked Salmon Fuccini bland Breakfast confusing Service poor wearing jeans when all other staff had Marriott uniform Where was the Marriott service that used to be so perfect when you ate Attention to detail Had to wave to get attention as waitress had her head in an iPad , Given a newly decorated room on the first floor and although the builders were in we had no issues with the room 
41917,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast buff was expensive and quite poor Such an important thing that hotels miss to often should learn from Swedish hotels breakfasts which also are included always , Big rooms and big beds Overall better than I though and great value for the money 
41918,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The concierge was not as knowledgable as I d expect him to be I asked for toothbrushes three times before finally getting them I was irritated that the hotel charged me to make a local phone call I made two short phone calls to rent a vehicle and it cost me 15 , I liked the breakfast in the executive lounge I have three small children and they were not allowed in the lounge but I was happy about that It kept the noise level down and they had plenty of tables to sit at right outside It worked out well The room sizes were extremely generous The staff was friendly 
41919,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, WiFi was only free in public areas but was very expensive in the rooms which is amazing considering less expensive places have completely free WiFi Had to ask for more tea coffee sachets as only 4 provided on arrival and there were 4 of us but they did respond very quick Breakfast was very expensive 18 00 a head The bathroom door handle came off when it was used , It was a good sized room with 2 double beds and had a balcony overlooking a garden There was a nice pool with sauna and steam room There was also a fitness gym 
41920,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Wifi would have cost extra in the rooms unless you were a Marriott member i joined for the free wifi Not enough teas and coffees in the room and no biscuits but staff were happy to provide more once we asked , The room was spacious clean and the bed was very comfy Staff were very helpful and the hotel is in a good location 
41921,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Air conditioning a little noisy in room complimentary water bottles on check in but it would have been nice to have more on 2nd night Worst thing was one REALLY surly waiter who we had the misfortune of being served by both on the first evening and the second lunchtime , Friendly helpful reception staff restaurant staff also very good with one exception see below Overall a very enjoyable stay 
41922,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Very handy having Carluccios in the hotel Location is near Regents park so you can walk into town if you wanted which was lovely Pool is ideal for young kids 
41923,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The orange juice at breakfast was a bit watery and the swimming pool was rather crowded , Great hotel we enjoyed our stay and would be keen to return We particularly liked the concierge who greeted us with bottles of water and Easter biscuits Lovely evening meal in the restaurant 
41924,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The staff was very stressed in the breakfast buffet and it was very noisy But all the other staff was excellent , I liked the bed types for a group of 4 2 children and 2 adults I liked the location very much and how close it was to the Swiss Cottage station The breakfast was very good and the kids loved the swimming pool 
41925,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Staff were really friendly they had Easter egg hunt for the kids a movie night every night over the Easter weekend and it was all free Wifi is free if you are a Marriott member My room had apple airplay on the TV and generally it s a really nice place to stay

41927,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The water took so long to leave the bathroom sink, The beds were amazing and the decor in the room lovely Staff extremely friendly and athmosphere nice in the h tel 
41928,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The attitude of the staff on the breakfast shift was not pleasant Disorganised chaos with very little attention to detail Everyday we were surrounded by tables heaped with dirty dishes Crockery available to be utilised were filthy as if they had been washed in cold greasy water Coffee was bitter and unpleasant The kitchen staff appeared as if serving customers was an inconvenience ,No Positive
41929,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Staying on a building site, The hotel was under renovations we were not told so spent what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend on a building site woken at 7am to drilling all day including sat and sun
41930,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The room was described as having a balcony ours had a rail with pipes and not even a window to open we were on the roof so had a curved window and they were very dirty and mouldy looking in parts The pool was very shallow at the end so made it quite difficult to swim lengths you also had to climb down some very tricky curved stairs to get to the pool once you had changed so many people just came through the main doors and went back to their rooms to shower the restaraunt also needed some more staff on the Sunday as they were struggling to keep up with the customers as mondays breakfast was definitely better though one waiter was struggling with his English as I ended up with decaffe coffee instead of decaffe tea , Lovely breakfast excellent croissants breakfast was in carluccios which is unusual and the bar was also carluccios and had waiter service was a nice touch it was also nice to have a swimming pool to unwind in in a London hotel as london is tiring
41931,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Lifts I don t like them , Staff helpful friendly and accommodating Breaky superb Rooms excellent We were all very surprised by how good it was 
41932,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Heater fan in room kept my partner I awake for most of the night It was so loud when the noise first started I thought it was a large delivery van in the car park below who had left his engine running The noise would stop then start up again just as I was about to fall asleep Very annoying Also we had to disconnect the TV from the main socket as the remote didn t work no hardship thou , Bed and pillows were clean and very comfortable The shower was lovely The breakfast was fantastic serving everything you could want and was freshly cooked The hotel was within walking distance of Camden locks where my son was attending a gig for his 18th birthday 
41933,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Location is good tube is close by and very close from Primrose Hill which a very nice area Bedroom was nice and bed very comfortable Very convenient to have the Carluccio s inside the building 
41934,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I believe the hotel is in the process of updating rooms however they did not inform us that work would be taking place during our stay So it would be fair to say it was a surprise disappointing to be awoken at 9 45 on Monday morning to the sound of banging drilling when we were hoping to have a lie in prior to check out Also the room had a leaking kettle , They allowed us to keep our bags at hotel after check out Room was clean Located fairly close to the underground 
41935,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We weren t allowed to check in at 3pm as they were running late and told there would be building work starting at 9am next morning which we didn t know about or would never have booked this hotel Our room was at front of hotel so with the noise off the building work which went on until 5pm and the noise off the traffic we were not impressed at all we go to London 3 times a year and this is our first and last experience with booking com, The bed was comfortable and room was clean
41936,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Washing the outer paving could have been done in early morning was afraid I would slip it was so wet elderly lady , Felt the lack of free wi fi was a bit mean
41937,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast is very expensive for a family of three if you don t get it included in a deal with the room price You cannot check into the room until 3pm if you want to check in earlier you need to pay 40 extra charge parking is 40 for every 24 hours which is expensive but convenient as parking is underneath the hotel so you do not need to walk very far , Room was newly refurbished and very spacious couldn t fault it carluccios restaurant downstairs was a bonus Leisure facilities are great lovely pool gym sauna it is only a 30 min walk into the heart of camden town which is fantastic 
41938,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Service in restaurant and at breakfast time was awful We stayed for 3 nights and every morning we had to almost beg for a hot drink we were never approached by a staff member asking if we d like a drink there were nowhere near enough staff present at breakfast and you had to try and find one and get them to get a hot drink for you It was truly the worst breakfast service I ve ever experienced I ve stayed at the Maida Vale Marriot just up the road too and breakfast there was top drawer so don t know why this was so bad Apart from this hotel is great maybe stay room only , Rooms were great with excellent showers and really comfy beds 
41939,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Although the staff were really nice I did feel that the check out could have been handled a little better It was very cold They didn t ask us how our stay was or made any conversation really , We ate in the Italian restaurant and food was fabulous and the staff were so friendly and fun The underground is just around the corner as is the bus stop to Camden which is about a 10 mins bus ride Camden is a must see when you go to London 
41940,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, the hotel charge 899 pond in stead of the 553 pond that i booked with booking arrived on Monday leave wednesday the money already of my account on monday Contact with the floor managers about this till today they holding my at the line And there is till today now refund as promised ,No Positive

41942,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The executive lounge was inhabited by loud people quite obviously drunk They were discussing lewd subjects it was very off putting, The breakfast in the exec lounge was delicious 
41943,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The restaurant didn t have much choice for food , The staff couldn t do enough to make your stay extra special value for money modern clean rooms hotel just amazing
41944,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Attitude of restaurant staff pool is very average no direct access rooms to pool one has to walk through foyeur in dressing gown or change in the changing rooms in spite of many reminders complimentary dressing gowns arrived only second day heating was broken so we had cool room When engineer came to look at it he said that the problem was known so they had closed off some pipe or other I assume meaning no warm air which begs question why give us a room that requires some maintenance and this was during a very cold snap in London , Breakfast good but repetitive hotel very close to underground room decor comfort 
41945,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, While the Italian restaurant was lovely It would have been nice to have another option like Bar food etc , The staff were extremely helpful Lovely spacious family room 
41946,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Service service service generally apathetic Door handle fell off our bathroom Loud drilling at 10am beneath our room Unfortunately not 1 member of staff cracked a smile in 3 days we spent there Room service didn t answer the phone had to call reception and it took over 15 mins for someone to call us back all in all 45 mins to actually speak to take our order , Great room size for 3 of us Restaurant fab and very reasonably priced for London A good 4 at first impressions 
41947,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, we were in large rooms of three ordered robes for the third persons we phoned downstairs after spending a lot of money at the lovely bar nothing arrived plus for the birthday girl no wine was sent to her room as on arrival was mentioned poor show, fabulous cocktail clean and a large area to sit 
41948,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Wonderful breakfast particularly the eggs Great indoor pool though go early as they have baby swimming classes around 9 30am Very short walk to the tube which was ideal

41950,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Location was excellent A mile away from Camden market Round the corner from our intended purpose of the the trip Hampstead theatre Loved all the extras that came with the room Bottle of water on arrival Iron ironing board Take away coffee cups Lots of plug sockets etc Just the little things that go a long way 
41951,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We were woken up by housekeeping coming in at 9 30 not acceptable they should know when we have checked out Ice machine not working on 3 floors took 15 mins to get ice, Rooms were great
41952,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The price of the breakfast we actually thought when we booked this that the breakfast was included but it wasn t, The room was lovely bed was really comfy even had bottle of bubbly and card for our anniversary
41953,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The parking is quite expensive so we chose parking off site where it was significantly cheaper Also paying for wifi in the rooms was not acceptable either , The staff were all lovely and resolved issues we had immediately The refurbished room was great and the food in breakfast was really good Overall a great experience
41954,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The shower isn t very high therefore people my height 5ft 9 and above will find it quite awkward to shower The drainage wasn t great in the bath shower either The fridge also didn t work thankfully we didn t need it for our stay , Beds were super comfy and staff were friendly 
41955,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Very noisy room The patio doors offered little to no noise insulation Outside traffic noise came straight in to the room , Friendly attentive staff Communal areas wee modem and clean
41956,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Had to pay for wifi in rooms location a little way out of the tourist parts of london , Amazing staff couldn t do more for you comfort was thought about all round one of the best hotels I ve stayed in 
41957,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Rooms were old and outdated Only to be told by hotel that there are renovated rooms available at extra cost This was not made clear by booking com at time of booking which is rather disappointing We paid an extra 20 for a renovated room to improve experience, Leaisure facilities free parking outside during weekend breakfast looked good though slightly expensive
41958,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The heater in the room was very noisy We had to turn it off so that we could get some sleep Then woke up around 4am freezing cold , Location Bar area was nice
41959,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The hotel is a construction site noisy constant drilling and the management don t care Simply put don t stay here , Location Is good for Primrose Hill and Regents Park
41960,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, A bit far from our venue for the weekend we were visiting the Boat Show but that was a matter for us to solve not the hotel , Every aspect of the hotel worked for us The food was good the atmosphere was friendly and informal We were able to relax 
41961,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Upon checking in we were told work men would be making noise until 17 which we weren t that bothered about it They did start work at 9am on the dot which woke me up It should have been mentioned upon booking that the hotel were undergoing works at this time as the noises were very loud and did interrupt my sleep , The beds were very comfy I loved the pillows The staff all very friendly and helpful The pool steam room and sauna were amazing Over all a good trip 
41962,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The staff were generous and gave me and my partner a free bottle of wine to celebrate his birthday Was such a lovely thought and made us enjoy our weekend that bit more Facilities were great and so was breakfast in the morning

41964,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Staff were genuinely warm and couldn t do enough for us and made us feel very welcome The hotel was very well sited being only a 5 minute walk from the Jubilee Line everywhere we wanted to go was accessible off the Jubilee Line so no tube navigation issues We parked at Stanmore and caught the tube from there and checked into the hotel 25 minutes later with no line changes Ideal if you have a young family with you 
41965,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, My neutral score on accuracy of description is because it was meant to be a room with a balcony Balcony was v narrow with no furniture looked directly onto a flat roof of air con vents and cigarette ends Had it been summer when my husband and I would have sat out after my daughter went to bed I would have asked to be moved Air con in room also noisy and couldn t be turned off Jubilee line was shut so trickier to get to but that s not hotels fault , Liked the pool and no restrictions on family time very much Loved carluccios for dinner and breakfast Staff happy to bring lattes not just ordinary coffee Ideal for visiting London zoo we had a lovely stroll over Primrose Hill to get there Good stay overall 
41966,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Can seem a bit pricey particularly in high season Other than this all I can say for what I miss are having the option of hash browns and those Great British crumpets for the breakfast along with the existing options , Perfect location very clean comfortable and warm room Staff very kind and helpful 24 hours security Minibar in the room Carluccio s Restaurant attached to the lobby 
41967,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast was really pricey probably due to it being in Carluccios restaurant which is on the ground floor unfortunately tube closures meant the local station at Swiss Cottage was only a replacement bus service which meant a long walk to Chalk Farm to get about , really nice hotel with comfortable furnishings and facilities Rooms are excellent standard 
41968,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Nothing , Staff were friendly efficient all round excellent We ate in the restaurant which was excellent also Hotel was ideal for the short walk into Camden

41971,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Lack of heating in the bathroom as well as tourist formation and availability of newspapers, the supercomfortable beds and the possibility of charging phones and such with our own plugs
41972,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Outdated room with loud renovations going on from 8am The breakfast was very dissapointing expensive We cancelled the breakfast after our first day but was still charged on our bill which took time to sort out on check out No free wifi unless we signed up for Marriots customer rewards , Pleasant check in with bottles of water activity packs for the kids 
41973,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I would have likes sandwiches or panini type of light bites on the menu, The staff were outstanding very tentative helpful the concierge gentlemen even walked me all the way up the stairs to my room as I do not like lifts a young man in the hall saw I was struggling with drinks offered to carrying them to my room please thank all the staff for a lovely stay
41974,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, That you feel the need to use someone else s brand for your restaurant I didn t notice Carluccio serving at breakfast , Nice family room larger than at some other hotels we have used 
41975,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Free Wi Fi in all areas would be good , The renovations to the reception area are great and the bar area is a lovely place to sit with friends I also liked the hot breakfast arrangement where the eggs can be cooked to your liking We have only visited at weekends and you are able to park your car for free on the street during this time rather than paying for parking at the hotel 
41976,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Down side was the lobby if you wanted to sit and relax was very open and quiet noisey , Location was good and close to the amenities we wanted to see The staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful
41977,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Only thing I missed was a flannel in the bathroom a bath in family room instead of shower but I didn t ask so maybe they had one , Rooms had great makeover Pool great for kids Staff very friendly Late checkout 12pm I asked to be away from lifts we were given a great room 
41978,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, When we checked in the first room was smelly Then it took an hour before the hotel can allocate another room for us and when we finally checked into the family room there weren t enough big towels for 4 pax in the room The hotel staff said they ran out of big towels mmmm, Italian restaurant food was good
41979,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast not best value for family 4 people at 18 00 per person cooked breakfast The other London 4 star hotels better price breakfast howeverthe hotel is lovely will return again , Hotel pool staff and Hotel very enjoyable event 
41980,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We waited 50 minutes to receive our main meal after out starter ridiculous The food service is never consistent one time great next time appalling , We use the hotel regularly and the facilities are great It is good for camden and primrose Hill village but a hike to town 
41981,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Carluccio s is a big bonus to the place The breakfast was excellent That scrambled egg I unfortunately came down with flu whilst there having booked it because of the pool That said it was even great without it Staff lovely atmosphere in the place light and airy and friendly Location excellent There really were no negatives other than minor no toothpaste in rooms no slippers and dressing gown unless requested paucity of shower gel etc advised when I queried that they only replace if less than 1 3 how can two people shower with 1 3 of a mini bottle Only a blip and when I queried was sorted All in all and I am fairly critical a superb hotel 
41982,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The cooked breakfast could have been a bit hotter , The location staff safe underground parking Finding a Christmas stocking filled with a gingerbread cookie tangerine card hanging outside our door on Christmas morning was such a lovely gesture

41984,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, television was rather slow and for a family could have had more biscuits with our tea in our room , very nice choices for breakfast nice swimming pool very helpful staff 
41985,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Lack of interconnecting rooms Always difficult for a parent traveling with kids when you have to leave a child or children in a room by themselves even if it s adjoining , Lovely staff helpful and hardworking Comfortable beds 7 minutes walk to Swiss cottage underground station Reasonably quiet rooms Nice breakfast with delicious pork sausages Close to useful shops on finchley Rd e g W h smith Boots Waitrose 
41986,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Well then constant building work which we werent warned about drilling directly into our room walls from above and side Heavy banging around from the work being done above It was from check in and was still going on when we went out at 4 30pm and from 9 8 30am on sunday morning Breakfast to room was totally cold and took an eternity to sort By the time it did we needed to rush to eat as check out time was near The thermostat in the room broke so we were cold and couldnt adjust it The best bit was leaving the hotel How can you charge these prices and not make people aware that they will be severly disrupted It was our 10 year anniversary and by far our worst Every year we come to london and have never experienced anywhere neat as poor 4 star hotel This place comes nowhere near close for me , Well then constant building work which we werent warned about drilling directly into our room walls from above and side It was from check in till we went out at 5pm and from 8am on sunday morning Breakfast to room was totally cold and thermostat in the room broke so we were cold The best bit was leaving the hotel How can you charge these prices and not make people aware that they will be severly disrupted It was our 10 year anniversary and by far our worst 
41987,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The room was tired and had an unpleasant smell They are refurbishing but until this happens I felt that 239 was a lot for a shabby room, The location and the facilities
41988,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Read above, Disappointed with basic lack of good will on the part of hotel 1 No complementary bottle of water in the room fridge 2 The bar ran out of Merlot wine with no reserve 3 We finished breakfast before coffee arrived despite asking for it twice For the rating the hotel is displaying it is unacceptable want stay there again
41989,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Every morning the stuff had to confirm with the front desk if I had inclusive breakfast , The breakfast is amazing The cleanliness of the hotel The stuff really great 
41990,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, unable to judge new rooms as renovation still in progress, My main impression was great awareness by all the staff in reception and concierge of any individual requirements Outstanding in a busy chain hotel
41991,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Nearly everything was wrong room very poor half eaten food on a try outside our room door as we went in drilling fire alarm kept going off shower barley any water very very poor allround,No Positive
41992,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Lack of breakfast tea bags left in room Only two bags per couple each day I know I could have requested more but feel more could have been automatically left I requested non feather pillows but this was not done , Location Close to underground Gym and Swimming pool very nice 
41993,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, I enjoyed my stay here the hotel was clean and the staff was extremely helpful They were serving hot cocoa in the lobby as well Marta was very detailed when checking us in and helped us get acquainted with the area of London we were staying it and attractions were nearby I would definitely stay here again 
41994,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, the staff were particularly pleasant and helpful they are the reason we d return kudos to your front desk staff and the concierge for getting us cabs and helping us navigate life overseas for the weekend 
41995,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, There was a furniture bug in our room and hotel too slow to respond in telling us their action plan and plus in changing our room, The room the lobby the staff at the coffee shop plus resturant very pleasant 
41996,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Room for 4 adults but only 3 chairs no bottled water in room and only 2 tea sachets provided not what I expected from a 4 hotel 2nd night of our stay was ruined by a group of all night party goers they shouted and sang slammed doors but worst of all they were smoking and we might as well have been too We had no windows open but the smell and smoke came into our room we were in a non smoking hotel Eventually at 6amhotel security responded to our complaint asked them to be quieter not much good for us by that time I later spoke to two members of reception staff who apologised for our experience but they offered no reassurances or hotel policy on this just smiley faces so a little frustrating Breakfast was included in our stay but we were informed that porridge eggs etc would have a charge of 5 6 extra our first coffee or tea would be free after that a 1 95 charge per cup the cups were tiny about 100mls worth the breakfast buffet was fine but all these extra charges seemed tight So all in all nice location but we came away sleep deprived smelling and choking on second hand smoke and no we won t be going back , Great location for primrose hill Regent s Park and Swiss Cottage tube station
41997,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I asked if breakfast could be included when arrived and was told no And felt was charged a premium as we were paying for breakfast separately , Friendly staff service
41998,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Cost of parking in the hotel car park, Excellent hotel in a great location for Camden town Have stayed here four times and have never been disappointed 
41999,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, It s a five star hotel but does not feel like one too many people not enough staff it s too obvious they they are minimising cost and maximising benefit I even had to pay for a converter from a European plug to a British one that s being truly cheap I ve been to many other Marriots and had a much better experience there the hotels seemed more like 5 star hotels , It s located in a lovely area and though it s not close to the city centre there is an underground close by The Italian restaurant and the service at the restaurant was great breakfast too Room was fine 
42000,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Although I have booked executive room I did felt disappointed For that price I did expected a bit more Like bigger room and atmosphere felt a bit cold in a room , The location was great and super friendly staff 
42001,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Although not on the main road traffic can be heard all night which is a problem if you re a light sleeper No slippers in the room We asked for slippers and one bathrobe as we wanted to go swimming with kids and waited Called again to follow up and staff advised it was on the way only to receive a call afterwards saying they do not have any available as they await the delivery , Most staff were friendly
42002,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Check in and out time Additional 40 to check in early , Breakfast was great staff friendly and helpful Room very clean and comfortable great value for money 
42003,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Nothing, Only stopped one night for a family london weekend beds were very comfortable Hotel was clean and modern took 2 mins to check in and out staff were very friendly and welcoming Never got the chance to use pool but only due to not bringing our stuff breakfast was nice and over all a great stay would definitely recommend and would stay again 
42004,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Beds were super uncomfortable We have stayed in a ton of Marriott s and they all had the best beds except this one , The Staff was super friendly and Honestly wanted to help 
42005,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, There always seemed to be one or two people parked in the lobby using the wifi for their phone they didn t look like hotel guests , The Italian restaurant was especially professional and menu interesting 
42006,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The air conditioning was not working in my first room so after 3 attempts to mend it I was eventually and without any fuss moved to another smaller one Even there it was extremely noisy The hotel is undergoing refurbishment so perhaps one can forgive the fact that the bedrooms are currently looking very tired and worn Luckily I was out most of the day but the noise from drilling was very loud next door and below my room in the morning I was shocked to be told that under a new rule there would be an early check in fee of 40 but had to pay it as I had an appointment at 3 30pm on my arrival day needed to change before going to it At the end of my stay my bill was overcharged by some 100 but this was double checked and corrected again without fuss All in all a disappointing stay at a hotel which I know well Perhaps better to find somewhere else till it the renovations are finished , The staff were helpful and mainly friendly but I did not feel they were very engaged Carluccio s restaurant had very good food though the breakfast pricing was confusing and the acoustics are not too good 
42007,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, She needed to stay an extra night but when we tried to cancel on the same day that we were meant to be staying we were not able to without paying for the room I stayed there alone when I could have gone home A complete waste of money , The hotel quality was as expected We booked this as my wife was having an operation and we needed to stay overnight to return for treatment after she left hospital 
42008,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The water wasn t working the hallways were dirty not one convenient feature of room , The lobby These rest of the building could have been in a 60s movie 
42009,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Rooms looked a little tired Pool area tiles were very dirty underfoot Three people booked only 1 robe 2 slippers 2 sets of towels and 2 teabags , Helpful friendly staff Slices of cake for birthday was nice touch Breakfast was good 
42010,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The price of the onsite breakfast For an adult Full English it was 18 19 and half price for kids A continental was 12 50 Outrageous in our opinion but probably not under the Hotel s direct influence as the breakfast is served in the onsite Carluccio s restaurant Which I hastened to add we dined at for our evening meal the previous night and it was excellent although a little expensive also , The location was great for where we needed to be Westfield Shopping Centre Baker Street All staff were helpful Although we didn t use it many other families seemed to enjoy the onsite pool Our family room was really a twin double no drama for us on this occasion as we all tired and had the same lights out time But might be different if you were expecting interlocking rooms or one with a separate sleeping area 
42011,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I don t really think anything else could of been better apart from our experience with the breakfast , The breakfast was good but didn t understand why I had to pay more for something that was cheaper than what I could have 
42012,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Wanted adjoining room Not available Horrible construction noise They moved us to new rooms but my sons were put into a room that smelled of smoke though it was a non smoking room More in room dining options , Great staff Good location 
42013,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Room was a little overcrowded with furniture 2double beds and balcony was not really usable due to busy road and heavy traffic noise, Location and value for money
42014,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The construction noise and water interruption I also didn t feel this was Marriott quality outdated decor and furnishings musty smell in hallways and rooms slow filling toilets , The staff were warm hospitable and helpful The service and food in the restaurant was very good 
42015,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Getting a house keeping call before 9am , Breakfast was faultless Room service pretty good Staff was competent and friendly Good location to bus line and tube 
42016,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, A member of staff called John was very polite and brought me and my partner a bottle of wine up to as we had a busy day I thought it was very generous and kind Send him my regards
42017,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We came to this Hotel for my 22nd birthday I wouldn t recommended it it had such potential but was let down majorly by the occurrences we experienced The balcony is very small but we didn t mind the room was nice we all had a shower ready for our night out and then realised non of our plugs worked when we went to use the hairdryer there isn t any description on what number to call to get reception so my friend went down with wet hair in her pjs and ask if it could be sorted they said someone would come up straight away 40minutes later I then had to call off my mobile to the hotel to get someone to come up they said someone was on their way another 20 30minutes went by then 2 of my friends went down which resulted in the maintenance man coming up with them he then said if we plug in a few things at the same time the plugs will all go so advised us to only plug in one or two things so we had to rotate hairdryers chargers which was inconvenient we missed our table booking because this took so long then when we came back from our night out we ordered take away and never received it but the receptionist took our money We all came from different areas so was looking forward to a nice trip someone is meant to be getting back to me about the complaint we made still heard nothing ,No Positive

42021,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Communication with many staff was difficult Room cleaners and waiters had a very limited knowledge of English Sometimes we felt like the foreigners in our own country , We liked the view from our room and the spaciousness of it Overall we enjoyed our stay 
42022,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Unable to access the balcony which was a shame as the view was good, Room really spacious and comfortable great to have a pool and leisure facilities The staff were very helpful 
42023,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, There was a large fly in the room one reading light not working sewerage smell in the bathroom poor view from balcony old mattresses and waste from building works visible , Excellent staff at reception and in the restaurant Good location to public transport 
42024,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Parking was a bit expensive , Staff were very friendly welcoming nothing was too much trouble Clean and comfortable rooms perfect location for Lords Cricket ground only a short walk to the tube for central London

42028,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, No adult only time in the pool Response to room request for things to accommodate the three guests booked was poor in the first instance didnt happen Not the attention to detail I would expect of a Marriott , Convenience to Hampstead and Belsize for restaurants Funky reception lounge Good sized room and bathroom Plenty of computer space in the lounge 
42029,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Where do I start The ants in my first room I was moved to another with none bathroom drains that were very slow to drain water very very old and needing to be replaced carpeting chipped and old furniture lock on the door did not work this hotel needs a MAJOR overhaul Or a wrecking ball , Not too much to like here Location was close to where I needed to be Bedding was comfortable air conditioning worked well That s about it 
42030,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, No fridge in room and no water in room Water only available in 500ml bottles and was expensive , Great location for Regent s Park and London Zoo Handy underground parking but pricey Reception and restaurant recently refurbished very nice Carluccios Super helpful friendly staff both on the phone and in person Even with noisy kids 3rd floor rooms are due to be refurbished but whilst a bit dated were super clean and perfectly nice Lovely bed Outside of hotel is not very beautiful architecturally but aside from that a great stay at a decent price Felt like everyone was really making an effort to achieve high standards We ll go back 
42031,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Very friendly staff good location room with a view well stocked bar excellent value for money Just outside central London but easy to get around and a nice area We would definitely book this hotel again 
42032,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, There were some renovation works going on in the hotel at the time Suppose they have to do that, All rooms have a balcony which was really nice as it was hot Good location just 5 min walk to tube station table s you on the jubilee line Joel was fantastic
42033,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Bedsheets not changed regularly balcony not cleaned and full of cobwebs No water available in the room Was told tap water is drinkable therefore no reason to put bottled water in rooms Cleaning is really dismal My daughter found a baby cockroach crawling in the coffee tray Hotel name rates charged and what you get don t match in my opinion , General staff are nice and friendly
42034,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We went away for my birthday week as we wanted to get away for some peace and quiet away from building work near our home We weren t informed that major work was currently going on in the hotel So obviously not happy with the sound of loud drilling and a lot of noise during our stay including heavy items being hurled into a skip right outside our room early in the morning Our bed was Itchy and uncomfortable We woke up with bites and itching all over We certainly wouldn t expect this from a Marriott It was very frustrating not being able to get through to the correct staff on the telephone I must of phoned fifteen times to chase up the problem I either got cut off or told somebody would call me back which they didn t Our bathroom smelled old and bad As a Marriotts rewards member We stay in Marriotts all over the country often through booking com up until now we have never felt physically sick due to the thought of bed bugs in any of them We were moved to an alternative room on our third night but it s just not acceptable that i spent my birthday week awake two nights running because of the quality of the bed then to be woken with the sound of building work in the mornings Only last week I stayed at a Marriott in Birmingham and it was a perfect stay This Marriott in Regents Park certainly Wasn t the same , Nice lobby and bar also pool nice The food excellent 
42035,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast is way too expensive, One tube into central London Great base for sight seeing Hotel staff were really helpful and kept our suitcase all day after checkout
42036,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Access to hotel from parking bays below ground More check in staff at the desk, Great on site restaurant very good breakfast suitable for children and great pool facilities
42037,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The staff at reception didn t really seem like they knew what they were doing They took ages to check us in and they asked for the full amount of the stay upon arrival Another annoyance was a member of staff knocked on our door early in the morning to ask if she could clean the room Even though we didn t put the sign on the door to do so Also they kept ringing the room for such little things Also didn t appreciate the fact that one of the staff members was rude to my girlfriend , The beds were so comfortable
42038,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Our room wasn t ready and it took a long time to get help from the front of house manager although he was brilliant when he came to speak to us It was not at all good to have to ask three or four times before coffee was bought round at breakfast A self serve system would have been much better , I liked that when we had a problem the front of house manager made sure that we were really looked after and the problem resolved 
42039,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The building is really old, I changed the rooms and I forgot my charger in the old room I spoke to all the staff and I was not able to get my mobile charger After three days the houskeeping brought me a used charger as a replacement for my missing charger 
42040,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I booked for breakfast to be included as on the internet there was only one obtion for the same but when we got to checkin they informed us it didnt includenthe same this is he second time its happened and I had to pay as an extra not immpressed another 200 plus ,No Positive
42041,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Think WiFi should be included in the price for the room Also room looking a little tired and could do with updating , Beds comfy nice and clean Breakfast good staff friendly 
42042,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Renovation is going on and it is noisy , The location is perfect for us We will stay there next time too After room renovations it would be more comfortable

42044,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Didn t get Marriott points through booking com , Great pool lovely room with good air con and balcony Great breakfast in Carluccios Concierge staff were very helpful Bed was massive and very comfortable 
42045,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The food could have been better the room deco for a 4 start was poor not good value for money for location, I was given a box of chocolate for a birthday treat
42046,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The chairs in the bedroom s were so uncomfortable They were awful to sit on I cannot lie down in bed so spend a lot of the time sitting in the chair but not this one The only other thing was that the lighting in the room was not very good even with all the lights on it seemed quite dark But these 2 little issues would not stop me from staying again as everything else was perfect and that is me nit picking because I cannot find anything else wrong , Loved the hotel very nice decor very very good cleanliness all of the staff that we met and dealt with were absolutely fabulous From the moment we walked in to check in the man on reception I wish I could remember his name it was foreign maybe french he was brilliant He went out of his way to help us in every way possible he was attentive and extremely professional he made our stay Saw him several times and his help was outstanding he is one of the reason s that I will be back to your hotel Overall the hotel was fantastic great facilities and near some great shops and very near to the tube very handy and excellent value for money I wish I could afford another trip and I would be back staying at The Marriott Thank you 
42047,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Breakfast is good Check in process is efficient Our receptionist is a Hongkonger which is a happy surprise Near Swiss Cottage Underground station and walking distances to the Regent Park 
42048,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Free wifi in the rooms would be better Hotel car park was expensive but may be going rate for London , Quiet location despite being fairly central just round the corner from Swiss Cottage Tube Station Enjoyed evening meal at Carluccio s restaurant Bed pillows comfy Swimming pool a bonus 
42049,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Nor family friendly No special discounts for families Moved from a 1 rm family unit to 2 rooms at a higher rate Expected a discount for second room or the like , Location
42050,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, No chocolate spread , Comfy beds clean everywhere cool pool great breakfast well equipped gym helpful and friendly staff good buzz but quiet rooms
42051,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I would like to see a cheaper breakfast alternative as it is quite expensive and not really an option for someone who just wants a small beakfast such as cereal or perhaps an omlette This would be my only issue as we had to go looking a cafe that suited us better We would have preffered to use the hotel for this facility It was slightly disappointing to see that after I had booked this hotel non refundable through booking com that I could have booked it slightly cheaper via hotels own website Again not a fault with the hotel but do your homework on prices before booking , Staff in foyer receptionists and concierge included were very kind helpful and courteous The two male staff in Carluccio s restraunt were very attentive and had a lovely manner towards our children they even let them tap in their own orders on the restaurant tablet Kids portions slightly small but the dessert definitely filled them up Kids loved the swimming pool and a cleaner entered the changing room at exactly the right time as the toilets were in need of a clean I would however lay the blame for this with previous users rather than staff Receptionist at pool entrance was great with the kids and gave them a treat on the way out Small touches like this were lovely Rooms were comfortable a little dated but i knew in advance that refurbishment is underway so this didnt bother me Very close to Swiss Cottage Tube station so travelling was no issue One evening was quite miserable weather wise so we availed of in room movies to create a cinema night 
42052,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Pay for wifi and fairly pricey for being outskirts of London felt the price was a central price, The staff were lovely and the decoration and message they left in the room for my birthday was a lovely touch 
42053,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Have no hot drinks machine so guests had to wait for a hot drink the first thing I want is a coffee and I had to wait for it as did a lot of other people it would also take a little pressure off staff if not a machine why not offer a cafettiere or a pot of tea which would give 2 cups to each guest Not very sound proof windows found the outside noise disturbing , the pillows are really soft and the bed comfortable breakfast was really good with lots of choice and a chef to cook your eggs how ever you wanted them we had trouble connecting to the wifi but had exceptional help to get us connected felt the staff more friendly when coming in than going out
42054,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The room didn t have free wifi and they should change the corridor carpets The carpets were old and smelly , Hotel Marriott Regents park is a comfortable hotel in a nice neighborhood near to the Swiss cottage underground station Our room was quite big and the beds were great The bathroom could have been a littlebit bigger The staff was chatty and easy going and always ready to help 
42055,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Noisy outside bedroom due to workers there were mites fleas in the room slow response to request for coffee and sugar in the room Had to call twice on two separate occasions to ask where they were and took over 20 minutes to arrive each time unacceptable , Pool was ok and leaving luggage was efficient 
42056,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Cleaners came knocking on the door at 7 30 in the morning And again at 10 30 They should have a list with check outs especially for people only staying one night ,No Positive
42057,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, outside balcony is a joke too small and possibly added later on room refrigerators are turned off why bath mats on request only parking prices astronomical , beds
42058,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Coffee served by staff to the tables during breakfast is almost non excisting A better way of doing that is a must But a very nice breakfast The room need refurbishment nice but outdated But it s is scheduled in September , Carluccio s the new restaurant The refurbishment of the foyer The pool area The fitness area
42059,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The balcony is really a balcony The steam room was smelly The kisngsize room was small We asked for a room with view and they ignored is and have a room with crap view, Swimming pool
42060,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We were kept waiting 30mins for our check in We were told they were late because the couple before us had booked a late check out which was totally irrelevant to us and which by inference suggested we were less important as we had not paid extra When we got to our room there were no towels so by the time we had reported that we had lost 40 mins of our afternoon We were not even offered complimentary tea or coffee whilst we waited Also when I rang the hotel to book a parking space I was told to contact Justpark to reserve a space I was charged 64 but when checking out found the hotel would have charged me 31 I am annoyed that the receptionist cost me 33 for incorrect advice Not sure I would stay here again as you are certainly not made to feel you are important to the hotel , The room was comfortable and the hotel is in a good location We have stayed here before so we were impressed with the updates that are taking place 
42061,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, In room Wi Fi is not free and wasn t included in our room rate though it may be included in some I was surprised , Did not use any of the facilities so have not rated them Did not eat in the hotel Location is convenient for visiting friends in London but also very close approx 500m from Swiss Cottage Tube station Price is on the high side but it is London I suppose and at least you know what you ll get with a Marriot 
42062,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Only grip that the breakfast was not included Moreover charging 18 for breakfast was way over the top even for a city break , Overall loved the hotel great facilities and very contemporary 
42063,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Room was very small bathroom not very clean and very pokey lots of noise from building works going on, location was great for visiting family in Swiss Cottage The staff were excellent always friendly and helpful The food was good
42064,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Old room tired looking , Lovely old hotel They are going through renovations Rooms are old and tired But clean and comfortable Location is great right near tube and buses into city 
42065,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, the bed should be harder to prevent hole formation and be able to turn sides easily , the cleanliness of bathroom and staff response the room isolation was great 
42066,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Rooms were in my opinion cleaned in a rush curtains were torn a bit dirty dishes left outside our room remained there until the next morning in spite of advising the desk about it There were not enough ropes and slippers which were not supplied although the desk was also advised of this Extra paid Internet was also a bit of surprise , Breakfast was fairly good everything was of course fresh the service in the restaurant was also nice We didn t have a problem with leaving the baggage for a bit longer in a room which was secured and safe 
42067,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Swimming pool is a joke Its a less than two feet at one end and one cannot to any sort of serious swimming The information regarding the pool on the website is misleading, Location bar
42068,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfasts fruit choice could be better and not soaked in syrup as practiced in 1970 s Bread slices are as thin as Melba toasts this is no way to save money , Nice and quiet location even though it s not near any Metro stations Dinners at the restaurant 
42069,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Poor and expensive internet connection public internet is also very poor The restaurant menu is short , Very quiet and convenient location good sized rooms the pool and the sauna are good
42070,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I had been waiting for a long time after checked in as the room wasn t ready It was absolutely nonsense why I had to wait for 90 mins at the lobby so disappointed , Clean
42071,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Very attentive made a real fuss of our daughter for her birthday with brownies balloons and a banner in the room Also liked the Carluccios in the hotel and the swimming pool too 
42072,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The hotel is under renovation and failed to advertise that fact There were rips in the carpet smudges on the wall and dated furnishings , The front desk staff was accommodating and courteous Concierge was also very knowledgeable and helpful 
42073,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Reception Too busy Building work Asked for a room on floor 7 as was my friends 40th birthday Phones and requested twice On day did not get and staff member was v abrupt Was a very noisy pope or air conditioner in corner of our room Was very loud all through the night, Beds were comfortable
42074,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The staff is very friendly and professional Marta at the Reception gave us an excellent welcome in Spanish The rooms are clean and with enough space for my family Great location close to the underground 
42075,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Only Two teabags left in the room when we asked the concierge for 2 extra teabags for the next morning he directed us to the restaurant staff who stated there was a charge per teabag very sad , Decent sized room
42076,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Broken refrigerator in the room but it s understandable because the hotel is currently being refurbished , Deluxe room was spacious with 2 double beds and a balcony I really appreciated the hot water kettle and free tea bags provided I enjoyed hot tea when I woke up every morning Hotel is near enough to the Swiss Cottage tube station and some nice cafes 
42077,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Just very expensive for the accommodation Room small despite being for 4 would have been remarkably small for 4 and the balcony wasn t really a balcony couldn t sit out on it a foot wide Also d cor a little dated could do with a refresh , Good location quiet although overlooking drop off zone and comfortable beds Excellent lobby area and enjoyed Carluccios restaurant 
42078,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Did not like all Italian food and bar it could have had more choice Breakfast is very expensive at 18 per person , Lovely clean room with comfortable beds Nice view over London 
42079,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The hotel is not at all easy to see if walking from the tube station There are no signs to show which way the hotel is either We had to ask several people on the way how to find it Hotel was under construction and was very noisy during the day due to this we were not told before our arrival to be aware of this Evening room service not enough cutlery provided Food was not hot enough Ice cream was not served over ice so quickly melted while we ate our dinner Was pretty average room service for three meals for GBP 60 00 was over the top to pay for , Very comfortable beds and good size room for 2 adults 1 child Great to enjoy leisure facilities without being charged extra Good breakfast Friendly and efficient cleaners for the room always greeted in a warm manner 
42080,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, There wasn t anything I didn t like , Everything from start to finish was excellent luggage taken on arrival hotel very clean and great facilities staff very polite rooms were great location was great very central 
42081,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and friendly particularly the bar staff on Sunday night who arranged a meal from the restaurant minutes before the restaurant was due to close 
42082,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The beds were extra comfy and all the staff were very helpful and couldn t do enough for us during our stay Will be booking again next time we visit London 
42083,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Noise from the refurbishment car park charges beds very soft and uncomfortable, Location was good pool area and availability very good bar and restaurant good value staff very friendly 
42084,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast very poor cold one day and the next all the juices had been watered down Pool really worn down no spa pool as advertised , Room very clean and comfortable
42085,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast was a bit of a shambles We were given a table straight away but sat there for ages with no one coming to take out order I tried to catch the eyes of several waiting staff but they deliberately looked away When I put my hand up to indicate to one waitress that we needed assistant she actually scowled and was clearly muttering that we weren t at one of her tables And walked away So we left and bought pain au chocolat from Budgens opposite saving 54 so in the end I was not too sorry , The staff were extremely kind and friendly towards my children My kids loved the activity packs presented to them on check in and the sweets Dinner was fine and the kids loved the pool 
42086,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Found the beds really uncomfortable and the noise of a fan running all night out side of our room was irritating Attitude of reception staff could have been better although they did help sort my incorrect booking , Kids loved pool and having Carluccios restaurant on site 
42087,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The bathroom was nothing special Very clean and everything worked just was no more special than the bathroom in a low cost hotel room , Staff very friendly swimming pool wonderful beds comfy balcony lovely restaurant served extremely good food Fantastic location 
42088,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The swimming pool staff were not very friendly One of them even told off my children about splashing but the only splashing they were doing was from moving their arms and legs to swim They are just learning to swim and after being told off they were very reluctant to move in the water , As soon as we walked on the property we were made to feel very special We all liked that very much They were very attentive and we appreciated that 
42089,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I didn t mind that there was no wifi in the rooms although I feel that this should be said at check in and I didn t mind the construction works outside the hotel grounds I was there with my girlfriend for two days and we found this hotel on a deals website My complaint is that one of the hotel staff informed me that the first tube would be running at 6 30am on the morning of my checkout a Sunday When I checked out that morning I found that the local Swiss Cottage tube opens at 7 20am This effectively made me nearly miss my flight as I instead had to get a 20 taxi to Victoria station to catch an airport express I would have expected the hotel staff to be a little more knowledgeable about their surroundings When I say I barely made my flight I had to sprint through the airport and was the last person to reach our gate ,No Positive
42090,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Not knowing there was works happening not good first impression for my secret birthday night Being given wrong room and the key not working Swimming pool was hard to find due to being redirected because of the works and then the changing rooms were located in a silly place pool was cold silly idea to have to go down full flight of slippery when wet stairs with wet feet , The reception staff were lovely The bed was very comfortable 
42091,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Bed was huge Really comfortable Bit of a balcony which was handy as it was sunny Close to Regent s Park 5 minute walk and also Camden lock and markets not too far away either The staff were very friendly and we were told on arrival that we were guests of the day so a small present of chocolate and strawberries was left in our room and free breakfast the next day 
42092,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The property is undergoing extensive renovations which we were not made aware of at the time of booking The reception and main entrance are a building site and the communal areas are confined to the conference rooms which are void of daylight My partner had planned on holding 2 meetings during her stay in the communal areas but this was not possible and whilst her complaint was managed by a very nice manager the only resolution offered was limited access to the business lounge which being on the 6th floor was not an ideal solution , It was a good location for the purpose oft trip 
42093,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Was made guests of the day for our anniversary Upgraded room Chocolates and wine in the room Free breakfast Staff extra friendly Couldn t of asked for any more Well done to all the team 
42094,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, I really enjoyed the quality of the food within the restaurant I thought it was of a high standard Drinks were at a reasonable price also Most importantly to help with the reason of my stay I was very impressed that upon my request at reception about WiFi within my room the staff was able to help me without any extra cost added to my stay and was more than happy to do so All staff were very pleasant and happy Each staff member said good morning good evening
42095,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Would not recommend this hotel It was in the middle of ongoing building work taking place Had to change rooms around 11pm Toilet in second room didn t flush propally windows were in a terrible state and curtains were moth bitten Very poor,No Positive
42096,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Paying for car park 31 a day when u can park around the corner for 10 The work going on to renovate and update the hotel entrance is quite extensive Saying that though it didn t effect our stay too much, Staff from check in to checking out everybody very friendly and helpful The facilities are really good nice well equipped gym and pool Nice rooms we had two big double beds seating and table and still plenty of space 
42097,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Renovation work in progress which made access to the hotel gloomy and unprepossessing but I understand that these should be finished soon A Sunday morning swim in the pool which I had hoped would be relaxing was marred by the fact that there were children s lessons taking up a third of the pool Happy to see kids enjoying themselves but it leaves little room for adult swimmers , The staff were very efficient friendly and helpful even in the throes of renovation works that made life fairly difficult for those arriving Beds were comfortable and the bathroom very well refurbished 
42098,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Hygiene in the public toilets could be improved a lot , Excellent location Friendly staff Excellent breakfast with lots of choice Comfortable room the bathroom is a bit older but still clean so that was more than OK 
42099,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We didn t have the breakfast because I thought it was too expensive and heating was too warm through the night , The beds were comfy the rooms were large the swimming pool was ideal 
42100,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I m a builder coming for a peaceful weekend break the last thing I wanted to see was another building site it was noisy and looked untidy The bars restaurant were closed and the hotel looked nothing like the pictures on the website They should pre worn you building work is been carried out , Location gym swim and the breakfast was fantastic
42101,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Would be good to have dressing gowns and slippers in the room for each of us we only had two and there was 4 of us but didn t affect our stay , The location was brilliant really close to Swiss Cottage underground When we arrived early to drop our luggage off we were told not only was our room ready but we were guests of the day and entitled to free breakfast for the 4 of us Room was a quad and plenty of room for the 4 of us having a balcony was a bonus 
42102,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I was disappointed we were not made aware of the renovations at hotel before we arrived it did ruin the experience as we have stayed at this hotel before and enjoyed the bright cheerful reception The restaurant menu isn t as good as when the indian buffet was available but should improve with Carluccio s arrival ,No Positive
42103,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, renovations going on but they didn t impact overall Breakfast is expensive, Lovely bed Good sized room with tea coffee facilities in room safe 
42104,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, A bit Pricey and renovation works going on during our stay Booked room with balcony but were initially put on only floor where rooms didn t have one but staff soon sorted us another room, Staff very welcoming and helpful rooms comfy and good breakfast good location for Tube and bus routes
42105,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Major building work going on which impacted on the flow of the main entrance which was untidy and dusty The swimming pool was difficult to access as once in a wet bathing costume there was a series of stairs to negotiate We thought breakfast was included and were disappointed it wasn t hidden information in the small print Very expensive for room only and a building site We should have been made aware of this and given the opportunity to change hotels , Spacious rooms with comfortable beds
42106,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Building work and thought the lounge could be more comfortable more sofas and armchairs to relax in the evening , Location spa and pool room was very nice Building work
42107,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Pool time limits for families not advised beforehand therefore we could not use the pool after 8 pm as our children are 13 16 price of drinks in the bar extortionate service charge added to bill then a space left for gratuities Very cheeky , Staff at breakfast very helpful food very good
42108,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The breakfast quality and choice could be improved , The staff at the check in and check out were exceptional in providing a great customer experience during check in and check out The staff in the restaurant provided excellent service also 
42109,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Would benefit from new windows as you could hear more noise from the steet than you would have expected on the 4th floor Thankfully the road was not too busy , Great location with a very nice family run restaurant within walking distance on Primrose Hill that did a great Sunday brunch 
42110,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, One thing I would say is the pool is a bit dated and I was changing in male changing rooms and there was a woman cleaner thought that was bit strange wondering eyes, Lovely hotel colleague are very friendly rooms are good we but of updating but they are refurbishing the whole hotel so there s a few changes to the layout good hotel brillant location 10 min walk to tube station if your staying in London book here and it s regents park
42111,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Not being told that the hotel is going through a major refurbishment I wouldn t have booked We couldn t stay at the hotel during day time because my daughter has asthma it was too dusty It is UNETHICAL not to inform your potential customers about the major refurbishment on the website By far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in We felt cheated , nothing
42112,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The price Plus There was a distinct lack of stairs Some work taking place so maybe due to this but I never usually use lifts but had no option but to use them here I don t think many people will see this as a problem , Lovely room Very comfortable bed so good nights sleep The room was very quiet which I thought was a real bonus I didn t get chance to use any of the facilities but there seemed to be plenty to do if you were staying for leisure purposes 
42113,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Refurbishment in progress noisy No stairs available if you would prefer to use the stairs or I just couldn t find it The quality of the breakfast was poor considering this category of hotel A service charge that is added to your bill which you can opt out of I don t mind giving a tip but a bill is presented with a service charge added as percentage of the total bill which amounts to more than I would like to give for a tip The d cor in the rooms was not just outdated but due for renewal Overall I felt overcharged for the service provided, Rooms were spacious enough and the twin bedroom came with 2 double beds Staff were very friendly and helpful
42114,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, During my stay the hotel was renovated Only one out of 3 elevators worked the place was dusty and noisy If I knew that the place was on renovation I would not book my stay there ,No Positive
42115,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Loads of noise from other people in hotel rooms partying in room till 2 am with kids screaming really not good for 180 per night then never got asked if we enjoyed our stay Wonder why , Check in
42116,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Room temperature wasn t stable Comlimentery cake on the table was dry tasted as it was there for days Car parking had to pay whis as a customer wasn t very pleasing and to be honest of cancletion fees wasn t implemented I wouldn t stay I could get better for the price Noisy couldn t sleep , Swimming pool
42117,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Extremely noisy air conditioner with no way to turn off even on its lowest setting it was noisy Also rooms felt quite tired and dated , Very comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom 
42118,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Not normal Marriott standards compared the West Indian Quays Marriott hotel This hotel is looking very old and tied I know at the moment they are refurbishing the reception but it s a bit messy with a bad smell Expensive car park when Quality hotel which is 2 minutes up the road as free on site parking for free, Comfy bed and on site parking
42119,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Building works which weren t pointed out on booking No public lounge small Bar in restaurant Very expensive breakfast and wifi, Comfy spacious rooms
42120,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Fire alarm broke out at 3 am no staff were present to help with evacuation guests especially with young children were left with no help or directions No explanation was given on reason for setting off the alarm Hotel management needs to comprehensively review its fire directions and operative measures Hotel needs to modernize its facilities especially its safety and security measures Hotel management expressed apologies but didn t offer any compensatory gestures for guests even symbolic Overall the stay in the hotel was ok but did not rise up to the expected standards of a Marriott , Good location Friendly staff from reception to concierge office especially helpful Samir 
42121,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Some rooms and facilities need more development and refurbishment , Good and quiet location Friendly staff from reception to concierge staff especially Samir from the concierge office Very Comfortable room better than the one I got first time we stayed in 
42122,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, As above Disgraceful behaviour by both Marriott and Booking com, How can you ask your clients to book a well known brand like Marriott WITHOUT advising that the hotel is undergoing a massive refurbishment It is a disgrace I am considering never using booking com again as I feel you have misled me Had I known the real story I would never have made this reservation 
42123,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The cost of kids breakfast nearly ten pound each for two bowls of rice crispies each morning , The staff were friendly and very helpful They made the kids stay enjoyable 
42124,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Over all not pleased with stay at all No robes in room as advertised with booking Very run down hotel although works were being done they woke us very early in the morning with the renovating Room service menu advertised a Cajun chicken burger with salsa guacamole and fries what arrived was a defrosted burger bun with chicken and a bit of lettuce with cold plain fries on the side 45 pounds for two burgers and two beers very disappointed When we arrived we were very tired so thought room service would have made up for the terrible noise and lack of run down hotel but was equally as terrible and I won t be back , Staff were friendly 
42125,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We booked a king room but this was not available when we checked in John tried to find another King room but was not successful However he offered a free breakfast to compensate We could not use the free breakfast due to fasting for a hospital procedure the next day so John offered 25 off dinner instead So the customer service we received from John went a long way to making up for the unavailable room type booked on booking com , John the guest relations manager went out of his way to ensure we had the best stay possible He was very cheerful and polite and very happy to help A asset to hang on to 
42126,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Booked a quadruple room for 4 adults and on check in was informed that we only got 2 breakfasts included even though we had paid for 4 as a package deal and if we wanted to have the extra 2 breakfasts that we would have to pay a further 20 each per day , The rooms are good and the location
42127,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The access from the room to the balcony would be very scary if you had children or older people in the room as there appears to be a significant risk of tripping I was disappointed with the size of the balcony as I had envisaged sitting on it Disappointed the fridge wasn t working, Although we didn t use the facilities the gym and pool looked very good Staff at reception and concierge were helpful and polite Position for tube was good The hotel left a birthday card for me in the room with a decorated plate and cookies Easy access to an ice machine
42128,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, building works meant a slight detour to reach Pool and Gymnasium, Good sized room for London very close to REGENTS PARK and LONDON ZOO nice restaurants in Finchley and St Johns Wood area
42129,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Everything everyone was very helpful and accomdating My daughter was delighted when the staff had put a plate of cake in the room saying Happy birthday
42130,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Hotel was under refurbishment and waiting staff was very slow and un organised Took 20 minutes to get strawberry jam for the afternoon tea for 4 people , Reception staff was great clean rooms 
42131,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The hotel rooms are too expensive as is the whole of London , All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful We were the guests of the day which was an unexpected treat free parking and free breakfasts Good location next to Primrose Hill 
42132,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, the people in next had a very bad night fighting shouting early hours of morning , every body where very helpful pleasant hotel was very clean location just spot on 
42133,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The bed was too soft so I struggled to sleep but that is perhaps a personal preference , The staff were brilliant Very friendly and extremely helpful At one point during our stay my wife thought she had lost her handbag our fault not the hotel but the staff swung into action and searched high and low until we found it A very professional and friendly staff making all the difference to our stay Thank you I also like the swimming pool It is a nice size and perfect for playing with young children 
42134,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, perhaps I missed it but it wasn t until I arrived at the hotel that I found out it was undergoing refurbishment this meant most of the facilities were compromised in one way or another and overall it just felt like a second rate hotel that said the room was nice enough and the shower worked so for simply sleeping and washing it was fine we just had higher expectations , staff were friendly and helpful
42135,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, THE INTERNET It is not free I am travelling all over and a lot it is very strange that in LONDON where you can find free internet in every coffee shop the hotel that you are paying for will not have a free WIFI for its guests Something that HAS to change soon , It is the second time we are staying in this Hotel this time it was much better then last They are reforming the hotel so it is a great news breakfast was very nice staff was very nice and location or us is perfect 
42136,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, swimmingpool is very small and I cannot use the steam sauna on weekday , I Really satisfied kind staff delicious food and free wifi locate also not bad 
42137,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The hotel was in the middle of a refurbishment and it would have been nice to be informed of this Breakfast was average and they couldn t cater for my gluten free requests The rooms were dated and the view from the balcony was just onto a side wall , The staff were lovely and very helpful Super location in a nice part of London Easy walk to the Zoo and Camden 
42138,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Prices at the bar ridiculously expensive and as a result the bar was empty The hotel was undergoing refurbishment when we visited so obviously didn t see it at its best but nevertheless it s a good hotel to visit , Staff very helpful and friendly Rooms good plenty of space and impressive views of the city on upper floors Cleaned daily quickly and efficiently Breakfast good 
42139,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The bathroom was a bit small the changing rooms were a long way from the swimming pool when leaving you had to go down stairs when wet quite dangerous Noise from bathroom above and outside window , The beds pillows were comfy and the room was clean 
42140,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The hotel room was smaller than we d hoped a little stark but suited our needs Some of the hotel was showing signs of needing updating The steam room was a bit moldy the pool very murky , The staff were amazing Helpful courteous professional but still very friendly Breakfast was really good 
42141,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Hotel looks a little tired but has just started renovation works The pool area wasn t very relaxing on a Saturday morning when the club members and kids come to visit , Comfy rooms fairly good location close to the tube station
42142,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, There was one female member of staff in the restaurant that had limited English and didn t seem to listen or understand what we said which was slightly annoying when there were 6 of us trying to order our evening meal , The staff made us feel extremely welcome and nothing was too much trouble even down to giving us a bottle opener or supplying us with extra towels We had a family room with two double beds which was plenty big enough and very comfortable The food in the restaurant was amazing and most staff were very helpful The spa facilities were very clean and very much needed after a hectic day around London also very good that they stayed open until 11pm teenage daughters certainly made us of the spa facilities again after we had dined 
42143,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, This hotel is undergoing refurbishment and there were not seating areas other than the makeshift restaurant or in the main corridor We had an adjoining room door and the noise from next door was loud ,No Positive
42144,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and friendly we had booked the hotel for our friends birthday treat and the staff went out of their way to make it as special as possible 
42145,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Me an my kids were in the pool and noticed that someone had pooed in there And it happened two times in the time we were there And had to eat pou as there was nothing there for vegan and diary free , the rooms are nice and the location was just right 
42146,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Nothing, We were very pleased with everything They made us Guest of the day which was very pleasing We had free breakfast refreshments in our room and free parking Nico was particularly helpful and made our stay all the more pleasurable 
42147,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, It is currently undergoing a major renovation and we were not made aware of this The bar and restaurant area are temporary set up in an old conference room We were not told about this when booking , Great service at the front desk and in the bar restaurant Very comfy room Pool is a good size too 
42148,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, A very small negative that the room assigned wasn t ready when I went up It was spotted by concierge and told I could get another room but there was no rush on my part , Every single member of staff were helpful and friendly It had an incredibly warm atmosphere and the rooms so cosy Great Front of House but walking to my room housekeeping so polite and welcoming too 
42149,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Nothing not to like , Staff made us extremely welcome we had a weekend spa trip for 7 We had complimentary early check in and a late check out Would definitely recommend this hotel 
42150,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I booked for wifi access and I was disappointed when I couldn t sign on Even after that was fixed the internet signal could not stay longer than 30 minutes so I gave up on the internet I had paid for and used my mobile internet People kept interrupting our room for mistaken messages My sleep was disrupted 3 times even to the point where a staff member opened the door with their key card while we were inside , It was easy to check in the room was clean and comfortable
42151,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, There were works ongoing in part of the hotel which meant the main entrance had been moved Signage on the road for this was not very good it caused us to incur a waiting charge from one of our taxi drivers although I ll look to claim this back from the taxi firm , Friendly and helpful staff very willing to help and always with a smile We had a well appointed clean and comfortable room and thoroughly enjoyed our stay Location was very convenient for us as we were travelling to central London Camden Lock and Hendon during our stay all three were less than 30 minutes cab ride away 
42152,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Bottled water in the room I drink a lot of water, The overall comfort and friendliness of the staff and we re very obliging when certain things were requested
42153,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Facility is very old not clean all carpets ared flooring bathroom very old and dust everywhere not enough staff really I won t give more than 2 5 star defenitly not 4 star, Good location
42154,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Interior of hotel felt old and shabby and leisure centre was very strange changing rooms were down a corridor and a set of stairs away from the pool no direct access Frustrating that half the pool was roped off for swimming lessons until 2pm on a Sunday just when you want to relax and make the most of the facilities , Room was spacious beds were comfy Concierge was very helpful and room service great 
42155,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, My daughter and friends stayed here for her 21st birthday The staff were amazing She was upgraded and they made her room look beautiful cake too just perfect Thankyou very much She was thrilled x
42156,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Refurb is in progress but no real internal impact Had been very windy outside but would be nicer if the litter were to be removed in the garden below the balcony Also hope the balconies will be cleaned ahead or as part of the refurb as there was a fair pile of pigeon droppings on the divide between the balconies of rooms 528 and 529 just unsightly really still rate my stay as 10 out of 10 , Very nice friendly staff nice pool great location 
42157,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The service was terrible at breakfast The restaurant wasn t busy but we had to wait a long time to be seated eventually had to go and find someone to seat us then we waited a long time to be served and had to actually call someone over before we were acknowledged The assumption was made that we wanted a buffet even though there was a menu to order from We had to ask for the menu We had eggs benedict and oddly there was tarragon in the hollandaise sauce but no advance warning of this , The helpfulness if the staff at check in and check out 
42158,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Bad room service Not upto the rating of the hotel we came back to find no towels in the room we had to ask for our laundry 4 times to get it back even though it was in the hotel The receptionist kept telling my husband he didn t pay for the laundry although we did until finally they realized that we did , Friendly staff
42159,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Breakfast no fresh fruit only canned very poor coffee when requesting a latte or capacino cost extra despite breakfast included, Room spacious and comfortable
42160,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The foyer was being renovated and generally hotel looked a bit shabby in some areas Wifi was really expensive and I find it incredible that a few hotels still try and rip people off with this , Friendly staff and nice room Swimming pool and gym were very good 
42161,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The staff were great polite and attentive in the different areas of the hotel I travelled with children and they had a great time in the swimming pool The hotel is under refurbishment however is very good 
42162,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Great location near to Swiss Cottage underground very helpful staff great pool for our 9 year old girls We didnt eat at the hotel but great facilities nearby for eating out
42163,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The shower head in our room was broken and we didn t realise until we used it in the morning The air con was a little noisy and seemed to struggled to reduce the temperature Parking is 31 per 24hrs which isn t mentioned anywhere , The room was spacious and clean and the beds were comfortable Swiss Cottage Tube was within walking distance which made getting around very easy and simple Staff were very helpful and polite 
42164,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The waitress serving at the hotel when dining got our meal wrong quite a few times which we had to correct and then the final bill was wrong However the manager compensated fairly , Location good nice clean hotel Deluxe room v spacious for family with two young children Friendly polite staff 
42165,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Location is quite far out of centre and engineering works to tube on the weekend we stayed was frustrating but near Primrose Hill which is lovely Refurbishments were in progress which were slightly distracting and made access to the pool inconvenient, Lovely staff Good value and so good to have a balcony as standard
42166,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, If we had known that the hotel was undergoing refurbishment we would not have booked it The ambiance was very disappointing and in fairness the images and facilities portrayed were just not as advertised or fit for purpose The staff were obviously under a lot of pressure but were coping A disappointing way to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday I m afraid , The hotel was generally clean and tidy
42167,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Communal areas felt slightly dated Undergoing refurb which we were not made aware of on booking No proper bar restaurant due to refurb so make shift in conference room which was a disappointment Bar restaurant conference room too hot , Bedrooms nice Upgraded to free breakfast on arrival which was very nice Evening meal also lovely Staff accommodating
42168,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The hotel was undergoing a refurbishment that I was not aware of It spoilt the wow factor for my family The evening meal and drinks were very epxensive, The reception staff were very friendly and efficient as were the restaurant and leisure staff The swimming pool was great 
42169,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Nothing bad some renovations we weren t aware of but not a problem, Staff were brilliant made us feel very welcome and helped us celebrate our daughters birthday
42170,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Having a young family and going out to eat can be hard work but with an excellent restaurant in the hotel made life so much easier And a weekend break so memorable thank you
42171,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, For a family of 4 room was smallish but I guess space is a value in London We got used to the fact and had a greatntime Bathroom might need some renovations but that wasn t a problem aswell, proximity to all London attractions Camden market was close several tube stations to London city Breakfast bar was good and staff was very helpful and kind tomus 
42172,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, a parcel was left for us and the concierge did not do this when we were there However they sent it on to us once we got home and we received apologies once we had called the hotel , staff were fantastic for our family
42173,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The rooms were small and dated the bathroom what bathroom and as for the shower they still made use of the curtain which is vile and disgusting , The pool
42174,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We asked for the room to be decorated for a 21st bday however this was not done , We enjoyed the swimming pool and the timings were great as we got to use the facilities more also room service was very puntual 
42175,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The fact you have to pay for wifi not much entertainment in the room pay per view channels didn t have new films And for the price we payed there could of been alor more, The hotel was good We originally asked for a double bedroom and walked into a twin room which they changed for us and gave us a newly refurbished room It was clean and I loved the fact it had a balcony cause me and my partner smoke Staff were excellent 
42176,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, small thing ice machine wasnt working on our floor we rang on 2 days requesting ice both days it wasnt delivered, Staff at the reception were very help full when asking any qusetions 
42177,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Wifi in the rooms was very expensive but apart from that everything was so perfect and wonderful I wish we could ve stayed longer , Such luxury My 4 year old son and I had such a great stay Everything was perfect The hotel said we were guests of the day and gave us a free breakfast The breakfast was so delicious It was such an unexpected treat The swimming pool is fantastic and has a nice shallow part for kids 
42178,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The pictures on the website of the room were very deceiving The room was extremely small having stayed in other hotels around London we found the rooms very tight for space and no toweling robes were provided it said you would in the website In addition our tv speaker was broken , Staff were very polite
42179,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, We were visiting family in Swiss Cottage and it was situated perfectly Close to Regents Park for walks and Swiss Cottage Tube Station for easy access 
42180,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Bathroom was a little dated , Good Hotel with a nice indoor swimming pool that my kids liked 5min walk to Metro Breakfast was very good Overall a good choice for London weekend break 
42181,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The only down side is the room was not very sound proofed you can easily ear a lot of noise next door in the middle of the night , Location was excellent 5 mins from the tube Facillitis were a plus enjoying every bit of it Staffs were brillent best customer service In London 
42182,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, They gave us what seemed like 2 complementary bottles of water and then charged us for them The breakfast choice was poor compared to other hotels l have visited recently It was also very expensive and the staff were very grumpy , The room the surrounding area it has good facilities 
42183,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Shower in the room wasn t the greatest paying for wifi also My teenager wasn t to impressed having to travel back an forth from the lobby to our room, Good location close to tube station and generally ok area
42184,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We experienced theft from your hotel room 233 My wife s Gucci watch was in one of her bags in the closet and our ID Documents Drivers licence were also there in a secret pocket in her handbag and all items were stolen I followed up with the management and they are still investigating further I left checked out of the hotel five days earlier due to the treatment we experienced We require an urgent follow up and compensation from the CEO of Marriot Hotels We asked staff and they informed us that this particular hotel has a high rate of thefts on a weekly basis My family is very unhappy and devistated as we did not expect this type of unfortunate behaviour in this hotel, I liked the restaurant and the workers were all very professional
42185,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, It was lovely The staff were very on the ball and knew precisely what they were doing The pool was fantastic for my Son to practise in also Perfect for children Very friendly helpful On Christmas day even put little stockings on each of the doors Very cute Very clean Lovely stay 
42186,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We asked for interconnecting rooms and when we arrived were told we couldn t have them We were given rooms close together that were 30m apart and when I complained we were then moved to interconnecting rooms The whole thing was a farce and spoilt what was an otherwise lovely stay , The rooms were excellent as was the breakfast
42187,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, odd location for laisure and shopping Don t like the fact they charge so much for WiFi connection especially for frequent users , I know the place and like its location for business purposes
42188,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Afternoon tea wasnt great No one offered to refill tea Or if we needed any more sandwiches ect and for 20 00 a person I think we should of been and then was charged to eat in the bar hotel quite far away Nothing in walking distance , Some staff were very nice room was a lovely size maybe slightly over priced birthday card and cake a lovely touch 
42189,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, My only disappointment was poor shower pressure 3rd floor and decor on some floors is tired , Excellent friendly staff team 2 double beds as per US if only all hotels in UK were like this Great facilities parking for London hotel Good breakfast cleanliness 
42190,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The location was convenient close to tube station and close enough to Euston station to be able to use taxi close to Primrose Hill for restaurants Staff very helpful and friendly Loved the Christmas decorations at the hotel 
42191,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The corridors are looking drab and tired and there are insufficient lifts for when the hotel is busy , Loved having 2 double beds like America Staff were very helpful Facilities were a plus for a London Hotel as was on site parking The breakfast was very good 
42192,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, We stayed as it was located close to camden where we were having a birthday dinner for our daughter The staff overheard us talking about the birthday and arranged an amazing surprise for her when we got to the room 
42193,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Midges flies in the hotel bar and members of bar staff approaching us a total of 3 times as we had on drink in the bar to ask us whether we had checked in yet , comfortable beds
42194,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, A few things getting a bit tired, Overall very good a couple of things a bit tired had to go two floors to find a working ice machine Breakfast excellent Location brilliant for what we wanted Had requested a quiet room but given one on the road but wasn t too bad 
42195,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, All good, Every time we stay and it s always the same location the service is excellent and all the staff are polite and helpful can t wait to visit again 
42196,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, When we checked in we were made feel very welcome by the staff and then they gave us great news that we were guests of the day and received an upgrade with free wifi and breakfast It is central enough with an underground station not far away 
42197,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Slow service in the morning to try and get a coffee The bar had run out of prosecco when we wanted a pre dinner drink Slow service when trying to get drink at end of evening , Comfy beds
42198,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, 1 Paid for breakfast with reservation Went down for breakfast with family and waitress said You have NOT paid for breakfast do you still want to have breakfast All this in front of other guests Eventually had to show her my reservation on my phone to have breakfast , 1 Excellent location 2 Underground parking 3 Space in front of hotel for stopping with car 4 Very professional manager at reception on arrival 5 Fantastic leisure centre
42199,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Rooms were a little dusty in places noticed on the phones there was a layer of dust on it that could have been picked up There was a odd sewage smell from the pipes in our room when we came back in the evening it soon passed and didn t effect our stay but it s worth noting that they should have picked it up before we did , Swiming pool food and staff service was brilliant 
42200,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We checked in early so thought great Requested a king size room and booked a king size room with booking com however were given a twin room which was tired and shabby ceiling paper coming away from ceiling scuff marks on walls and told non were available Contacted booking com and this was mysteriously resolved but took an hour to resolve also no free wifi as was offered on the site Rooms were definitely not four star three star is acceptable only booked this hotel as we stayed many times at Marriott Panaji in Goa India but this hotel is a tad overpriced Also booking com at time of booking requested cash payment on arrival which on arrival i was told it must be paid on credit card of which i only had cash Maybe it was booking com giving false information It wasn t hotel from hell far from it but no way 4 , Breakfast buffet excellent Staff excellent and helpful
42201,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, N a, As soon as they found out it was my wife s 30th they gave us the car park complementary and also laid on deserts with a bday message and kids party bags for the kids and to round it off they supplied us with a bottle of wine sent to the room Thanks Tim
42202,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, The price is on the high side for regular business and the bar pricing is expensive meaning we went out rather than stay in the hotel , Helen on reception was lovely friendly and welcoming Couldn t do enough for us Comfy beds with great black out blinds to ensure a good nights sleep 
42203,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Location was not brilliant it s definitely more of the suburbs of London , The indian meal in the restaurant was fantastic Kids also enjoyed the pool
42204,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, Felt comfortable staying there with young children yet still a smart hotel The staff were all very friendly and helpful Short walk to a tube station ideal for exploring London with children The pool was also much appreciated by the kids 
42205,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Blackout blind off its track Floor lamp switch verging on dangerous for those with inquisitive children TV channel selection pretty poor reception dodgy No working fridge minibar Parking over priced, Swimming pool gymnasium and changing facilities are excellent Our room was huge if a little bit frayed around the edges Beds really comfy Bathroom clean Excellent service at a well stocked breakfast Good service and value for money food in the family friendly Bistro Taxis right outside the hotel staff will go and get you one if there aren t any immediately available St John s Wood Regents Park is a lovely area 
42206,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Room Service took for ever to bring a glass of coke and milk to room Milk in room was all gone off And there was not enough tea bags etc for us in room, Beds are comfy staff amazing Kids loved the pool Nice all round would recommend and will come back bc staff where great
42207,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The room was large and spacious We had 2 adults and 2 children and the accompanying luggage for a 4 week trip through England I didn t feel cramped
42208,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, So of the finishing touches in the room could have been done better and i could hear the house keeping in the corridors which woke me up, I like beds i had a very good nights sleep a love how many pillows i had
42209,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Reception staff were dreadful Not helpful or apologetic when given wrong rooms Quite rude and unhelpful Breakfast staff unhelpful too Not usual Marriott standard First room smelt badly of smoke and was a twin not a deluxe King as booked , Good location for the Roundhouse Rooms were clean 
42210,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I was a little disappointed with the parking fee of almost 30 to park overnight I ended up parking my car on a side street as I didn t want the additional charge , I liked the fact that it was relatively near to the M1 so finding it was not difficult neither was our trip extended by having to fight through London city traffic I also liked the size of the room The breakfast was particularly lovely 
42211,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, even though breakfast included in my reservation during check in and every morning before breakfast I was told by hotel staff that breakfast is not included in my reservation I had to say breakfast included in the total price and I already paid it to trough www booking com web site There was no slippers in the room Even though we were 3 we have never gotten 3 clean bath towels without asking for them The room was equipped with disabled stuff like tubular holding bars everywhere that I am not fan of it In the breakfast food wasn t Marriott class Actually this hotel isn t like a Marriott hotel but like a budget inn , check out was hassle free
42212,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Staff who choose not to speak to me make eye contact and ignore me However when my partner joined me to answer his questions immediately treatment to women is outrageous for London and 2015 Not the standard of service you d expect from a high end chain Very disappoint and offended won t be staying in a Marriott anywhere in the world again , The cleaning staff said hello The concierge Dave was fantastic as was Andrea on front of house unfortunately we only saw these staff as we were checking out 
42213,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, I booked this months ago with booking com and everything I asked for was 100 ignored Two beds in the quiet room on a high floor one bed in the room on the 2nd floor near the lift The fact is the check in staff do NOTHING until you arrive and then give you whatever is left That s the problem with booking com, Nothing much
42214,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We stayed two nights and on the Sunday night there was lots of banging and noise coming from the loading bay at the front of the building we could not close the doors as the air conditioning made a screaming noise Business centre had no toner in printer and only one computer worked Room was not cleaned when we arrived back after 6pm in evening Manager was rude and insulting when issues were raised ,No Positive
42215,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, We were moved to the fourth floor but the first floor rooms above and near function rooms should be the last rooms to be filled to avoid possible complaints especially when loud events are on The spiral stair case to the pool is not ideal especially with wet feet but I guess there is no alternative If breakfast is included in the room rate it s ok but 25 for breakfast is ridiculous That s 100 for 4 Try the cafe around the corner , Front desk staff were helpful Jeff but not enough staff at busy times Event staff Sandy and Jheannel were very helpful and efficient 
42216,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, if i had one complaint it would be that food in the hotel was a little on the expensive side, excellent location for our needs close to tube and only a 20 min walk to Camden market gym facilities were quite impressive
42217,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, There were three of us in the room and friend of mine was arriving later Once she was at the reception she stated my name I was making the booking and hers in order to get the key and room number The staff member told her that there are no quests under this name and was quite rude after calling me numerous time I was at the spa she received the key I must stay the lady on check out was very friendly though , The room was spacious and quite clean the location is good
42218,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, Was quite pricey but I guess it s London , Very friendly staff Useful car park especially good for the middle of London Lovely room with king size bed Great facilities
42219,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park, At the time of our stay roadworks near to the hotel with numerous closed junctions frustrated our initial approach as we had no route map or GPS in the car Fortunately the closeness of the tube station overcame that problem We also found that the fridge in our room was empty Our grandson was agravated to find this but maybe it was a benefit in disguise to us , We enjoyed the facilities of the hotel the room and the meals taken The location close to an underground tube station was especially convenient We were able to leave our car unused for our whole stay inside the hotel car park which was particularly appreciated 
42220,London Marriott Hotel Regents Park,No Negative, The customer service was excellent Staff were really friendly the room was lovely and breakfast was delicious A bottle of wine cake and nuts sent up to the room for my friends birthday Brilliant
