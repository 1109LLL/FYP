7961,InterContinental London Park Lane, the shower curtains is too easy to leak to the bathroom floor even if you put it into the tube it still leak , The room is very clean and the facility is very thoughtful
7962,InterContinental London Park Lane, Changing the club lounge rules especially removing the complimentar access for royal ambassadors members , Staff Location The club lounge Breakfast

7964,InterContinental London Park Lane,No Negative, The brochure in the room stated breakfast until noon However it finished at 11 so we missed out It cost a lot more to have breakfast included on the room rate so was not happy 
7965,InterContinental London Park Lane, Been stopped by the door man and asked to produce our room keys to prove we were stopping there Stereotyping due to tattoos , Beautiful hotel with large stylish rooms Super fast service at reception 
7966,InterContinental London Park Lane, Well Although I liked my breakfast it was not included in the room charge , I like the bed and large pillows especially All is good except the room is a bit small 
7967,InterContinental London Park Lane, Avoid the dingy standard rooms facing the courtyard Soviet style views dated and worn furnishings and subpar luxury , High Tea was very exquisite and memorable Bar and restaurant staff beyond reproach Concierge was exceptional and arranged the best theatre tickets in the house on such short notice The upgraded superior rooms facing Hyde Park definitely worth the price for the added space and views Club Intercontinental the perfect atmosphere and setting for breakfast and cocktails 
7968,InterContinental London Park Lane, The Intercontinental breakfast was kind of limited in terms of options especially for the price charged In the room the espresso machine didn t work or I couldn t find out how , Helpful staff busy lobby great location proximity to the tube stations hyde park
7969,InterContinental London Park Lane, I have stayed here occasionally over 5 years The breakfast which used to be quite special has now become appalling The cups and saucers have gone to be replaced by the standard holiday inn mugs The magnificent buffet has gone and replaced with meagre pre laid fruit dishes and not a lot of choice of any thing else There used to be an omelette area that s gone too For warm food you have to choose off Theo Randall s Italian breakfast menu at mouth watering prices If the food we had was a reflection don t even bother The fried rosti tasted like a brick Service too was underwhelming forgotten orders wrong orders etc and the experience all in all very poor If this is IHG s flagship hotel in London then unfortunately the 5 star experience they want you to have in the rest of the hotel is not matched by the breakfast I guess it has been done to make more money with fewer costs Go across to the Serpentine caf for a better breakfast Also there are also currently no toilets on the ground floor except those at the back of the restaurant above which involve a flight of stairs for both gents and ladies So beware if you are not so mobile We will pack our bags and move on to other accommodation next time in London in the future , Excellent location near Hyde Park and Oxford Street Friendly staff

7975,InterContinental London Park Lane,No Negative, Everything as should be Exellent location Very friendly staff smiley faces all over the hotel They offer you the help without asking Very clean room luxurious room very comfortable bed Taxis available all round clock Hyde Park Corner Underground Station is next door Main attraction in London is in walking distance Hyde Park Green Park Harrods Oxford Street Buckingham Palace Marble Arch London eye 
7976,InterContinental London Park Lane, The bathroom requires minor maintenance repairs attention to the sink plug hole to keep water in and the hand shower in the bath needs attention due to a heavy leak when in use , I did not have time to use the hotel facilities for a one night stay however the bar service and staff in the lobby area was excellent 
7977,InterContinental London Park Lane, My over all experience was just a disappointment the room quality was less than satisfactory because the view was horrid and it was poorly lit the food was below average it took an hour and twenty minutes to bring up a pair of scissors the hotel was grossly over priced for nothing other than the name it carries extremely disappointed with my stay , The concierge service was excellent Comfortable bed and pillows Very clean over all The bellman was lovely
7978,InterContinental London Park Lane, I was promised another room with a better view but when I checked later there was nothing in the system about it BUT when Karem the night manager heard about it he immediately contacted me and came him self to my room to make it right, room size attention from staff especially Karem the night manager
7979,InterContinental London Park Lane, 1 Bed quality is poor King size bed is simply 2 singles joined Pillow choice and mattress is poor 2 No free wifi 3 Room size not great for price, 1 Excellent location walking distance to most places and tube bus stops nearby 2 Staff were helpful
7980,InterContinental London Park Lane, They didnt clean my room for 2 days even though i called them to confirm about cleaning and tidying the room Also i didnt have the Clean My room door hanger nor the don t disturb one ,No Positive
7981,InterContinental London Park Lane, I was disappointed with the Spa you could only use it if you paid for a treatment We only wanted to go in for half an hour to freshen up but were unable to do so , The hotel is excellent and in a great location All of the staff were very friendly and breakfast was very nice 
7982,InterContinental London Park Lane, They didn t clean the room one day Had to call 4 times for someone to bring shampoo Ordered Croissants to my room at 7 00 am and they were dry , Friendly staff nice breakfast menu beautiful hotel
7983,InterContinental London Park Lane, This hotel needs to match the breakfast to the quality of the hotel , The breakfast is very poor quality and the service terrible The food was like transport cafe food Dreadful quality And at 100 00 for 4 Shocking 
7984,InterContinental London Park Lane, Our iron in the room didn t work Not a big deal but I would have like to run it over my dress before dinner , The rooms are lovely we were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful as our stay was for my husbands 40th birthday This made it extra special
7985,InterContinental London Park Lane,No Negative, Amy on reception was brilliant and went out of her way to make our stay perfect We even got a complimentary cake delivered to our room as we were celebrating our 10th anniversary Thanks to all the staff 
7986,InterContinental London Park Lane, I asked for early check in but the room was not ready and we had to wait a while , The staff treated us like old friends and were helpful without being overbearing I took my car which was parked overnight without any problems 
7987,InterContinental London Park Lane, The room was below expectations Although we had a superior king room which should normally have a view it overlooked the back street When we asked the staff to give us a new room the response was that the hotel was too full Having booked a month earlier i dont believe they didnt give us a view room either bc of our late arrival or bc we booked through booking com For this price there are many other hotels which can provide better accomadations within the vicinity It was a definete disappointment on our part My advice is either pay a bit more and prefer 4 seasons or pay a bit less and stay at the hilton They re all 100meters away from each other Having stayed in all of those this was the worst vfm , The location was good
7988,InterContinental London Park Lane, Nothing perfect stay , Not only was the hotel of a luxurious standard what else would you expect of a five star on Park Lane but it was the attitude of the staff who really made our trip extra special Upon arrival I mentioned that it was our 10th wedding anniversary and asked if there was a chance of a complimentary upgrade Luckily they weren t full so we got a lovely upgrade to an exec room which was super spacious and a free late check out Not only that when we returned from our meal out the reception manager had organised for a beautiful chocolate gateaux and bottle of red wine to be in our room on the house Such a classy move considering we were already more than happy with the upgrade and really made our trip even more special Considering we re not your average five star hotel clientele I was so impressed by the intercontinental s approach to treating us like VIP S you made our anniversary so memorable and we ll definitely return again 
7989,InterContinental London Park Lane, My biggest issue with the hotel were the other guests Rarely have I spent so much time around so many affected rude and ignorant individuals Yes the hotel costs a few quid yes you need a bit of money to stay there but quite why people feel that makes them better then the staff working there is beyond me The rudeness and arrogance of my fellow guests was almost enough to ruin my stay , Undoubtedly a luxurious hotel excellent facilities and a great gin menu The hotel is perfectly located to explore many of the capital s best known landmarks and shopping streets on foot 
7990,InterContinental London Park Lane, Breakfast a little frantic restocking of bowls for fresh fruit and even butter at the breads table, Great location helpful polite and well trained staff although the breakfadt room melee and staff involved were a little less well organised
7991,InterContinental London Park Lane, Nothing none, I m very pleased that we choose to stay at Intercontinental London park lane this time me and my sister loved every thing about it we were feeling most welcome everyday every moment I already rated the property 10 but what I really wanted to mention here is the concierge Micheal Petar and the others were so helpful too but those guys manage to find us bookings in no time in the most wanted places restaurants opera etc We felt so spoiled this time thanks to them I totally recommend this hotel the location is amazing to the breakfast buffet is almost similar to our Hotels in the Gulf very tasty with lots of choices not only an English breakfast like any other hotel We are totally booking in it again 
7992,InterContinental London Park Lane, The rooms soundproofing is not very good because sometimes I hear sounds coming from the rooms while I am walking to my room , Everything is perfect The reception rooms cleanliness and the staff i really recommend this hotel 
7993,InterContinental London Park Lane, Very small amount of milk in room we had to ask for coffee pods too , Excellent breakfast and good service Very comfortable room and bed Personal touch of card and cake for anniversary Proximity to St James Park and Buckingham Palace for a walk the morning after our celebration dinner 
7994,InterContinental London Park Lane, The room was too small and messy there was no cabinets to put our staff in except one tiny one and the rest were without keys to be able to open it The toilet was too small and there was a blockage in the bacenet and the water was not going down We ordered club sandwich the presentation of the sandwich was very bad as if I ordered it from a grocery and not from a famous hotel like intercontinental The taste was disgusting I swear I wanted to vomit after I ate the first bite Our stay in that hotel was like a night mare and instead of the staff helping us after all what we faced after a long journey they charged us for 591 instead of 561 for that night , This was the worse experience for me ever i didn t like anything in the hotel and I checked out from the second day and shifted to another hotel
7995,InterContinental London Park Lane, Air conditioning a bit noisy , Friendly staff great location good size room clean lovely comfy bed good facilities and a great Bloody Mary in the cocktail bar

7999,InterContinental London Park Lane, Bus stop is at 2 minutes walk to Hilton H No supermarkets nearby , everything was great the staff are very helpful and kind breakfast was limited in choices but yummy 
8000,InterContinental London Park Lane, Room was too hot both windows open heating low as we could get it so hot my partners asthma was set off and he was up all night as he couldn t lie down had to have water from minibar to cool himself The receptionist let us have the water and advised us that next time to call reception to help, Big pillows and breakfast
8001,InterContinental London Park Lane, Our room was very warm even with A C and didnt have the best view The Mini Bar in the fridge was VERY expensive 3 50 for a KitKat and 5 for a 500ml bottle of water though I guess that the majority of Patrons wouldnt have to worry about the cost of water The Buffet style Breakfast was also a bit of a farce no information given as to whether we helped ourselves gave an order etc and there were lots of children running around Also some of the staff need to be more aware of their non verbal communication , Location and the Chap who s name I sadly forget on Reception was very friendly and made us feel relaxed 
8002,InterContinental London Park Lane, 10 for two small bottles of water was a bit steep given everything else is excellent value Could hear the guest next door easily at night , Location service and hotel atmosphere amazing Gym looked excellent but not used Five star Checked us in early 11am was fantastic and accommodated us when we were late for breakfast excellent service both times

8006,InterContinental London Park Lane,No Negative, Everything was great on my recent stay in that hotel and all was up to perfect in terms of the staff and the exotic services and facility provided by the hotel also location is fabulous One thing I would like to mention about my experience with that hotel i made my booking through hotel booking web site and it was non refundable one month and a half before my Arrival so when I have checked the price of the room I have booked later in the site I found cheaper than the price I booked my room for so I made I contact the hotel booking customer service and explain the matter and they have respond immediately to my request and sent a notification to the reservation department in intercontinental park lane hotel and thay agreed right away to modify it and they sent me a new booking confirmation with the new price offered in the website I appreciate that so much and proof to me that is hotel booking is the best choise to book my hotel in my future trip 
8007,InterContinental London Park Lane, Room and in particular the bathroom is a tight squeeze for 2 people and from this perspective I don t think the hotel offers good value for money We also experienced extremely poor service at the Arches Bar which given that we were out celebrating a special occasion affected our evening and would be enough to say we wont be returning , Great location good valet service clean hotel and pleasant breakfast
