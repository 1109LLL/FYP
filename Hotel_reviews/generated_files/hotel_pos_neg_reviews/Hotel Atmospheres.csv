132134,Hotel Atmospheres, very less variety for breakfast and 16 euros too much for that when you can get more variety from outside cafes and less cost too , We have stayed in the suite and it was absolutely amazing very large bathroom and good size room too The location the hotel is very comfortable the staff always acknowledged you with a smile and very helpful the rooms catered for all your needs like complimentary tea and coffee etc and the large bed was to die for after walking all day 
132135,Hotel Atmospheres, Very small room which was configured inconveniently perhaps it is ok as a single room but for 2 persons it is not convenient Furthermore there is a separate toilet box more appropriate for a submarine not recommended for claustrophobics , Excellent location extremely friendly and efficient staff very clean internet better than in average room equipment boiler coffee tee

132138,Hotel Atmospheres, Nothing , Situated in center of Paris near Notre Dame cathedral excellent location real value for four star hotel Very friendly inside very quiet Parking Very pleasant holiday 
132139,Hotel Atmospheres, The size of the rooms are small and we had a superior double The window looks out onto a man made terrace , The hotel is in a good location within walking distance of metro trains shops as well as a range of bars and restaurants 
132140,Hotel Atmospheres, Breakfast just OK for 16 Euros Baguette and croissants not good by Paris standards Good fruit salad and cheese meat selection , Good location Near metro Lively area with good restaurants nearby Not too touristy Helpful staff 
132141,Hotel Atmospheres, We booked a family room but for three persons it was quite small The wellness facility is somewhat basic We didn t have breakfast because we thought it was overpriced Instead went to a cafe around the corner , This is a good looking hotel in a nice neighbourhood of Paris Staff were very friendly Wifi was fast Rooms were clean In the streets surrounding there a lots of nice cafes and shops and a good food market see pics Panth on is around the corner 
132142,Hotel Atmospheres, We had a room with twin beds more spacious but don t like twin beds Bath would have been nice in freezing cold, Decor of hotel very cool Breakfast expensive but very nice variety Staff very friendly and helpful
132143,Hotel Atmospheres, Room was a little to compact ratio of furnishings to floor area and had no bedside table , Clean comfortable modernised hotel in arrondissement 5 close the many restaurants and the major universities south of the Seine Good connections on Metro Lines 7 Jussieu and 10 Maubert Mutualit 
132144,Hotel Atmospheres, The wash bathing was a bit small but the rest of the bathroom was very nice , I was surprised by our room next to the elevator being so quiet Loved it that the Starbucks was only 200 m away 
132145,Hotel Atmospheres, it has less charm than some other hotel on the entrance but it is actually very practical so at the end of the day all good if they give you the right bedroom, great comfort can be little noisy but you can have a bedroom you wont see else where depending what you choose
132146,Hotel Atmospheres, The price of the room and the breakfast were little bit expensive , The room was clean and well designed The lights were great The products offered in the shower was wonderful The reception was great 
132147,Hotel Atmospheres, Breakfast was not worth the price for what was offered , Beds were big and comfortable and staff was very friendly and helpful Can t wait to go back 
132148,Hotel Atmospheres, hotel claims to have wheelchair facilities No way you could maneuver a wheelchair in the jr suite that we had Also you have to borrow the iron from reception none in the room , the room was comfortable and clean good location staff are friendly and housekeeping service is very good
132149,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, Friendly staff who ensured that everything was going well Great location for a short time away visiting all the sites as it was near to a metro but not in a very tourist area that it was always noisy and busy 
132150,Hotel Atmospheres, Check in was not ideal because they asked for a deposit for a voltage converter but did not have change for 50 euros or accept a credit card Also they forgot to give me the internet code and receptionist was outside so I could not call down to obtain but rather had to walk , Very comfortable room with ample space a balcony and exposed stone walls Vaulted sloped ceilings helped to create a cozy ambiance Excellent proximity to all parts of town and wonderful daytime morning staff who will turn on the sauna for just one 
132151,Hotel Atmospheres, The underground parking is extremely tight and difficult to park in High risk of damaging your car It should be a lot cheaper due to this Slow elevator The self service Honesty bar is really cool but too expensive , Very sweet friendly and helpful staff The manager even helped me personally by coming along in my car to give directions to re park it Would have been lost in Paris without her That is what I call service The rooms are small but very stylish cosy quiet clean and romantic Good bed Good breakfast Great location One of the better hotels I ever stayed at Would stay there again for sure 
132152,Hotel Atmospheres, The room was very compact the toilet cubicle was tiny just enough room to sit down Had to ask for the coffee sugar to be refilled in the room Available coffee and cake downstairs but the coffee was cold and when we asked for a fresh one they offered to microwave the coffee The gym is tiny consisted of a treadmill a bike and some light free weights , Great location for sightseeing Easy to get to places of interest Staff were extremely helpful and friendly Attractive hotel decor interior 
132153,Hotel Atmospheres, Rooms a bit on the small side although this seems to be the norm for Paris , Staff were their greatest asset Very helpful and knowledgeable Great artistic decoration bold use of colour in rooms 
132154,Hotel Atmospheres, No hot water last day there and that was tough , Room was small but great bathroom Day staff was great Very helpful and spoke English which was very nice 
132155,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, The staff the location how easy it was to get there from the airport the room upgrade we liked all of that and everything went really well I already booked this hotel for my next trip to Paris 
132156,Hotel Atmospheres, Luxury suite wasn t that luxury no natural light into the room and was more like a strange duplex style room , Great location in the heart of Paris 
132157,Hotel Atmospheres, As the nights are warming up a top sheet on the bed would have made things more comfortable as a full doona is not necessary , Very conveniently located clean and attentive staff we would stay there again 
132158,Hotel Atmospheres, Location, Great location It is a lovely property in and old Beaux Arts building refurbished tastefully I would stay there again and recommend it to others It is not in one of the main tourist areas which is part of its charm 
132159,Hotel Atmospheres, We had asked the reception to book a taxi 8 seater for us from the hotel to train station Sad to say we were extremely overcharged , Overall a good experience The reception staff was good and very helpful 
132160,Hotel Atmospheres, Room a bit small shower looked clean but smelled a bit like mold Breakfast was a bit strange from a set up standpoint and a bit limited , Lobby area location decor bathroom shower facilities 
132161,Hotel Atmospheres, The room was quite warm and the central AC didn t seem to help much even after talking to the front desk An open window did the trick though , The location is great only a short walk from several sights like the Notre Dame and the Pantheon The room we had was rather compact but in top condition and very clean as was the hotel overall Beds were comfortable and the WiFi was very fast We didn t have time to try out the hotel sauna unfortunately 
132162,Hotel Atmospheres, The stuff ana they change my room to be suit because that they treat with my infant as an adult and the room should be for three people not two, The location not bad
132163,Hotel Atmospheres, The entry door to the hotel is not evident We walked down to the next hotel and then the opposite way before we found the entry door it looks like a window , Great location Short walk to parking garage outdoor market with cheese fruits and vegetables meats flowers local items Notre Dame Located near a small grocery store across the street and several restaurants and cafes Breakfast was delicious and constantly fresh Staff were constantly refilling items before the items were finished Bathroom toiletries were a good brand 
132164,Hotel Atmospheres, Because I stay in hotel 150 Nights a year for the past 19 years I have been spoiled by Western International hotels The rooms here are small small which is typical for Paris but hard for two people to move around No amenities to speak of pretty bare bones stay Not even phone in room no room service no bar or restaurant But hey you re in Paris, The Location was excellent Felt Safe and Rooms over all clean Staff was helpful 
132165,Hotel Atmospheres, Room was small but then isn t every hotel room in Paris and there was a bit of dust on some of the surfaces , Staff very friendly and helpful everyone we spoke to had a smile which is unusual for Paris Bed was very comfy location excellent for seeing sites of St Germain and around Great wine bar 5e CRU about 5min walk away 
132166,Hotel Atmospheres, Not great value for money Cramped room for a suite Apparently it sleeps 4 people Yes there are beds for 4 people but there is no way you could comfortably move around the room with that many Beds were also quite hard and uncomfortable, Great location Staff were nice and helpful
132167,Hotel Atmospheres, Extremely small room not even enough space to lay basic luggage on the floor Not a whole lot of breakfast options and they seemed to be running out of everything all the time Paris isn t the cheapest city in Europe but still felt a bit pricey for the quality , Nice location A a lot of restaurants nearby and a good homebase for exploring the city Friendly staff
132168,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, We are a family of 4 kids aged 12 10 We stayed in a superior room that was 2 floors Where can you get that kind of space in a Paris The beds were extremely comfortable we had 2 bathrooms The hotel location is honestly perfect The Pantheon is 1 5 blocks away Notre Dame is less than 2 minutes it is ideally situated around the corner from the Metro stop Lastly the staff was very kind helpful We will definitely stay here on our next visit to Paris 
132169,Hotel Atmospheres, The shower head was a little to low for my husband and unfortunately the showers head did not adjust to a higher height , The hotel was so convenient for the centre of Paris and only five minutes from Notre Dame Bed was so comfy and had lovely nights sleep We were on the sixth floor and looked on to the street but there was hardly any noise Reception staff were very polite and helpful 
132170,Hotel Atmospheres, Room was very hot at night and the air con didn t go any lower than 17 C , Very helpful staff gorgeous decor very clean super centrally located 
132171,Hotel Atmospheres, Mr TALEB the receptionest the way he talk about the very small room we have even I offer to bay for bigger room but he refused saying next time it s better to book through our site on the net Luckily the booking was for one night the second day i moved to better 4 star hotel with larger room breakfast included and even city tax included But Mr Taleb ask for it even booking reservation said tax include , Location was not bad
132172,Hotel Atmospheres, The spa is very basic but we were not in Paris to visit a spa , Arguably the best position in Paris in terms of accessibility to so many historic places and good bars and restaurants even if there are also some rather tacky looking touristy eateries in the vicinity The tone of the hotel was generally civilised and peaceful 
132173,Hotel Atmospheres, Due to compactness of room no side table but used a shelf instead Not a big deal , Lovely boutique stylish hotel close to Maubert Metro and very close to Latin Quarter and Notre Dame too Central yet quiet Room had loads of sockets usually have to pull out charger to dry hair but ample to choose from 
132174,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, Fantastic hotel with very friendly and helpful staff Perfect location with all the necessary shops restaurants bars metro 24 7 supermarket across the street or all Within a stones throw from the hotel What more could you want We spent Valentine s weekend at the hotel and we couldn t have asked for a better stay Close to all main attractions highly recommend
132175,Hotel Atmospheres, They decided to charge 9 EUR for a simple breakfast rather than 15 EUR That s an improvement considering that across the street you can get a reasonable breakfast for 8 5 EUR , The location is excellent and the newly remodeled rooms are quite comfortable for Paris anyway 
132176,Hotel Atmospheres, Size of the room was not particularly huge and the working place on the table due to that was also limited, The location the ambiance the closeness of good restaurants the facilities including sauna and some sport equipment the staff etc Many things are build on the trust e g breakfast or bar and this is extremely pleasant 
132177,Hotel Atmospheres, Wifi was not reliable Only complaint , Though small the rooms are nice comfy and very clean Location is also great close to metro close to notre dame cathedral lots of caf s and restaurants very close by 
132178,Hotel Atmospheres, We had a bit of a frosty reception by one lady receptionist but other than that our stay was delightul We normally stay at t select hotel in the Latin quarter which we love and it s a little closer to the Latin quatre , The pillows were amazingly soft our bed was a super King and very comfty indeed The reception men were very delightful and attentive we asked for an ice bucket two nights in a row to cool our champagne we had bought in t Latin quarter and got it strait away Fresh fruit was on offer each morning free of charge by the reception desk The rooms are lovely and clean as is all of the hotel We stayed with our 5year old son and we felt very safe and comfortable in the hotel atmosphere we would stay here again 
132179,Hotel Atmospheres, Staff prices facilities We were overcharged by booking com but the hotel would not make any adjustments They say it is booking com s fault but booking com say it is the hotel who give them the rates Our room was for 3 persons but all facilities were for 2 Cups glasses Coffee tea etc If a question was raised with the staff an answer was never received despite promises to get an answer No courtesy in this hotel Treated like a second rate citizen No parking despite booking it so had to stay in a multi story a short drive away My advice find another hotel there are plenty to choose from, Near to Notra dame
132180,Hotel Atmospheres, Nothing to say here , The concierge took a LOT of time helping us with restaurants and sightseeing tips In general very very pleasant staff Very cute and cozy room just under the roof 
132181,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, Reception staff were helpful when we arrived and departed The location was very good for the Latin Quarter with Notre Dame and Pantheon within walking distance 
132182,Hotel Atmospheres, bit noisy room not from road as windows are doubleglazed there was always some kind of tiny noise wich hardly can hear day time but very loud at night was it from heating cant tell at all Cleaners are good changing linens and towels and toileteries regulary but do not taking care of dust as out furniture was dark colour its very easy to see that dust is not taken regulary breakfast is expensive we had it once only also didnt like that wc room and bathroom is separated , Location is excellent centre of Sait Germain close to all restaurants and touristic places apprx 7 min walk to Notre Dome Our room was good in a dark colours and red bathroom Looks new and cosy staffs are great and welcoming Wifi connection is good 
132183,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, The staff could not have been nicer Great location Great bed The room was stylish and well lit Although it was very small unlike similar elsewhere even NYC it had a wonderful large shower We had a small balcony a peek into other rooms suggested that possibly some rooms are larger but don t have the balcony The Latin Quarter is the Greenwich Village of Paris Or Berkeley per Sorbonne being here There is much in the way of cafes we didn t try the hotel breakfast less of the high end eating shopping than other neighborhoods Very convenient to art museums Notre Dame Ste Chappelle Pantheon Luxembourg Gardens Don t miss the nearby Saint Severin church We were surprised by how terrific French ice cream and sorbets are Ask the concierge where to get the very best 
132184,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, This really was a lovely hotel The location was perfect The staff made us feel very welcome and were very helpful The rooms were fairly small which is to be expected of city centre hotels however it was perfect for what we needed It was very modern and most importantly very clean We would certainly stay here agin 
132185,Hotel Atmospheres, I know Paris hotel rooms are small this was our 4th trip but the size of this one given the rather high price even after the substantial genius discount was very disappointing You could just barely go around the bed Bed was very hard i realize it is subjective whether this is perceived as positive or negative Carpet floor Strange safe closure where you have to use a credit card or similar with a magnetic strip to close and open it it is exactly these cards that i am trying to keep safe and not carry around with me Cleaning staff ignored do not disturb sign on door , Location location location The shower 
132186,Hotel Atmospheres, Room could be larger but as far as I know small rooms are standard in Paris hotels, Good location a few nice restaurants and metro station nearby clean and cosy hotel
132187,Hotel Atmospheres, noise from the cleaners early in the morning so couldn t sleep after 8am receptionists not the nicest and not helpful when I asked for recommendations of places to eat , very pretty and clean room small but not bad at all well located and free wifi
132188,Hotel Atmospheres, The room is small and for the price I paid you would expect more The room smelled of sewage when i got in late that was fixed the next day after I told the staff , Nice location very near metro station I had the room next to the lift with no noise relief 
132189,Hotel Atmospheres, Extremely small room even for Parisian hotel black walls in a room and in a hotel made it feel so dark and gloomy In a room there was an odd peace of furniture a broken iron chair like an electric chair or something it was spooky The toilet in a room was so small even for a small person like me not a propre door in to it just a sliding door , The location was good It was quiet Nice shower 
132190,Hotel Atmospheres, Nothing , Great location Friendly and helpful staff Comfortable beds and everything we needed in the room Has character felt like we were in Paris 
132191,Hotel Atmospheres, The Heating wasn t working in the room and they couldn t do anything about it The sheets were not changed next day and smelled very bad the second night,No Positive
132192,Hotel Atmospheres, We had a junior suite which was good to have the extra room but I think maybe it took from the bedroom as the bedrrom and bathroom were tiny I think next time we would go for one of the larger double rooms , Fabulous location within walking distance to Paris sights and great local restaurants Very clean city boutique hotel breakfast room pleasant and breakfast good value 
132193,Hotel Atmospheres, The bathroom was terrible It flooded when taking a shower Small washing table No space to put our stuff Not design at all not comfortable Small bedroom not what we expected from a superior room , Very good breakfast good location 
132194,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, Wonderful location within walking distance of Notre dame the Louvre Saint Germain de pres and tons of excellent restaurants and shops nearby The hotel is beautifully designed and all the staff were very helpful and professional Would definitely stay again 
132195,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, Fabulous location fabulous eateries turn right out of hotel and right again towards Notre Dame and there is a very reasonable supermarket and bakery We bought from here and took food sightseeing Would definitely stay again 
132196,Hotel Atmospheres, Buffet Breakfast was very expensive considering that there was not much to choose from We had breakfast at a local cafe which was considerably cheaper The room was very small We chose a standard double room so if you like more space it might be worthwhile choosing a larger room , The hotel is in an excellent location within walking distance to Luxembourg Gardens the Pantheon and restaurants The staff were friendly particularly Taleb who was very helpful The bed and pillows were comfortable and the room was nice and clean We would definitely stay here again 
132197,Hotel Atmospheres, To be fair room was a bit tried needed a bit paint and a good dust had deluxe suite expected bit more for 400 euro a night, Hotel and area that it was in good
132198,Hotel Atmospheres, Not much space in each room or any hooks for clothes in the bathroom but apart from that it was very good Poor lighting on stairs corridors unless your eyesight is excellent common trend for black everywhere isn t safe , Good location for exploring the Latin Quarter Very helpful staff Nicely designed rooms
132199,Hotel Atmospheres,No Negative, The name of the hotel is fully correspondence with its environment it is very stylish and has its own atmosphere Rooms are nice clean new and cozy Bathroom equipment is exceptional it is even includes rain shower Location is perfect too only 7 minutes walk to Notre Dame de Paris metro is also very close 2 min walk as well as numerous shops and restaurants We really enjoyed our stay there 
132200,Hotel Atmospheres, We booked a Junior suite for 3 people the room was small and third bed was pull out sofa bed in the second room so it left the living space very tight Also breakfast should be included for the price you pay but we enjoyed getting fresh bread and pastries from local bakery s instead , Location was excellent Less then 5 mins from Notre Dame Complimentary tea coffee and biscuits in the afternoon in the lobby is a lovely touch Very clean hotel with modern decor Lovely powerful shower 
132201,Hotel Atmospheres, The comfort of the bed was not great and the sink does not allow you to wash your face properly due to the design Breakfast was not worth the 16 euro charge , We enjoyed the cleanliness of the room and the free wifi Room fittings are also new and the decor is modern 
132202,Hotel Atmospheres, Very small room for three people we got deluxe double except suite , Great location for walking all sights Quite and no touristic area Very comfortable bed Cool bathroom Good to have tea coffee staff in the room
