378209,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Everything was just great at the hotel except for their policy of requiring euros 25 per day for Internet access This is unheard of in major hotels around the world Like in airports it s free With at most only high speed Wi Fi is charge for,No Positive
378210,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The staff are so rude Totally not a 5 star treatment they didn t care about ur comfort as much as money They blocked an amount on my credit card without my authorization even though I paid everything in advice and told them to never use my credit card but they said that they calculated the room price wrong so they had to block an amount without my authorization So so so cheap and rude I ve never experienced such poor treatment in a 5 star hotel Hated it never again , The size of the room 
378211,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Wi Fi should be free , The staff is very friendly and helpful The location is superb being close to beach and 5 min walk to metro The facility is also very well kept and comfortable The breakfast buffet is delicious with many options The Wi Fi works perfect but cost 25 euro a day 
378212,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The reception staff made me feel uncomfortable and weren t very friendly When you pay so expensive to stay in a hotel we didn t expect 45 a night parking and we didn t expect to pay 25 a day wifi Also for a simple small glass of juice around the pool worked out at 10 and an alcoholic drink almost 30 , I liked the cleanliness and pool staff of the hotel The beds were really comfortable and the beach and clubs couldn t of been closer however the clubs were underground so no noise bothered you of a night 
378213,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The buffet bfast was a bit too expensive i think , We were given a really good room beautiful view of the city and the beach Pool was good size not small The staff were all friendly and attentive to our needs We felt special We were brought a bottle of wine for my Mum s birthday It was def a treat Bfast buffet has good variety of options There are nearby Metro and Bus stops which you can take to get to central The beach is only few minutes walk And there are plent of restaurants walking distance If you wanta treat it s def good place to be 
378214,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Property could use a small face lift The common areas looked a bit worn perhaps 1 2 years past their prime but still perfectly acceptable This could also be said for the carpet in the room This is somewhat of picky issue but when you stay at 4 5 5 star hotels you tend to notice all the details Also the area tends to be a bit of a Barcelona party zone with multiple clubers leaving tehe clubs between 5 6 am in the morning Consequently may not be the most family friendly after between 11pm 6am The pool is small and gest crowded and I would not descbie it as kid friendly Those used to staying at Five Star Hotels will be satisfied but now wowed Bottomline I would stay here again in a heartbeat , I stayed three nights in a One bedroom Suite with a City View I picked Hotel Arts becuase I m very familar with Ritz Carlton Properties and this was my families first trip to Spain Superb service This is to be expected from a Ritz Carlton property The room size was superb for myself and family two girls 8 and 11 and my wife and was true suite and seperate sitting living area with two bathrooms one full one half The full bathroom was wonderful Very clean with very hot water and superb size pet issue of mine is small bathrooms in 5 star properties The views are truly spectacular and I would bet are some of the best in the city our window view literally framed La Sagrada Familia Although loctaed in Barceloneta I found transport to all the major sites very easy and expect to spend between 10 15 euros for transport to exiample or la Rambla You will find an abudnace of restuarnts to meet varied taste kid friendly vs michieln star Can t beat early morning walks along the beach 
378215,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The only issue was the WiFi In 2017 staying in a 5 star hotel you would expect to have free WiFi The wifi was only free in the public areas ie the pool area recepion etc If you wanted to use this in your room you would have to pay 25 euro per day They did not specify if this was 25euro per device or if it was just for the room This made it very difficult to do any work while we were on our holiday , The location of the hotel is superb the staff are very very friendly and polite and it is very close to the gothic quarter and is just down the road from sagarada famillia 
378216,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Location is near a busy boardwalk Lots of bars clubs restaurants nearby Great location for young couples who want to hang out Can be loud for families with young kids Hotel is super expensive rooms do not live up to expectations especially in size On the up side we were upgraded to a sea view room which more than made up for the small size , Excellent location by the beach Lots of places to eat food nearby Walking distance to many local attractions 
378217,Hotel Arts Barcelona,No Negative, We stayed in a suite at the club level which was luxurious and beautiful Amazing panoramic view comfortable bed and very spacious The club room just down the hall was fantastic They had a lovely breakfast spread and the variety of snacks they put out throughout the day was impressive Complimentary drinks were a nice touch at the club as the price for bar drinks is pretty astronomical at any other bar or restaurant along the beach or elsewhere in the hotel for that matter Staff couldn t have been more accommodating Would definitely stay there again 
378218,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Staff is basically a bunch of kids with little to no experience and no empowerment to take the most simple decisions a nice smile and then the need to refer to management In addition and even if it is for your safety and comfort you feel tracked at anytime when seating around the swimming pool staff asks for name and room number when asking for repair of a malfunctioning roomkey staff asks for your passport which of course is in the room or name and birth date Lastly rarely seen so many staff knocking on your door to carry out tasks that have been broken down between different teams clean up the coffee machine clean the room sometimes in a matter of just a few hours during siesta time of course Globally speaking feels like you are in a big machine and that attention is not that much personalized, outstanding venue in an outstanding location Extreme care paid to design and atmosphere Extremely neat and rather quiet yes there are a lot of not so distinguished tourists Nice swimming pool 
378219,Hotel Arts Barcelona, it was irritating to know that Wi fi is not included in the room rate Sounded very strange to me that for a hotel of this price and class wifi was an extra charge Similarly breakfast was not included in the room rate and breakfast would cost 40 euros per person including children Such small things gave my stay a rocky start as it is boring to haggle or get charged for small add ons when you thought you had already booked yourself to luxury I do have to add that when I expressed my disappointment the staff tried to pacify by adding in some of the things noted above I wish that I did not have to start the trip by expressing this disappointment in the first place , The staff were very friendly The room had a gorgeous view
378220,Hotel Arts Barcelona,No Negative, Not only that the hotel the rooms and the facilities are amazing and well maintained the level of service is the best we have ever experienced If it is the smile of each and every staff member the attitude the patience the kindness and hospitality 
378221,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Took forever to check in almost 20min And the room was so noisy had some machine hiden in the wall We were tired but still had to change room Not an experience we were expecting , good location
378222,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The lobby was not on the same level as the hotel entrance so you had to take an additional lift but this was very minor in the great scheme of things , Room was very luxurious and the view from our room across the city was out of this world We were given a room on 31st Floor so ask for a high floor if you want great views We were right next to the port and beach so the location was fantastic The bus tour stop is a stones throw away and taxis are always available It s a really great spot The staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble They were very professional and very friendly and on hearing we were celebrating a special birthday they sent up some Cava and some lovely cakes We would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends and we would love to stay again on our next visit 
378223,Hotel Arts Barcelona, No free wifi we were placed on a lower floor floor 6 so not much of a view the pool outdoor area was being renovated during our stay and we could not use these facilities , Large and luxurious room with comfortable bed Huge bathroom The accommodated our early arrival Very close to the beach and boulevard 
378224,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Although staff were always very polite the service could be quite slow at times There were also a few occasions when staff would let themselves into the room without knocking not ideal Food at the hotel is also a tad on the pricey side but very good , The room and bathrooms were an excellent size The beach was a short walk away and taxis to get to the centre were readily available The porters were incredibly helpful
378225,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Missing iron from Penthouse apartment Concierge staff took forever 1hour to replace this A long time when you are waiting to go out , Tapas Restaurant on site was fantastic
378226,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Nothing, We were more than satisfied We had a small misunderstanding with the airport transfer at the beginning of our stay but the staff was very polite and professional to offer the breakfast for free for the whole stay I highly recommend this hotel to everyone
378227,Hotel Arts Barcelona,No Negative, The staff from the bellman to front office every staff fully showed their friendly and professional service skill Perfect location along the beach and very good facilities Spa treatment was really well no doubt will choose this hotel next time 
378228,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Parking at the hotel for guests staying there should not be paid , Excellent room and its sea view excellent breakfast layout Excellent service from smiling staff 
378229,Hotel Arts Barcelona, What I did not like that the price was already high and for each thing for example internet additional price would be asked Internet is something that should be free ,No Positive
378230,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Internet is not free in the rooms 25 Euro per day It should be complementary especially with the high room rates , Nice location and entertaining hotel
378231,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Absolutely unacceptable to pay 25 euros per internet rate per day and a fee of 45 euros per person for a simple breakfast in an hotel where you pay an average of 400 euros per night With this rate internet should be included and breakfast too Hotel Arts at the time was the best choice now i d say it s very but very outdated , Impressive cleanliness They will clean your room twice a day and not only in the morning I love the location even though it s a bit far by the center if you want te be close the the seam this is the best spot 
378232,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Facilities not great No indoor swimming pool Food very pricy with lot of extra charges , Great location with beach close public transport close by and stop for city tour right outside hotel 
378233,Hotel Arts Barcelona, nothing, The whole experience was fantastic the staff went far beyond their duties to make our weekend special if you have a special celebration coming up go to the Arts you wont be disappointed
378234,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The follow through of the staff was a bit lacking The safe in the room didn t work and was reported after arriving but was never repaired or exchanged even though several staffers said it would be taken care of shortly They did provide a hotel safe while I waited which ended up being my entire stay , The hotel generally was very nice The hotel has a very large staff which is very attentive but sometime the follow through is not quite there 
378235,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The breakfast buffet was overpriced with little choices to choose from the fact you have to go into two elevators to leave the hotel, Excellent interior large rooms extra large bed crispy flaky croissant in breakfast buffet the great location of the hotel overlooking the beach and great restaurants as well as near attractions
378236,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Arrived early and room not ready not a problem at all just wanted to relax after journey in garden by pool and take a coffee Coffee 7 Euros each in a paper cup barely warm and little coffee Replacement offered to one of us This took almost half an hour to arrive and was only slightly better Debris on the bedroom floor on arrival No personal welcome or hotel orientation guidance So no information like where is the gym spa restaurants the hairdressers etc One sink blocked in bathroom which was not entirely resolved when reported Ironing board in bedroom like a rickety Emett Heath Robinson design death trap Socket cover plate fell off the wall when plug used Wi Fi was an extra charge 25 Euros per Day unless you blagged a Marriott preferred quest registration That also entitled one to use the preferred quest lounge which had complimentary beverages and juices rather dated and latterly could not be accessed at all Breakfast was a complete rip off at 78 euros for 2 people juice coffee pastry bit of cold meat salami and some feta cheese Didn t order anything cooked On arrival at breakfast they has smoked salmon and Iberian ham was out but by the time we had a coffee they had apparently run out believe that if you will Supper in Arola Incorrect order delivered By the time it was replaced with the correct order the other person had finished their main course Lack of lounge space especially if weather poor Huge conference ISTAT taking place there Masses of noisy delegates frequently completely clogging reception area making huge noise and completely spoiling ambiance for other guests Why were they not accommodated elsewhere in a dedicated room They dominated all the limited lounge reception space meaning others had to fight through the crowds several times making any conversation with concierge challenging , beds comfy reception staff very competent and polite 
378237,Hotel Arts Barcelona, I stayed in the same hotel 2 years back and every thing was perfect This time not so much The T v had a dark line running in the middle the bathroom door would not shut the bathroom shelf was broken door stopers were broken electrical plugs didnt work Coffe machine did not have a socet next to it , The staff were excelent
378238,Hotel Arts Barcelona, They only have double or king beds no queens Housekeeping was slow and not very thorough , The staff were very friendly and helpful Our bathroom was huge 
378239,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The boutiques at the hotel were closed pretty early They should stay open to offer their services for longer hours , The staff was extremely friendly and helpful particularly the amazing mery Edo at the concierge who made our trip memorable The room was spacious and comfortable The food was excellent as well 
378240,Hotel Arts Barcelona, When they know that one booked through booking com they try to give you the inferior rooms no wifi service etc even if you are a Marriott member , The location and the rooms
378241,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The hotel itself is wonderful and the staff super so difficult to be negative but the prices for food and drinks I had expected with it being a 5 star hotel to pay a little more but the charges for soft drinks and alcohol ice creams and snacks etc even around the pool were extortionate Another very minor niggle only provided with 2 coffee capsules per day for the coffee machine and when we requested additional capsules we were told that there is usually a a charge for these the capsules are 29p each here in the UK Kindly they waived the charges and provided us with 2 further capsules Please don t let these points put you off staying at Hotel Arts it is a truly special hotel and we certainly hope to return , The suite was wonderful with incredible views Very comfortable beds and excellent bathroom facilities and products The pool is super although a little cold and the other outside spaces are very well maintained The staff are very helpful and keen to assist with any queries or questions asked 
378242,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Some of your clients were very loud and overly boisterous at the pool perhaps a word in their ears would have helped they seemed disrespectful of your other guests and staff , The leisure facilities 
378243,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Upon arrival cleanliness of suite lack of facilities i e room safe not one anywhere room telephones the only one we could find was in the WC in the bathroom cigarette burns on furniture sofas and side tables and despite the property being non smoking the smell of smoke was very noticeable walking to the room i e from the corridor there was a distinct smell stale smoke and from quite a distance Bathroom fittings hanging off the walls dirt mould visible in the splash backs and sink holes Window seats filthy drink marks sticky stains and hairs on the seating which made you not want to put ANYTHING on the surface Scuff black marks to the paintwork doors etc and generally an extremely disappointing arrival back to the Arts for the 8th time The above said housekeeping came promptly we were moved to an alternative suite once that had been deep cleaned and on a higher floor still sea facing Overall the duty manager couldn t have been more understanding of our plight and was extremely helpful thereafter as were the rest of the staff to ensure that there were no other hitches during our few day s stay This included 50 discount on the room for the first night wifi and breakfasts included and a very nice lunch at the Marina Terrace Restaurant The pool area is fine provided you don t mind other people s noise and their kids but it must be frustrating for family groups to want to make the most of the outside facilities ok it was peak season but the Arts isn t necessarily the best lay over for Med cruise groups it simply can t cope with the volumes of young older generations and its limited outside space ,No Positive
378244,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Bars and restaurants way too expensive compared to the value offered Very slow service Disorganized Disconnect from Barcelona hotel could be located anywhere ,No Positive
378245,Hotel Arts Barcelona, You re paying 700 night room WiFi should be free It costs 30 I d rather they charge 730 night and not nickle and dime for ever service, Everything
378246,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Can t sleep we ll because of the noisy soarronding the area is full of night clubs and the hotel windows are not sound proof , Very nice location
378247,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Breakfast was overpriced, Pool staff are amazing juggling people and trying to find sunbeds not an easy task Loved the beach Tapas restaurant was great
378248,Hotel Arts Barcelona, There isn t one thing that could have been better My stay at this hotel was perfect , Service at the hotel was wonderful Pool staff was extremely attentive especially Darias who took great care of our family We got upgraded room when we checked in which was a pleasant surprise The room we got had the most awesome sea view Location of hotel was perfect Loved everything I was traveling with my 3 kids in their 20s and they were able to walk to clubs at night Can t wait to go back 
378249,Hotel Arts Barcelona, I ve never felt so unserved at a hotel of this category things went absurd at times Felt like a charity event hosted by college students Wishing a good day while we need to look for towels on our own or getting the coffe order right the third time is not good enough for a hotel like this Do you think anyone showed the hotel or the room Take the key and your luggage and follow the crowd to the lift The only good service provided was at check out thank you Antonio The room needs an overhaul but the design is nice and the view fantastic American and verysimple food in the restaurants at the price of a menu in the nice Spanish restaurants nearby Overall a definite no recommendation , Nice room in terms of design and view Good location
378250,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Had to wait 1hr to get our room although arrived only at 3pm They just handed me the key without showing me the room or explain the facilities Must have been a very busy day as the reception area was packed , The staff was friendly and helpful The location by the beach and night clubs very convenient 
378251,Hotel Arts Barcelona, I checked in at 10pm I had two rooms only rooms on 3rd floors available so i had to upgrade to a suite to have a room at 27th floor One of the room was already used and i had to go back to the reception strangely they manage to find a better room on a higher floor when 5 minutes before everything was full The following day i went to the gym and someone stole my headset The service at breakfast was very slow the waiter had to apologize Zero flexibility on the check out I always go to this hotel when i am in barcelona some of the staff remember me well In the past i have always said good words for this hotel but this time the experience wasn t as expected unfortunately , Location
378252,Hotel Arts Barcelona, We had a few problems with the management and reception We were given a twin room instead of a double room although we had requested a double bed two months and a half in advance We had to argue with management for a good hour before they finally decided to give us one of their double rooms Weirdly this was actually the room that we booked so we couldn t understand why they did not want to give us the double room in the first place very bad manager , Beautiful design and the concierge and pool team are very friendly and helpful 
378253,Hotel Arts Barcelona, 1 very inexperienced staff especially at the reception 2 We had to call at 7 PM to have our room to be cleaned after beeing out for the whole day 3 Spa was split between men and woman and very tiny You cannot attend with your partner The answer to this by the staff was that we have to accept values of the guests with different than European cultures 4 The food other than from Enoteca very poor with almost no healthy options 5 Overal well below average, Location spacious rooms
378254,Hotel Arts Barcelona,No Negative, We were upgraded as it was our 20 year anniversary spectacular room and phenomenal service views are incredible great restaurant near the pool area and helpful concierge staff
378255,Hotel Arts Barcelona, No music around the pool at all Not nearly enough sunbeds when there is plenty of room for 15 20 more Had to go on list for 3 hours two days in a row Music choice in the franks bar is terrible Very depressing Not a social environment at all Feel you have to whisper almost it is a little uncomfortable No later night social activity at all No music anywhere Nowhere to go after 11pm to enjoy a social night You have to leave the hotel unfortunately Needs a party place to go At least drinks by the pool with music with the loungers removed and area should be turned into something special at night This hotel is better for older couples 50 or those who just want peace and quiet day and night and who don t need a sunbed Also over 10 for a tiny plastic bottle of water in the room was I feel not value for money and being they are left out on the side you assume they are complimentary , Staff very helpful and friendly Lewis and others in the bar very good at making the drinks and making you feel welcome All staff throughout hotel were excellent But I feel even they want things to liven up a little The decor was great Food very good overall 
378256,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Level of svc is so high on and off season u can feel the svc level was a little low during summer r staff were genuinely busy, Location svc staff very good 
378257,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Very old television with poor connection and striped view Extremely expensive meals and services Swimming pool too small for number of guests Overstaffed with poor management For in room wifi one is charged 25 per day Public wifi is slow Not all staff at concierge desk are knowledgable about the answers regarding touristic activities , Cleanliness direct access to the beach comfortable bed nice bathroom and shower 
378258,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Shocked and annoyed that wi fi in rooms was 25 euros a day on top of the very expensive rooms I felt they were taking the mickey still doing this I raised the issue but no way around it they said Very poor , Location quality of rooms and friendliness of staff 
378259,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Bad toilet smell all over I think there was something wrong with the ventilation as I could smell the sewage And the fact that other guests waiting at the reception desk to be helped where offered something to drink and I was not I m not a cheeky bastard just giving a critical review as one may expect these things not to happen for the price one has to pay to sleep in such a hotel , Comfy and wide king bed nice bathroom and seaview The reimbursement of Internet after the complaint of bad smell 
378260,Hotel Arts Barcelona, I was disappointed with the fact that there were hidden charges 25 euros per day for internet is outrageous 150 Euros per day per room was also unnecessary Having to wait over 15 mins to have luggage collected and then no one came so we had to cart our own luggage downstairs The Staff were mostly interns and they tried their best but they were inexperienced and were being exploited In general the Hotel was overpriced and I felt the Hotel were taking advantage of clintele who clearly are of a higher income bracket So Hotel owners naively think value for money is not important Well it is ,No Positive
378261,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The rooms were clean but not 5star clean as in walls in bathrooms were not sparky clean We arranged for private transfers prior to our stay my husband rang and we email confirmed but no transfer was arranged so that was frustrating and not really acknowledged by the hotel A taxi was easy to get at 10pm and about 100 euros cheaper so next time I d save the money and go for a taxi , The location and views were amazing The hotel is walking distance to the beach and many beautiful restaurants The pool is beautiful and the pool service great We had a family room and had views of the marina on one side and then the city on the other wow The breakfast is yummy and fresh with lots of variety and excellent service 
378262,Hotel Arts Barcelona, We found the staff a bit in your face over friendly You couldnt even take a lift ride without having a member of staff asking how your day was Perhaps some people may like this we did not We also found the food drink services ridiculously expensive , Beautiful hotel perfect location right next to the beach Staff went the extra mile and even left a bottle of cava and birthday cake in the room for my husband s birthday 
378263,Hotel Arts Barcelona, when we checked in the staff ready to gave me anthor room but I told the staff I have book a sea view room on Booking they didn t make a note in advance Anyway everything s ok , the room is clean and big 
378264,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Internet cost 25e, Incredible service pool area and location We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to one of the apartments which was a truly beautiful room and experience Would recommend this hotel very highly indeed
378265,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Tv s in the room are too small and old and there is no Bluetooth facility to play music They need to update the entertainment systems they are very old , Amazing views Fantastic hotel gorgeous room and very friendly staff 
378266,Hotel Arts Barcelona, EUR 450 per night while all extras amounted to additional charges WLAN SPA even breakfast etc Slow service, Very responsive and friendly in terms of receiving feedback
378267,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The main pool was very chilly a few brave souls gave it a go but soon relented I m guessing early season but a few more degrees would have made it 10 10 , Excellent as always Staff are exceptional and the rooms are superb Our four year old was spoiled by the staff with a special mention to Dominic in the Arola restaraunt for taking him strawberry picking and concocting a T Rex strawberry juice 
378268,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Cost of the rooms Room facilities Toilets don t have locks not a great idea if you are traveling with large family, Location Friendly and professional staff
378269,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Terrible value for money nit including breakfast or even Internet It used to be the best now it cannot compete with W or Mandarin Oriental They are both in a different league, Nice staff
378270,Hotel Arts Barcelona, the only downside is the price Not for every pocket, Great staff really great service great facility we took a suite it was really comfortable and well equipped This is not really an hotel for kids but they do made an effort to entertain them I would definitely recommend the hotel 
378271,Hotel Arts Barcelona,No Negative, HIGH standard GREAT atmosphere SUPER location I have already recommended this hotel to all my Network Family and Company Everything was perfect from the serviceminded Guys at the main entrance to the smiling Girls in the reception area And the rooms the view ans sleep comfort nothing to complain about Looking forward to come back SOON 
378272,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Although the location was good it is hard to get to the heart of the city with a baby and the parking fees are very high , The gym and cleanness of the hotel
378273,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Breakfast is absurdly expensive especially if you only want to eat a small breakfast There really should be an intermediate cheaper possibility like continental breakfast I ended up eating breakfast out on the beach , I ve always enjoyed this hotel in many aspects the staff and the view in particular 
378274,Hotel Arts Barcelona, If only the pool was heated , Firstly the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming The restaurants were all fantastic We simply did not want to leave and now look forward to our next stay there 
378275,Hotel Arts Barcelona, EVERYTHING costs extra Breakfast 38 use of the spa 42 Wifi 25 It is free on our local bus Please bear in mind you will only get the room and everything else costs a lot extra making it extremely poor value for families They also took more than the whole cost of our stay from our credit card as a guarantee when we arrived even though they said we would not be charged and then charged a second full amount when we paid our bill We had to wait for over a week for our card to be refunded with the first guarantee debit so allow for this We have stayed in many 5 star hotels in different parts of the world but this has never been a problem before , Comfortable hotel in excellent location 
378276,Hotel Arts Barcelona, A DISASTER THE PEOPLE OF THE RECEPCION FIRST THEY CANNOT FIND THE RESERVATION AND THAN THEY OFFER AN UPGRADE FOR 25 EURO AND THE CHARGE 150 EURO PRICES OF THE BAR AND BREAKFAST ARE NOT ACCORDING TO SPAIN ,No Positive
378277,Hotel Arts Barcelona, No negative feedback at all , We stayed in a club room everything was amazing beds super comfy views over the beach fabulous The staff were so helpful child friendly One of the best hotels we ve ever stayed in Thank you hotel arts
378278,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Everything was on point , Amazing hotel I suggest to stay at the room with the Club access as we did The staff is exemplary You will enjoy your stay no doubt about it 
378279,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Pool could be heated was very cold Room service food was appalling not to the standard I would expect from a hotel of this calibre The cost of the room service menu was too high especially considering the quality of the food I stay in many hotels all over the world and this food was what I would expect from a rubbish canteen Decor was a little tired in places Rooms a bit scuffed Breakfast was very overpriced Especially considering my eldest child was 11 and charged as an adult , The staff were brilliant very helpful The location and facilities were great Kids loved the Jacuzzi 
378280,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Pool could ve been heated , Fabulous room great view We stayed on 24th floor and had a spectacular view of beach and city from side of hotel Plenty of room for two adults and teenage daughter Wonderful bathroom and good smellies 
378281,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Drink prices are way too high It s my second time I stayed at this hotel and this time I had room with no breakfast included and we end up paying per person 39euros it s too high for what you get , I love Barcelo and Hotel Arts Barcelona is one of my favourite hotels Staff friendly will do anything to ensure guests have quality stay 
378282,Hotel Arts Barcelona, access and interior spaces chaotic architecture seems to me to be result of failed planning small rooms for the price , vicinity to barceloneta gym vue over beach 
378283,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Nothing was fantastic, Everything was perfect best 5 star service you can experience and I have been to many around the world was also upgraded to a wow suite which was amazing but the staff were all amazing
378284,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Was very unclear regarding what was included and what wasn t Its very expensive Staff were not clear and was confusing Tried to charge us 300 for two breakfasts However did refund Dont eat in hotel if you on any budget at all Is really exclusive Will stay somewhere else next time regardless of how good a deal I get , Fantastic location Staff very attentive and friendly Rooms spotless 
378285,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The lobby is too small which provides for a slightly stuffy atmosphere at peak periods such as Easter Given that many families choose this hotel it might also be an idea to provide a club for children , The staff could not be faulted Simply excellent Available to deal with every need with the kindest possible attitude 
378286,Hotel Arts Barcelona, EUR42 for breakfast was too expensive Restaurant food was not worth the money and not good quality and also EUR25 PER DAY for the internet What a rip off Hotel is above all the nightclubs so big police presence and lots of fights outside the hotel Also had problems checking in couldn t find my reservation altho booked through booking com and did specify guest name VERY poor for a 5 star luxury hotel , The gym was good and reception staff friendly
378287,Hotel Arts Barcelona, A LONG WALK FROM BARCELONA CENTRE VERY HIGH COST OF BREAKFAST AND WATER OUT OF THE MINI BAR WASNT SHOWN TO OUR ROOM SO DIDNT UNDERSTAND HOW ANYTHING WORKED , LOVELY STAFF A WARM WELCOME LOVELY LOCATION NEAR THE BEACH GREAT VIEW FROM YOUR WINDOW
378288,Hotel Arts Barcelona,No Negative, This is my second stay at Arts and I can t find a simple thing to complain about This could be my all time favorite hotel The location stunning sea views hotel condition and room standards are unmatchable not to mention the amazing staff and service 
378289,Hotel Arts Barcelona, It is indeed a Hotel for the old generation I would not recommend it for young people where other options are there in Barcelona Ask for such amount of money for Wifi is not very attractive Lobby is really small In summary after being in the W Hotel there is not discussion at all , Good location no doubt about this 
378290,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Nothing I didnt like about the hotel except the hotel restaurant was a bit pricey but to be expected at a 5 stay , The bed was really comfy and also the bathroom had everything you could possibly need Friendly and accommidating staff 
378291,Hotel Arts Barcelona,No Negative, The hotel was amazing and in a great location The staff couldn t have been friendlier and accommodating This is definitely my go to hotel when visiting Barcelona 
378292,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Too much staff to offer a glass of water or call a lift but not enough staff at reception This hotel is really poor value for money wifi and minibar are so expensive The hotel is modern design but you arriving in the bell boy area and having to take a lift to reach reception is bad in my opinion the facility are small bar area lobby The room was not ready when we arrived we were travelling with our young daughter and there was no bed for her you book a room for 3 and there is one bed Overall the room was expensive and really not value for money , Staff was always available but 
378293,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The hotel is ageing a little Carpets in the hallways have visible stains Also bed made too much squeeking sounds The B O Tv is great but doesnt show any HD channels Also the music system is outdated It is not a dock for phone and does not support Bluetooth so all you can enjoy on the system is Radio and CDs if you still carry them in this iPod age The parking on site was very expensive at 45 Euros a night, Stayed for second time in 2 years Right on the beach above the vibrant nightlife of Barcelona The best hotel in Barcelona on the beach by far Very welcoming staff smooth check in and check out Room was spacious and so was bathroom Was given a room on high floor so there was no outside noise at all They have B O TV and music systems in room 
378294,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Staff were very friendly but useless when you actually needed help The first day the internet wasn t working The reception transferred me to the internet provider where I with out success waited in line on the phone for half an hour Another day I needed a different plug for my computer A simple thing that most hotels could solve but the girl at the desk was completely blank If a hotel wants business travelers these things are basic and must be in order , The view of the sea the spacious bathroom and the comfortable bed 
378295,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Because in your website you mention Internet free and they want to charge us And breakfast as well they charge while it s written its included, The lovely staff in concierge namely blanca she is real asset for the hotel the way she helped
378296,Hotel Arts Barcelona, You have to pay for SPA access which is ridiculous and a very cheap move for a five star hotel Housekeeping will call the room every morning to ask you if you want the room to be done when a sign DND was clearly put on the door very and extremely rude strategy , Reception and concierge very helpful cozy lobby great location 
378297,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Staff and hotel do only for themselves Breakfast is open at 7 It s too late for early departure guest Even they cost from 5years old kid I have stayed in seaviewsuite but livingroom sofa is stained , Only view is good 
378298,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Bad move to charge a lot for any side stuff Internet 25 per day breakfast buffet 60 car park 45 So be aware how they will top up your bill very quickly , Very nice hotel lovely sea view 
378299,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Everything is paid as an extra in this hotel and that is not mentioned in the inicial reservation on booking Breakfast is not included and is to expensive entrance in SPA area without treatments even WiFi The conditions of the hotel don t justify the inicial price The bathroom needs repairs , Nice view Room clean and confortable bed 
378300,Hotel Arts Barcelona, No bad experiences Had one beer in the bar which cost 13 euros Breakfast was 42 euros each which meant I never had it Beautiful hotel but extras too expensive When I booked it didn t realise you had to pay for the spa and the pool wasn t heated , Staff were excellent
378301,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The room was too hot at times particularly at night and this meant i had frequent wakeful periods, Very friendly and welcoming staff particularly the concierge staff I also enjoyed the soft bed luxurious 
378302,Hotel Arts Barcelona, The room tables had not been dusted nor were they during our stay The room refreshments facilities were good excellent coffee maker plus they had a kettle but no tea bags so not sure what the kettle was for, Everything was excellent we did not use the restaurants so cant comment any further
378303,Hotel Arts Barcelona, On the first night my room had extremely loud cracking and smashing noises within the walls all night We arrived late and were in bed already when it started so tried sleeping through it however at 5am it was just too unbearable On calling reception to complain and ask to be moved they told me they knew when it was windy there were problems on my floor I asked why then knowing there was strong wind forecasted did they put me on that floor There was no answer to that I then asked how they would compensate for all of this They very cheekily offered me a 25 discount for the night Obviously this made me extremely angry and the attitude was insulting I told them that was not good enough and they then agreed not to charge for the night After this incident no management contacted us to see if everything was now ok with our stay and there was no follow up from the front desk So in a hotel of this standard with the reputation it has I found the way they dealt with this disappointing , The staff were friendly and attentive The location was great The rooms were lovely designed 
378304,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Service was awfull 3 nights for me there were full of stress problems Like first day blocking my creadit card took me about 3 hours They couldnt put the numbers corectly which is not expected from such a hotel Internet fee was 25 per a day So expencive One of the staff broke my powder while cleaning which cost me 100 Overall I regret staying there, Just the buding itself
378305,Hotel Arts Barcelona,No Negative, The Hotel is beautiful and the rooms are modern high tech and spacious Our room had several sea views which were heavenly to wake up to in the morning The staff is excellent honestly I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to the hotel staff or my stay as everything excedeed my expectations I Will defininitely be coming back in the near future 
378306,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Check in area too small The arrival point for a five star hotel is terrible It s a car park and the lift lobby up to reception is not five star , Ch
378307,Hotel Arts Barcelona, We loved everything , The staff were amazing and so helpful A very big thank you to Alexander and Clare they made it very special especially for our anniversary and my birthday our love to them both Xxx
378308,Hotel Arts Barcelona, It has been 5 years since we last stayed at the Arts Hotel we felt that the hotel really need some renovations done on the rooms particularly as we paid quite a bit for our room it was general in OK condition I would definitely expect more when I was paying so much , Its in a great location with easy access to everything in the city
378309,Hotel Arts Barcelona, When I arrive in hotel I find that I have to pay 200 deposit per day I get all money back of course But if you booking this hotel be ready for this , Hotel service location all for 5 
378310,Hotel Arts Barcelona, 1 charging for wifi 2 very noisy all the night night clubs area 3 cheaper to have breakfast in room than going to the restaurant 4 to go to your room you need to take 2 lifts, The view of the city
378311,Hotel Arts Barcelona, No bad experience , Every part of the holiday was great The staff were amazing and were at hand at every moment My children and I really enjoyed the holiday 
378312,Hotel Arts Barcelona,No Negative, Despite the hotel being located by beach the typical tourist destinations are still surprisingly easily accessible by taxi or walk The hotel itself is luxurious the staff unfailingly polite and helpful but even so it is a little pricey for what you re getting

378317,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Given the type of hotel I was very surprised that the wifi was extra In this day and age wifi is essential especially with teenage kids it s even free in pubs now , We had a great time at the hotel In particular the staff and location were very good 
378318,Hotel Arts Barcelona, I did not like the noise music could be listened in the room until 1 am on a friday night and until 5 am on a saturday night No way to sleep Also there is a window in the corridor inside the room that there is no black out so the room has day light since the sun rises ,No Positive
378319,Hotel Arts Barcelona, Wi fi at circa 30 euros is not right given the amount you pay for a room The small cafe around the corner has it for free If it was in the price you probably wouldn t notice but having it separate means people like me write about it , The hotel is beautiful and the staff cannot do enough for you It is perfectly situated for the beach great restaurants sight seeing and night life The beach is probably one of the best beaches I have been on in a long time Definitely recommend this hotel and area
