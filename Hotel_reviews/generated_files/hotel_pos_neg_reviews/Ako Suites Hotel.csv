313645,Ako Suites Hotel, The room was not as comfortable as the booking It was very noisy at night with an open window We had room to Carrer de la Diputacio , Excellent location Very kind stuff especially in reception Very clean room and bath 
313646,Ako Suites Hotel, Bathroom and toilet area not private Please emphasise this in your description Caused unnecessary problems especially when sharing with grown up children Tea and coffee facilities should be provided in rooms, Location to Los Rambles about 15 20 min walk Air con could be better 
313647,Ako Suites Hotel, The glass bathroom in the middle of the room was awkward for friends as we booked for 4 adults we were expecting four full beds but it was a sleeping sofa for 2 quite comfortable though , Location was amazing great pool friendly staff
313648,Ako Suites Hotel, Staff was correct but asking for too much information as we paid with company card and we understand the politics of the hotel but it was a bit of a hassle Making things easier and also being a bit more sensible as we were in front of our client and it looked a bit like there was a problem when we had paid everything in advance , Hotel facilities and location were great We would recommend it as it has a great location and the rooms are decent 
313649,Ako Suites Hotel, Room a bit hot could not work out the AC controls but I was frankly exhausted form tow nights lack of sleep at another hotel so more me than the hotel , Ok we needed a quite place after the disaster hotel we had booked a few blocks away and this did us very well 
313650,Ako Suites Hotel, No kettle chopping board bread knife cloth to wipe surfaces clean dishes A toaster would have been a good addition Welcome pack would have been appreciated to incl milk sugar tea bags Loose connections re bedside lighting Shower head would not stay in position Armchair and footstool would have been nice Leather sofa slippy and wearing Needs repair Additional hangers in closet needed,No Positive
313651,Ako Suites Hotel, Nothing, Friendly staffs good location near stations n airport shuttle Shower is strong n hot Love the little kitchenette it would be perfect if they have oven 
313652,Ako Suites Hotel, I booked a hotel with swimming pool cos my son loves the water But unfortunately the small rooftop swimming pool was not heated Although we traveled beginning of May the water was too cold Didn t see anyone using the pool It would have been just perfect if the swimming pool was usable , I traveled with my husband and 3 year old It was an excellent place to stay for 3 days very comfortable clean quiet and staff at reception very helpful The suite was cleaned everyday and the staff responded to our requests promptly The location was close to the catalunya square Many bakery cafe restaurants closeby Will recommend to friends and stay again 
313653,Ako Suites Hotel, I put my properties inside the safety box which is included 2500 and 1500 Euro When I checked out I didn t check my bag based on my trust Once I arrived home I saw it is lost 800 and 100 Euro I called to the hotel but they said they cant do anything , Everything was good
313654,Ako Suites Hotel, Prefer a double bed rather than two singles side by side Would like cloths and washing up liquid to wash dishes rather than wait for the daily clean when we needed to use them , Staff were lovely and very helpful Room was very clean and spacious for Barcelona Room was bright and quiet facing the back Location was great and a 10 15 walk to Passeig de Gracia for shopping Restaurants and a supermarket all on the same block 
313655,Ako Suites Hotel, Double bed was the standard twin bed put together to be expected Pool didn t open til 10am, Great facilities Located a 10min walk to placa catalunya Area close to some great local restaurants 
313656,Ako Suites Hotel, The breakfast not included in the rate the process of ordering too much complicated same as the menu, The complimentary biscuits fruits water coffee in the reception
313657,Ako Suites Hotel, The breakfast wasn t the best It would have been nice to have something hot But then I m probably used to a great British breakfast There was no butter with the toast either so very dry It would be nice to have a bar area downstairs but it wasn t a problem as there are lots of bars and restaurants in the area , The staff were very helpful and nothing was too much I felt very welcome at ako suites A special thank you to Rita who helped me to book a well needed Turkish spa bath and massage even printing my conformation and leaving it with the night staff The hotel was very clean and I had everything I needed Thank you
313658,Ako Suites Hotel, The view of our room wasn t great, Little Kitchenette was great 24hrs shops located at the same street free cookies at the lobby Universita metro station is less than 5 minutes away
313659,Ako Suites Hotel, Wasn t aware the pool area was closed and being worked on and was quite noisy at times as we were in the room below would have been nice to sit up there as the weather was lovely DO NOT book their airport transfer you are offered got ripped off and paid 50 euros booked my own on the way home and it was only 18 Just flag one down instead , Really easy central location nice clean white modern room 
313660,Ako Suites Hotel, The television and the air were not working when I first checked in but they were very responsive fixing it quickly , Very friendly helpful staff I felt very secure in this neighborhood with the 24 hour desk 
313661,Ako Suites Hotel, No desk nor chair to sit and work at , Great location with small good returants around Less touristic than most other locations even if you are very close to everything 
313662,Ako Suites Hotel, I did not like that there was an error on the reservation and although it was caught within 24 hours of booking the facility did not do anything to assist That was certainly not good customer service When I spoke to the friendly desk staff he told me the manager would contact me when he was on property and I m yet to hear from the manager No Bueno , The staff I had encounter with were pleasant and helpful loved how quiet and cozy this place was Loved the location nice lil walk to the city to burn those extra calories from the food food and drinks I had while in Barcelona loved it 
313663,Ako Suites Hotel, The lack of amenities in the kitchen no coffee tea etc supplied No cleaning items for kitchen area , The room was spacious with sitting area The air conditioning was very effective and the pool was cold but nice to cool off in The staff were very friendly and helpful with local sights and transportation options 
313664,Ako Suites Hotel, Parking is a block away there is no stopping for loading unloading of luggage Staff suggested that we pulled up in front of a car park next door as if we were going in there whilst we unloaded which helped Teenage daughter was not too keen on the privacy of the bathroom , Reception staff were extremely helpful with information about the area After we checked out we were told that we would still be able to use the pool whilst waiting for the time to leave for the airport Large clean family room with fridge cooking facilities Would stay at this hotel again 
313665,Ako Suites Hotel, While this hotel tries very hard to have a cool modern minimalist look what might look nice in photos does not translate to a very good experience in the room I m afraid The biggest let down was the almost complete lack of soundproofing between the room and common areas atrium I could hear the lobby muzak the conversations of people waiting for the elevator and the screaming of the kids using the pool six floors up through my closed door Not good Additionally voices and footsteps from neighbouring units were very audible As I am a light sleeper I had to use ear plugs during the night Also the use of semi transparent glass walls and doors between the bathroom and toilet section in the middle of the room and the kitchen and sleeping areas is of questionable taste I think the bathroom cubicle itself was supposed to have closing glass doors but the panels didnt want to move on their sliders anymore Small niggles There was no place to hang your towels to dry after showering the TV remote only worked with the small screen in the kitchen The rooftop terrace could have been very nice if they luxed it up a bit with a bar and someone in attendance but as it was when I was there it was in effect a kindergarden full of screaming kids who in essence occupied the whole area A bit of attention from the staff would make it possible for other guests to enjoy the facilities too In all I was expecting something a bit more luxurious than what was provided and in particular the feeling of a lack of privacy lets this hotel down in my opinion , Location at the University square is more central than expected and at the same time you re in the quiet Eixample with lots of great places to eat and shop nearby 
313666,Ako Suites Hotel, Quite a lot of noise from guests in corridor when leaving entering rooms on same floor Only 1 lift so a bit slow at busy times, Excellent a c Helpful friendly reception staff
313667,Ako Suites Hotel, We slept on the sofa beds and the noise in the mornings from the central atrium was quite loud , Staff very friendly very clean great pool and relaxing area
313668,Ako Suites Hotel, No AC Although promised in the website s description AC did not work We needed to switch rooms twice Staff never apologized and was unfriendly Out of 6 nights we did not sleep 3 nights since AC was not working and room was hot and humid as sauna it s July in Spain Hotel manager refused to compensate us despite this problem Also very weird design of bathroom toilet without a door and in the middle of the room Glass screen was translucent so no privacy in the bathroom Quite awkward In addition kid s bed is a pullout armchair that was extremely uncomfortable Kids woke up with back pain every morning Overall if AC was working this is a fair deal Since AC was not working very poor value for the money , Location was good Hotel looks new and clean and is located in a very safe neighborhood 
313669,Ako Suites Hotel, Nothing The kids wish the pool was warmer though it was good to cool off as the warmth of the outside temperature made up for this , The room was very nice The layout was good clean and comfortable The staff were very helpful and happy to assist with any of our requests The view from the roof top was amazing and gave you a different perspective of Barcelona The location of the hotel was quiet but was within walking distance of local shopping a great bakery the metro the touristic bus and much more There was a laundry right next door 
313670,Ako Suites Hotel,No Negative, Large rooms good roof top pool nice staff quiet area for sleeping walking distance to main streets with many small shops around the hotel for water snacks

313672,Ako Suites Hotel, Doors cannot be locked from inside , Excellent Near restaurants shops cafes pharmacy etc 10 min walk to plaza catalonia Very close to the hop on off bus tour Excellent Value for money Only issue door cannot be locked from inside Staff are extremely helpful
313673,Ako Suites Hotel, lacking a kettle for the morning Lacking a single car park place to allow the client to get pre booked car park ticket and location , good placement in the city the swimming pool on the rooftop the proximity of the tube proximity of a lot of restaurants
313674,Ako Suites Hotel,No Negative, we were very happy with the hotel Great location because of proximity to the metro bus Plaza Catalunia Rambles but also the neighborhood is great restaurants cafes supermarkets just all over very save the hotel is comfortable helpful staff beds very comfortable the sofa in which our 19y son slept less cleaning took place every day 
313675,Ako Suites Hotel, Hotel could leave the big brown pillows they were taken away the next day after from our bed If double mattresses would be more available not twin beds I would have given 5 Overall great hotel and lovely staff very helpful , Highly recommend Ako Suites friendly staff lovely rooms in very good location 
313676,Ako Suites Hotel, I was promised a BATHTUB and only got a SHOWER After a long day of walking all over the city I needed to SOAK For the price I should have had a bathtub , Front desk man was very friendly and helpful 
313677,Ako Suites Hotel, I ordered one big bad but we got to singel beds I called to the reception and the told me that there is no more big beds available The kitchen was very nice but it was strange that it was no tea boler or coffee machine at the room , The location was very good The room was spacious Nice staff 
313678,Ako Suites Hotel, More frosting on the shower and toilet walls just a little too revealing A small bar would have been nice but there was a mini bar in the room and plenty of bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel , Apartment provided everything we required and needed The gentleman on reception when we checked in was really friendly and gave us lots of advice and tips to help us make the most of our holiday Staff were always willing and on hand to help with queries and extras we asked for Cleaning staff maids did an excellent job and the apartment was spotless the whole time 
313679,Ako Suites Hotel, Very slow wifi in the top floors No conditioner in the shower Pillows could and should be better, Very friendly and helpful staff at reception Good apartment layout Great location
313680,Ako Suites Hotel, When we arrived the room was cleaned and it had distinct chemicals smell Also it seems they allow smoking in the rooms , Exceptional location for the price very close to Metro and not far from Catalonia square Big apartment modern looking everything works Lobby is fantastic and in my view even excessive for appart hotel 
313681,Ako Suites Hotel, Sometime the Wi Fi was a little slow , Great central location very friendly and helpful staff the hotel is looking new and very modern the apartment suit was big and comfortable separate living room and bedroom 
313682,Ako Suites Hotel, Quite a noisy street outside traffic wise if you sleep with the window s open as we did but there is air con too if you re there in summer or you want a quieter early morning We were on the 6th floor 602 and we were woken at 6 00am , Very good location just a 5 minute walk to La Rambla Room was clean and spacious with a small kitchen with a microwave and a two ring hob plenty to make a quick snack A separate living room with a small sofa was a nice touch A few bars a couple of supermarkets chemists and bakeries very close by The staff were pleasant and helpful 12 o clock check out was excellent Would I go back to AKO Yes without a doubt 
313683,Ako Suites Hotel, Noisy revelers in the early hours trying to enter a sex show opposite mainly Brits , Location and facilities within the apartment Very comfortable super king size bed with separate kitchen and sitting area Short walk to the Metro and also The Ramble
313684,Ako Suites Hotel, The rooms were not cleaned to a high standard and the bathroom floor was slightly sticky and stunk , The staff was extremely helpful The rooms are comfortable and well decorated 
313685,Ako Suites Hotel, room 202 is just above the main entrance so you can always hear the noise when door open close however we are not light sleeper so this didn t bother us so much we asked for a kettle but it was not clean and with strange smell so we didn t use it , Location is perfect train from airport T2 takes about 20 minutes and then walk 10 minutes to the hotel metro station universitat is in 5 min walking distance very helpful staff nice room fast wifi 
313686,Ako Suites Hotel, Excellent place to stay for a leisure trip Could also be convenient for a business trip but missing a bar in the lobby they provide coffee though , Excellent location 2mn from the metro and 10mn from plaza de catalunya on foot Lots of restaurants bars around and multiple 24h convenience stores Large clean and comfortable room with a large shower very bright at day time 
313687,Ako Suites Hotel, Wi fi was very hit or miss in the room It worked sometimes and other times didnt connect, Amazing room Cleaners also left our room smelling fresh everyday 
313688,Ako Suites Hotel, No sofa in our room which we expected and some building work in building next door which woke us up loud drilling on two mornings No view looked at a brick wall Painfully slow wifi , Clean room and comfortable bed slept pretty well
313689,Ako Suites Hotel, Not enough privacy if sharing with a group of friends of different sexes unless you know each other very well The swimming pool was really no use at all as too small and not open at convenient hours , The location was great and very clean and comfortable Staff were very helpful 
313690,Ako Suites Hotel, We booked 2 months in advance for 3 nights for a double room with king bed However when we got there they said no double room was available We were given a room with two single beds and had to stay there for 2 nights If I knew there was no king bed room available I would have booked somewhere else , Staff was friendly and helpful Lots of good restaurants nearby 
313691,Ako Suites Hotel, WiFi a bit slow sometimes, Absolutely everything Staff was great and very attentive Excellent location but in a quiet street The room was very spacious and very clean Would definitely recommend 
313692,Ako Suites Hotel, I made a reservation for a suite for 4 people because we wanted a big room even though we were just 3 adults and a baby but the hotel didn t agree with our needs and gave us a suite for 3 adults as they thought was enough that s what the clerk at the front desk said what they didn t do is change the price accordingly thanks to booking s staff the price was reduced by 280 euro such an audacity and fraud i ve never seen in my life , The staff is quite helpful and the location is well
313693,Ako Suites Hotel,No Negative, One of the quieter streets in Barcelona The room was very spacious and great to have a fridge and hob for a cup of tea in the mornings Staff were very helpful Would recommend for a stay in Barcelona 
313694,Ako Suites Hotel, The shower leaked into the bathroom quite a bit so we threw down extra towels , Friendly staff very clean rooms comfy beds walking distance to restaurants but not right on the tourist strip which I enjoyed Also next to a laundromat 
313695,Ako Suites Hotel, The only drawback is the windows are not normal hotel rated and so the street noise is considerable But earplugs solved that problem , Excellent location Great room
