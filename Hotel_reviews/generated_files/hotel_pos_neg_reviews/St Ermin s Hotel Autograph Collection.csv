88260,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast was a real disappointment Tables and chairs looked sad Felt as if we were in a canteen rather than a beautiful hotel , Claxton Grill Fantastic
88261,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the amenities , The bed was VERY nice The staff were friendly and helpful even making sure we d had our breakfast before we got in the taxi to leave 
88262,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The meat platter for two costed 45 which I believe was over priced for the meat you had Plus you had to pay extra for chips as the vegetables that came with the platter was not enough for two , Breakfast was good but a bit pricey for kids Excellent location staff and the suite was excellent 
88263,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, A bit pricey in comparison to other hotels we stayed at there wasn t much of a difference to make up for the extra cost , Friendly staff in room dining service location
88264,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast adder seemed pricey We did not purchase for that reason Coffee should be made available for free in the lobby for early morning risers say before 7am , Staff was always courteous and ready to assist us Rooms were very comfortable The lobby and balcony were nice afternoon unwind spots lots of spots to sit and enjoy 
88265,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, Charming vintage building with modern amenities The staff was friendly and professional and the hotels location is near to many London sights Our room was small but comfortable 
88266,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The room was poky and small We often use the Conrad just around the corner The rooms there are bigger comfier and yet cost less than St Ermins For a so called King room we feel tight on space , The hotel oozed quality and refinement 
88267,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, For the price this hotel is not good value for money The rooms are small and the decor rather gaudy Unfortunately there was so much road work going on around the hotel that it made getting about almost impossible and while this isn t the hotel s fault it did colour our impressions of the hotel s location While the staff were pleasant enough the breakfast was ordinary and not what I would have expected for the price , This is a unique hotel with an interesting history 
88268,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, Service is the key and I will rate the Hotel 10 10 for helping you I stay all over the world and pay out for Hotels a lot I feel for the price its 10 10 the staff make this Hotel stand out and i m very happy to stay I would like to stay again 
88269,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Service in the dining room was very slow We started at 6pm with 4 young children and it took until 9pm to get through not acceptable , Everything was well thought out and catered for 
88270,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, There weren t many restaurants near or much shopping But the tube was close enough that you could get on and find those places , This hotel is absolutely incredible Right by St James park tube station that can get you absolutely anywhere Very close to Westminster Abbey and Big Ben They upgraded us to a suite without an extra charge and gave us free drink vouchers while we waited for our room to be ready Absolutely wonderful all around I felt like royalty 
88271,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Nothing bad to say, We picked this Hotel because of location to Buckingham Palace and Big Ben and is located in a nice area to walk around and see sights Staff very friendly Got lots of good pictures 
88272,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Buffet breakfast was fairly ordinary for the price very limited selection bread cold inside possibly taken out of a freezer beforehand pastry not crispy For half the price of the buffet we could get solid and tastier breakfast in any of better caf s in the area I recommend choosing from a la carte rather than taking the buffet , Staff very helpful rooms comfortable Very central location just 2 mins away from underground Great for walks Wonderful hotel 
88273,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The cooked breakfast was very poor with powdered scrambled egg and microwaved bacon there was no beans potatoes or tomatoes on iffer, The cold buffet breakfast had excellent choice of food
88274,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, There was very little I could fault The shower creams etc were located quite high in the main shower and my wife who is quite short struggled to use them easily , We received a free room upgrade when we booked in and the Suite was excellent as was the hotel in general We had a meal in the Craxton Restaurant which was of high quality The staff were alll friendly helpful and polite Overall a very enjoyable stay 
88275,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, We stayed here twice during our travels and had a great experience both times They had a cute adventure for the kids which they loved We had breakfast there as well and it was nice Location was fabulous easy walk to Buckingham and Westminster 
88276,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, We were supposed to have a room with a hide a bed for our child and there wasn t one They gave us a roll away but that made the room fairly cramped , Comfortable bed excellent location quiet in room Nespresso coffee and tea friendly staff buffet breakfast 
88277,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, it was disappointing that room service after 11 00pm offered only cold snacks, excellent location friendly and efficient staff great value for money would definitely return
88278,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Hotel corridors a bit complicated as it was a remodel , The staff were extremely attentive and helpful We had High Tea at the hotel as well and enjoyed it thoroughly 
88279,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Had no TV with kids It was broken They got it fixed at 11 pm Next morning is was broken again Also found hair in our eggs At over 500 00 a night I would have expected some kind of compensation Not just sorry,No Positive
88280,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The room was a bit small but that did not effect our stay The room view was of an office block but again this did not effect our stay as we were only in the room at night, Great location spotlessly clean comfortable room Friendly efficient staff
88281,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Sofabed was horrible very hard and uncomfortable Pillows too hard , Got a executive room which was great Clean and no noice from the streets Everything in the roon was great except for the beds 
88282,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, I hated the shower The water came out too slowly and it was difficult to wash my hair Maybe it is a problem of pressure and of course of limescale You should keep it more clean In the toilet you should put a kind of wc brush to clean in after making poo Why don t you have it , Best breakfast ever best position and such a beautiful place to stay Clean rooms and comfortable 
88283,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Caxton Grill experience was forgettable Poor cut of meat and also over aged yuck Servers in disarray Service was slow and there was an argument in the kitchen which could be heard in the dining room Just lovely NOT , Courtyard garden bee terrace and grand staircase 
88284,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Booking com didn t pass on the booking message to the hotel asking would the hotel call about parking arrangements , The bar team kindly set aside area for quick bite before all the family set off to theatre Lovely birthday cake and card in the room lovely welcome which made my mum feel really special It was an unexpected treat Concierge friendly and was fantastic taking family photo for us All employees were happy and helpful which made beautiful hotel and location even more special 
88285,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, C etait vraiment super joli and super sympa Lovely ambiance beautiful rooms and very pleasant location to see the City of London from also conveniently close to the Supreme Court 
88286,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, I like to crack my windows and smokers would gather under my windows and so I had to close them again till they were gone I am advocating even a non smoking policy for open air public areas I was overall stunned with the great numbers of smoking persons everywhere in London horrible like being in Egypt I travel a lot in US so maybe I am a bit brainwashed plus as a doctor I have made it my lifelong mission to discourage all people from smoking , entry to the hotel and lobby are very posh yet modest hotelemployers were all very welcoming and friendly plus helpful comfy bed nice room with excellent interior design bathroom was in good order though bowlplug was leaking scary with contactlenses so had to put washtowel over it had to wait long for hot water passing through the pipes to taps location of room on ground was nice facing the court smokers outside were a problem to me the location is excellent walking distance to Underground but also walking to Westminster Abbey and Parliament Thames etc it is all nearby 
88287,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast was very busy and restaurant ambience a little disappointing , Very convenient For the tube network Quiet position good location for a peaceful nights sleep excellent for tourist attractions Very pleasant and efficient staff 
88288,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, There was not a single thing we did not like , We are not sure where to start with the compliments Upon arrival we were met by gentlemen helping unload the suitcases Charlotte at the front desk Lee Wood head concierge Tony Alice Isabella Stelios Mr Santos Mr Sultan dining too many to mention ALL exceptional Lee gave us great advice on tours to take Room service Housekeeping laundry feather pillow request outstanding We did not have a single unpleasant person to deal with Location was unbelievable 
88289,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast had a very limited selection and was overpriced for what was available The room was tiny The bed was too soft , The staff were very good particularly Alexander in the dining room The location is perfect we walked everywhere The history and grandeur of the place was interesting 
88290,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Room very small considering paid for a Queen size bed Glass shelving not dusted for a while and glasses the same , Room generally clean Nice clean bedding and comfortable bed 
88291,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Had a slight problem with our meal at the in house steakhouse restaurant but was addressed when concerns raised , Reception area very beautiful and Made a great first impression on Room quite small but probably normal for London
88292,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Understandably it is expensive due to the location and quality of the hotel It would always be good to understand how to make this more affordable and I will keep an eye out for offers for this hotel in the future , The staff couldn t do enough and were so friendly to our children The book is a really special touch and our daughter reciprocated with a lovely letter thanking the staff and saying we hoped that we could return We needed to move quick through breakfast in the morning due to taking part in a run They couldn t have done more for us and understood our needs as a family which was great 
88293,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The breakfast arrangements don t match the overall rating of the hotel The breakfast charge should encompass the entire menu for this standard of hotel , The concierge Team were outstanding in their assistance and attention to detail
88294,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The rooms are very tight and probably depending on which one you get and on what side of the building you have significant noice of air vents outside your window The bathroom was not heated so in winer somewhat uncomfortable , Great place very well located close and in walking distance of many must places to see Staff very helpful Very comfortable and stylish interior 
88295,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Room was a little small and a tile was broken where you walked into the shower, We didn t have breakfast but am sure it would have been lovely if we had
88296,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The price of the drinks in the bar are a bit pricey , Excellent location and brilliant staff It was my daughters 10th birthday and they made her feel extra special 
88297,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Shower over bath was pathetic No power and temperature went up and down , Great central facility for work at Westminster Great beds clean hotel and quiet calm surrounding 
88298,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The bathroom was very small and the bath was hard to get into and out of The staff at breakfast were lovely but the pastries were dry and unappetising , The view into the courtyard from the room was beautiful with all the lights The location was amazing The bed was extremely comfortable 
88299,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Poor sound insulation between rooms we could clearly hear conversation in an adjacent room Bathroom very cramped for this price of room We had to draw attention to the sticking bathroom door this should have been picked up before we arrived , Very comfortable bed Extremely helpful staff
88300,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Nothing Would definitely stay again , Breakfast cheap and fine but not the best ever Staff lovely and helpful Great location close to attractions and transport links Rooms nicely decorated and furnished Quiet hotel with a feeling of class 
88301,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Small selection of cereals and a fixed price even if u had 1piece of toast should a choice of maybe 3 menus lifts for both sides of hotel rather than 1 with a long winding walk if ur room on other side ,No Positive
88302,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Poor heating in the room I cannot remember the room number but it was on the same level as the Bee terrace We had maintenance look into the problem with it being fixed but it was still cold in the room Also there were little moths flying in the room The parking cost 110 for two nights Overall not worth the money There are too many other places Just book in advance 6 months for other places as they all seem to book up quickly , The location was great It is within walking distance to many sites the tube and one of the hop on hop off stops Beautifully decorated for the holidays fist week in Jan Overall it s a beautiful place and the staff is very friendly and professional 
88303,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Air con units outside were running all night But its London and not enough Tea and Coffee in room Tried calling reception twice but they never answered, Fantastic Location
88304,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Bar staff spent too much time gathering to chat with each other but other staff members were helpful and attentive , Impressive foyer staircase etc reminiscent of a gracious byegone era The room was comfortable and warm with an adequate supply of tea coffee etc plus toiletries in the bathroom 
88305,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Got given wrong rooms and thought the breakfast staff were not very assisting, The location was perfect and the staff were very friendly and accommodating 
88306,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, This Hotel is the best in London words cant describe just how wonderful our stay was the staff are so friendly and helpful and the hotel is stunning our room was spotless and modern and we also had room service at 2 30 am on new years day morning wow i would love to return to this amazing hotel again in the near future thank you st ermins hotel you are the best by far 
88307,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Very expensive at 500 per night but of course New Years Eve prices are The restaurant food was good and well presented except for the green paper seaweed and again expensive , Staff are always very friendly and helpful 
88308,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The hotel was lovely the only issues I had was that our bath was in very bad condition plus The walls were not sound proof at all , The location was brilliant
88309,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, My room wasn t ready at the allotted time so i waited with my daughter in her room Her room was next to a generator of some sort quite noisy so she requested another room which she thankfully got In the meantime i Still hadn t gotten my room by this time it was four o clock I had to bring it to the attention of front desk This was the third time we have stayed at St Ermins I understand people get busy it just seemed a pity attention to detail wasn t there on the day , A very comfortable bed Friendly maid 
88310,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Seems to have shortage of space to accommodate guests for breakfast and the quality and offering are pretty basic , Beautifully decorated entrance pleasant atmosphere
88311,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Pillows not flexible enough to cater for personal taste Noise through doors from corridor disappointing in such an otherwise peaceful place , Housekeeping were excellent and very efficient Gorgeous building Quiet area 
88312,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Can t think of a single thing that could be improved , The entrance was spectacularly decorated for Christmas Upgraded to a suite which made my 13 year old niece s day Friendly welcoming staff everything in the rooms you could possibly want Room service quick and reasonably priced Will put this hotel on my special treats list 
88313,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, There were 5 of us all adults stayed in the family room which was very clean and comfortable All the staff are polite and helpful Breakfast has a good variety and in lovely surroundings The Christmas decorations add a little bit of magic Just a fantastic hotel this is our fourth stay and we will return 
88314,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, We found the shower a bit below 4 star It was difficult to get the temperature right with the controls on the taps , The staff were extremely friendly and we slept better than at home 
88315,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, Comfortable spacious room Helpful courteous staff Lovely touches in the room bath robes toiletries coffee tea hairdryer etc Quick laundry service Very good hotel 
88316,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, They might have been a high standard but they were very small Breakfast was a ridiculous price 21 for what was on offer , Very high standard of room 
88317,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast was disappointing Only cooked food on buffet was scrambled egg sausage and bacon nothing else Could have offered mushrooms tomatoes potatoes etc ,No Positive
88318,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Requested twin beds as we were 2 friends travelling together we had to pay 30 supplement and the room was very cramped Disappointing, Good location for our visit
88319,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Not that much not to like if I was looking to really scrutinise the beds and pillows were a little firm, Beautiful building very friendly staff nothing too much hassle for anyone Great breakfast Right next to tube station and 5 minutes from Westminster area 
88320,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, slightly over priced and floor boards in room by tv and desk EXTREMELY squeaky and irritating , first class hotel with very polite friendly and helpful staff Well located and easy to find Cannot fault the room or staff at all very pleased Only minor gripe i have is that in my opinion compared to other hotels i frequent it was slightly over priced but apart from that A would stay again if in the area 
88321,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, We stayed here 17yrs ago and chose it again because of it s location We were 5 10 minutes walking distance from Big Ben Parliament Westminster Abbey the London Eye and many other points of interests The Tube is 5 minutes out the door The hotel and staff were the best 
88322,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, rooms a bit small not enough shelf space in the shower sink area, beds are great all amenities excellent Caxton bar and restaurant superb breakfast service in the room was also well done and breakfast a la carte was excellent with very efficient friendly intelligent service especially the Bulgarian male staff 
88323,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, Fabulous service it was my partner s birthday and they gave us a lovely bottle of Prosecco left little bee chocolates on our pillows on turn down it s these little touches that make hotels stand out from the rest 
88324,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Attention wasn t well paid to check in requests when made through booking com I highly recommend confirming any wishes prior to check in with St Ermins directly , Comfy bed and great black out blinds 
88325,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, A beautiful hotel tucked away from the hustle and bustle of London Warm welcoming and friendly staff Luxurious rooms with lovely extra little touches Would thoroughly recommend 
88326,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Appreciating it was the weekend and its location it was very busy to the point it felt there was not enough tables for everyone especially at breakfast using the lounge area people having to wait, The hotel was beautiful and quaint it had a really lovely feel to it the food was good and staff were friendly
88327,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Staff Booked a room for 2 adults child to be given a small double bed in tiny room Told by hotel that booking com hadn t told them there was a child in booking My paper work had child on it , Location
88328,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Our executive double room was small and overlooked a stairwell The mini bar charged 2 50 for a bottled water Lacked the special touches that would have made the stay feel like better value for money , Location was very good with many of Londons main attractions within walking distance The bed was comfy and the Monday evening wine and cheese was a nice touch 
88329,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Size of bathroom Small but had everything you need , The location and the ambience of the hotel Truly a luxurious oasis in Central London Loved the proximity to St James Park 
88330,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, We have been coming to the st ermins hotel for 13 years well before it became a Marriott and lost most of its unique character all references to its long history as an important building in Westminster at the history of its name the redesign by an undoubtedly modern designer who designs uncomfortable tables and chairs throughout the hotel but this is not the best we checked in at 11 30 in the morning and the receptionist not English with a bad command of the language told us we would have to wait note Was travelling with a lady of 95 years so we had lunch and returned to the reception only to find out they had reallocated the ground floor rooms with easy acces And a walk in shower which had been expressly reserved 6 months prior to someone else the manager then attempted to offer another hotel in London we declined so after another hours wait they gave us two very uncomfortable and tiny box rooms at the back of the hotel not acceptable so I complained and had to wait a further hour and they found us two other rooms adjacent with a shower but not on the grond floor for the 95 year old lady not appropriate much too much walking as it was as far away from the lifts as it could have been we got into these rooms at 6 pm Madame was by this time exhausted the manager was completely useless and simply said he was sorry the service throughout the stay was dreadful with staff who barely speak English and management completely incompetent we received no apology from the management in a note or letter to Madame the standards at this hotel have sunken a dreadful stay we will not be repeating , It s location
88331,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, This was our third stay at St Ermin s and we cannot wait to return The facilities are immaculate and the staff is friendly and helpful and the location is great 
88332,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, We felt the expectation to tip the staff for suitcases car parking etc was a bit over expected , Excellent location to visit the palace as we were particularly impressed with our car being taken away and parked for a comparable rate with the car parks in London took the stress out at the end of the journey The staff here are very attentive and the hotel is immaculate I was a little poorly in the morning so missed breakfast but my partner said it was excellent and the croissant and coffee he bought up to my room were very good We are frequent visitors to London and we will have no hesitation to book this hotel again 
88333,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Too many guests for the size of the facilities Check in was long and chaotic Breakfast had to be served in an adjoining ballroom because there was no more room in the dining room The breakfast in the ballroom felt like an express breakfast at an economy hotel which for the price per night at this hotel was hardly the case , Charming front veranda and historic charm The staff was very friendly and helpful The location is close to all the main sites and there are always taxis available outside 
88334,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Nothing, Thoroughly wonderful throughout The room was perfect the bed huge and very comfortable The gardens and shared areas were absolutely beautiful The whole experience was very special 
88335,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, I have nothing bad to say about the hotel with the exception of the price You most certainly pay for the location which for a family with young children was worth it , They staff was lovely and helpful to both my children and me The room was beautiful clean and comfortable It even had 120v plugs which was super helpful The location was PERFECT We were walking distance to a huge portion of the city and only a short inexpensive can ride to anywhere else 
88336,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Poorly appointed as far as storage of clothes was concerned very few drawers no luggage rack Coffee maker was impossible to use Other hotels offer shortbread or cookies , Cannot comment since we only used the hotel for sleeping Therefore a very expensive hotel but safe since it is right next to New Scotland Yard Internet was excellent 
88337,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The hot buffet breakfast was poor as you only got to choose from bacon sausage and scrambled egg most other hotels have beans black pudding and mushrooms as well The Jam on the table was used by other guests and not replaced when the table was remade We found bed was very soft, lovely Building and great location for us as we were spending the day on Hyde park
88338,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, We had a room at the corner which was oddly shaped With a young baby it was really small , Great location Close to st james park palace and subway station
88339,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, First room offered very small said to have courtyard view but on the 6th floor this is hardly accurate Breakfast was very poor more like a rundown service station than an aspiring 4star hotel 2daysoutof4 no smoked salmon 2daysoutof4yogurts not topped up very slowtoaster etc etc All in all extremely disappointed ,No Positive
88340,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, the noise of the water pumps everytime you showered or flushed the toilet Someone snoring next door WIFI in the room not up to much 3g was faster We didnt have Breakfast as thought the price of over 20 00 each was not worth trying , The bed was very comfy Staff where very friendly Ideally located for tourists
88341,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Room was a little small window blind pulled down to block unattractive view out of window Would have been helpful to know these things when booking as would have chosen a different room booked a different hotel ,No Positive
88342,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, Fabulous hotel We loved the Bee terrace The staff were extremely helpful after I had made a mistake with our booking and the problem was quickly resolved Thank you
88343,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The eggs in the morning wernt that great I was not offered fried poached or anything like this unlike the table next to us that was offered these options we just had the scrambled egg that was very runny There also wasn t much options for a full breakfast there was only scrambled egg bacon and sausage There was however a very wide variety for continental breakfast, I do not have anything bad to say about this hotel room it was amazing the best hotel I have ever stayed in We was upgraded as we was celebrating our engagement anniversary which was a lovely surprise for both me and my fianc e as I had only asked for them to do something nice on the bed
88344,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The shower We found it difficult slippery and dangerous getting in and out of the tub to take a shower , Very accommodating staff Made us feel very welcome Saw to all our needs and requests 
88345,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Not so much didn t like but small details of consideration perhaps baked beans mushrooms and either friend or poached eggs to be available as part of the buffet breakfast would seem better value for money access to a full English breakfast as well as a continental one given the hotel is located in our capital Staff were friendly and helpful although I have zero complaints one or two could people could ve been more willingly helpful and enthusiastic by asking if we needed any city maps wake up calls or personal requirements on arrival would just give it that outstanding rather than good in this area , Many 4 star hotels are nice but all a bit of the same however I feel like this hotel has more character than the average hotel As well as its great central location a lot of attention has been given to detail lovely grounds outside the front entrance that includes tress and flowers a grand lobby area with many staff at hand to support reception area toilets that have noce toiletries and flannels that can be used and placed in a wash basket nice deco in rooms and a very comfortable bed free bottles water as well as a good selection of teas and coffee a mini bar from which items can be purchased slippers robes and ironing facilities staff came in and turned over the sheets and left a lavender spray at night 
88346,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Quite a small room with a view onto a grey building for 200 night seemed a little off , Comfy beds and great location One of the porters had bags of character very pleasant chap 
88347,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Nothing, This was a revisit to your establishment 48 years later it was very satisfying to see that it was as memorable a stay the second time around 
88348,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Would have been good to have leisure facilities, The staff were excellent and very helpful My husband hurt his leg running the marathon and everyone at the hotel couldn t have been more helpful to us 
88349,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, THE BATH WAS DANGEROUS VERY HIGH SIDED NOT EASY TO GET OUT OF WITHOUT SLIPPING NO MAT PROVIDED WE ARE FAR FROM DISABLED VERY ACTIVE BUT BOTH FOUND THIS A ACCIDENT POINT, THE MEAL ON MON WAS REALLY EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS THE FAMILY HAS STAYED HERE FOR OVER 30YEARS WHEN IN LONDON SO WE KNOW THE HOTEL WELL
88350,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Room was small we had a welcome note addressed to another guest in our room and if anyone walked around on the floor above we heard every step This meant we were woken up at 5am and couldn t get back to sleep When we left we were asked how our stay was we mentioned the noise this was barely acknowledged All in all not worth the money , Amazing location and exterior
88351,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, Hands down the most beautiful hotel I have ever visited Pure elegance and fantastic staff even upgraded our room Really lovely would not hesitate to go back The shower was huge and the entire room was spotless I felt very pampered and relaxed Wish we could have stayed longer 
88352,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast could have had more variety Additional cost for menu items More like a self service premier inn breakfast I feel this could be improved, Location Room very nice Excellent service off staff
88353,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, There is nothing I would change about this hotel , I loved the location the staff the amenities and what it was for the price I would definitely recommend this hotel and would visit again 
88354,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, No saucers or small plates at breakfast Poor signage on the bedroom floors Really don t like the dispensers in the shower bit cheap for such a nice hotel , Lovely bed Crisp linen Good size room for central London Comfortable friendly bar and marvellous dinner in caxtons even if portions were on the tiny side 
88355,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, Lovely hotel with loads of character friendly and helpful staff Room G05 is an excellent disabled room with wheelchair access and shower Extremely convenient for Whitehall visits
88356,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Food is so expensive buffet food are not feel like eating specially eggs also not much varieties , Room is so lovely beautiful spacious well illuminated I like the bathroom as well 
88357,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, We were unimpressed by the bar food It was and way below par for a hotel of this nature The fries were like straw and the Wagyu burger was tasteless and had been way over pressed in my opinion We did not try the Caxton grill so please don t let this put you off what look very impressive on the menu , Staff in the hotel were incredibly helpful and went out of their way to make you feel welcome Beautiful hotel Quiet central location right next to the tube station in a stunning building 
88358,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The buffet breakfast could have had more variety , Impressive entrance leads to very grand lobby Excellent facilities in room Loved the crisp white sheets on the bed 
88359,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, I didn t like that we had to log in to the free wifi every 24 hours that s a first for me , I liked that the staff were so helpful and polite The food was great too
88360,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, felt a little rip off style water in room not complimentary room tiny would not expect a room that small I have tried many hotels in London as I frequently visit and although reception bar etc fabulous the room was disapointing, lovely concierge
88361,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, My room on the 6th floor was adjacent to an air conditioning heating unit that emitted a loud irritating humming noise all night When I opened the window hoping to let some of the sound escape there was another even larger unit in the courtyard making an even louder noise I expect some city noise traffic people but this was dreadful I left the next day because this was unacceptable and when you consider high cost of the room you do expect to be able to sleep , The reception area was very plush 
88362,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The staff in the bar were less than attentive and we needed to chase them But otherwise the reception staff and concierge and housekeeping staff were brilliant , Beautiful old world hotel in an excellent location 
88363,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Nothing negative , The bar and restaurant in particular and the staff are always very friendly and complement the relaxed environment Nicoletta in the Caxton Grill is outstanding The room was comfy and adequate for our needs

88370,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Have stayed before and preferred rooms we ve had in the past over the orientation of the family room we had this time around a bit of a jumble to stay organized when the desk is on the far side of the room , We love the family rooms here very comfortable and great to have a second bathroom Great location in London especially if you re exploring during the day and seeing shows at night 
88371,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Little pricey on the breakfast but a great little coffee shop a block away , The room was lovely and great location for site seeing This hotel is in the business district so less busy on the weekend but short walk to the sight seeing buses 
88372,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Heating in room 107 was inadequate for winter in London Broken window Water flow from tap wasn t smooth Insufficient lighting , Next to tube station Coffee and tea facilities in the room not expresso machine but good selections and have paper cups as well as good quality porcelains Reasonably large room size Nice lobby deco 
88373,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, I live in London but stay in this hotel because it feels like my second home The staff are amazing and i would recommend to my best friends to stay In fact American family stayed there over Xmas and loved it 10 10 on every front Food is also great Best Hotel in London 
88374,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The noisey Ferrari in the drive away only because it was not mine , We loved everything the ambiance and feel of the place through to the tentative staff Adam Handlings restaurant on site with food to die for just made are weekend 
88375,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Somewhat surly male attendant at Reception 10pm busy noisy event spilling into entrance etc Rescued by a Porter intervening Most staff were smartly dressed with ties as appropriate except for one who seemed to be a leader of some sort who I thought was particularly scruffy and who I initially took to be a scruffy guest , Style generally including what used to be car parking at entrance Attention of front of house staff BUT see negative comment Bee hives
88376,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Recurring problem with a faulty toilet and shower in the second bathroom would never get hot Made the second bathroom fairly useless but upgrade fee waived to compensate which was appreciated On all occasions maintenance staff arrived promptly to address the problems Fold out bed in the living area not very comfortable and extremely squeaky Room often overheated but that was typical of all indoor London , Character hotel in fabulous location Walking distance to many key sights and next door to the Underground for those further afield Suite was spacious and clean Room was quiet with no noisy neighbours Provided a room to shower in when we arrived early from a very long flight This was greatly appreciated
88377,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, A very central location A great looking hotel with beautiful foyer area We were given a complimentary room upgrade although still quite small for a family of 5 Included breakfasts were a bit disappointing especially as they struggled to find a table with 5 seats for us on 2 of our 3 mornings 
88378,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, I was in room 630 this time and it was very comfortable although the bathroom is on the small side compared with other rooms Also there was a small rattling noise in the ceiling periodically couldn t tell where it was coming from but sounded like maybe it was in the cooling heating device on the ceiling It stopped overnight , I love the whole experience of coming to and being at St Ermin s the staff are welcoming the building and entrance presentation and decor are superb and the atmosphere is like coming to a very grand home Its location is excellent and the is food delightful What more could you ask for it s a fabulous place and I thoroughly recommend it 
88379,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Liked everything no complaints, Old fashioned elegance of public areas but modern equipment in rooms Staff courteous near tube room 202 ideal for four days as nobody going past the door
88380,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, I thought the afternoon tea was a little expensive for what you actually got And breakfast is expensive too if not included in room price , Staff were very helpful
88381,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Concierge was intensely rude Cooked breakfast was poor Our room was very small I ve stayed previously via a direct booking and the room was fine so the small room is likely to be due to booking via booking com, stylish hotel location
88382,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Could provide complimentary bottle of water in rooms needed another shelf in bathroom shame there wasn t a little pull out shelf at the kettle station for the cups when making tea but I am being really pickie with that , Well located superior hotel with good underground access Good value for money great food with nice relaxing bar area extremely helpful staff

88384,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, I was disappointed about the accessible room which is good if you are not dependent on sitting in a wheelchair As you wouldn t be able to look through the spy hole hung clothes close curtains or turn off lamps make a drink etc as nothing was within reach , The ambiance of the hotel the Caxton Grill and bar The completely accessible entrance and lobby for wheelchairs Overall friendly and helpful staff Quiet in the heart of the city but 10 mins from the West End
88385,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast we were told to wait for a table of 5 and got seated in the sofa area then were asked to stay there for breakfast as no bigger tables were available It was uncomfortable and unpractical to eat breakfast there and two other families of 5 came in shortly after and were seated properly afterwards after a short break , Friendliness of hotel the look of the hotel and the location 
88386,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, I have reduced mobility and after booking in whilst walking to my room one of the duty managers asked me which room I had been allocated and when he saw the room number he said no we can give you a more convenient ground floor room Very proactive
88387,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, It really is a very nice hotel but window view to rear is nothing special just left blind closed and all is good , The entrance to the hotel is vey special and gives you such a good impression 
88388,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, clicked in rates w breakfast but when I got there they had no records of that I showed them my booking com printout of confirmation and they accepted that , Staff were excellent All went out of their way to help 
88389,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Bathroom very clean and functional but extremely bijou taking into account we had an executive room but churlish to moan as it provided all we required for a simple one night stay , Location was good nice quiet area and everything we needed and wanted to see do was within a reasonable distance to walk They upgraded us to an executive room and provided a small treat for my wife a beautiful chocolate brownie on a decorated plate as she had just celebrated her birthday 
88390,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, The staff were brilliant very polite helpful Location was great for us as we went to see Billy Elliot within walking distance Handy as it was very close to St James tube station Room was fab Would def stay again

88392,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Strange dining room Breakfast choice could be better , Ambience of hotel and friendliness of all staff is exceptional Availability of room with 2 double beds that can accommodate 3 or 4 adults 
88393,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Meeting an Amerucan friend who was already checked in her room was large and roomy and mine was very small both paying same price and so it did feel that I wasn t getting value for money,No Positive
88394,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Very disappointing breakfast only cooked food on offer was sausage bacon and very hard overcooked fried egg Nothing else for example no mushrooms tomatoes beans pancakes etc You could order some cooked food from the menu at an extra cost which I don t think was right , Loved the room with separate lounge area Had a wonderful tasting menu at Adam Handling restaurant in hotel Food was wonderful although would have liked a but more time between courses 
88395,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Room service trays left outside of rooms for long periods nearly tripped over one , Grand entrance tasteful decor cleanliness good atmosphere and an extremely comfortable room 
88396,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, We booked an Executive Double for 2 nights and asked for a room in a quiet location either over the entrance cul de sac or one of the other courtyards but when we got there we found that the only room available at 4pm was a disabled room and even that wasn t available for another hour when we checked in there were 4 or 5 other couples also waiting for rooms The room was dismally dark with no lighting whatsoever in the sofa seating area and in addition the ensuite door would not close and its fan would not switch off When we complained they said maintenance would fix it but all they could achieve was the door They offered us a change of room the next day at 13 30 by a timestamped letter left in the room but we had gone out for the day by then and it was way too late by the time we returned , The waitress at breakfast was very helpful and friendly 
88397,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Nothing bad to say If you want me to try to find any negative I can only think of the view from the bedroom over the back of the hotel but even this you ve tried to improve with the construction of the Bee Terrace , The decor and the comfort but first and foremost the staff I had to change my booking twice at late notice for both room and table size and everything was handled with courtesy and efficiency This was our second visit and it won t be our last 
88398,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Ridiculously small as ever elevator 2 3 max Water pressure is not that great Poor internet connection The hotel didn t have hot water throughout the whole place and we werent able to have a hot shower yet they did give us 50 off that night and made arrangements to have showers at another hotel Bit far 10 12 minutes from Oxford Circus Picadilly NO view from any of the rooms, The beds are very comfy Big bathroom yet small bedroom area Really really close to Buckingham Palace Room service and the Bar is fantastic Really yum 
88399,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Room was too small it was difficult to move around with two suitcases reminiscent of cheap hotels in Paris, Reception area restaurant were palatial staff in the public areas were very responsive 
88400,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Interruption for room service even though privacy sign on the door , Very beautiful hotel Much larger than I expected 3 to a room Staff and service were very friendly and accommodating The location to St James Park station was ideal especially with all the walking you will do 
88401,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, My friend fell entering the terrace for tea and the staff appeared awkward and showed no concern for her injuries , The bellman concierge and taxi fetcher were very helpful and cheerful The receptionists were also pleasant and competent The hostess in the breakfast room was friendly and brought a muffin with candle for my friend s birthday 
88402,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The price per night is just incredible in comparison with the small size of the room the limited internet connexion and the poor view of most rooms , Location is great nice entrance but 
88403,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The price of the room that is all otherwise fine, The staff the location and the breakfast it was a wonderful experience Steven the concierge was most helpful as was Roberta in the restaurant in the morning
88404,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, We were put into a room designed for disabled travellers cramped and with a very tired shower room which leaked In a rush for a late meeting we did not have time to ask to be moved Our verbal complaint on check out was attended to later to the credit of the hotel , Hotel is in a fantastic location very close to Westminster We did like the fact that the manager following up on our verbal complaint calling us by phone to apologise for very poor room and reducing the room price by half 
88405,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, shower in the bath this did not match the brochure tiny separate living room would have been better without the walls , beautiful hotel lovely bed friendly staff great bar 
88406,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, High tea on the terrace but we were sharing the space with a wedding party Bit noisy spoiled the ambience a bit , Beautiful hotel and great location Comfortable room Very quiet as set back from the road Loved the shower
88407,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast was rather hurried I had an ac back pain had difficulty in helping myself with BF Although a chap was assigned to our table but he was hardly around Had to ask another waiter for Poached eggs Did not like Digital Radio light alarm was on , Most liked Bed Shower room Bacon Poached eggs Best I had for many yrs Staff were helpful
88408,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Concierge advised us to take a bus to the restaurant that wasn t running due to the bicycle race earlier that day I felt they should have known about that Also I was given wrong instructions for the train I needed to take to the airport I was traveling by myself and had multiple pieces of luggage so this was an inconvenience , Concierge was helpful with restaurant suggestions 
88409,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Room for 4 only had 2 glasses and 2 cups and at turn down service only 2 chocolates left instead of 4 , Room 335 excellent sized room Very clean and quiet hotel Able to leave bags etc during the day 
88410,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Not much choice for restaurants near by and not close to the shopping area Not the same setting as I saw on the booking com , Nice setting and near subway 
88411,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, TV fixed to wall for bed viewing only not from sofa Safe on floor of wardrobe not best location for those with limited bending ability Lying on floor to check contents interesting , Very efficient knowledgeable helpful restaurant staff Clean comfortable room with good facilities Great location 
88412,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Stayed in room 555 beautiful room and bed Tea and coffee looked like they had been there for years and literally fell apart in my hands Milk was out of date and came out green Constant cooing noise outside the window literally couldnt sleep and a terrible draft , Beautiful Hotel inside and out Great Location and lovely room 
88413,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, It would be nice to have had breakfast included in the price , The fact that we were very kindly upgraded to the junior suite The comfort of the suite and the situation of the hotel very quiet and pleasant We would be happy to make this a regular stay 
88414,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, The non affected professionalism of the staff and the bang on the money ambience of the Hotel traditionally British with that I could live here feel Exactly what you would expect from London Everything else is an absolute bonus location world class food comfort 
88415,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Tiny room which was being passed off as a superior room No closet space worth talking about Then given another room slightly larger but quite inadequate closet space , Friendly staff High level of cleanliness and general maintenance 
88416,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast extortionate given alternative options nearby but no different to any other hotel, Lovely hotel that were very accomodating Also it was my wife s birthday and we were welcomed to the room with a cake 
88417,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast was very poor Paid extra for the room for breakfast to be included and then found that a full English was 14 extra each The included breakfast comprised bacon sausage scrambled only the latter sent back as it was green on the underside no mushrooms beans etc ,No Positive
88418,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Asked for a room with a view and not a brick wall due to other reviews I had read Got a room with no view A spiral emergency staircase with a wall behind it Couldn t even see the sky and had to go downstairs to front door to do a weather check every morning Couldn t open the blinds in case anyone was using the staircase and the windows wouldn t open So permanently in a darkish room Very claustrophobic Presume this is because we booked through booking com and got the room cheaper but it was still 250 a night room only, Location was great Opposite new Scotland Yard Near tube station and within walking distance of many attractions Hotel was bright and clean 
88419,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, nothing, Great hotel spacious room for London standards best breakfast of the entire 3 weeks trip across Europe The location is perfect close to the Tube and walking distance from Buckingham Maybe a bit pricey but we got a good deal via Booking 
88420,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The room was too small It was cramped and trying to fit 2 people was a struggle The end of the bed was very close to the wall meaning you had to squeeze past When mentioned to a member of staff they shrugged We paid an additional 21 each for breakfast The eggs were cold and the croissants were hard , The hotel was conveniently located for the purpose of the visit 
88421,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, AC did not work effectively and so it was very hot not sure the staff understood the issue that although it worked it was not effective , Could not be cleaner Excellent locaction Staff very friendly

88424,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, I thought the pillows were uncomfortable, The service was excellent along with the location Our second time back and we will gladly return again We even had the exact same room as 4 years ago Which wasn t requested just a coincidence

88426,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, I particularly enjoy hotels with character The entrance from the street into driveway is very unusual for a city based hotel The architectural features of the upper reception probably from the original build create a special feeling This was my second stay at this hotel

88428,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Breakfast on the Sunday morning as we had to wait over 20 mins for a table they had a wedding party in the day before and all their rooms were full and they could not handle a full hotel they should have opened the room up for breakfast that they had the wedding in, Everything from start to finish
88429,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, The hotel charged phone calls I was sure we didn t make I called my roommate to verify and indeed she didn t call anybody We have been refunded straightaway However I was so curious and decided to call the phone number which they supposed we called and found out that it was their own restaurant I have previously contacted in internal call for reservation So make sure to verify your bill if you call the Caxton Grill even on internal call they might charge you , The bed
88430,St Ermin s Hotel Autograph Collection, Noise travels from the hallway especially on the ground floor View was right up against an alley and another building Room was incredibly small and hard for two people to move around, Room finishes were very nice as was the shower
