367406,Hotel Dieci, My room was very small The wardrobe had only a few hangers , There was a great variety of food for breakfast and the coffee was exceptional I would have loved to eat and drink more and only showed restraint for health reasons The location is within walking distance to a University in Milan where I attended a conference It is also close to a metro station where there are several shops Moreover a bus to the Central Station stops right in front of the hotel The hotel has a lift which is nice when you have a heavy suitcase 
367407,Hotel Dieci, Missed having tea coffee making facilities in the room like my morning cuppa , Single room small but comfortable Air conditioning in room Excellent water pressure for shower Mini bar fridge and Room safe Staff courteous and unobtrusive Modern amenities in an older setting Feeling of unhurried elegance 
367408,Hotel Dieci, It s not as close to the center as we expected it to be and the area around it is not that cool but at least the tram station is right in front Still it doesn t seem like a 4 star hotel more like 3 stars it s very small and right by a busy street So it s good if you just want a nice and clean little place to stay for a couple days but not if you re looking for something more fancy , They had soy desserts for breakfast which was awesome for me since I can t have milk and the rest of the food was good too but not that many choices The shower in our room was huge and really nice once you had figured out how to close it properly though 
367409,Hotel Dieci, Air condition is not strong enough and does not operate all the 24 hours Most of the rooms are very small Wifi is not the best, Cozy hotel very nice design staff are nice and helpful
367410,Hotel Dieci, wifi works fine in the day but very slow in the evening times when all guests are using it making it near impossible to work in the evening , Breakfast excellent Outside garden small but lovely Seating area near reception very well appointed 
367411,Hotel Dieci,No Negative, I liked here all The hotel the room the very nice staff the atmosphere the area of location the very nice energetic was very nice to stay in this hotel thanks a lot I d love to come back 
367412,Hotel Dieci, The furniture wasn t very new but the room was very clean and neat , Super welcoming and helpful stuff I was leaving at 4a m upon my request they wrapped a small to go breakfast for me 
367413,Hotel Dieci, There was a constant noise in room 210 Like there were a compressor or something similar Carpet in the rooms isn t state of the art anymore , Nice breakfast Nice personnel 
367414,Hotel Dieci, The main problem with the place is the microscopic size of the room While one expects generally smaller rooms in Europe this one is particularly small for the room rate It is about as small as London hotel rooms may be even smaller There is barely enough room for a twin bed and your suitcase The free wifi in the room is barely adequate Pretty poor connection most of the time , The location is excellent especially for a visit to Politecnico di Milano only an 8 10 min walk away The bus stops exactly outside the door so it is very well connected to the train tram bus system The breakfast is excellent fresh lots of variety and there is a breakfast garden that is very charming to take your breakfast and eat under a canopy of trees 
367415,Hotel Dieci, the worst breakfast of my life Poor choice non fresh foods staff not present for helping well busy with themself chatting and drinking coffee A total disaster I travel a lot for my work and for a four stars ranked hotre I was shocked, Nothing

367420,Hotel Dieci, Mosquitos flied in the lobby room and garden so I could not use these places during my stay , The staff of the hotel was very friendly so I could ask them whatever I want The best point of this hotel is the location The bus stop is in front of the hotel the tram stop to go the center of Milano is 3 5 mins walk from the hotel and the place of my job was 10 mins walk from the hotel The most important point of the place is the access from Linate airport to the hotel I could go this hotel from the airport in 20 mins by bus The breakfast was good I enjoyed six kinds of coffee espresso americano cappuccino Cafe Latte But I wanted more kinds of bread and cheeze
