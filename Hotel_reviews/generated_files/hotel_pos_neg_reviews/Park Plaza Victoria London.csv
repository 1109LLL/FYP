117485,Park Plaza Victoria London, We were told we did not need reservations to eat at hotel restaurant but we could not get a table So disappointed No problem there are many great places to eat within a short walk down the street , The bed was so comfortable Great location near the Victoria Coach Station Victoria Station We walked everywhere To catch tours we only had to walk a few blocks Loved our stay at this hotel 
117486,Park Plaza Victoria London, We could not figure out how to turn on the bathroom light without having the overall light on Using the panel was tricky in that sense Also our window views weren t the best , The room was clean spacious and had comfortable furniture soft beds lounge chair The bathtub was large enough for soaking in and all room controls would be done via a touchscreen panel The location is great 4 minutes to Victoria Station for tube or rail 5 minutes from Westminster Abbey 15 minutes to Buckingham Palace 
117487,Park Plaza Victoria London, Had problem with the rooms locked due to some card reservation issue Have more reservation on the credit card than the total amount , Great location near good public transport connection Hotel is good and comfortable Nothing special 
117488,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, Unfortunately I didn t get to spend enough time at the hotel to enjoy it as much as I for sure could have The doorman concierge is superfriendly and helpful He let us park in front of the door for 10 min so we could unload and check in

117490,Park Plaza Victoria London, The stuff in the restaurant was a unfriendly and arrogant, Very good breakfast with a large selection of fresh food tea fruit more than friendly people at the reception vicky avi are great thanks a lot for your help the room was perfect friendly room service
117491,Park Plaza Victoria London, When booked through booking com I expected to pay over the counter when checked in but the reception told me the payment was already through I was not allowed to settle by other means like gbp cash or another credit card As London is my last stop in Europe I did a lot of shopping during my stay 3 days 2 nights in order to reduce luggage weight a few old clothing and empty shopping bags were left in the room when I checked out To my surprise I was being charged for one more night for the little trash I found this totally unfair and unjustified , The bed was large and comfortable bathroom was spacious with both bath tub and shower place Room was spacious too can have three suitcases opened at the same time good for packing 
117492,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, the hinesty and friendliness as well as profesionalism of the staff as i forgot my diamond weding ring and they were kind enough to send it to me to the airport with a taxi I am soo lucky to deal with Yahya from concierge
117493,Park Plaza Victoria London, The value for money is not what I expected it to be Prices were too high for a two nights stay In terms of cleanliness I still do not understand why I found my room barely tidied up when I came back towels still on the bed hairdryer as well etc I may understand privacy is respected but that was a little exaggerated , The hotel is ideally located in a busy street It is very convenient for a business trip The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful

117498,Park Plaza Victoria London, 5 rooms were booked through booking com and on arrival the guests had to pay for the room again although it has been paid for in advance using a different creditcard It was highly frustrating and they did receive a refund The booking form had a random name on one of the guests receipts which was not part of our group booking ,No Positive
117499,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, Great bathroom double TVs highly appreciated for families with kids The kids like their own section which is a pull out couch and swirling chair 
117500,Park Plaza Victoria London, The windows are not good enough and the noise of the street is just in the room , The bed was very comfortable The breakfast is good and served in a very lovely restaurant Very very close to Victoria Station there is also Argos a few meters away But the best thing about the hotel is the people working in the reception They are especially Monika and Avi are very helpful

117505,Park Plaza Victoria London, The lack of gluten free options at the breakfast buffet Had to stand in a bathtub to take a shower The doona was far too heavy for summer use Is it possible to have a top sheet and a blanket , The property is just a short walk from Victoria station close to a number of modern and inexpensive restaurants and a short stroll to Buckingham Palace Full control panel at bedside table The breakfast staff were helpful and courteous and provided us with gluten free food each day although it was very basic 
117506,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, Great breakfast Room had everything we needed including multiple charging outlets for Europe and US We stayed 5 nights for touring and the location for access to Victoria Station was unbeatable We could easily get to hop on off buses connections to Harry Potter Stonehenge Buckingham Palace and downtown Perfect for someone with a cane The real advantage lies in multiple restaurants within a short walk that stayed open late We utilized it all 
117507,Park Plaza Victoria London, Bathroom door right against the toilet made it difficult for 2 people to be in there together , Good food friendly staff near Victoria Station nice linens room size good large safe for camera electronic drapes and lighting helpful concierge 
117508,Park Plaza Victoria London, In our room we felt that the shower was somehow arkwardly located behind the door just across from the toilet But that s just a minor thing , The place is really nice and offers lots of amenities The gym is a nice feature I thought and the rooms are quite big The panel with which you can control all room funtions is a nice feature The breakfast is really good too and in the evenings the restaurant where breakfast is served turns into a great restaurant Tozi that serves Tapas All in all I would say that it s a great place for business travellers and those who are on a short stay in London and want everyting close by

117518,Park Plaza Victoria London, We got a room with no air conditioning The maintenance man said the motor needed to be replaced so they moved us to a different room which made us late for an appt The other room they moved us to had air but then during the middle of the night that stopped working also We were incredibly hot but did not ask for another room as that then would be our third room no guarantee that room would be any better My brother sister in law did have a room with air conditioning had no issues, Cleanliness of hotel friendly staff
117519,Park Plaza Victoria London, Trivial things I never take breakfast far too expensive and too many excellent options as near as across the road Aircon is a bit weak and ineffective in really hot weather , Ice machines in every lift lobby a big plus in London Staff pretty cooperative Otherwise I do not really touch the sides

117521,Park Plaza Victoria London, Price is on the higher end of the spectrum although the extra cost is reflected in the quality and running of the hotel, Great staff and hotel which operates more like a five star Hotel is literally 30 seconds away from Victoria station with everything needed nearby including several must see sights
117522,Park Plaza Victoria London, AC is centralized and was not available until the last day of our stay System is completely automated so it seems to crank the temp back up when you leave the room Can t cool the room down in the evening while you are out for evening dinner , Location near tour bus station and near tube station
117523,Park Plaza Victoria London, Room only approximate clean not very comfortable bed and soft pillows becoming to have lumps Breakfast a little too basic almost no cheese and not at all fish and the staff too much in a hurry to clean your table as they were saying eat fast and go Understandable considering the restaurant is rather small but very unpleasant if you want to leisure a little around your breakfast , Excellent position close to underground railway taxi bus and national coaches friendly polite and efficient staff at reception and concierge
117524,Park Plaza Victoria London, Parking is quite difficult and very intimidating as you need to drive your car onto a very confined elevator to be taken down to the underground parking area Getting instructions was very difficult and it involved driving around the block to get back to the hotel to use the elevator Staff ignored two requests to attend to a maintenance problem with the hand basin in the bathroom Definitely won t be staying there again , The best thing about the hotel was the location 
117525,Park Plaza Victoria London, Was a little bit noisy on Friday night however this would not stop us staying here again After all its a major city and nightlife noise is to be expected , The location was very good walking distance to Victoria Station and lots of other landmarks The staff were really helpful and friendly We got upgraded when we arrived which was really lovely

117528,Park Plaza Victoria London, The pillows were on the bed weren t to our liking but to be fair they are a very personal thing anyway and the hotel couldn t possibly please everyone in this regard , Great staff and quiet and comfortable accommodations in close proximity to Victoria Train Station We arrived very early in the morning and were able to leave our luggage in reception so that we could make the most of our day Similarly left our bags at the hotel after checkout as we had an evening flight and still had a few things to pick up before departing Lovely cool piano bar reception area to relax in and have a pre theatre drink before seeing Wicked a few doors up the street Very good selection and quality of food on offer for breakfast All in all great hotel well positioned and serviced would definitely return 
117529,Park Plaza Victoria London, We enjoyed a laid back late evening drink in the bar accompanied by sedate laid back live music close to both the train and coach stations the river parliament buck house and theatre an easy stroll away , First class location accessible clean friendly and welcoming The accommodation was spotless and all customer facing staff polite happy and efficient We arrived by car parked at the hotel in the basement hotel parking and had a lovely 2 day break Check was at midday no hassle and was priced very favourably compared to any other alternatives 
117530,Park Plaza Victoria London, Had motion detectors in room so when you were gone turned off the AC We complained about but Hotel Engineer told sorry that is the way it is The breakfast food was cold angain told that s the way it is Lost stay for such a pricey hotel We even paid extra 15 per day for an executive room Hate to see what we would have gotten if not paying extra at the desk, Location

117532,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, Close to everything 5 min walk from Buckingham station half block from Victoria so it was easy to take the Heathrow express to Paddington then change to Victoria tube train The hotel was totally booked so our 2 rooms were on different floors One was great and one was awful Both were booked as a double room The awful one was a handicap room with no view and unappealing Decor The good one was a normal room Showers were amazing Breakfast was really good variety meats and cheeses as well as pastries Cappuccino and soda cost extra Would stay again 
117533,Park Plaza Victoria London, Why do we have to have hot synthetic heavy duvets in an English hotel A top sheet and a blanket is far more preferable , Hotel was located to close to where we wanted to visit
117534,Park Plaza Victoria London, Roadworks outside all through the night that we weren t warned of either before trip or after we arrived First night s sleep was particularly disturbed Offered free parking when I raised the issue but nothing pro active from staff which I would expect I was told roadworks were unexpected and they weren t told about them in advance as is usual I find this hard to believe as they were routine resurfacing works , Location and comfort
117535,Park Plaza Victoria London, Could set the room temperature very easily But fan speed was relevant to temperature difference So fan was noisy So had to go down one step at a time , Modern room Very comfortable Plenty of power sockets Good restaurant
117536,Park Plaza Victoria London, staff attitude especially when the dining area was booked the staff in restaurant did not want to do much but just inform me it was booked for dinner so no seating the hotel does NOT exclude the management of the restaurant from the hotel the hotel gives guest the impression its all a convenience then when you get there the bar is different and you cant get proper food from the restaurant brought to you at the bar if by no fault of yours its booked I was forced to eat light dinner when I was very famished , just the location this time round I think management has changed hands and the staff are not as friendly as last year and my 2x of usage two years ago Everything is more by the book mechanical now than going the extra mile for the guest 
117537,Park Plaza Victoria London, The drainage in the shower could have been better Maintenance was called when we reported the issue and it improved somewhat but it still flooded with each use and ran onto the bathroom floor Luckily there was tub with a shower in addition to the shower stall so I just switched , The hotel was centrally located to our activities and transportation was easy for the bus as well as the tube The room was much larger than I ve experienced with other hotels in the London area It was great The bed was like a cloud It was much more comfortable than I expected The room was quiet during the week but got a little noisy on the weekend as families arrived It would be great if they offered a no children floor The breakfast was the standard English breakfast which I had looked forward too The dining room was spacious and relatively quite in the early morning during the week Staff kept our teapots full and served us with a smile The dining room staff were swift to relocate me to another table when the adults at the adjacent table refused to control their shouting children on Friday morning Later when those same children were running and screaming through the lobby creating a hazard for themselves and others staff quickly asked the parents to control the children I didn t see those unruly children for the rest of the weekend which was a blessing I really appreciated the staff s willingness to address the issue 
117538,Park Plaza Victoria London, Nothing They did great , Nice room and bathroom with a bath and shower option Great breakfast with variety of hot and cold options juices and breads Nearby the metro and train station Staff was very friendly Baggage storeage was convenient and secure

117540,Park Plaza Victoria London, Rooms we had two were not clean Parts of Brocken parts left from previous guest dust slow internet connection full bars rooms were not ready at 3 15pm , Close to Victory station 
117541,Park Plaza Victoria London, For some reason the hotel had received identical bookings through booking com for two rooms when I only wanted one I only have one showing on my account therefore some technical glitch must have occurred This did cause me some stress but hopefully the hotel has sorted out any misunderstanding I paid a premium price for Saturday and certainly did not want to pay twice , Good location close to Victoria Station very clean and well appointed
117542,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, The room was perfect Modern clean and techy Excellent location and several options for a nice dinner nearby I highly recommend the place Staff was very nice

117544,Park Plaza Victoria London, I couldn t find a mirror near an electrical socket so I had to look at my reflection in the glass of a framed picture on the wall when drying my hair Our room 905 was a nice sized corner room however it was next to the lifts so we could hear those until very late and from early in the morning Other than that it was very quiet and we couldn t hear anything from other rooms There was a strange gassy smell in the bathroom briefly first thing in the morning but this cleared once I started using the shower , Our room was spacious and clean and the bed was extremely comfortable The bathroom was large with a separate bath and shower cubicle there were shelves to store toiletries and a conveniently placed shaving makeup mirror and large heated wall mirror Breakfast was very tasty and all the staff were very attentive and helpful The complimentary macaroons and chocolates in our room were a nice touch We were able to store our luggage for free after checkout which meant we could enjoy sightseeing until our train home later in the day All in all excellent service

117548,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, Our first time travelling with our baby so we booked a larger room Due to a computer problem reception were not immediately able to find our booking But came back after 10 minutes and gave us an upgrade to an apartment due to the inconvenience Stayed at this hotel a few times Location is simply fantastic 2 minutes from Victoria so getting around is simple 
117549,Park Plaza Victoria London, Other guests banging doors to their rooms in the middle of the night , Location for the itinerary I had while in London Room was very comfortable and with a great view over London Very near to Victoria station Very pleasant and efficient staff 
117550,Park Plaza Victoria London, The fact that we would have to book the restaurant even though we were staying at the hotel We had family and friends visit so it was disappointing to discover the restaurant was already fully booked The staff member was very apologetic and explained that they have the franchise and not connected in any way to the hotel However we still enjoyed a selection of dishes choosen from the bar menu Once again staff were a tentative special mention to Josh , Every member of staff we came into contact with were so polite helpful and made us feel most welcome Special mention to Montchel not sure how to spell her name who greeted and checked us in on our arrival at the Park Plaza

117553,Park Plaza Victoria London, on my arrival at 1 00 pm the room was not ready and we were told to wait until 2 00 pm this is in theory ok i know general check in rules at hotels but on the other hand this is my first time in life that i arrived at a hotel and couldn t get the keys so we dropped off our bags and went out we came back around 10 00 pm and received the keys from the reception once we enter the room it was horrible they gave us most probably the smallest room at the hotel that has no view at all i had booked an executive studio and the room we were given was not that after endless discussions they gave us another room which is more like an apartment nice view but very old fashioned furnitures but this overall experience was very much frustrating for us besides the rooms i saw have no similarity at all with the pics on the web site i have been to London many times and it was my first time in Victoria district i can say that there is nothing special around and all main London attractions are far away excluding Buckingham Palace the neighbourhood is not too bad but also nothing interesting last thing we wanted to heat the room a bit as we had a small child with us but the air conditioning was set to cooling only by the hotel , breakfast was nice easy access from to victoria rail station
117554,Park Plaza Victoria London, The European twin beds For two guests they are simply too close together and not very comfortable I realize this is commonplace in Europe but it seems so unnecessary , Excellent location Great breakfast Very friendly and accommodating staff

117561,Park Plaza Victoria London, 67 television channels including Cuba vision Russian tv and Arab tv but not one single American news channel Surprising since a large portion of their guests seem to come from the us Suggest they add an American news channel just not the fake news cnn They no longer have any credibility Also a small Jacuzzi in the gym by the sauna and steam room would be a perfect touch Breakfast is overpriced but great cafe options right across the street , Great location Right next to Victoria station Especially convenient if coming in on the Gatwick express The staff was very friendly knowledgeable and helpful Nice free sauna and steam room in the gym area 
117562,Park Plaza Victoria London, The bathroom was too small and not according with the category of the hotel The AC didn t work and the room was too hot The room service after 11pm was very reduce and poor like no desserts options , Easy access to the underground Walking distance to turist attractions Breakfast was ok not super The bed was very comfortable

117572,Park Plaza Victoria London, None so far, First and foremost is the location If you are from Gatwick airport and going to Central London then look ffor this hotel it is less than 5 minutes walk from Victoria Station really very handy The staffs were courteous The room size is good enough for two people not recommended for family or maybe they have a family room which is different size from our room since we re only 2 Cleanliness wise well the one assigned to us is not really clean especially the bathroom the sink is clogged Value for money is a way expensive for a night well London is expensive 
117573,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, The bedroom was modern nicely decorated spacious and comfortable The staff were very helpful we left our luggage at the property before check in and after check out so we could visit attractions without hauling luggage around

117578,Park Plaza Victoria London, The air conditioning heating in the room was on full blast every time we came back and had to be switched off altogether to get the room to an acceptable temperature Our room wasn t ready when we arrived even though we arrived at the designated time and it would therefore have been nice to be offered complimentary drinks whilst we waited but alas no we had to pay for our refreshments , Hotel was very close to Victoria Station and Underground so excellent transport links

117653,Park Plaza Victoria London, The bathroom needed some fix and the hotel breakfast wasn t rich especially the cheese section, The room was spacious and clean and the bed was really comfortable 
117654,Park Plaza Victoria London, Unfortunately on this stay on the first night I took a shower and the shower drain was blocked and flooded the bathroom and it overflowed into the passage I spoke to staff and no apology offered no compensation offered and no alternative room offered This was really poor and I expected more from such a normally brilliant place , I have stayed here before and it s a brilliant location and the hotel is normally top class The food food is brilliant staff friendly and rooms are normally perfect

117657,Park Plaza Victoria London, I had booked and paid for a large double bed rather than a single as I don t sleep well in a single bed I also asked for a quiet room On arrival I was allocated a twin room where two single beds were made up individually and pushed together This defeated the object I went back to reception and the room was changed for another room less quiet but it had to single beds pushed together and made up as a king When you ask for a double bed I think you should get a double bed , For London it was a large room and it was conveniently located near the tube station
117658,Park Plaza Victoria London, Bed was not comfortable it was broken or something I extended my staying for 3 night but I still did not get the refund of insurance amount that they took in first night as I did not use any thing in mini par but no reason for not defending me the amount yet , Location the place generally was good
117659,Park Plaza Victoria London, The central control air condition is too noisy at the night So I have to switch it off at night but this results in cold morning when I wake up Others are fine , Good location for business trip very close to Victoria Station

117662,Park Plaza Victoria London, I would like more details on what each type of room provides I had to call hotel got their reservation number Had to call the front desk to find out specific details of room Accessible rooms listed would like more details online about what types of room are accessible What rooms have stand alone showers along with a bathtub that was not distinguished online Some general maintenance issues with the room , Location and price couldn t be beat
117663,Park Plaza Victoria London, A bit annoying air condition and lightening system We would prefer it to be more classic Towels and bathrobes were clean but need to be renewed , Good location Lovely restaurant with quite nice breakfast Room was also good for a short stay we where 2 adults with kid Big bathroom No problems with Wi fi It was fast enough We can recommend it for families with children

117665,Park Plaza Victoria London, Air con defective See my other review This is not just one room It is a hotel wide problem They ve done something strange for winter which results in the rooms being uncomfortably hot even on the lowest air con setting This means you won t get a good night sleep and they don t seem to be fixing it any time soon , Most things
117666,Park Plaza Victoria London, Room is far too hot and the excuse that air con is not needed during winter is utterly pathetic You re left with a choice of not sleeping properly because a the room is too hot or b the room is too cold because you had to open the window all night Really pathetic guys Although I love the hotel I can t stay here until you stop making excuses and actually do something about your defective aircon , Most things
117667,Park Plaza Victoria London, N a, Love the location we have stayed numerous times Everything is clean high standard We were very impressed with the recent improvements re central lighting controls etc 
117668,Park Plaza Victoria London, , Perfect location close to Victoria station Helpful staff Tasteful breakfast with fresh fruits yoghurts and cereal they also had full english Clean and large room Our room had bathrobes slippers and a Nespresso machine 
117669,Park Plaza Victoria London, Very hi tech environmental control system lighting a curtains etc which I found confusing , Wonderful hotel Welcoming friendly helpful staff gorgeous bedding
117670,Park Plaza Victoria London, Rooms were very cold and it was difficult to get any warmth from ac unit Uncomfortable sleep Checkout poor with staff seemingly focussed on other things , Close to Victoria Station 
117671,Park Plaza Victoria London, When you stay for more than a night they prioritise room changeover for cleaning which means that our room wasn t cleaned twice until after 3 30 pm which I think is unacceptable ,No Positive
117672,Park Plaza Victoria London, The staff were not too friendly No smiles No greetings I was only greeted once by the receptionist on our way to the breakfast and thats it We spent 6 nights in this hotel The breakfast was identical each morning Their system is not centralized as housekeeping was not aware that we have extended our stay on the last day as they opened our door for cleaning even with the do not disturb sign was on , The room was available for early check in at around 9am The automation on the room controls was cool too Bed was comfortable 
117673,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, This hotel is situated right next to Victoria Station so for the business travellers amongst us this is one of the best places to stay The hotel has excellent facilities lobby bar in house Italian restaurant Rooms are good WIFI is good 
117674,Park Plaza Victoria London, The only small thing I could find bad about this hotel was that in the morning you can quite loudly hear water splashing from other rooms having showers for some reason If you re not a late sleeper though it shouldn t be much of a problem , The location of this hotel was absolutely excellent we arrived by car and found the drive through to the hotel easier than expected especially for London and the secure underground parking was a huge bonus to us Victoria Underground station is a VERY small walk away and then from there almost everything else we wanted was only about 2 stops from the station The staff were friendly and helpful when we needed it and quickly booked us a taxi when we asked Any problems we found during our stay were rapidly sorted and we thank them for that The rooms themselves were lovely ours had controls by the bed to open and close curtains change lighting and temperatures which was brilliant The bed was also incredibly comfy and we found it hard to leave it in the morning The bathroom and room in general were both clean and fresh A lovely stay for us in the Park Plaza Victoria and we will definitely be coming back 
117675,Park Plaza Victoria London, Not completely central if your there for main attractions taxi was needed but still only 5min drive Would stay again however, have stayed at two different park plazas in central London and both amazing would without a doubt chose this hotel with confidence you will be happy
117676,Park Plaza Victoria London, All the staff was very friendly but some knew more then others so I would ask questions at different times to see who knew what , The bed was very comfortable and the sauna was clean and relaxing 
117677,Park Plaza Victoria London, The fire alarm went off three times during our stay each time waking us in the early AM The first two alarms were brief about 30 seconds but lasting long enough for us to be out of bed and frantically throwing clothes over our pajamas by the time it ended Very irritating The third time we had to evacuate along with the other guests and spent a good 30 minutes standing in the early morning cold outside before being allowed to return While management did circulate a letter of apology that hardly seemed sufficient for the number of inconveniences they inflicted on their guests who had to endure all three , Our superior twin room was by far the most comfortable in which I ve ever stayed The room was quite large by London standards and was hi tech with all lighting and draperies easily controlled from touch panels at various points in the room The bath was also spacious and very well appointed The room service meals were also some of the best that I ve had anywhere 
117678,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, Staff were great location too Liked the fact that at breakfast time they made the effort to going and getting the only cereal my husband could eat due to threat canvocer Restaurant had a excellent meal lovely Would certainly stay again Kathy Noble travelled with family for 70th birthday for husband was just next to theatre we were going to in the evening and easy to get to all attractions the following day after short walk was at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park 
117679,Park Plaza Victoria London, I had mixed support from staff at reception Some staff were very unhelpful Buffet breakfast was cold poor value , The location comfort and cleanliness was excellent Bar staff were also great

117682,Park Plaza Victoria London, Whilst staying there was a fire alarm activation at 7 50am all the guests vacated the building but it was apparent that the staff had little or no idea what to do I understand from another guest that not all fire exits were open accessible Once outside we were gathered on a street corner spilling into the road There was one member of staff leading the roll call whilst others wandered round with a list Surely having one member of staff designated for each floor would have made this way more organised quicker and would have provided guests with more information We were outside for approaching 45mins on a very cold morning and given the fire brigade were quickly on the scene it would appear that we the paying guest were basically outside in the cold whilst the staff poorly managed checking that we were outside The hotel is very pleasant and comfortable although the bed linen duvet was not designed for the bed provided Whilst I would happily stay here again as it is convenient and very reasonable for central London I hope that the management will learn from the obvious lack of staff training regarding fire procedures , The hotel is comfortable and very well positioned for being out and about in London

117887,Park Plaza Victoria London, Noise levels in adjoining room could have been improved with more wall insulation The cabinet which housed the tea coffee had no instructions ie the side enabled the kettle to be removed via a door which was not immediately recognisable and the housing was too small for the kettle to be removed any other way , Was very roomy and user friendly Just needed a bolt hole to dry off and relax

117938,Park Plaza Victoria London, We were in a room on the second floor on same side as Wilton road Don t take a lower level room on this side its very noisy as the windows are not insulated well Buses in London run through the night and one hears constant noise of traffic We had trouble falling asleep but as we had already unpacked 3 bags we didn t want to waste few hours asking for a room change which I doubt would have been possible on the busy Easter weekend anyway Check your bill as well we were charged for mini bar items which we had not consumed but the hotel removed them on request , Excellent location 100 meters from Victoria station practical for Gatwick express and to see Wicked at the Victoria Theatre and all the buses plus underground The executive room for three was very comfortable good beds and my daughter didn t sleep on a sofa bed but a real fold out bed the bathroom has both a bath tub and a shower There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room Lots of restaurants in the neighborhood including a Sainsbury which is open till 11 00 and a chemist We ate breakfast at the Pain Quotidien right opposite the entrance of the hotel which had a lovely atmosphere and if you re in a hurry take your coffee and croissant to go The restaurant Giraffe opposite the hotel is open till 11 00 so we never really ate at the hotel The hotel lobby has a nice atmosphere to ave a late night drink 
117939,Park Plaza Victoria London, Even if we lowered the thermostat on the air condition to 16 C every morning when we went out there were something wrong with the air condition So it felt like going to sleep in a sauna everynight during night time And to open the window towards the busy Wilton road was making inte harder to sleep with all the noise But that was the only option or swelter in the heated room We mention the heating problem when we checked out and the receptionist pointed out that it had been like that during a couple of days during the refurburation which I think should be one of the first thing to mention when we checked in Also sometimes the water became scolding hot without us touching the thermostat water heater , we enjoyed the excellent service and selection they had at breakfast even though we thought it was a bit pricy when we payed it the hotel is very central and close to London Victoria station the interior was new and fresh The staff at the reception was really helpful to make sure we got a good price on the cabfare to Gatwick since the Gatwick express was closed for reconstruction

117974,Park Plaza Victoria London, The breakfast foods were only lukewarm and the toaster was a complete fire hazard absolutely burned one side of one piece of bread but left the other sides uncooked The waiter said oh yes it s been doing that lately we don t know why How about take that device out of service before a fire starts We ate future breakfasts in restaurants or in the apartment At 4 30 AM on 16 February the fire alarm went off 3 blasts and then stopped I called to the desk and after waiting on hold was told it was fine to go back to sleep Our 10 year old son was very freaked out and had trouble going to sleep Less than 45 minutes later the alarm went off again but without ceasing and we had to evacuate the room We were out on the side walk for a long while and later some were allowed into the lobby presumably for warmth with the alarm still blasting My constructive criticism to the hotel staff was that it would have been helpful if they had assigned someone to instruct patrons what is going on why it was happening etc This is simply wise safety protocol when you are running a business I was told well there are only 4 of us on staff right now so we couldn t do that When I calmly told the daytime manager the next morning that this was unacceptable safety policy and procedure he was receptive to my comments and we were upgraded to the 2 bedroom apartment Our son had a difficult time going to sleep the next night as well because he said that the alarms were going off in his head I was always taught by my father a professional engineer that signs off on fire safety blueprints in the USA that you should always study that evacuation map on the back of your door while you are unpacking in the room My son s suggestion was to tell everyone in your party the passcode for the room safe , The sauna and fitness room were spacious and clean one day the sauna wasn t heated as predicted but every other day it was great The location is perfect near to many buses Victoria station and even walkable to Westminster if you don t have any mobility issues The beds were comfortable and the Executive King Suite and later the 2 bedroom apartment were very nice especially the view from the 2 bedroom apartment There are two groceries and many restaurants nearby as well The theater where Wicked is playing is just down the street

117999,Park Plaza Victoria London, During the checkout the front desk manager insistently asked us to pay for a free beach bag 250K which the hotel left in our room We ve been to probably 100 hotels around the world and never met such a behaviour the overall experience was multiplied by 0 , Actually we enjoyed our stay at the hotel during all the 9 days until the las day 
118000,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, The room was very spacious and well equipped likewise the bathroom We had asked for a room close to the lift and were in the first one in the corridor The staff were very friendly and helpful Night room service was welcome A very comfortable stay 
118001,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, I would like to thank the staff for everything they done for me and my girlfriend I couldn t have asked for anything more they made our stay so enjoyable Unfortunately I didn t get the chance to speak to the staff on my departure as I would have liked to have thanked them in person 
118002,Park Plaza Victoria London, Towels seems slightly old and rough, Location was excellent for the musical we were watching Staff so helpful Provided special treat for the birthday girl Breakfast was amazing and overall a lovely hotel and facilities
118003,Park Plaza Victoria London, Check in was a bit slow, Location by Victoria station was very convenient room was very comfortable Hotel seemed busy but there was no noise apparent in the room 
118004,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, 2nd time at this hotel great value through Booking com Great location and good facilities The hotel is modern and the rooms have obviously recently been refurbished Victoria Station is a two minute walk away which makes the rest of London very easily accessible Ideal for a weekend break

118006,Park Plaza Victoria London, Spa facilities were not open asked for room not to be cleaned as per option card but came back to find housekeeping in the room more staff needed at breakfast as tables not cleared and food items not refilled often enough , Perfect location for passport office and just a few yards from Victoria station breakfast buffet was varied and reasonable price comfortable beds
118007,Park Plaza Victoria London, We booked a king bed and sofa bed for our five year old the sofa bed was really basic not comfy so we all ended up in the king bed Should have booked two doubles Concierge advised city tour bus was 30 adult and 15 for five year old walked to Vic station and found another company who cost 16 adult and child was free Worth the extra enquiry ,No Positive
118008,Park Plaza Victoria London, When we arrived and checked in we were told that our room was ready for us The room had actually not been cleaned at all when we got to it so we had to return to the front desk to complain They offered us a free drink at the bar to apologise for the inconvenience and about an hour later we were allowed to go up to our room bear in mind this is now almost 2 hours after the official check in time , The hotel was immaculate and very well presented The room was incredible and had what I feel was one of the most comfortable beds I ve ever slept on and the staff were very friendly and helpful when it came to sorting the issue with the room 
118009,Park Plaza Victoria London, Couldn t find my booking at check in the cleaning staff repeatedly knocking on the bedroom door and the price of the drinks and the snacks in the lounge I thought it was a bit of gouging so resolved not to spend anything further Being blackmailed on my final bill into giving a donation , Location cleanliness and friendly reception staff Was upgraded without prompting after an error on their part Our fourth visit 
118010,Park Plaza Victoria London, Room was too hot we we re sweating Temperature could no be adjusted at all Also we left the room for a few hours and our room still had not been cleared up by housekeeping , Staff friendly Room spacious 
118011,Park Plaza Victoria London, My last two or three stays standards have dropped compared to other hotels in London mainly the facilities regarding the rooms rather than the rest of hotel The last stay I had a room which directly outside workers were in the middle of laying new carpets this left the whole area smelling of glue throughout my 2 night stay the cost was iro 760 gbp for 2 nights so value for money it was appauling, I stay there a lot as victoria london location is great for my work trips also I m member of the hotel group points scheme
118012,Park Plaza Victoria London, Nothing would definitely come back , Very friendly staff answered all questions Proximity of Victoria train station and bus station just 100 yds away Concierge on duty 24 hours a day offered great advise on things to do Very quiet rooms and comfortable bed Breakfast was also very good but exactly the same menu everyday Breakfast was also a bit pricey but may be typical for the area 
118013,Park Plaza Victoria London, Staff at breakfast not terribly attentive Breakfast was somewhat dried out under the lights and the pre paid breakfast did not include any freshly cooked food without a supplement Poor information regarding getting into and out of the car park, Friendly staff when I asked for help with the car park Car park 
118014,Park Plaza Victoria London, It was hard to control the temperature of the room but it was ok , The room size was great and the bath was lovely Beds very comfortable and the reception was decorated lovely 
118015,Park Plaza Victoria London, No fridge for storing cold drinks and breakfast could have been warmer , The happy atmosphere as soon as you walk in and the cleanliness of the building No frayed carpets 
118016,Park Plaza Victoria London, Not very organised from customer service through to housekeeping etc Cleanliness of the rooms very poor and rooms could do with an update No air conditioning in apartment so room was extremely hot an uncomfortable , Staff very helpful and pleasant Breakfast brilliant 
118017,Park Plaza Victoria London, Major reconstruction in the area impedes access Hotel has limited dining options In house repair work create noise on bedroom floors, Location close to Victoria close to a good selection of restaurants and local transportation
118018,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, All staff in all areas were excellent The room was really well thought out Great location The Christmas decorations were superb We shall definitely be back 
118019,Park Plaza Victoria London, Overheated room and air conditioning not operating in winter months so far too hot to sleep Was told to keep window open but not effective to cool room and also too much noise from street Should not be advertised as having air conditioning if this facility is not available all year round Got the impression we weren t the only guests reporting this inconvenience Some of the furniture was also quite shabby Not worth 125 per night Offered discount for next stay but will not stay here again , Good location clean 
118020,Park Plaza Victoria London, there was quite bit of noise on the corridor outside of our bedroom due to carpet being changed but it wasn t much of the issue and we understand it must be done sometimes must say it looked good so well done, Thank you very much we had lovely stay at your hotel location was great staff very friendly a we enjoyed breakfast as well 
118021,Park Plaza Victoria London, Small problem found an empty bottle of gin in the mini bar but they gave us three free ones in compensation so can hardly complain , Location close to Victoria station Flexibility when I had to leave a day early no charge made
118022,Park Plaza Victoria London, Night reception team They wasn t able to serve me fast with hotel s bill and double charged my credit card after 15 min attempts , Convenient location very comfortable bed big enough room You re able to choose nice breakfast place outside hotel 
118023,Park Plaza Victoria London, The air conditioning gets turned off over winter Our room was way too hot The window was locked so we couldn t get our room cool We had to ring down to reception to get someone to come and open our window , Very helpful and pleasant staff 
118024,Park Plaza Victoria London, The beds are on wheels and given the floor is laminate wood they constantly moved when you sat on them and forget setting up in bed you WILL fall off Also if you go to the bar don t use the toilet it was filthy and in serious need of upgrading, Rooms were clean and relatively spacious 
118025,Park Plaza Victoria London, 18 for a breakfast is not acceptable Wetherspoons breakfast for two 11 , Perfect location from minute we stepped off gtw express until time to head home Wicked in Apollo next door to hotel Loved this hotel 
118026,Park Plaza Victoria London, I made a reservation for superior double room First room was boiling hot room change was done We received room change to a very very basic room Not the standard of room I booked and paid for Again room change Did receive a room of category Executive room The room was fine but in the morning I was searching for cups to make myself coffee I found in the drawer lot s of food left overs from previous guest 2 huge half eaten chocolate bars and food wrapped in silver foil I expected better from this hotel , Location
118027,Park Plaza Victoria London, No one to blame but me I checked out a day earlier and could not claim the extra day back even though I had informed the hotel at check in , Very good staff especially the Ghanaian man who checked us in 
118028,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, We got upgrade and let into room really early as we arrived there for 10 30 am approx and had a medical conference to go to so we could go and get freshened up before heading off as wasn t back at hotel until the late evening Excellent service
118029,Park Plaza Victoria London, The rooms are of a very poor standard As a regular traveller for business this would be one of the worst rooms I have ever stayed in This was listed as a 4 star hotel and in my opinion it is no where close to this rating They have tried to redo the main bedroom to modernise them however this has obviously been done very cheaply and it shows The bathrooms however have not been touched and the taps were caroded and had green build up on them When you don t want to leave your toothbrush in the bathroom that says a lot about the quality and cleanliness Very poor value for money , They have great Italian Resturant called Tozi which I would go to again Staff were quite pleasant
118030,Park Plaza Victoria London, I booked an Executive Room because it was advertised as having a bed at least 180 m wide so it was disappointing to find a bed of about 150cm They insisted that the room was an Executive Room but agreed a refund of 30, V handy for Victoria station Decent breakfast 
118031,Park Plaza Victoria London, Staff was confused inefficient Ordered twin beds two days before Still double when I got there They were to send someone up while we were out for dinner 3 hours later still not done Gentleman sent up to fix it was not happy with incompetence of front desk staff , Location 
118032,Park Plaza Victoria London, Walk in shower leaked which caused a lot of water on the floor , Excellent location added bonus that you can drive straight to the hotel and park in their basement Staff very friendly and helpful although we weren t always understood Will definitely stay again 
118033,Park Plaza Victoria London, I get that this is pretty much central London but whacking a 12 5 service charge on everything just stings to be honest Also the price for breakfast is outrageous in my opinion 18 , Very friendly helpful staff Nice rooms spacious and very clean Very nice bathroom with nice toiletries provided
118034,Park Plaza Victoria London, Nothing to mention in particular , Very good choice for a short stay in London 5 mins walk to Victoria tube station and central points Clean and neat 
118035,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, We were very pleased with our stay at the Park Plaza Victoria My husband turned 50 on the day of our arrival and a suprise was waiting for him in our room a delicious cake among some other supriseses We loved it and this hotel Also breakfast was excellent Best regards from Iceland Sigr n and sgeir
118036,Park Plaza Victoria London, There was no air in our room the AC was not working and we couldn t even open the window We told this twice to the hotel front desk they said that they will deal with it but nothing was changed , Hotel has a good placement close to many interesting things 
118037,Park Plaza Victoria London, It took me 5 10 min to figure out how to control the water temperature it was not a very intuitive operational shower but this is not a bad thing I was only not used how it operates The towel was very thin for a 4 star hotel but again this is not a disaster either I am aware that I am sometimes spoiled , Super comfy bed slept like an angel The Nespresso coffee machine in the room was a plus 
118038,Park Plaza Victoria London, Pricey wasn t overly impressed with the restaurant which serves like Italian Tapas Courses were not at all what I expected First was literally just a plate of parma ham 2nd was a plate of chopped up sausage No presentation or veg to accompany Very strange Lastly there was drilling in the next room at 9 30am so I didn t even have the choice of a lie in , Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful location excellent 
118039,Park Plaza Victoria London, I understand this is London but bar and breakfast prices were on the high side luckily plenty of local places that are happy to have your custom at more realistic prices , Location was really good very close to underground hotel staff prompt and polite rooms spacious and clean and tidy 
118040,Park Plaza Victoria London, Took ages to find us a room even though it was booked weeks ago gave us best room in hotel they said lights wouldn t switch off toilet wouldn t flush shower jammed on and it was a king size bed but was booked as a twin staff didn t seem very helpful when we had to keep going to reception as phone wouldn t work either to call them ,No Positive
118041,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, This hotel so close to the Apollo Victoria Theatre and the Victoria coach station made it perfect for us The tube also close and a variety of restaurants and coffee shops made it all in all perfect
118042,Park Plaza Victoria London, I personally found the bedding too hot unfortunately there was no alternative so experienced a less than comfortable nights sleep , Everything about our room was good it was clean quiet well equipped 
118043,Park Plaza Victoria London, Bathroom taps and glass vanity shelf were dirty Quilt and cover were ripped on lhs of bed Room was apparently soundproof but we could hear coughing and outside works clearly Remote control for TV was faulty ,No Positive
118044,Park Plaza Victoria London, I reserved a room with king size bed but received a big and nice room with a queen size bed I finished sleeping on the sofa while my spouse slept alone in the small bed When I complained about it the lady at the reception tried to convince me that the difference in the bed size between queen and king is 2cm and I don t know what I m talking about , Location is good and the room size is convenient 
118045,Park Plaza Victoria London, The street outside was noisy and was not reduced by the ineffective window seals The bathroom was not clean as there was make up down the wall near the vanity mirror , Large executive room and contemporary design 
118046,Park Plaza Victoria London, Breakfast is pricy even though they offer a small discount for guests if booked the night before , Friendly staff great location nice room very clean facility 
118047,Park Plaza Victoria London, Nothing, The staff were very friendly and helpful Nothing was too much trouble We attended the cenotaph on Sunday morning and needed to leave our cases This was no problem 
118048,Park Plaza Victoria London, Air con did not work for all three nights Lights in the washroom was not working and the employees there did not bother to rectify nor give me alternative nor be apologetic till the last last night I was there Fabio the concierge was outstanding and helpful, Location
118049,Park Plaza Victoria London, This visit was the first time we experienced a minor discomfort The room next to our room was having alterations carried out and the banging and knocking went on until 7pm I explained the problem to the front desk staff And it was quickly stopped , We ask for a room with a view of London we where given a room on the seventh floor it was fine As we stay at this hotel two times a year we where happy with this visit 
118050,Park Plaza Victoria London, I arrived early off an international flight and I understand you were fully booked the night before but I had to keep coming to reception to follow up to see if my room was ready yet waited 4 hours in total and guests were already departing as I was arriving don t see how it can take 4 hours to clean one room, Location is good and the breakfast was good
118051,Park Plaza Victoria London, I stayed in Room 901 An Executive Suite The room standards particularly the Bathrooms remain poor and have shown no sign of improvement in any of the four visits I have made to the hotel The hotel needs to be renovated throughout to have any hope of justifying a 5 Star rating which it clearly isn t at the moment and also the ridiculously expensive room rate I booked through Booking com by the way , The proximity to Victoria Station
118052,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, Everything about the Hotel we wish we had stayed another night as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay The hotel staff were very friendly and could not do enough for us especially Andrew The beds were really comfy and the room was a good size and nice and quiet just like we requested also a good breakfast selection would definitely like to stay there again

118055,Park Plaza Victoria London, Breakfast frenetic although food OK just Bathroom bad step up not obvious to poor sighted me but worse was the way the shower flooded the floor of the main bathroom making it very slippery and dangerous , Stayed here because attending a comference here
118056,Park Plaza Victoria London, The fact they did not accept my Club Carlton points , I was provided a complimentary upgrade from an Executive room to an apartment The staff were excellent and they were really accommodating to all my requests 
118057,Park Plaza Victoria London, a bit too expensive, the mattress of the premium twins bed was so comfortable I would highly recommend this to anyone who want to have a good sleep after having a long jorney 
118058,Park Plaza Victoria London, Very disinterested concierge staff as well as the door men May be they were preoccupied or super busy , The check in staff was very efficient and eager to help out The rooms were clean and functional Location is great
118059,Park Plaza Victoria London, I paid to upgrade to a queen bed from two twins and got a room with two twins Upon asking about it at desk they sent up housekeeping to push them together to make a King Don t pay extra for a bed upgrade get breakfast there instead To quote their desk staff it is just marketing For me it was an unnecessary 110 Aside from this good hotel , Location near Victoria Station allows for walking to main tourist sites or Metro to anything else Steamroom and sauna were nice 
118060,Park Plaza Victoria London, Breakfast is very limited The sound insulation for the room wasn t good we could hear the movement in the next room you need to pull the toilate flush many times to clean, Location is very good close to Buckingham palace Hyde Park Staff where very friendly although we have to call room services 2 times for extra blanket
118061,Park Plaza Victoria London,No Negative, Convenient good quality clean room with very comfortable bed Nice clean bathroom with a bath becoming a rarity in London Staff were welcoming and helpful although the staff at breakfast seemed to be rushed at times even though the dining room wasn t full Breakfast itself was good well cooked bacon and great scrambled eggs

118063,Park Plaza Victoria London, Bathroom needs some attention Could hear everything people in next room were saying because it had an adjoining door No where near as nice as the other park plazas in London Price did not reflect quality, Proximity to tube and Victoria station Lots of places to eat close by Clean Nice toiletries Big room
118064,Park Plaza Victoria London, The cleaning products used were overpowering extremely strong scent and lingered throughout our entire stay even without having housekeeping come past the 1st day ,No Positive
118065,Park Plaza Victoria London, The hotel is currently surrounded by the significant yielding works for Victoria Whilst there is no noise impact in rooms it doesn t make more a particularly pleasant location , Service at this hotel was excellent and rooms were comfortable with lovely toiletries
118066,Park Plaza Victoria London, The nearby roadworks are a pain It is expensive hotel and the margin seems quite high it d be nice if breakfast was included in this price , Good quality accommodation with great access to station

118072,Park Plaza Victoria London, We booked three studios and one twin room The twin room was classic and quite old furniture which was below our expectations The studios not like the photos in the website they were all different and different sizes which were disappointing, The staff very friendly helpful the hotel location
118073,Park Plaza Victoria London, Cleaning was bad For example only came late afternoon at times no vacuuming as seen by dirt on carpet lacking in refill of tea coffee and water and constantly left their main key card in our room Hotel not at said 4 level and expensive Rooms need upgrading dull and small and a change of cleaning service , Staff in reception and breakfast room Excellent service and information and fantastic breakfast selection Central location just like many others 
118074,Park Plaza Victoria London, This is an old hotel the rooms need refurb We checked into our room and the toilet hadn t been cleaned and was disgusting They did however move us to another room but not the type of thing you want to be doing at midnight with a small child after a long flight , Location was good and staff friendly 
118075,Park Plaza Victoria London, The bed is too soft for us, The staffs are so nice It is very close to Victoria Station so that you can take the buses tubes and trains within a walking distance

118080,Park Plaza Victoria London, On arrival at 16 00 in the afternoon the room was still not ready for my checkin I booked an Excutive Suite which actually turnd out to be a normal room with a sofa I was told that the fotos in booking do nt always correspond to the room The executive suites are situated on the executive floor next to the exective lounge however you are not elegible to use the lounge unless you pay a surcharge of 30 00 Did nt feel welcome , The hotel is well situated close to Victoria Station 
118081,Park Plaza Victoria London, the room was stinking of some refreshing scent But it was literaly stinking there was no fresh air to brethe, just meters from Victoria Nice window view
118082,Park Plaza Victoria London, The only negative was that our room was not serviced one day We got back at 3 30pm and it hadn t been serviced spoke to housekeeping and it was supposed to be done while we were out in the evening returned at 10pm and wasn t done On check out they removed room service charges we incurred for a meal in compensation , The location was excellent 2 minute walk to Victoria Underground and Brit Rail a wide array of good restaurants within a 5 10 minute walk well lit at night The room was very clean and comfortable Would definitely stay again
