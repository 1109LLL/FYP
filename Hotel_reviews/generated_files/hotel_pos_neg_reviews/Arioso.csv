239572,Arioso, Room very small I booked through booking com because you don t pay at time of booking and was disappointed when I went to pay by cash that the money had been paid by my visa , Room was very French Little extras in the room for every Occassion 
239573,Arioso, Breakfast place so small and squeezed Rooms are old and need renovation they are clean but smells old furniture Wifi connection not strong enough , Smiling and very helpful staff location very good at a walking distance to Champs Elysees Opera Madeleine etc and metro station is very close to the hotel 
239574,Arioso, My a little tight room on the ground floor had a window but needed to be curtained The door of bathroom automatically closes tight and the inside becomes quite steamy , Small hotel well maintained with nice breakfast Staff were friendly and helpful 
239575,Arioso, There is a strange thing now in the hotel that was not observed before the doors from the elevator hallways to the rooms balconies are not locked now and as there are the steps from one floor to another floor from balcony to balcony people walk though you balcony downstairs freely It is better to lock these doors again , The hotel is nice as it was 
239576,Arioso, 1 Wi Fi The connection was not that satisfying And even that s a free it might be a little complicated to log in But I only meant the free one there s another option requiring a small sum of money but given that I got EU Roaming so I didn t bother to try that 2 the Boilers I think you might like to check you boilers Every time the water was boiled the whole electricity in the room just went out Maybe it exceeded the power limit , It s a really comfortable experience I was traveling alone in Paris during the Christmas Holiday when I got a short break from college And there re a few points why it left me such a great impression 1 Perfect Location The hotel is located near the famous boulevard Avenue des Champs lys es which is the first attraction of my plan So it saved me lots of time 2 Nice decoration and cozy room Briefly it s almost the same like what you ve seen in pics online So there s nothing more to explain 3 Professional Services Due to my personal issues I had to get up early at 4 a m to catch the flight I ve told the front desk the night before departure and requested for a morning call around 4 Accidentally I didn t hear the first call but they still succeed in waking me up somehow Thanks for help 
239577,Arioso, Parking very limited Need to Pay around 20 euro per night at nearest pivate parking Free parking along the street , Nice room Good Location near to Eiffel Tour
239578,Arioso, A few more choices for breakfast would have been nice but what was available was otherwise good , Very cozy comfortable hotel with attentive staff location very close to Champs Elysee and other areas of interest 
239579,Arioso, very small room but it is a problem in Paris hotels in general breakfast was not included in a price and costs 20eur, in a walking distance to many famous places friendly staff very good public transport connection to all train stations many nice restaurants around

239585,Arioso, Be careful when booking this hotel in the fall because once they change their air conditioning system over to heat they cannot change it back until spring and it can be too hot to sleep during warm weather , Great location and friendly professional staff The free Wi Fi worked great 
239586,Arioso, The area didn t have a ton of late night action in terms of options and places to eat drink but the hotel was able to come through for us and let us buy some wine that we could enjoy on our terrace , We had a cute little outdoor space which made us feel like the room wasn t so small And the entire hotel had only 28 rooms so it felt very quiet and quaint Perfectly romantic for our 4 night getaway Seems like we got a great deal and perfect experience for what we paid for compared to other similar hotels
