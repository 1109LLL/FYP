351449,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The bed cover comforter was not replaced We had to put a note asking to replace it For a 5 star hotel with very expensive per night everything should be replaced cleaned everyday If they ll say to save economize then lower the rate for the 2nd day or those days where the sheets aren t replaced It would make sense The breakfast per person is 20 Euros which is too expensive especially when done everyday We tried only once just to check what they re offering But everything is expensive in Vienna The parking We had to pay 24 Euros per night In the Parking Garage s website the per day is 18 Euros but because we stayed in the hotel the payment was different which is 24 which is ridiculous , That the mini bar is free and always refilled everyday The room is huge with the ceilings too high Those who are claustrophobic will have no problem There are two lifts Easy to go to room and go out of the hotel Shower is in the room Better for couples but not for friends and others sharing one room as you can see the person taking a bath Toilet is in a separate room really nice and clean Loved the bed Near the Rathaus train station
351450,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The glass shower in the middle of the room is just strange considering that this is more a business hotel than a couples retreat The mattress was stone hard and the pillows were flat Just all very uncomfortable ,No Positive
351451,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast selection was very very limited One coffee machine for all so you have to queue up a bit to get your coffee It s a quite neighborhood not much happening around You will have to do long walks or uber it to get to more active areas In general the hotel doesn t really give you a feel of Vienna We drove from Salzburg and upon arrival it was very confusing to know where to park my wife had to go down and search for someone to help us took around 10mins My expectations were higher from the review i ve seen but was a bit disappointed to be honest Wouldn t consider it again , The view from the room was very nice shared and it was good to have a balcony and enjoy the city lights before going to sleep Bed was comfy and room size was decent 
351452,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, In our first night we slept in a room with ants that coming out of the shower We changed the room day after and it was better But still curtains and walls were dirty shower was oldish toilet door did not close properly Above all the rooms were noisy We heard snoring and getting a shower of our neighbors during the night Last day the cleaning lady came to knock our door at 8 30 In overall room was ok but absolutely not a 5 star hotel quality , Location breakfast comfortable bed
351453,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Reception staff were friendly and attentive Room was comfy with a lovely view of the city Worth the extra Breakfast choice was plentiful and delicious 
351454,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast had to keep requesting refill of food drinks and crockery on buffet counter , Room size comfort and style friendly staff on arrival and in bar 
351455,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Air conditioning in the room was awful and no tea or coffee making facilities These are basic things that make a big difference, Comfortable room and bed Minibar was well stocked I liked the shower in the room it was quirky and interesting 
351456,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Pillows on the bed , Staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was very good staff always replenishing the selections when they became low A good location to visit the wonderful sights Vienna has 
351457,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, the bed was too hard and the glass shower in the living area was not good and the drain wasn t cleared even after mentioning this to the front of house staff therefore the shower water flowed onto the living basin area of the room the room was very hot due to the glass alcove this was ok because it had outdoor electric blinds but that then meant you couldn t take in the view , top floor 5th floor had a good view
351458,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Every thing was perfect The staff even put us on the quiet side of the hotel which was lovely Parking for the bikes was ideal And the person who welcomed us had an incredible warm smile which made our arrival just lovely He was a thin man constantly helping everyone with a shaved head and if the hotel can keep him forever they should 
351459,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Very clean and comfortable hotel and the breakfast omelettes were great Location was great too very close to the museums a metro station and tram stops Walking distance to the palace and was very close to where the Vienna 2017 film festival was 
351460,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Everything was great when our room was too hot they put us into another one much appreciated the breakfast was great the staff helpful and friendly Perfect location 
351461,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I booked the A C room but it was not working and inspire of couple of complaints nothing was done to set it right Room is too small and the bathroom which is almost touching the bed is really too bad I requested to check out just 10 minutes late but it was bluntly refused by the staff which in hotel industry Over all very bad experience There was no bell boy to carry the luggage and we had to bring down all the luggage ourselves , I didn t like any thing of the hotel
351462,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Air conditioners don t work in the rooms properly when I switch the lowest temperature it s still very hot in the room and we suffer every night because of this A bed in the room is rather small for 2 people it s not a king size bed Every day I saw insects in the room on the floor and in the bed ants The shower cabin is located in the center of the room and absolutely transparent which could be not comfortable at all if you are not alone in the room There was no cold water in the sauna I asked to fix it and after 2 days still noone fixed it The receptionists were not happy to help us with changing the room ,No Positive
351463,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Carpet in the common area was really dirty Actually I would not call this place Deluxe hotel with 5 stars just adequate 4 stars hotel , Good things are location breakfast and Nespresso coffee machine in the room 
351464,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, information about services not sufficient we especially asked and they just mentioned that there is a public garage not that they have places reserved there not that there is valet parking rooms were not cleaned you had to ask for it especially, some employees were extremely nice the old building with the high rooms
351465,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The pillow was too low A curtain for the shower was missing, The size of the room and it s design The room was quite The stuff were friendly and helpful The location was very good
351466,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Room was quite small ground floor Felt like we were part of hospitality passing all the conference rooms Don t let that put you off Marienhof restaurant opposite the hotel is amazing Very friendly waiter from Montenegro perfect English ,No Positive
351467,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Bar staff uninterested most of the time I e looking at their mobile behind counter Asked for a jug of water with ice to take to my room was told by one of the bar staff that I could drink the water out of bathroom tap I particularly don t like drink water from any bathroom tap this wasn t the point it was a very hot night and I was disgusted to get this response from a 5 star hotel would have expected a manager to follow up onn my complaint Wouldn t stay again because of this, Breakfast good choice of food fresh fruits cooked food good
351468,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Aircon didnt work very well at all 29 degrees outside and the whispering fans of the aircon did nothing Bed is a little low too , Clean and central shower in the room is amusing
351469,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, we asked for a jug of water to bring to the room and were told that it was fine to drink the water from the bathroom tap Water quality was very good in Vienna but I prefer not to take drinking water from the bathroom , Great choice for breakfast Breakfast area was in discrete sections rather than the usual one huge room so it felt quiet Staff were very attentive The breakfast experience was very pleasant The bar area was nice to relax in after a day out Rooms were comfortable and clean Interesting design with the shower and washbasin in the room
351470,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I liked the property Some good restaurants across the hotel I loved eating there, Amazing property Good location well connected to metro I would highly recommend 
351471,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Hot stuff at breakfast could have been hotter as only warm tea and coffe making in room would have been nice, Very friendly and clean good value and great lpcation just 5 mins walk from st micheals plaza
351472,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, A The main reason for me not to stay again is the unbelievable and unbearable level of noise you get at this property Let me explain this 1 There is merly no soundproofing in the room 2 The floors are designed in a way that corridor doors are separating every few rooms The sound of shutting and slamming the doors is continuous throughout the day It is something I have never experienced in any hotel before 3 The staff were kind enough to change my room for 3 times but each one of them has the same problem The last room was the best as there isn t any corridor doors in the 6th floor however I was placed near to the elivator of the fitness center and the sound of the elivator going up and down is irritating as well The fitness center is running 24 7 as I understood from the reception 4 the noise also will be during day time from the cleaning staff So I wasn t able to rest throughout the day To my surprise no one wrote anything about the noise level B The bed is very low and the pillows were very thin and soft Even by using 4 of them I had a trouble My neck is still paining due to this C The shower is in the middle of the room As I was a solo traveler that is totally fine but if you are with family or friends that is rather inconvenient D Finally the breakfast wasn t tasty The coffee machine produces a very bad quality of coffee I d rather have my nespresso coffee at the room , location is good Nearby supermarket and biomarket which sells an amazing fennel soup rooms furniture is modern and a mini bar and nespresso machine is a plus Receptionest were polite
351473,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I can tell that 609 used to be part of a bigger suit with one interconnecting door separating it from the other rooms 611 Hardly any sound proofing normal conversation was clearly audible from the other room Which brings unpleasant experience even it s not really the other guests fault , Great location quiet but not too far away from the city center The restaurant was nice too The staff were very helpful Very nice facility in the room 
351474,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The cleaning was not in line with the expectations I have for a 5stars hotel The sheets were not changed during the 4 days we stayed there were stains on the carpet no cosmetic products were added the water glasses were not changed The room was right in front of the elevator we could hear the ding of the elevator each time someone took the lift Sometimes we called the front desk and had to renew our call as no one answered us On booking the rooms seem to be spacious and with a beautiful view however our room was not reflecting at all the rooms we can see on the booking website we had a view on a really sad courtyard The bed was too small When we checked out we were not given any bills and it turned out that my friend was debited from the warranty mini bar and room service while we already paid for it Do not pay for the breakfast as there are plenty of lovely bakeries around , The design of the hotel was quite nice simple Some of the staff was nice room service We ordered some cheese and wine in our room and it was not expensive and it was good 
351475,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Nothing, Wonderful stay and hotel near from very nice Wiener Rathaus subway station city Centre and magnificent historic neighborhoods And our meetings at Messe Congress Centre are near from Fleming s hotel by subway 5 stations as about 15 min with a great organization for business Delicious Cafe Central and Cafe Landtmann at the exit of excellent Staatsoper or Burgtheater and very nice evening at Cafe Weinmar at the exit of Volksoper after die Zauberfl te Probably the best Operas of the world It s always my pleasure to speak German with Austrian people And very dynamic ambiance thanks to Vienna Marathon 2017 Unforgettable
351476,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The hotel is entered by a couple of stairs and no one is there to help you with the luggage The spa and the fitness room could be bigger But I think since the hotel is located close to the city center it offers an usual size of facilities As we used the spa very late after 9 10 pm we found the facilities to be full of towels and the beverage jug to be empty This could be improved easily I also recommend offering maybe a tea at the relax room However you re doing a great job and we felt very comfortable at your hotel , Location close to the subway station and within a nice walk across the Hofburg and park to the city center Try to walk home at night you ll see many sights beautifully illuminated Modern style comfortable room with original showers have a look at the pictures Complete breakfast with salmon and everything you wish the staff was prepared for lactose free guests The reception staff was competent and helpful Spa with 2 saunas 1 steam bath and a relax room Very friendly and motivated concierge Something really special in this hotel Guests are really kings at the Fleming s with their everything is possible mentality We were offered to leave the wellness open after 11 pm just for us two Something I never experienced in any other hotel 
351477,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Only minor details like something to give privacy in shower curtain or something In breakfast Buffet maybe more cheese there was Great selection of meat but only emmental I don t Count blue cheese and white cheese , Room was spacious clean and nice Breakfast super good Good experience and we come back 
351478,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Most of the staff was friendly to us except one who didn t even smile or nod when I said hello to in the lobby but he definitely saw me The lobby was not exactly what I expected for a five star hotel and the room is quite simple again not exactly a five star style I still don t like the european style of having two small comforters instead of one large one for a double bed but that s just my personal preference , The breakfast was excellent with a lot of options and the waiters waitresses were very friendly and attentive The bed was a real double bed not two small singles and quite comfortable though a bit small queen size The location is quite good walkable distance to the Hofburg Palace and several interesting museums as well as the city center although the hotel is actually hidden in one of the smaller streets away from the busy area good enough for the price I guess 
351479,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Everything was perfect I asked for special things and it was a blast Very nice location close to U2 and heaps of nice bars and restaurants around the hotel Staff was very nice and very helpful I definitely recommend this place Perfect for couples 
351480,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The only negative was that we were not told on arrival that using the hotel car park would cost 24 per day so were left with the nasty surprise on the final day at checkout, The excellent facilities including well equipped mini gym sauna and steam room Breakfast a very good range of sweet and savoury items and nicely served The comfort of the bed and the general cleanliness of the hotel
351481,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Parking in room amenities staff assistance size of rooms blocking amounts on credit card without prior customer s approval etc Unfortunately it was a horrible stay , Location
351482,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I was there with my wife and my10 years old daughter The bathrooms are transparent and in some rooms there are no curtain in between the bathroom and other part of room So if you are just a couple it would be OK but if you are traveling with your kids that would be a big problem When we checked in the lady at the reception allocate us a room without curtain and I went beck to her for 3 times and explained her the situation that it is impossible to use bathroom as my ten years daughter is with us But she didn t consider our concern and didn t do anything for us So I wait one day till her shift was over then I asked the same request from a gentleman at the recitation He was really sorry about that and he changed our room immediately , The location is not bad Breakfast was perfect some staffs were helpful 
351483,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Very comfortable beds great and spacious rooms Exceptional staff They make you feel extremely welcome Delicious food Iwill definitely stay there again next time I m in Vienna 
351484,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Loved the hotel especially the staff The manager was extremely considerate towards letting me extend my stay on the eve of checkout giving us a much cheaper rate than on bookings com The only problem was the duvet It did not conform with the temperature of the room for me It was too hot under the duvet and too cold without Perhaps having an alternative not sothick duvet would help ,No Positive
351485,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The location is ok but is not very close to the city center, The room was spacious the staff were helpful and the breakfast was excellent the hotel itself puts you in the Manhattan mood
351486,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The room had an unpleasant smell but was otherwise clean and tidy asked for a room change same smell in the second room , Convenient location just behind the Rathaus and very close to the centre of Vienna Spacious room comfortable bed Bathroom is open shower next to the bed only glass partition so take into consideration if that bothers you 
351487,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Beware Breakfast finished promptly and buffet was closed Excellent facilities and location Friendly helpful Staff Excellent restaurants close by ,No Positive
351488,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, fitness very small cellar location but in kombination with sauna and steam thin walls so you hear your neighbour s talking, close to city center located in the nice area of 8 distrikt very spacious rooms parking in own hotel garage cheaper than elsewhere round but vienna parking is expensive 2 sauna 1 steam perfekt fitness a little small we didn t have breakfast included but there are many options around tram station and underground just 2 minutes away
351489,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, They blocked my bill for 30 days even though I called 4 5 times and told them to release the money they told they called the bank and they was released they were not There is so warm in the breakfast restaurant that it was impossible to stay there more than 10 15 min then you had to leave,No Positive
351490,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast room a single coffee machine queuing when it is working and no coffee when it breaks down as it did , Room size is very comfortable even so you have to accept that the shower with its glass walls is not in a separate room
351491,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast was poor gym had rather out of date machines staff was efficient but not too friendly the shower in the middle of the room was really strange , Hotel is very clean good location 
351492,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, It was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a 5 star hotel Except looking the part the rest were disappointing Most staff were unprofessional and impolite Firstly I requested a queen size bed but got a room with twin beds I called the reception the lady over the phone was very impolite just said she will send over a colleague and cut the line Her colleague came by and said there s nothing he can do and just pushed the two beds together After coming back from dinner I was about to get into bed when I found bugs crawling under the pillow it was horrific to think I would ve slept in that bed if I hadn t moved the pillow I immediately called the reception requesting a room change the reception sent someone over to give me the keycard for the new room I received no apology whatsoever had to drag all my luggage to the new room without help and spent the rest of the night worrying about the cleanliness of the bed Well trained and polite staff are expected at a 5 star hotel but throughout the stay I only experienced one out of all the staff that was polite and professional Very disappointing and unpleasant definitely many much better hotels for a better price and experience , Location is great 
351493,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Working hours of sauna are 15 00 23 00 I suggest to extend them on demand starting at 07 00 It will be very good for those who are in Vienna for business and are generally busy during the day often in the evening , Breakfast foodservice
351494,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The breakfast was ok but the pastries could ve been fresher But that s the only less than prefect thing i have to say about the hotel , The staff was VERY curtious patient and helpful The deluxe room was beautiful and spacious with an amazing view to the city The hotel itself is a few minutes walk to an underground station and some tourist attractions 
351495,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, one of the entrance of the hotel does not support stroller and the other one I have to walk through the bar to get to the elevator which was not comfortable with my baby I did not notice in the pictures that the levitator is separated then the toilet completely and I have to walk outside the toilet to wash up my hand this was a bit uncomfortable , The breakfast was really nice The staff are really nice and cooperative 
351496,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The curtains in the room didn t cover all the sunlight so I woke up very early with sunlight in my eyes I really tried to close them but the coverage is very poor The minibar fridge didn t work the temperature was the same as room temperature , The reception lady was very quick to replace my room with a quieter one Room is comfortable and well decorated Breakfast has a good choice of items 
351497,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, but nothing special Location is okay but not super Breakfast is okay but rather standard Sufficient but the bottom standard of what you would expect in such a hotel , Not really anything more then what you would expect of a hotel in this category Good Wifi 
351498,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Food in restaurant at dinner Breakfast was ok but not on a required level No person who make omelette or pancakes for example which I expect in 5 star Building was strange more like a school or old clerk building Room was extremely small Bathroom not convenient No pool, Location is perfect It is not bad hotel but this is not 5 star it is somewhere between 3 and 4 
351499,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Shower in room not especially appreciated Bed pillows were not particularly comfortable, Excellent location for our purposes Good breakfast Friendly staff Excellent value
351500,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Don t expect 5 experience breakfast menu never changes staff isn t trying their best to accommodate your needs extremely poor wellness facilities, Great location
351501,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The hotel displayed some signs of wear and tear e g Missing silicone filling around shower nothing major but a shame , Location was great Breakfast was super 
351502,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Housekeeping was too annoyed at departure date Breakfast was very simple could be better reservation was maid for king size bed and upon check in received twin beds room after long journey it is not cool to go down change a room again , location of the hotel is great 
351503,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The reception staff could be a lot more courteous They have a could not be bothered attitude The soonest they can handle you the better Upon check in not much briefing was held They just get you to sign the registration form and hand you the key , Nice breakfast The rooms are very comfortable Good lighting Very nice location close to public transport 
351504,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The hotel was very standard and not welcoming at all The room seemed dirty with marks on the walls and huge traces of moisture on the ceiling No slippers were provided which is quite a minimum We definitely do not recommend this place , Location is quite good 
351505,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, For some reason smoke kept billowing into my room even though my floor and room was explicitly for nonsmokers As a result I had to change rooms three 3 times However the staff was very helpful in relocating me so I thank them for addressing the problem I d say that if you have a keen nose for smoke and a strong dislike for it like myself you should consider that possibility when booking , The staff was overall pretty friendly especially the waitstaff at the restaurant during breakfast The room was also very nice if you sprung for the top floor with the window views of City Hall 
351506,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The staff who waited during breakfast was inadequate and did not understand English well , The idea to place the shower in front of the bed is innovative 
351507,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Shower in the middle of the room with transparent cabin walls looks fabulous from the first glance but actually makes its usage uncomfortable wet floor etc , Great breakfasts with rich selection location is good near Rathaus metro and tram stations are close You can also walk 20 minutes to historical downtown 
351508,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, The location of the hotel is great close to the Rathaus metro station and in walking distance to the city center Hofburg and the Museumquartier Top breakfast with a rich variety of pastries We loved the facilities in the room including the very nice shower 
351509,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Are there any rooms where the shower isn t just behind glass Preferably more private or even a curtain , Fab location Good size rooms Clean hotel friendly staff
351510,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, If I had to make one negative comment that it would only be that maybe the hotel is a little clinical Maybe more colour or art work or prints could change this , Lovely bed and fantastic breakfast The location was great also close to many attractions and all within a short walking distance 
351511,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, clear shower in the middle of the room no room for privacy here i m afraid , The location was fantastic really close to underground links and great cafes near by 
351512,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Our room had an interconnecting door with the room next room Unfortunately there was no sound proofing whatsoever Other hotels I have stayed in have had a double door which has acted to muffle the sound We could hear absolutely everything that was said and done by our neighbours This was irritating early in the evening but unacceptable particularly on the last night when a couple with a young child arrived late and seemed reluctant to go to bed , Location was terrific Very close to the centre of Vienna and all the major visitor sites The room was very well appointed and the bed extremely comfortable I was impressed with the choice of pillows The breakfast was excellent and offered a very wide choice of extremely tasty food 
351513,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The restaurant is a huge rip off The food was mediocre and very expensive , Clean room with nice decor The view was amazing and the shower as a room divider was a neat touch The room is the best part about staying in this hotel 
351514,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The hotel was packed with people some dificulties having breakfast, The room was good with suficient space and well organized Realy nice lighting decor It s easy to get in and out of the hotel
351515,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The wellness area is rather small compared to the number of rooms guests The bath robe should be prepared in the room , Location The breakfast choices The shower in the room 
351516,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The rooms are not cleaned properly and there is dust in all the corners spider nets are a bonus The bed sheets are full of dust Moreover the beds are not comfortable at all Breakfast is terrible due to the food quality fried eggs are like plastic vegetables are dry and cheese is like rubber etc and variety there was always queue at the only coffee machine When you first enter the room you get 2 apples that are covered in wax uneatable Rooms are not sound proof as you can hear everything from the corridor The view from the rooms is mostly towards concrete walls Corridors are facing the street and the city I ve been at this hotel from 22nd December to 27th December and there was absolutely nothing to remind of Christmas in the rooms , The location is great max 5 min walk from metro station U2 and the City Hall 
351517,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Some things could be better the restaurant gave me the run around and hung up on me 2x before I managed to order room service and we had to ask reception to replenish standard consumables e g tissues etc , Central location directly opposite the Rathaus Approx 5 7min walk Take the No 2 tram to and from the hotel to any inner city destination Room service is provided as well as a fine dining restaurant food is good The hotel has a small gym good to stretch and use cardio equipment 
351518,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, bed not many pillows airco wasn t functioning properly no help with the luggage thin walls we could hear the people staying right next to us , Sauna gym steam room Helpful receptionists Friendly staff
351519,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Fair walk to anything Not as close to the city centre as it may look Not all that much within close walking distance Beds are outrageously hard , Polite staff and very nice interior Close to the Christmas markets 
351520,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, We asked to be moved rooms as our first rooms stunk of cigar we were moved very quickly and with no issue Mattress very firm not to our taste but will be to some others, Excellent location Great breakfast choice Large comfortable room Very warm and powerful shower
351521,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Nothing, Very clean and comfortable Beds very good and pillow menu Food excellent really good value for money Would definitely stay again and I am very fussy 
351522,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Everything was really great from the first minute we walked in Nice staff great breakfast in room where the air conditionning was unfortunately out of order during our 4 day stay so that it was rather a sauna Suggestion it would be good to not only have 1 person in the reception at check out time as we were 7 people standing in a line 
351523,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Showers in the middle of the room and only suites had bathtubs Breakfast more on the cold dishes than hot , Location to City hall Xmas market Sauna steam room 
351524,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, They really need to get breakfast sorted There were only two of us yet no tables both days because the restaurants were full and we were left without taking the breakfast we paid for Very very poor show from a five star hotel Other guests were similarly complaining It put a real dampener on our stay and we would choose somewhere else next time , Nice hotel Good location Friendly staff
351525,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfasts were chaos We waited ten minutes upstairs and no tables then had to wait 20 minutes to get a table in the downstairs restaurant we could not eat with our friends and there were only four of us Hardly five star and on the second day we gave up and ate outside even though we paid for breakfast For that reason we would not stay there again , Location Nice room good staff
351526,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Airco Not working and not told about it at checkin Poor breakfast with little seating space Poor bathroom in the middle of the living room with a sink that didn t drain , Kind staff
351527,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The breakfast was fairly limited for a hotel of this caliber and during the holiday season I was expecting more variety , The room was fabulous The view was superb and the sauna was very nice 
351528,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Hotel room was not clean Our shower backed up and we discovered it was due to clogged drain with hair balls slime and other unknown nasty stuff Also room was cold,No Positive
351529,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The breakfast is nice but the not much variety in food The gym only has one weight lifting machine and is not sufficient for training , The staff were amazing very welcoming and helpful The room is spacious and cosy 
351530,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Blonde lady at the reception not helpful overall they tried to charge parking even though the car was not parked in the hotel premises, Location confort room breakfast
351531,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Room was noisy and in need of redecoration I expected more from the hotel from pics I had seen but it looked warn and damaged on closer inspection holes in the curtains scuffs on the wall broken light switches I didn t expect it considering the money we paid for our room , Location was fairly good however not many good restaurants and bars close by We were there on a Saturday and Sunday and all shops and a lot of other things closed Saturday evening and then did not reopen until Monday 
351532,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Staff weren t pleasant at all They took 120 off my card without my consent when I asked why they said it was only blocked in case I had breakfast and left without paying the money still hasn t been refunded to me and it was two days ago I checked out ,No Positive
351533,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, We really enjoyed our staying at flemings The room is very spacious and the bed comfortable It s very close to the centre and the subway station is 100m from the hotel There was a problem at the check in but it was quickly solved so no hard feelings I definetely reccomend this hotel to future turists that go to vienna 
351534,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Asked for double bed and was allocated a room with twin singles Bed hard and uncomfortable Pillows flat and need renewing Room not soundproof , Friendly staff Great breakfast spread Location is pretty good 
351535,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Booked a Superior room requesting a high floor and was allocated a Standard room in the basement which I refused Pillows were uncomfortable Could have probably done with two Expected robes to be in the room after reading Booking com info We had to request these after arrival , Good breakfast with plenty of choice 
351536,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, My first impression of the Fleming s Deluxe was that it was bland and soulless utilitarian and charmless Deluxe doesn t really come into it The receptionist like all the staff we encountered during our stay was surly and unfriendly My room was spacious and stylish though not comfortable There was a king size bed on top of which was an artistically pleasing arrangement of duvets pillows and cushions The idea is that you make your own bed someone having decided that this would be preferable to having a bed already made for you There were two wafer thin pillows and two similarly slight single duvets I surely can t be alone in thinking that a night spent alone in an enormous bed would be better with an equivalently sized duvet rather than negotiating two and risking lying in the middle with no cover at all The room was admirably quiet but I didn t sleep well on any of the nights I was there Breakfast was good rendition of the standard fare but the coffee was from a vending machine such as you d find in a petrol station a surprising and disappointing start to a day in a city renowned for its coffee shops ,No Positive
351537,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, We had requested extra pillows which never arrived , Great location near to Rathaus line in Inner Stadt Excellent breakfast with a good selection of meats chesses breads Friendly staff for the most part Very comfortable beds with large free standing showers perfect for couples 
351538,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Minor bed was hard and took for us some getting used to Gym was in principle good but some equipment was in need of repair , Great breakfast but only the coffee machine was too slow but it is the one that whole Austria seems to use Great location we could walk everything but public transportation was close as well

351543,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Maybe during breakfast all restaurant area would be open Guests tend to go for breakfast at relatively the same time Hence makes it difficult to find a table But the waiting never took more than a couple of minutes , Tram and metro stations very close to the hotel Great facilities Saunas available after a long day of site seeing 
351544,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, On my last day there before checking out I was interrupted at least 3 times by housekeeping starting around 8AM Checkout was not until 10 30 AM so I wasn t sure why this was happening before the actual check out time Also the breakfast served in the hotel is over priced for what s served , The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and almost all spoke English which was a plus for us as we do not speak German The food was very good and the hotel was really close to many things in walking distance The rooms look just like the photographs and the windows open if you want some fresh air 
351545,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Corridor carpets were a bit tired housekeeping staff not quite as helpful as expected for a hotel of this general standard Shower cubicle with clear glass in the middle of the room was a bit controversial , Room was very comfortable and breakfast very good Location very good for walk to city centre and main museums Good restaurants in the area

351549,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Very minor but our room had free bar which was excellent if you liked soft drinks and beer It would have been a bonus to have wine in the bar We were provided with one pillow each which was as flat as a pancake but another pillow was provided , Breakfast was excellent very varied Rooms large and modern and very comfy bed

351557,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Room service was not available and they even hung up the phone twice then third time said we ate too busy phone back in an hour If room service is open then they shold cater fully for it The time I was trying to order was not an unreasonable time In no other hotel have I ever had such an issue , The location is really good and the hotel is clean

351561,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Fitness area is very very very insufficient Lacking lots of equipment and does not even have dumbbells Definitely needs an improvement Also we have requested an early check in a week before our arrival but no one ever has contacted about it and once we arrived they haven t done anything about it there either , Location is very good If you came by train you ll have to go Rathaus station Room is very clean and staff is very kind

351563,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Smokers Every time we ate outside we managed to sit down wind of smokers , We paid extra for a room with a balcony which was a lovely place to sit after a very busy day walking around Vienna We don t eat a lot for breakfast so didn t eat in the hotel but made our way to the Museum Quater 5 minutes walk where you can get an excellent value breakfast brunch and watch the world go by before visiting the various museums in the area We went on the Red Bus hop off and on bus but with so much to see we didn t get to hop off on the Blue Route If you want to see Klints Kiss its at the Belvedere Palace not the Leopole Museum
351564,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Not to much information by the receptionists, We re very happy with Mr Mauricio he was very helpful and kind and the best professional we met in the reception desk and the breakfast was great Also the room and views were really nice
351565,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, There was some confusion when i checked out as they were going to charge me for breakfast even though it was part of my room charge but it was taken off my bill, Great location near the rathaus and short walk to the city centre and main attractions I had a room with a balcony with city view and a complimentary minibar The shower was a glass box so if you dont mind showering in front of someone then thats ok but i was staying alone so didnt mind 
351566,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Very Nice Hotel Extremely close to the center of the city Very clean Great Breakfast Definitely a great option for those travelers with a restricted budget

351568,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I really hated that the shower in inside the room and made of glass for the money I paid for i expected at least coffee tea would be available inside the room , what i liked about it is that the rooms were cleaned 
351569,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Bed rubber or plastic mattress protector too soft pillows pillow menu not existing got additional pillows, Breakfast wifi location ambience of the hotel staff Excellent quality of food 
351570,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, no access to hotel on fridays as there is a local market and the entire road is blocked be prepared to walk 300m with your suitcase to check in check in is chaos when groups arrive no system of managing checkin waiting in line for 30 odd minutes and gave up beds are not of international standard more like camping beds fit for a YMCA was twice given keys to a twin bed room as requested in advance only to shlepp all the way to the room to find a double bed staff mentioned that the computer doesn t show correct meds in the room what staff seem mostly new underlined and out of their depth for a hotel that pitches itself in this category way too expensive for service standard of rooms and location, breakfast buffet
351571,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Staff not overly helpful no concierge Booking issue with Tour front desk agent said our reservation could not be made as it was full When we called the tour company they had a reservation in our name Agent was quite rude and argumentative saying it s not possible In the end we had our voucher and went on the tour , Location was central and property was clean but dated Room service was prompt
351572,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I reach the hotel at 12 afternoon after traveling almost more than 10 hours and they didnt allow me to checkin until 3 pm Some of the reception staff Rude, Location Room Breakfast
351573,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, This is not a 5star Dirty carpets with stains all over in rooms and the hallways door shields damaged Unfriendly nonflexible personal at the front desk Geographic location is good but since I am travelling to Vienna several times a year I know there are many better alternatives around for the same or even better prize Thus never again ,No Positive
351574,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I paid extra for a 6th floor room to have a balcony The handle was broken on the balcony door and the staff seemed a bit indifferent and had I not pushed they would have gladly seen me stay in the room with no access In the end they moved me to a new room after one night but did not offer any compensation for the first night The shower flooded and despite letting front desk staff know they never fixed it So every morning I threw every towel in the room on the floor so try to prevent the hardwood from being destroyed On checkout they did not put on the mini bar charges I had but did charge a hotel bar change to my bill that was not mine In the end they comped the mini bar and I am waiting for a credit on my credit card for the bar charge , view from 6th floor free breakfasts fast internet nice hotel
351575,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Staff was very friendly and helpful in providing information on the city Location was excellent so many sites to see within a very reasonable radius of the hotel and it is also right by a subway stop Bed was incredibly comfortable and breakfast selection and quality was high We would definitely stay here again 
351576,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, No slippers or bathrobe in the room Slippers not provided even in the sauna area No swimming pool and fitness area is very tiny , Breakfast was good with different choices Staff is helpful but they dont smile 
351577,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I always miss my pillow , Ideally located by the ring and just at the back of the Rathaus so that you can have impressive views Breakfast is very complete and the staff at the restaurant are all enthusiastic and friendly Rooms are very comfortable with nice details like coffee in the room or nice shower with views Very helpful team at reception and great management of this team Our second time at the Fleming s We ll be back 
351578,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, not so near to the city center you need to walk 15 20 minutes to the main part of the city there s no parking in the hotel you need to park 2 blocks away and pay 25 Euro day which is not nice for a 5 stared hotel , high ceiling of the room is unique 
351579,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, shower was glass box in the main room the drain did not work properly and it smelled stale luckily only when inside the shower cubicle There were two light bulbs not working in the bathroom area and these were not replaced during the 4 nights of my stay Hotel tried to charge me 20 euros a head for breakfast on checkout even though my booking included breakfast luckily I noticed this and the bill was sorted out Carpet in both rooms was stained and could do with a deep clean sound travelled between our two rooms due to a connecting door I could hear every sound my daughters made not so bad for a family but a disaster if you were not related The door was locked which did not make sense, Building dated to 1910 but had been nicely updated Breakfast was lovely with great choice and very fresh bread etc so much on offer that we could skip lunch most days Room very spacious with high ceilings Separate toilet which was spotlessly clean Location was excellent very close to the museum district with great shops and a supermarket nearby Oberlaa cake shop and various artisan coffee shops and bars Apples offered and minibar and safe in room
351580,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast is expensive The walls of the shower stall are transparent glass panes Totally zero privacy , Restaurant staff were attentive Location is close to a metro line 
351581,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Reception staff can improve its friendliness , We enjoyed very good food in the hotel restaurant We found very nice and comfortable facilities Hotel has a very convenient location 
351582,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Our double bed had 2 separate small duvets which was not comfortable Also the hotel seems understaffed in the restaurants and reception in the evenings I would stay in another hotel in Vienna next time, good location nice restaurants near the hotel good shower
351583,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Good but rather simple five star hotel Nice location friendly stuff Was a nice surprise to receive a complimentary cake for my birthday The only minus for me was the breakfast the choice of food was great but everything looked not very fresh especially vegetables
351584,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I thought breakfast was expensive 20 euros per person I didn t pay so can t comment on the choice , Upgrade to a city view room the balcony is such a great feature The shower has a digital display great feature 2 minute walk from Rathaus U Bahn stop 
351585,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Swimming pool missing, The front office team especially Mr Harry Very calm and serene location vicinity to shopping street mariahilfer strasse
351586,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, My room was dusty and not properly cleaned even when I complained on the 4th of 7th day In fact no vacuum cleaning was carried out for a whole week Experts recommend that carpets and rugs be vacuumed at least two times a week and more often in high traffic areas like hotels , The barmen as well as front desk guys were helpful and polite The hotel is in a nice location 
351587,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The shower and toilet are in two separate rooms The shower is just around the corner in the bedroom bit strange , Comfortable clean rooms with exceptionally comfortable bed and duvet Staff were super helpful and very friendly Great location 10 min stroll to the museum quarter 15 mins to St Stephen s Carhedral 
351588,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Those modern pillows which flattens out as soon as you lay on them are useless , This is not type of hotel for bringing your kids Due to luxurious interior design of room especially colors and shower in the middle of the room this is more of a sex hotel Perfect for bringing your girlfriend wife or mistress whatever you prefer for a erotic weekend It will make your stay very pleasant 
351589,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, 1 Card authorisation payment policy is preposterous An amount equal to a 4 night stay was blocked although I have booked and staid for only two nights the staff s explanation as to why this happened was virtually non existent The hotel then charged separately may I add the amount for the stay without releasing the previously blocked money I had to wait 10 days for the bank to release it It soured a bit the trip as I had less money to spend during the stay 2 Room had a moldy smell due to the in room shower Insufficient space for storing personal care items 3 No slippers bathrobe unacceptable for a hotel with deluxe in its name and for its star rating 4 Cleaning crew came after 4 PM 5 Poor quality personal care items , 1 Location is great within walking distance of Rathaus 2 Pillows and bed excellent 
351590,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, There was no provision of water inside toilet , Location is great with just outside the hotel Tram stop and underground train at 100 to 150 meter Excellent breakfast menu

351592,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The selection for breakfast could be better Cold and not tasty scrambled eggs In general the breakfast is not like in 5 I would say 4 breakfast , The staff at the reception desc was very helpful Amazing room with terrace view on the last floor I would say that made our holidays more memorable And of course the location of the hotel is perfect Right in the city center Perfect for leisure travelers 
351593,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Room far too hot We had a top floor room with large window and it was like a conservatory with sun shinning through Air con did not cool room Room small and not good set up for shower Would be much better with seperate bath shower room , Location Balcony Breakfast 
351594,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, glass shower cabin in the middle of the room will not be to everyone s liking , location is very good just outside city centre but within walking distance of everything public transport also very accessible good breakfast 
351595,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast was busy which resulted in tables not cleared so no where to sit Staff needed to be asked to clear a space , The room was fantastic Spacious comfortable bed and much needed air con It was lovely and clean in the hotel and the location was great Very easy to get to all the sights either by walking or tube Good breakfast options 
351596,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Stayed on arrival in Vienna and really liked it so booked for our transit back through one week later I should have checked but assumed price and conditions would be same one week apart but no This stay was dearer AND there was no breakfast included they wanted 20 Euros per head for 4 of us when previous stay included breakfast Showed the difference to the staff but response was that s what you booked No negotiation possible It took the edge of our previous stay ,No Positive
351597,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The internet didn t work except in the lobby where it only worked properly between 4 am and 6 am Very difficult to get necessary stuff done in that circumstance Also no A C so we had to sleep with the windows open and carriages and tourists were lively drinking trotting well into the wee hours of the morning , The staff was really lovely friendly patient helpful polite The location is perfect for walking to mozart s house and the side streets have cute shops open until 5 pm 
351598,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The receptionist was incredibly rude and unhelpful on check in She didn t greet us politely and asked us no questions or offered any advice on hotel facilities or about our stay in Vienna She really let the hotel down because it left a poor first impression and made the place feel very cold I can only imagine that extra training is required , Room was nice and quiet and on a high floor as requested 
351599,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast don t cover wide range as a five star hotel Wish also to include halah food , Very Friendly staff with multi cultural background languages Nespresso cafe machine in room 
351600,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I think the breakfast was a littlebit overpriced It was good but not worth 20 , This hotel was the first stop on out honeymoon We arriwed on 3 7 around 8 p m and there was this very friendly man at the reception I told him that we are on our honeymoon and he gave us deluxe room he was very very sweet and nice so I hope this rewiev reaches him The location was good and the hotel was extra comfortable Thank you 
351601,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The service in general are very unfriendly mostly the people from reception We had a difficulty and they were not helpfull at all neither friendly,No Positive
351602,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, 20 for breakfast was ridiculous There are other breakfast places ex cafe rathaus just around the corner providing you with an excellent breakfast and fast service for just 7 , Large and clean room Excellent location Street side parking just outside hotel was free the entire weekend Otherwise parking garage would have costed a small fortune Hotel offered a substantially reduced price this period hence very good value for money Free wifi worked without problems 
351603,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Receiption female were not friendly more of Rude there is a possibility they dont understand English but There was one Male very friendly polite and managed to solve on their behalf to most customers i saw him while seating at lobby , Room was good size bedsheet Towel were very white clean and breakfast was very nice as well well organized
351604,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, None , I love everything the staff the beauty of the hotel the rooms are amazing What a touch The glass shower in the room The rooms are neat and tidy The location is brilliant You are just a walk away from the sights of Vienna 
351605,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Having booked two rooms one for our 40 year old daughter it would have been nice had we been allowed to park for free , Great location extremely helpful friendly staff
351606,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The standard Room is small for a luxury hotel Shower in the center of the room and hardly any place to save your personal care items Bed is small and for us a little to firm Consider an upgrade for some more luxury , Good location just outside the city ring All interesting places for us on walking distance Variation of good local restaurants just around the corner Good breakfast buffet 
351607,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Spa is Small but good as wasn t busy once we were in , Staff Score should be 20 out of 10 Super friendly and helpful from check in until check out Liked the High ceiling room and very good breakfast 
351608,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I didn t like having my credit card charged 387 at check in then being charged the room price of 209 on top of that again making for a total of 596 When challenged the reception staff were surly and unhelpful with the exception of the manager who did what he could to try to rectify the situation It was four days later before the money was returned to our account , A luxury hotel very close to the centre of Vienna 
351609,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Difficulties with card authorization and long period for deblocking the amount afterwards , Very nice clean hotel with modern equipment and really comfortable bed 
351610,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Bad welcoming staff no manners booked with indication queen bed given 2 bunk beds Needed to change a room Asked for a late cleaning of a room left please clean our room but they forgot Instead the card on the door was flipped to do not disturb Very soft pillows no extra in the room , The hotel is new and has a good location spacious rooms 
351611,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The shower in the middle of the room was a bit odd but we got used to it , The breakfast is fantastic But it took us a while to realise that breakfast can be take in two locations The man who helped us with the luggage when we arrived went well beyond the call of duty and deftly got us out of a sticky situation 
351612,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Nothing, Breakfast was delicious Staff were very helpful and friendly This is our second stay at this hotel chain so we knew what to expect glass shower in the room It is near an underground station didn t come up on Google maps though convenient for getting to the museums 
351613,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Agree with another comment about provision of a kettle for tea and not just a coffee machine , Centrally located near the Rathaus convenient for the U2 Underground trams and Airport bus in front of Rathaus Very comfortable 6th floor city view would be highly recommended Quiet considering city location Breakfast was fantastic continental and a selection of cooked bacon scrambled egg and sausages smoked salmon 
351614,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The air conditioning wasn t working efficiently , Location is excellent handy to the Metro and within easy walking distance to all the main attractions Staff were very helpful and the rooms are very nice 
351615,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, We both woke up from the sun burning in our room before 6 in the morning Curtains were closed airconditioning was on 20 degrees but it felt like over 30 Not really acceptable for a according to booking com 5 hotel although their website shows 4 Also missed coffee thee making facilities in the room , Nicely decorated spacious room with a great view on City hall In room shower covered by a glass door only might not be ideal when travelling with a colleague but for us as a couple it was fine Beds were very comfy 
351616,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Very modern comfortable and very clean We didn t eat in the restaurant but it looked amazing The staff were very friendly and even looked after our luggage for the day after check out so we could continue to enjoy the town Fantastic location 
351617,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Unfriendly receptionist the tall lady with glasses We somehow felt racially discriminated We were very polite towards her the whole time but did not once feel that she was willing to assist us in anyway We also felt cheated by the hotel or this same receptionist because when we checked in we were told by this lady 3 times that our room included breakfast I believe I asked her once and my husband asked her twice more just to make sure and she said yes Somehow when we checked out another male receptionist asked if we had breakfasts and of course we said yes Then he said they would have to charge us 20 euros per person per breakfast we stayed for 3 nights so 120 euros extra in total because breakfast was not included We were quite shocked to hear that Then my husband explained to him that we were told when we were checking in that it was included but that didn t help and we did not want to argue because we had no proof of what was said to us during our check in So we just paid for it anyway We really felt tricked into paying extra money for what could have been some nicer cheaper breakfasts in other local coffee shops restaurants outside the hotel Very bad experience indeed , The room was nice clean and quiet Good location 
351618,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The room was not exposed to the sun the window view was internal room to room room was really dark like living underground It was very depressing , It was very clean 
351619,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Fridge did not work basically a box with a light single pillow no neck support More towels required as the one towel did not dry in time for morning shower from the night before Reception never asked if I enjoyed my stay or not and there was no other guests waiting , Hotel was spotless Ten minutes walk to St Stephens Cathedral 
351620,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, shower in room next to bed Who wants to watch someone in the shower Don t answer that Uck small dark room expensive for what it was, Location secure bike lock up area for night
351621,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Poor air con Bed was hard as to my taste and thus not comfortable for me but maybe other people like harder beds Also two small blankets instead of one large I was using one of those to soften the bed so that was helpful at the end The pillows way too soft and flat I also had an impression that the bed linen was not changed on one of the days Personnel very cold except one girl who was pleasant I forgot the toothbrush and they didn t have any at the reception and everything was closed so I couldn t buy one They said something like we are fully booked and everyone asked for a toothbrush so we ran out of kits I ve asked the next day out of curiosity but the answer was the same So make sure you don t forget your toothbrush at home if you plan to stay at this hotel , The glass shower was probably the only thing I liked about this hotel And the size of the room was good Otherwise very regular place with no particular vibe Good price was kind of conciliation but probably I could have booked something more interesting with the same money 
351622,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The view wasn t spectacular but I imagine if you specify you want a view they will accommodate you , Wonderful stay staff were extremely helpful the room was superb with cleanliness to a very high standard and with a luxuriously comfortable bed we couldn t fault it We will definitely stay here everytime we are in Wein Highly recommended 
351623,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Breakfast superb room comfy and fresh towels every day easy to access local transport No complaints would stay there again Extra pillows if needed
351624,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The shower in the middle of the bedroom was odd to say the least For couples it would be fine but we were friends sharing a room My friend refused to shower for the first day as she found it too weird All it needs is a curtain to divide the room so that there is the option of having a private shower , This a modern hotel decorated to a high standard with a restaurant attached giving a feeling of a mid sized high class hotel at reasonable prices The location was perfect slightly out of the tourist areas with coffee shops and places to eat nearby but a stones throw away from Parliament the Museum District areas around the University and most other tourist locations It was nice to have a gym and steam room Although the gym is small it is not busy 
351625,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, n a, 6th floor costs a bit more but was well worth it for the beautiful wall of windows leading to the balcony that overlooks the city It was beautiful The room was clean and well equipped with nespresso machine The bed was comfortable the shower was great with digital temp controls and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful Location was excellent as well Not embedded directly in the tourist zone but a 15 minute walk to all of the action and a half block from a metro stop On a nice side street served by the 2 tram with a Spar on the corner coffee shop across the way and numerous restaurants just steps away By the way around the corner is a restaurant called centimeter with a dish called the meter that is a trough of 6 Austrian dishes 
351626,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Room service should be open later We found after returning from the opera that we couldn t get a bite to eat, We found everything at this hotel to a great standard 
351627,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Food quality and price private shower bathroom would be nice comfier beds tea and coffee making facilities in rooms would have been appreciated , Location was good for walking into Vienna centre 
351628,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, It wasn t an issue for me as I was a solo traveller but the shower and vanity are in the bedroom the bathroom is actually this is just a toilet with a door , Centrally located comfortable room
351629,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, They held 2x the room cost for hostage deposit right off the bat Thankfully I caught it right away or it would have been a disaster They don t have do not disturb signs We got walked in every morning by the cleaning crew , Beautiful room with access to the roof Had a patio that was enclosed with no future Why this could be an opportunity to have room service Wifi was easy and fast Room 610
351630,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The hotel is so noisy couldn t sleep the entire night and when I booked I asked for a quiet room yet the staff was so rude to The room stinks Dirty smell ,No Positive
351631,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Not really a problem to us but the Hotel is more geared up to the business market with various meetings conferences being held when we stayed The Austrian approach can be a little on the formal side but perhaps here a little more so due to the nature of the main business, The breakfasts were excellent as was the cleanliness of our room The Deluxe package included a free mini bar although we did no more than have a few beers during our 4 night stay it was a nice touch The location is pretty good a short walk from the Rathaus and beyond that the City centre 
351632,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Had to wait for a table for breakfast one morning but only for a couple of minutes , This hotel is ideally located for a long weekend stay in Vienna located close to the U Bahn airport transfers with decent restaurants close by airport transfers Our room was spotlessly clean comfortable and the Wi Fi was fine Lots of choice for breakfast and really helpful attentive staff I would certainly use this hotel again when in Vienna 
351633,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast was great lots of choice but all cereals had sugar in them No plain museal No problem at all if you like your Meat bacon Eggs breads fruit juice salads cold meats etc Also they had lots of cereals to choose from but all sugared up , Staff and location The people just really tried hard and it made it a very pleasant stay particularly after a long drive across Austria to arrive they took over the car from us immediately so we could go to the room and relax 
351634,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Only having single beds Needed extra pillows 1 was not enough Originally being put in a room with only 1 single bed Then being put in a smoking room when asked not to be 1 receptionist we found less than accommodating and not particullaly helpfull Not enough milk for coffee and tea , Coffee machine in room Free Wifi Quiet room with no outside noise Hotels appearance Breakfast
351635,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Staff is not very friendly WiFi needs to be reconnected all the time and is quite slow, Great location Good value for money Excellent rich breakfast
351636,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The reception staff was not very friendly or helpful There was no tea and coffee facilities in the room Hotel should not be rated 5 stars as this is very misleading I would give it 3 1 2 stars On the last day the bread in our breakfast was dry and hard , Not very much
351637,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Paid for superior room which was so small that there was no room for an armchair The shower was a ridiculous glass enclosed closet in the middle of the bedroom a pathetic attempt to create an illusion of space It was very noisy at night trams , Close to the main city attractions
351638,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Travelling with a friend and we had a twin room yet the room had a glass shower cubicle It was also way too hot in the room , Nice size room great location 
351639,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Shower in middle of room Odd Twin duvets Not enough pillows Rubbish gym small and boiling hot with no sign of an air conditioning unit , Breakfast was lovely hotel very clean
351640,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Nothing really bad except the very high price of breakfast 20 p p But there are several good caf es much cheaper just out of the Hotel, Good Hotel very close to the center with a very good value for money with respect to the standards of Wien Spacious and clean rooms kind staff close to the Metro
351641,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Housekeeping was terrible the first day Didn t clean the dirty glasses or throw the empty coffee capsules Instead of throwing a broken glass that was in the bin just took it out and put it back in its place The receptionist when told didn t even apologize Room was non smoking but smoke was coming from the ventilation from other rooms It wasn t fixed by the end of our stay Staff were cold and completely non smiling , Breakfast variety of salmon and many different sauces Breakfast room also nice Location next to the town hall and close to hofburg Nespresso machine in the room highly appreciated Idea of open bathroom was fun 
351642,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Staff member that checked us in was quite rude and dismissive walked off half through to see to business man four of us quite taken aback considering your motto it s not a job it s a career expected the staff to be friendly and engaging the lovely two men helped luggage and couldn t be nicer I get the clear shower in room but as four ladies staying would have liked bit privacy we had leave room till the other had shower, Lovely quality bedding and spotless great area
351643,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Pillows were too soft for my liking but the friendly staff at the reception didn t hesitate and delivered another pillow to my room within 5 minutes , Great and fresh breakfast very nicely layed out and the staff was present to help you with coffee water etc Clean and modern rooms The transparant shower window might be obstructive if you re travelling with friends Only a 3 minute walk from the Rathaus U bahn the city center is approximately 25 minutes by foot 
351644,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The room needed decorating a lot of scuffs on the wall and was a bit small , The staff were really friendly and helpful and the spa area with free water was appreciated Breakfast was plentiful with lots of options Great location in the centre of Vienna with lots of great cafes and restaurants nearby
351645,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, A small detail the gym could be better equipped Internet did not work well in our room, Great location Josefstadt is a very nice area in itself not for sightseeing but for bars and restaurants and very close to major sightseeing spots and to the centre Nice with three saunas Very good breakfast
351646,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Photos of the room did not reflect the real picture Booked Junior Suite in reality appeared tiny and gloomy space No information exchange between the restaurant and reception charged twice as many breakfasts than eaten in reality So if your reservation has no breakfast included make sure you are correctly charged , Nice location 
351647,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Boutique like hotel and rooms are fairly small shower next to bed etc did not bother us but could bother some people, Location is excellent can walk to many major attractions no problems Rooms are clean Breakfast excellent good choice and plenty food
351648,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, First floor room on road side suffers from bad traffic noise in the morning Had to sleep with ear plugs They offered to change it but to a lower standard of room or to a better one but with extra charge Not all but some of the staff are quite indefferent and even clueless in giving directions even to the central station , Very good breakfast Spacious room they are not all the same though 
351649,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Day shift reception ladies are rude and not helpful at all On bookings com it shows 5 starts hotel but in reality the hotel is not rated But that doesn t mean that we did not have a pleasant and comfortable stay , Amazing location good breakfast and cleanliness Kostadin K from the night shift made our stay even more special He guided us to all attractions and restaurants in the city and he even guided us with our trip to the surrounding countries 
351650,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Some staff members were not very polite especially one female who argued with my wife the folder that holds your room key had the WRONG hotel address and when we got a taxi it took us to the wrong hotel twice we reported this and we were meant to meet the hotel manager later in the day which never happened so customer service is not a big priority at Flemings hotels also the extra cost of 40 euros for the taxis should never have happened all they required to do was tell you it was the wrong hotel address and write on the correct one EASY ,No Positive
351651,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Bad choice of tv channels in English really just the news but really great hotel all around, Excellent breakfast included readers should disregard any other reviewers saying otherwise publicity photos are of superior rooms not the standard rooms but even lowest category fine super helpful staff and fun showers in the room and very modern touch upgraded for 20 euro got much nicer room and free minibar which alone was worth the upgrade
351652,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The female receptionist was unhelpful and mean spirited Not a great advert for your group , Breakfast and the size of the room comfortable bed nice compact spa 
351653,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Loved having the city view and balcony that came with the junior suite We thought it was a good location 2 blocks from the metro station Very easy to walk to other parts of town from as well 
351654,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Gym too warm too close to the sauna looked much nicer on the pictures , Good breakfast very clean and comfortable well located close to Rathaus metro station and city center by walking distance 
351655,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The walls need new painting, Starting from the price I would say that for what it offers comparing to other hotels in city center of Vienna it is really a good hotel Very good location behind the City Hall very good breakfast spacious rooms clean towels 
351656,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Not cheap staff not that friendly This is not a 5 star hotel but should be given 4 stars Reception area does not look very welcoming Beds very hard cushions cannot be taken seriously Sleeping not that comfortable , Super fast internet never seen before Nice spacious room Good bathroom Good breakfast and location in the city
351657,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Totally dissapointed with hotel policy They were charging my card night after night for some reason maybe they though people are going to run away without paying They have reserved 110 eur on my card for fear of me having breakfast there or using minibar even though I wasn t having breakfast or used their minibar and that was AFTER I protested to staff about every night charges to my card and paid full amount of my stay in advance Don t GO to this hotel unless you want them to make you feel like a thief , Nothing 
351658,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Curtains look dirty , Location is very good just 3 minutes walking from Rathaus Shower in the middle of the room is so cool Breakfast was diverse and nice 
351659,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The room was really small and pillows were very uncomfortable We were told at the reception that Easter Friday was holiday in Austria and we could park in front of the hotel unfortunately it was not and we were fined , Location was perfect cleanliness and breakfast were OK 
351660,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Bed is old some staff at breakfast are far from professional Very few food Walls in the rooms are dirty facilities are cheap quality , Some staff are nice location is good
351661,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The only thing to complain about was the pillows they really were awful Very flimsy to the point that you could feel your arm bones if you had your head on your pillow and your arm underneath It made for a very bad nights sleep , Lovely room we had a Deluxe balcony which had a gorgeous view of the city skyline The location was great if you re ok with walking which we were anything further we jumped on the U Bahn which was fantastic clean and very close by The staff themselves were friendly and accommodating 
351662,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The room and bathroom was not very practical We had a room a bit at the end of a corridor Not the impression to be in a guest in the hotel Except for the guys that helped with the luggage overall staff was not very much smiling PS we booked two rooms paid the same price and had two different rooms one much smaller That s not fair Discovered this at the last minute , Good bed nice place in the city to visit 
351663,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The first room we got was a smoking room and the room smelt badly of cigarettes The staff on reception should have asked whether we were smokers not waited until we complained in the morning , The second room was a great size room the bed was nice and the shower cubicle different
351664,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Shower design may put off some travellers Was charged an unusually large pre authorization on my credit card multiple times even after we had finished our stay , the hotel was immaculate the room was excellent
351665,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Amazing value for money The staff were friendly and approachable the shops and restaurants nearby were outstanding Looking to book again in the next 2 months 
351666,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, the see through shower i was traveling with a friend and not on a honeymoon we were told all rooms are like that , the spa facility was great wish we could have stayed longer and used it more 
351667,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, The hotel was very clean pleasant and everyone was very helpful and friendly The room was very comfortable and a surprise with the in bedroom glass shower Breakfast was excellent 
351668,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Size of room shower and sinks 3 feet from bed view from windows and amenities WAY OVER PRICED for a so called Junior Suite Would have been better off in a regular room Some light switches didn t work Mold under a c control Terrible pillows Filthy plastic coffee mugs Was really expecting more from a 5 star hotel and the amount we paid per night Very disappointed , Great breakfast nice big bed clean shower Pleasant staff 
351669,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Carpet in our room was wet when we arrived Shower was leaking to our room and it was wet around the bed This made room smelly , The hotel is nice in general
351670,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, This is not a place in which to share a room with your children or your mother the shower is in a glass box in the middle of the room with no privacy whatsoever The bed was very uncomfortable The air conditioning simply did not work whether set to 5 degrees or 30 degrees My towels were not changed the used damp ones that I had left in the shower were simply folded and put back on the shelf Housekeeping is already knocking on doors at 8 30 and gives guests no time to respond before walking in Stains on the carpet and holes in the curtains The hotel describes itself as a deluxe 5 star but it is really no better than a superior 3 star , Free WiFi with a strong signal The breakfast was good 
351671,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Mattress was very firm and not comfortable , This hotel totally exceeded our expectation Location cleanliness size of room quality bedlinen and pillows Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice a really lovely hotel and great value for money 
351672,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Room was very dusty Small bed It s a big hotel making it impersonal breakfast was very busy so we had to arrange our own cutlery, Staff was absolutely great
351673,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The check in guy told us breakfast was free no one asked for our room at breakfast but when we checked out they asked us if we enjoyed breakfast and we told them it was delicious Then they charged us 20 per person per day for breakfast After some prodding they only made us pay half because that is fair ,No Positive
351674,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, 1 Displayed a DON T DISTURB SIGN but was still disturbed twice 2 Breakfast was overpriced considering what were available, 1 Bar men were great excellent service
351675,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Struggled to log in the Wifi for certain phones but on the other hand very fast internet , Comfortable room Clean Nice shower eventhough it is in the room
351676,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Two days before the arrival they contacted us saying that the room with the city view was not available anymore then they changed it into a suite but when we arrived there the room was really cold so we had to change also this room this is not the right service for a 5 stars hotel,No Positive
351677,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Our first time in Vienna excellent hotel excellent location felt at ease as soon as we stepped through the door breakfast super amazing and the staff you felt as if you knew them for years super fantastic hotel we will be back 100 to stay here again 
351678,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Can t think of something I did not like, THE BREATHTAKING CITY VIEW from the room The architecture of the room with the open shower in the middle of the room The tidiness of the place
351679,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, On arrival I was given a dirty room Nice big room but dirty After contacting reception I was given another room which although was supposed to be an upgrade it was smaller than the first one with a wall separating bedroom and sitting room Second day I moved again to a third room which was better Too much moving around in three days I was tired by the end of my stay, Excellent Breakfast choices
351680,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The room got SO hot at night and we couldn t figure out how to turn the heating off maybe the aircon we put on didn t work It was December , Breakfast was lovely the city view room was really beautiful so worth it to us loved the central shower feature very nice stay 
351681,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Staff impolite not easy to reach Room was cleaned only once during 3 night stay despite reminder to the staff and me not occupying the room during the day Temp in the room and in the breakfast area way to high Wear a tshirt for breakfast , Location is convenient 15 min walk to opera or 10 min to museum district Nice and competent bar staff 
351682,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, cleaning was terrible difficult to say that it is 5 star hotel Max could be 4 star Next time will choose another hotel Reception was not helpful couldnt advise anything , location was good 
351683,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast room was so crowded that you had the feeling of eating on your neighbour s laps The curtains in the room were not very clean No private parking and it is difficult to unload luggage, The location is very good five minute walking from the Rathaus Breakfast is very good Spacious and modern room Nespresso coffee machine 
351684,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Old corridors and carpets Take care with the transparent shower in the room if you don t go with your loved one , Big rooms The shower in the room The location 
351685,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The room surprisingly wasn t very clean the worst was the beds that have a lot of dust not a nice thing to depare with , The location is amazing we didn t spent a lot of money in transportation because the hotel is near to everything The staff is also amazing and really kind with the guests The breakfast is amazing 
351686,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Two of the front desk employees were rude and arrogant The young woman who checked us in and out was really pleasant and friendly though , The location is perfect 5minutes by foot to Rathaus or the Parliament 2 minutes walk from the U2 metro station We upgraded from a Superior to a Deluxe room and it was definitely worth it free minibar and a more spacious room Breakfast was really good fruits vegetables fried bacon and eggs smoked salmon and various beverages and everything was fresh 
351687,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The furnishings felt a little dated The breakfast was very busy and a few times we had to wait for a table The room service was a bit haphazard with cushions throws etc simply being bundled up and discarded to one side of the room rather than folded neatly , The location close to the tube station and all the museums was excellent The bed was very comfortable good wifi connection Problems with the shower were dealt with promptly by the reception staff 
351688,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The room was small not what id call a superior one The shower was see through frosted glass would have been more private , The breakfast was nice the room was clean and the staff were nice 
351689,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, There is no privacy to shower for couple who go as friends because of the see thru glass The equipment is vey lacking the weight machine was out of order, Good value for money nice property and central location
351690,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Professional service delivered with a smile Reception desk outstanding Enjoyed street view looking over to the Rathaus Proximity for trams ubahn taxis 
351691,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Needs soft furnishings and comfortable furniture to add a warmer cosier feeling to bar reception for relaxing or chilling out there rather than in the bedroom but would recommend the hotel for everything else, Great location Brilliant breakfast Very clean hotel and staff very helpful Comfortable room Lovely local area with bars restaurants Transport so convenient
351692,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Initially our room had wifi issues however after discussing the matter with a member if the staff they offered us a new room , Very nice modern rooms breakfast had a lot of variety and was open from 6 30 to 10 30
351693,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, No water heater for coffee making , The Receptionist was so friendly The concierge Mr Aziz was outstanding The Breakfast was Excellent Sure will come back 
351694,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Overall attitude was less than what I ve observed at four star hotels Gym fitness facilities were poor No bellboy courtesy for arriving guests , Room layout cleanliness central location excellent view friendly and polite staff
351695,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Considering the price the breakfast could be included additional 20 per person However no big deal because there are many coffees and lovely places close by to have a really pleasant breakfast or even brunch for a reasonable price , The location is amazing Close to Rathaus and easy reach to the main attractions and wonderful historical buildings Very clean and the staff is very kind and helpful 
351696,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, There was no tea coffee making facility in the room , Lovely modern hotel perfect location just a few minutes walk from the Christmas markets and historical sights 
351697,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Firstly I always pleased with the hotels which choose through booking com and this is the first time that I am disappointed I booked a room for two people on booking com and there is shown as a five star hotel But already the first impression is that it is a hotel for three to four stars more three The first two days of the wifi connection was working After that it wasn t already possible For the gym zero For five nights as we were not once was not altered linen Pillows are a disaster Too hard beds I read on booking com this hotel rated with five stars When I asked one of the receptionists if this hotel 5 star said he did not the other day I asked another and said to that Ridiculous Never had bad experience with recommendations on booking com and this is firs time If you expect high quality of this hotel you will be disappointing And please do not imagine this hotel as a five star since the three would be real , Just location 
351698,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, the actual hallways to get to the room were a bit run down The woman concierge at the check in desk was not all that hospitable, The room was excellent and very clean Love the bathroom layout Very good location and the Christmas eve dinner was excellent 
351699,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Our room wasn t in the greatest spot in the hallway next to the elevators which meant minor noise from the hallway early morning and late evening Would have liked a kettle in our room , We stayed over the Christmas holiday so this may have made our experience a bit different than most reviewers We were greeted with a warm welcome and our stay was comfortable and cozy A great location right on a tram line and U bahn station and a relatively quiet and less crowded area Standard breakfast fare good for the price 
351700,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, The staff where very friendly and helpful when possible Danielle on check out was very nice as was the dark haired bar man who working the 14th to 18th of Dec
351701,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Shower is not in a separate room in fact it is right next to the bed which could be awkward for those that like privacy , Good location and easy to get anywhere
351702,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, You might want to ask for an extra pillow unless you re used to sleeping completely flat , A spacious modern and comfortable room They gave us a complimentary upgrade when we arrived and were extremely helpful at reception whenever we had any requests 
351703,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, SPA Wellness area was not very tidy towels were missing at first and one Sauna was not working , Very nice modern rooms leave nothing to be desired Excellent breakfast buffet with lots of freshly prepared food Perfect location to visit all the main sights in Vienna just 5 min to Christmas market 2 min to U Bahn station Rathaus 
351704,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The shower and bathroom are not optimal for privacy if travelling as a non intimate couple , Comfortable beds with many large pillows The shower and bathroom are very stylish and integrated in the room Smart and modern design
351705,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, I really like the staff of the Hotel They were really helpful Also rooms were clean and the Hotel has a perfect spot Close to Christmas Markets and city center and shopping streets 
351706,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The stuff at the reception is rude Also as a couple we expected and asked in advanced to have one double bed but got 2 separate single beds Also it seems like they have to maintain the facility better since the walls could use some fresh paint and the carpets have stains , Great breakfast large rooms transparent shower and good location
351707,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, This hotel take deposit directly from credit card in advance after deduct full price and when u arrived even ask more for deposit does not make any sense For cancellation of deposit also have no evidence to provide , Receipionist is not friendly with deposit cancellation issue 
351708,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, There were no zink next to the toilet so you had to go in the bedroom for washing hands, Very kind staff Silent place no noise from outside Good place in the room
351709,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, After an early start and tiring journey they lost all if our luggage which was a bad and stressfull start to our stay Other guests seemed to have the same experience The gym equipment we wanted to use was out of order , After
351710,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The breakfast area is too small and Sunday we were waiting almost one hour for having any seats plus no one helped us I asked the personal if they can let us know when will have a table free No answer Till the end we were sitting on the corner where everyone was looking at us with mercy Was a bit embarrassing, The position of the hotel is good Amazing room and breakfast The receptionist was very responsive respectful and nice 
351711,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, no tea and coffee making facilities in the room which i did not notice on booking , location was excellent on the whole good value for the money excellent breakfast
351712,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, At breakfast there was a table for half of the guests it has to be eaten standing or wait for a long time, Quiet clean and functional hotel Breakfast was great when you finally got it 
351713,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Free Wifi wouldn t work in room and staff couldn t fix it, Good location nice restaurant great rooms The rooms are very quiet Good breakfast too 
351714,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Definitely not 5 star Terrible hotel staff arrogant unfriendly and very unprofessional Trainees working alone without supervision and any knowledge Fitness not working without any apologies Non functional room keys you need to spend at least 15 minutes at reception anytime you need to return to your room , Nice location clean and comfortable bed 
351715,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, stuff were not much friendly except one with shoulders length hair Room was too small facilities were not described to us so we dnt have any idea about if its exist , Location was Good Hotel clean Nice design
351716,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Shower in the middle of the room was disconcerting no space for privacy Would definitely choose a room with its own separate bathroom next time , Gorgeous view lovely breakfast friendly staff Hotel is right in the centre of it all perfect for a weekend break 
351717,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, For price 150 for deluxe room I had to pay extra 24 for parking with such a hotel for such a price I would expect FOC parking , Everything was just perfect 
351718,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Staff were very polite but a little disorganised sometimes , Very nice looking hotel in a convenient location to nearby places of interest but you are still looking at about a 15 minute walk to these and tube stations Spare pillows would ve been nice and also a shower screen for privacy if wanted 
351719,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Hotel Wi Fi did not work in the room We stayed for five days and reported this within the first hour after arrival A staff member came to the room and established that our iPads and mobile phones were working in the hallway outside the room and in the public areas He suggested that the problem MUST be with the iPads The only suggestion was to use a very poor quality external connection The hotel is very impersonal with dull corridors not a picture or poster in sight Window curtains had no bar to help closing them Really difficult as the ceiling must be 12 ft high , The location was good as it was within walking distance of the city centre The tram stop was outside the door and the Metro just around the corner 
351720,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Please check your bill and card account by some mistake my card was charged with aditional amount Money has been returned as soon as the stuff realised they mistake still it blocked funds on my account for 2 weeks , Vienna is beautifull city with lots to offer hotel located in the city center close to underground clean and nice 
351721,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Hotel was busy and couldn t cope with breakfast crowds i was turned away twice but did get free table on return, Great location and very comfortable rooms
351722,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Cigarette packet left in wardrobe and slight smell of smoke not great in a non smoking room Exterior blind seemed to have a life of its own and went up and down when it felt like it Staff couldn t help on front desk when we asked for a restuarant recommendation Wellness area very small , Nice room with small balcony and lovely view of Rathaus
351723,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Coffee maker in room but have to pay for the coffee after the first 2 free ones Seems a little petty to me , Great location right near U bahn and tram and easy walking distance to many sightseeing locations Local cafes good too 
351724,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, We had a room with twin beds and a see through shower Perhaps fun as a couple but a bit akward for two travelling friends Also the room could have been cleaned more carefully , Lovely location lovely reception staff 
351725,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, The staff was very helpful and professional the room one of the most beautiful and comfortable I ve ever slept in there was a big shower box in the middle of the room so cool Everything was perfect thanks 
351726,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Please note that walk in shower is located in the mid of the room and the glass is transparent It s not bad just be aware of this feature if you plan travel to this hotel with your kids or if you plan to share the room with your colleague There are no sleepers or bathrobes in the room you probably need to ask it from reception , Location comfortable beds 
351727,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The facilities are rather dirty carpets in corridors are with grease spots The person attending me at checking in was not kind and censoring me for a minor mistake the room was not clean and bathroom accessories such as soap were not dispensed daily, The location only
351728,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, How I was recieved Had booked double room but was first put into a single When I questioned this I was made to feel like it was my own fault , Location good Walking distance to centre 
351729,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The wi fi didnt work at the fourth floor so I got a new upgraded room at the first floor But when I was checking out the hotel tried to make me pay for the new room The staff was terrible at speaking english , The location was perfect The breakfast was ok 
351730,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, When we arrived they confused our reservation and their attitude was not very professional The receptionist had crumpled shirt really badlly like he would just wake up however it was 19 00 , Breakfast was good 
351731,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The rooms aee tired and need a little renovation they are also dirty but when we brought this to the hotel s attention they reacted quickly and by the time we got back to the room it was clean The rooms have the showers in the middle of the room which i would imagine could be difficult for some couples, Lication was great
351732,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Nothing , Clean room great view from my 6th floor city view room free minibar restocked each day reliable wifi very good breakfast Very near 2 mins walk to Rathaus UBahn station Or an easy and pleasant 15 20 min walk to the city centre 
351733,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, We arrived in the afternoon so the road to the hotel was blocked by some street stalls or something so had to walk out of the taxi to the hotel as the driver couldn t find a way around The check in staff was either rude or racist couldn t tell exactly The room assigned was the farthest possible with not the most appealing view either overlooking dark houses and a school on the back side probably thanks to the check in guy again , One of the concierge staff was very helpful in pointing us out to decent dining places and places to check out while we are in Vienna Had nice gym and spa facilities The rooms were really nice with the shower in the middle of the room 
351734,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The bed was on a raised dais hazardous when you make a trip to the loo in the dark The shower is positioned in the middle of the bedroom clear glass no privacy if you are sharing , Clean comfortable and refurbished to a high standard Close to underground system and the ring road 
351735,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Hard bed and pillows too soft Staff could have informed us earlier how to catch tram to areas of sightseeing it would have been a lot easier to get around Underground was ok Luckily I got the requested separate shower room Strange having a toilet separate and having to go around to shower room to wash hands, Close to underground restaurants and supermarkets
351736,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, the room is quite compact and there is no room for one person stands at the front of mirror when you open the toilet door , location breakfast and hotel staff they are very hospitable and helpful 
351737,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Room clean staff at 8 40 a m a little bit too early isn t it , Important info yes shower cabins are inside rooms as it is shown on photos quite strange to see negative comments of surprised tourists As for the hotel good location to main sights room service is fine 
351738,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, The city view rooms are excellent The only thing is the shower in the room So if you have a partner sharing the room be prepared for that Good breakfast
351739,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, There was no closed of bathroom just a shower stall and a dressing table and sink A bit strange , Rooms are nice and clean Staff is friendly and helpful 20 min walk to city center Good eating places nearby
351740,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, no choice for pillows its too soft, big size room breakfast staff 20 min walking distance to city center Tram no 2 station opposite to the hotel gate some room has coffee machine but it give warm coffee not hot as I like 
351741,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, I found the shower in the middle of the room strange I also had issues with the wifi dropping out at times , The hotel is clean with nicely finished rooms 
351742,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, too expensive even basic amenities were not in the hotel and we had to pay a deposit each time to even request a kettle, cleanliness and supermarket next to hotel
351743,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The attitude of the staff when I told them I needed extra pillows at night They told me their house keeping room is locked and they will provide the pillows by tomorrow , I liked the suite a lot
351744,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, 1 Staff at the front desk could be much friendlier and not that snobbish Got a feeling that it was not they who were serving guests but guests serving them Behaviour is always reserved Not a smile on their face 2 Price could be a bit lower Rip off frankly speaking , 1 Clean As usual Austrians give attention to detail 2 Excellent breakfast Good selection of food 3 Great location Near Parliament building and within five minutes of outdoor shopping quarter 
351745,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, Great location on the edge of the centre All the sights in easy reach and public transport right outside the door but still far enough out to be peaceful Fantastic breakfast and great coffee Other catering options were a bit expensive but lots of cheaper options available nearby to suit all tastes Spotlessly clean sauna and steam room in the basement for that extra relaxation Staff on reception were friendly and efficient 
351746,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Contacted out wifi provider makes for unnecessary login complication and sometimes unreliable A free helpline was available but who wants to be ringing that when they are on holiday Not the staff s fault obviously Just a questionable management decision , Perfect location very helpful staff great breakfast and excellent room 
351747,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, The location is excellent just a few steps away from the subway We could see the Rathus directly from window Plus the room is super comfortable Really recommend for visitors to Vienna

351752,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The breakfast is too expensive 20 for what they offer Just go out in the morning and find a caf , The hotel is splendid and is very near the Rathaus U bahn station so you can move with ease around Vienna Some bars and restaurants nearby 
351753,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, The staff could be a bit more friendly, The city view room is worth all the money we paid for I ve never stayed in a room like this The breakfast was nice and hotel location is excellent 
351754,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Staff aren t friendly at all The hotel is old First time of my life I see a hotel charge for room arrangements , The Turkish restaurant in the opposite side of the hotel
351755,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City,No Negative, The location the staff the rooms everything was really great Breakfast was excellent Everything we needed to explore the city was just steps away 
351756,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Young lady on reception had a bit of a cold attitude towards us Asked on 3 esperar occasions to have a firm pillow delivered to our room as they have a various pillow menu and request was never met Quite disapponting On the first occasion I asked for one she just said no it s not possible , Big room clean premises comfy bed
351757,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Hard bed pillow too soft only 1 had better sleep in half price hotel in Vienna Only CNN in English all TV in German poor for today and luxury hotel No one to make fresh omelets Confusing layout of hotel e g check out with luggage passes through people eating breakfast , Quality and design of room coffee capsule machine large proper shower not over bath double sinks quiet Good modern choice at breakfast time We got a v good price for one night but they changed prices so we went elswhere for other two nights Location great for museum district 
351758,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Breakfast was not included in the room rate and in my opinion very expensive There are several lovely cafes nearby that serve a very nice breakfast for a third of the price , Great location walking distance to everything Underground secure parking just around the corner Very clean and comfortable and would recommend to others 
351759,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, 1 The shower The shower cubicle is in the middle of the room boxed by glass panels with one side completely and I mean completely transparent The other sides have frosted strips but there s absolutely no chance of modesty if you re sharing the room Great for couples not so for everyone else If the hotel management is reading this could I suggest one way mirror film for the glass panels At least for some of the rooms , 1 Friendly helpful staff From the front desk to housekeeping and especially to the staff in the restaurant I have only the highest compliments for them Excellent 2 Good breakfast and I m saying it after staying there for 10 days The weekday set lunch is well worth it delicious good sized portions and cost about the same as nearby restaurants 3 Good location My point of interest was at the Rathaus so for me the location was just right There s a metro station about 5 min walk convenience stores and restaurants are even closer 4 I did say friendly helpful staff right 
351760,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Hard to park car near to hotel hotel car parking in next block aprox 200m we didnt like glass shower in midle of the room that does not add comfort Corridors carpets are dirty lights made of gold covered by dust In rooms bad smell of sawage system, Good location fair price by Booking com normal double room price 780 night exelent breakfast size of room
351761,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, What do you think about a hotel that retains your credit card almost ten days after your stay and does not respond to e mails asking about it , Proximity and quiet
351762,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Not an issue with the hotel but inconveniently retailers including supermarkets in the area close for the weekend at 12 noon on Saturday but this would be the case Vienna wide , Rooms are well appointed and the property is within minutes from Underground 
351763,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Well you get a room and you can t sleep in it Why Because every time someone flushes the toilet or washes his hands in the other rooms you hear sewage noise water flowing down the pipes Every 5 minutes I had already paid an extra night because I had to check in at 7 am so I paid for a whole night I didn t use When I asked for a better room because of this noise problem they should ve offered an alternative room for free They didn t want to Despite the fact that I had paid an extra night for my early check in they didn t care at all A room with toilet noise from other rooms water Yuk , The location and the breakfast

351765,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, Although it gives the impression of a 5 star hotel the service is horrible the manager at the time of our visit was very very rude and uncooperative Their parking facility is ridiculously priced and an inconvenience for what it is cars sardined together in the garden basement therefore blocking each other without easy access to your car We had to wait half an hour standing outside without having our car key just so they can decide which way is best to play tetris with the cars , Acceptable location 
351766,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, A small swimming pool would have been nice and we didn t know about USB charging docks till we leaving so they were not obvious , Location right behind the parliament building size of room very large compared to others we ve stayed in huge shower was excellent Staff were very helpful extra pillows arrived immediately even booked our tickets for river trip to our next stop in Bratislava We were also lucky film festival was on at city hall so free externtaient on days we were there with mutilpe kinds of national food on sale 
351767,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, very little the only downside was the dirty carpet in the corridors should be easy to fix , Excellent value for business or leisure elegant new furniture in the well designed room nice views over the city very good breakfast real capuccino served at the table

351769,Fleming s Selection Hotel Wien City, They just try the max to steal you They wanted to charge me for 2 parking days while i were a tourist without any car They made 2 preauthorizations on my credit card for an amount exceeding my stay bill And when you call to have an explanation they just lie to you and pretend that the system is blocked,No Positive
