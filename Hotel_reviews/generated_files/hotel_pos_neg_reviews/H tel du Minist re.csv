147298,H tel du Minist re, The Nescafe coffee machine in the room was not working when we arrived the jam in the machine had not been fixed prior to our arrival We fixed it The provision of soft drink in the fridge was not always the same but good that it was available , The package with breakfast included is good value The breakfast is very good lots of choice and good for families Junior Suite is excellent for families A quick walk to Invalides train station links you to Versailles with ease Metro access also excellent 
147299,H tel du Minist re, We had a duplex upstairs bedroom with tv desk and double bed There was no light over or near the desk so hard to see TV channels are of course all in french and as tv is integrated into a wall we were unable to plug in a usb or laptop to watch english progammes The main issue though is that the air conditioning just didn t work and the upstairs bedroom particularly was unbearably hot and we just couldn t sleep up there We advised reception daily and each day they tried to fix it and on the last day got a technician but it still wasn t fixed We were not offered another room or a fan Our booking said large double bed upstairs and a double bed downstairs for our adult daughter It wasn t a double bed but it was a pull out couch in what was supposed to be a lounge There was no room to move at all once this was pulled out with a coffee table and chair We had to climb over furniture to get to the bed which was most uncomfortable No tv in the downstairs area The downstairs was dark and lighting was appalling We ended up leaving the bathroom and wardrobe lights on in order to see It was a shame really as the staff were lovely and it could have been okay They need to fix the air conditioning and move customers when they can t They need to fix the lighting have light bulbs that actually provide some decent light and then they will have a very good hotel , The service at this hotel is very good All staff were friendly and helpful and spoke English which was a bonus for us The hotel is only 10 20 euros by taxi to major attractions and 10 minutes to metro The buffet breakfast was good with something for everyone and nice juices The upstairs bedroom bed was comfortable 
147300,H tel du Minist re, The bathroom doors are on a slider and they re a little hard to move There are no tea and coffee facilities in the room which I think are a must , Great breakfast options comfortable bed great hotel location small hotel but has everything you need Great free mini bar We got a little weather report for the next day delivered every afternoon which makes the planning a lot easier Hotel staff are always helpful and friendly 
147301,H tel du Minist re, wifi was slow and didn t work sometimes there is no super market nearby, Complimentary mini bar except Champagne Friendly Kind Staff Great location for tourist not so many variations but good quality breakfast
147302,H tel du Minist re, No tea and coffee making facilities in room which was a little bit of a let down for a 4 Hotel , Wonderful location located on a quiet side street and very near great transport links to all Paris has on offer Clean modern and stylish rooms Lot s of amenities nearby Soft drinks and bottled water included in your room rate 
147303,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Last week we spent 5 remarkable days in Paris One of components of tremendous short rest is a cozy guest house practically and the center Paris Hotel du Ministere Day personnel on a reception the most sociable customer oriented good natured and sympathetic I ve got detailed answers to all my questions as it is better to pass or far more simply to reach And all that were easy with smile from their side The hotel is perfectly located we practically went by walked to all sightseeings Room number is very pure was cleaned perfectly every day Number was Deluxe with extraordinary planning Hotel is located not so far from Police we were safe Many thanks to Hotel s Administration to young people on reception black and fair haired sorry I don t know their names for the wonderful attitude towards guests P S Its too pity for me that I tasted croissants on breakfast in the hotel only last day of my visit They were delicious and especially french 
147304,H tel du Minist re, Including the breakfast in the cost of the room would have been nice , The room was comfortable and within easy walking distance of Westminster Abby which was the most important criteria for us 
147305,H tel du Minist re, The hotel was a bit too hidden , The design and color palette of the rooms used are beautiful The beds are heavenly and the bathrooms are equally gorgeous Did I mention the rooms are very clean too 
147306,H tel du Minist re, Not having a good variety to eat in hotel past breakfast Cleanliness has room for improvement although within acceptable ranges , The rooms are comfortable and reasonably clean The hotel is in a nice neighborhood and a good location The decor is simple but bright and inviting The staff was very helpful and friendly 
147307,H tel du Minist re, Room service food was absolutely terrible microwave meals The bar did not even have 1 glass of red wine which I ordered This was disappointing for the price , The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable 
147308,H tel du Minist re, just the king size bed is two separate beds combined together not one bed , The front desk are very friendly and help you in all information you want and advise you about all what you need and where you can find 
147309,H tel du Minist re, Size of room a little bit small, Small room but well equipped and modern good breakfast perfect and quiet location also for sight seeing purposes Friendly staff 
147310,H tel du Minist re, The rooms aren t designed to maximise the limited space available The quality of finish is inconsistent and doesn t reflect a design hotel , Comfy beds great location 
147311,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Beautiful boutique hotel with perfect location and professional staff Rooms very well designed comfortable and clean Don t miss out the delicious breakfast 
147312,H tel du Minist re, Room is a little bit narrow, The location is great near to Palais de Elysee and in walk distance to Place de la Concorde Arch of Triumph and numerous luxury stores Easy connection to museums by metro bus Nice breakfast with baguette and danish pastries of very good quality selection of Cheese yogurts juices and fruits organic options provided 
147313,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Hotel staff was extremely helpful Breakfast was excellent Bed comfortable Location perfect central but in a small street not filled with tourists The staff was nice enough to provide me room even before check in time since I arrived early in the morning 
147314,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Such a comfortable stay The pillows were superb We stayed in the Juniour suite and it was such a beautiful and very spacious room It had a free standing bath tub which was amazing The shower was also fantastic The mini bar was also free apart from the champagne There was a docking station which we played music at The hotel is very artistic and has a great vibe especially for young people The staff were all amazing and very helpful It was my boyfriend s birthday so they even left him a card in the room The breakfast was great if you re searching for a quick and cheap breakfast It included French food too The hotel has a gym but we didn t attend The location is very much in central but it was tucked away from everything It wasn t that much of a problem especially for people who want to return to some peace and quiet Fantastic hotel definitely worth the money
147315,H tel du Minist re, Just a detail the shower was great but I usually prefer bath when I stay in a nice hotel Also the mattress was not a good quality one , Delicious breakfast one of the best I ve had friendly staff and spacious room for Parisian standards It was well located in a quiet street The little attentions like newspapers available and candies on the bed with the weather forecast 
147316,H tel du Minist re, The fire escape connection area of the hotel to the junior suits Also the windows did not close properly which made me feel a bit insecure , The breakfast was really good for the Parisian standards The cruvassant was great I loved the selection of cheeses And the geat thing was the buffet hours were very reasonable where as it almost finished around 11 We stayed at a junior suit room and I really Loved the confort of the room The bed and linens were really good quality and very extremely clean The towels as well The only thing that doesn t bother me but may others is that the two twin beds making one king bed I loved the extra black out curtains and how quiet the room was It made the environment perfect for relaxation after a long day of walk in Paris The heating system worked really well and the staff was very helpful The only thing that did not looked to well was the connection of theain building to the junior suits which was basically a fire escape The location of the hotel was different than what I m used to as I m 1st ard lover However this even beat the first by being equally close to all attractions like rue rivoli la Fayette champs Ellise Concorde vandome just like a 10 15 minute walk away Madeline and Opera was just a minute away Also the hotel proving us bike to rent made our last day in Paris unforgettable 
147317,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, The room was nice but getting to and from it was awkward thru some stairs It seems as if they have two buildings connected and we had to move between them or something Breakfast was good The lobby is small and not very nice The fitness room was really nice and well equipped Overall it s an ok place nice Not great but nice
147318,H tel du Minist re, Constant phone calls from the front desk with no caller Very little desk horizontal space for storage reading working No heat despite complaints room like an icebox for most of stay Nicest staff member was the cleaner,No Positive
147319,H tel du Minist re, I left money in my pocket there was my colleague s money for perfume so I definitely knew the sum of money And when I d decided to go to the shop for Perfume it was a day before we should check out I couldn t find 120 euro you know if it were my money I wouldn t be so upset but it were not my money so in future I would came back to this hotel but money would be kept in safe, Very nice place kindly staff when we arrived We were offered a better room because it was our first trip to Paris so we were pleasantly surprised And I want admit that breakfast was really good and delicious 
147320,H tel du Minist re, A little expensive at 240 euros so book early for a better price Superior room little small even for Paris, Good location Staff were friendly and very helpful Nice bed very clean 
147321,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, All staff were super nice and helpful Our French was terrible but they still worked with us to make sure all our needs were met They helped us find a 2 star Michelin restaurant and made a reservation on short notice We walked all over the city about a mile and a half to the Eiffel Tower The breakfast was great 
147322,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, The decoration of this room is very modern and chic Our room has two floors big and very beautiful The staff here would introduce the special point of the room and very friendly The location is also good enough Recommend 
147323,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Tha staff was extremely nice and helpful the room was very clean and has modern design and it was well prepared All the food and drinks were bio and organic there were a well designed lobby with parlour games and also gym this we haven t used but seemed to be modern everything was very close by walkway and it was a really good area One more extra there were bike rental possibilty 
147324,H tel du Minist re, Not suitable for elderly or disabled Executive rooms had bedrooms and bathrooms toilets on separate floors very hot at night, Staff were extremely helpful polite kind
147325,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, I want to highlight the staff which were all extremely friendly and helpful It was our second stay and we will come back again In particular at the time of checking out the street in which the hotel is located was closed and the taxi was not able to drive all the way to the hotel The taxi did park several 100 meters away the porter did help us to bring the luggage all the way there Thanks a lot 
147326,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Staff were very nice and helpful Location is excellent and the facilities are everything one needs In addition the free mini bar items are really nice complement too 
147327,H tel du Minist re, It s a little bit pricey and the rooms are on the small side , The location is great rooms newly refurbished and the staff super friendly and breakfast was very nice too 
147328,H tel du Minist re, The toilet and bathroom are separated in two different locations in the room No wash basin in the toilet section Was not comfortable at all The room was not cleaned on daily basis , Nice location and friendly staff
147329,H tel du Minist re, During my stay my grand mother 85 years old she was ill and we had a phone from our country and heard that she is in a very bad situation so we changed our airplane and we kindly would like to ask the reception and we would like to talk with the manager that could we make one day early check in we were 8 person and 3 rooms because booking com customer relation talked us to speak with the manager I am 38 years old and I travel all over the world belive me I have never seen such a BAD AND RUDE staff in my life Yes I also know that the room is not returnable but because of CUSTOMER RESPECT we do it in our country the manager should come and talk with the customer Even the hotel manager oblige to talk with us and never come Her His room is 1 meter to the reception People shouldnt forget that You should respect the customer because we are the one who pay your salary The rooms are very very small Even in Paris and very dark view no sun is coming to the room Additionally a bad smell is coming from the toilets and never lost They are telling that the breakfast is buffet it is something joke there is only egg and cheese that is all for breakfast The lady in front of the desk Has glasses and I think she is in 50 s she is the rudest people I have ever seen She should be the only reason that NOT TO stay in this hotel if you are visiting Paris with your children or older persons and can not use Metro Subway I dont suggest you to stay here because it is far away to Every important attractions Neither in the booking comments it writes it is very close to the city center and good location it is not true For example because of my small children 3 and 8 years we all have to use the taxis and the closeses touristic area is something 15 euro with taxi such as concorde square 15 euro louve musuem 25 euro ,No Positive
147330,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Staff make this place exceptional They are extremely responsive and accommodating I arrived at 9AM from an overnight flight and they remembered my request for early check in having the room clean and available The breakfast is an excellent start to the day for a reasonable cost and the location and set up of the room ideal 
147331,H tel du Minist re, It would be nice to have an armchair to watch TV and not be obliged to get on the bed rubber mats available for the shower breakfast seems to me a bit overpriced, Last time we stayed there we suggested that the stair in the breakfast room had a stripe put on it to emphasise it We were pleased to see that it was now there Very reasonable tariff Everything fine
147332,H tel du Minist re, Hotel close to Elsyee palace but far from nightlife restaurant areas it was difficult to get eat and drinks after 11 PM , Minibar free except for champaigne Polite staff Nice design
147333,H tel du Minist re, Nothing , Perfect location within short walking distance to La Madeleine Place de la Concorde etc Complimentary soft drinks and Nespresso machine in room Funky little gym 
147334,H tel du Minist re, Unfortunately we were put in the wrong room when we arrived which was a smaller cheaper room than what we had paid for We noticed this when comparing with the pictures of the rooms online Although the situation was rectified once we brought it to the receptionists attention the way it was managed did give a sense like this was a deliberate mistake as we were made to feel like they had done us a favour by putting us into the correct room , The hotel is modern and in a great location We stayed in the deluxe executive duplex room which was beautiful and very comfortable Overall good facilities and perfect for a short or long stay in Paris
147335,H tel du Minist re, Price for breakfast at the high end otherwise nothing to complain about , Excellent staff and comfort good location Nice renovated rooms and not to forget free mini bar 
147336,H tel du Minist re, The breakfast should be better, The location is great quiet and safe The decoration is modern The staff a handsome man who works at the front desk is so so so nice However the staff of the restaurant is less warm 
147337,H tel du Minist re, There was absolutely noting not to like , The most memorable holiday The hotel was well located so we walked around Room was confortable small but well equipped Breakfast delicious Staff very efficient and warm Will recommend to all for sure And hopefully will return one day 
147338,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, The location was wonderful very close to gorgeous parts of Paris like the Louvre Champs Elysee Galeries Lafayette etc The breakfast buffet was good the beds were really comfortable and the street was very quiet 
147339,H tel du Minist re, Unfortunately this is an apartment and there is nothing good to say about this hotel Please don t go if you want a nice hotel especially for GCC citizents, Nothing
147340,H tel du Minist re, Wifi in Rm 94 was unable to connect , The hotel is situated in a clean and good public security area very important in Paris We stayed in duplex Rm 94 the room is quiet and stylish with a free mini bar except Champagne High end shopping area St Honor is in 5mins walking distance Sightseeing spots such as Madelaine Church and Museum de Lourve are all very near 
147341,H tel du Minist re, The breakfast variety could be better And for some reason the hairdryer automatically stops working after a few minutes It took me forever to dry my hair properly, The room was spacious as we were traveling with our son The bed was very comfortable and it was well lit The staff were very friendly
147342,H tel du Minist re, Wifi signal was weak in the last 2 days but staff were nice and tried to fix it , I had a very pleasant stay there Nice hotel friendly staff and good location

147345,H tel du Minist re, Two points Night porter at 22 45 hrs cursory when asked for two glasses of wine Coffee at breakfast 09 00hrs went from warm to cool to running out and slow moving staff paid no attention, Reception staff friendly with a relaxed courtesy that was in no way casual Very obliging and helpful with our very heavy luggage Decor and furnishings colourful and chic 
147346,H tel du Minist re, WISH THEY HAVE FOOD BESIDES BREAKFAST HAD TO GO ON LONG WALKS TO GET DINNER , THE ROOM WAS CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE THE STAFF WERE SUPER NICE IT WAS CLOSE TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET 
147347,H tel du Minist re, The rooms were split into two levels At ground level sitting area bathroom etc are located and at mezannine level beds are put up It was quite incovnient specially for children to go down in the night Also room size was small , hotel is located in a very central place and facilities were good Staffs were friendly and helpful 
147348,H tel du Minist re, Some small issues with the lighting of the bathroom lights going on and off all the time Not enough coffee capsules Strange way the safe is set up in a drawer which is prone to get blocked A bit expensive, Location Very nice room Comfort of the bed Very nice and helpful staff Nice to have the possibility to rent bikes directly from the hotel
147349,H tel du Minist re, Nothing it was perfect , An amazing location and the hotel was modern but kept some of the features of an older building Location was 5minutes from the louvre right next to the boutique shopping and restaurants 
147350,H tel du Minist re, Room was tiny Barely enough room to move around the bed , Staff was excellent friendly knowledgeable and helpful excellent English Very clean and modern Included breakfast was excellent beds were comfortable location was very convenient to sights and transportation
147351,H tel du Minist re, The room was very small dark and had absolutely not a single drawer So storage was limited Also though the thermostat was purportedly regulatable it was not so until later in the evenings Apparently the temperature was controlled until later in the day , The hotel staff were excellent professional attentive and knowledgeable regarding surrounding locations Daily replenishment of the refrigerator was very nice and included Coca Cola Oranfina sparkling and non carbonated bottled water 
147352,H tel du Minist re, the hotel is not well maintained the design is cool but of very bad quality there was a big spot of humidity and rust in the shower there was a smell of humidity the bed covers were old and stained and dusty staff at reception not presentable and some were sort of depressed not very attractive for a reception, location close to st honore
147353,H tel du Minist re, Don t expect a typical Parisian hotel experience with croissants in a quaint courtyard but if your like us it won t matter A great night sleep cool hotel awesome location we spent time in Paris not our room, Amazing location great boutique hotel vibe clean and simple great fun style super comfy beds helpful staff
147354,H tel du Minist re, There really wasn t anything to dislike , The hotel is extremely comfortable with excellent quality of furnishings and linen The towels were luxurious to say the least as was the coffee maker Breakfast was good and plentiful Staff extremely helpful and obliging particularly Yanik who was brilliant 
147355,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, The location was great Centrally located and easy to get around to everything The staff is extremely friendly and helpful The Wifi works great and they have a very nice little gym 
147356,H tel du Minist re, I have experienced two different standards of room in this hotel both good The standard room lacked tea coffee making equipment but was otherwise fine the suite is excellent and has everything the traveller could want plus more than enough space for two , The sensation of sleeping on a cloud the best bed I have ever slept in Quiet clean stylish rooms helpful staff Good information material in the room for guests A minibar stocked with free juices and water you only pay for the alcohol 
147357,H tel du Minist re, Nothing , Proximity to business needs Somewhat small but immaculate room with great bed Wonderful breakfast Extremely helpful staff Excellent value 
147358,H tel du Minist re, Rooms a bit small but perfectly comfortable and beautifully appointed , Comfy beds elegant room excellent breakfast helpful staff Overall a really excellent small but chic hotel We would definitely stay there again 
147359,H tel du Minist re, We came at 10am for breakfast and the tables were dirty no clean cups available no orange juice anymore We needed to ask for everything Disappointing as this was the last thing we did in the hotel before leaving and that is what you remember Tiles in the entrance are clean but are weared out They need to be replaced because they leave a dirty look though they are certainly clean, Very friendly staff They are really doing everything to give you a good feeling Always willing to help
147360,H tel du Minist re, try to have different breakfast atleast another menu i dont have stunning view but i understand bec there is construction in front of r room , staff are approachable clean location is good strong wifi 
147361,H tel du Minist re, My room design was inconvenient as the bedroom was on a mezzanine level above the bathroom and living room separated by a spiral staircase Could be fun for some but a pain if you need to visit the bathroom at night Also as heat rises the bedroom was too hot and the living room and bathroom too cold My colleagues rooms were fine so just check what you are getting if you want to avoid this , Unique design Very affordable 
147362,H tel du Minist re, The staff weren t helpful one bit Especially when we arrived late a night it was almost like it was a drama to check us in Wasn t a good starting mood of the whole place The rooms are clean but they are beginning to be a bit run down , The beds were super comfy And the rooms were clean 
147363,H tel du Minist re, The floor in the bathroom was slippery when wet Destabilising if you are older It would be helpful to have a rubber mat if possible , Very close to teh place of our meeting Very good buffet breakfast and the price was included in the price of the room Comfortable chair for reading or watching television much appreciated I had stayed in this hotel several times before it changed with the addition of the extra rooms and I have always had a good stay but found the staff extremely friendly 
147364,H tel du Minist re, Heating system did not work properly no maintenance man present at night The shower draining did not work and the room flooded Only one person in the entirely lobby when I arrive made hotel feel like a deserted land But the real worse was concierge rude a bit like what are you doing here , Very new hotel nice design style which also feels homely They upgraded me when I complained the hearing system did not work properly It still did not work in upgraded room but appreciated the effort
147365,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, A great location Very friendly and helpful staff A comfortable bed in a quiet room The quality of the products at breakfast Great value for money 
147366,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly Made great recommendations for dining Super location very central Great breakfast set us up well each morning Cool decor and rooms Would happily return

147368,H tel du Minist re, There should be a price list at the honesty bar We had 2 drinks each and it was quite a shock when we got a bill for 64 , Staff were very very nice and gave us an amazing room Breakfast was great Room was excellent and came with a Nespresso machine great value for money 
147369,H tel du Minist re, Except from the location the hotel is like the three stars hotel I stayed in Paris before and the staff didn t fix my problem of my room and the shower gel already opened when I live in they didn t changed it don t think I will come again, The location is really good
147370,H tel du Minist re, Standard room is a bit small but it is inevitable due to the convenient location If the room is bigger the price should be higher , Location is great Staff is friendly and very helpful Though this is a small boutique hotel they are eager to offer similar services as the larger ones including a fitness center and a self service bar 
147371,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Hotel du Ministere is excellent positioned on a very quiet one way street close to the streets where all the biggest names in the fashion have their boutiques Place de la Madeleine the big department stores and various fabulous restaurants and fancy bars can be reached in a couple of minutes walking 
147372,H tel du Minist re, Very small room and boutique hotel It must be either 2 or 3 star hotel Definitely not a 4 star hotel , Location was quite good In a walking distance to Eiffel tower
147373,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Love the style of the hotel modern chic and comfort and surprising their breakfast croissant is excellent The best one on my trip will love to stay there next time 
147374,H tel du Minist re, I suggest hotel could consider change some breakfast or guests need to have the same thing every morning , Location is perfect for me and staff is so hospitality and polite 
147375,H tel du Minist re, If you stay in the suites it is tricky navigating your luggage up the narrow winding staircase, Stayed here twice the best location because you are in the heart of it all but the hotel rooms are very quiet 
147376,H tel du Minist re, Nothing to be point out which is rare , I enjoyed everything starting from the arrival that I was very welcomed by the person at reception can not remember his name but he had Greek origin Great welcome and also on the check out 
147377,H tel du Minist re, Room to expensive I I found and we had a false alarm in the morning and after stopping it no telcall to explean, The ambiance of the hotel the location and the breakfast
147378,H tel du Minist re, couldnt access any english channels at a crucila time of the bombings and shootings was very frustrating fire Alarm went off without warning, location was good
147379,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Fabulous location Very central Helpful and friendly staff members Great Art Deco modern as well as practical and comfortable Definitely to recommend 
147380,H tel du Minist re, The doors in hall are not on controlled hinges so every morning I would hear them slamming every 5 minutes which was extremely noisy and disappointing It made it difficult to relax in my room in the mornings and a big shame as I was in Paris for work This would be a big issue for me next time when booking It would be nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room , The staff were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was always good with a wide selection Location nice and central You can walk to most places Room was small but nice and comfortable The drinks in the room were a nice touch Rainfall shower 
147381,H tel du Minist re, The hotel was sold by booking as reserve now and pay later Nevertheless the hotel charged immediately a pre authorisation At the moment of the check in I was asked again for my credit card and charged for another pre authorisation Frankly I find it totally absurd Poor customer service, Rooms are clean and new Nice bathroom and quality breakfast
147382,H tel du Minist re, Lighting could be better in room and bathroom very hard to see particularly in bathroom, Great location lovely and very helpful staff good breakfast very comfortable bed and modern room with really good shower
147383,H tel du Minist re, cooked elements of breakfast unappetising bed is on a mezzanine above the bathroom and sitting area up a spiral staircase , Location close to Madelaine station quiet street
147384,H tel du Minist re, The bed was twin bed and it always gets separated I think the wheels must have a brake or something and not enough space for clothes In the suite , The staff are too friendly and the hotel location is awesome
147385,H tel du Minist re, Receptionist was not over friendly on arrival and tried to tell me that I would pay for breakfast extra to my booked rate This was not what had been booked Fortunately on check out this was not an issue , Very comfortable and attractive
147386,H tel du Minist re, Room very small difficult to find somewhere to put the case But didn t spend much time in room so wasn t a problem , Bed was very comfy and staff very helpful Free drinks were a lovely touch although it may have been nice to have tea coffee facilities Overall very good location and ideal for weekend away 
147387,H tel du Minist re,No Negative, Location was a 10 minute walk from the Champs Elysee so very handy and 10 minutes from Madeleine Metro station or Champs Elysee Clemenceau Very comfy beds 
147388,H tel du Minist re, The staff of this hotel were simply horrible I ve never encountered such poor service at a hotel not to mention at a 4 star hotel They were rude and their service was absolutely horrible For example on the 1st night I asked them to bring me another blanket because it was chilly on that day but they refused to do so They simply told us they cannot do it in the evening Do they not have a spare blanket On the 2nd and 3rd nights they took our blankets and didn t leave one I had to call them and fight to get a blanket The lady who was on the front desk was absolutely snotty and rude She even scolded me for not telling them sooner We were touring lovely Paris during the day How could have we been able to do that during the day The room is very small and nothing worked as it should For example the hair dryer overheat every 15 seconds so I had to cool it down for 3 minutes after 15 second use It took me 20 minutes to dry my short hair The shower was horrible too This hotel was the worst aspect of our trip to Paris Avoid this hotel like a plague Don t trust other good reviews This is a horrible hotel , The location of this hotel is not bad But it requires a good 10 15 minute fast walk to a subway station so there are better choices out there 
147389,H tel du Minist re, the hotel layout is odd if staying at the suites feels disjointed Hard to access if you can t climb stairs Similarly no porter to help with luggage the day we left Staff are ok but don t go out of their way, The location of the hotel was great and we liked the size of the junior suite for our family 2 adults and a toddler
