512401,Hotel Amadeus, Nothing , The hotel is so very conveniently located just 2 minutes from St Stephen s cathedral right in the centre of Vienna The staff were marvelous nothing was too much trouble they were exceptionally helpful in answering any questions booking musical events and sorting out problems All the staff without exception were very friendly courteous and full of pleasant good humour they cannot be faulted The hotel is very tastefully furnished and exceptionally clean and bright looking The breakfast times from 0700 until 11 00 are most convenient and the breakfast itself of a high quality with a very wide range of choices available I loved my room on the top floor with its skylight and its quietness The bed was very comfortable and the decor just right and in keeping with the rest of the hotel s furnishings I would recommend this hotel to anyone as excellent value for money 
512402,Hotel Amadeus, We encountered hot weather in Vienna The air con was not very effective meaning rooms were a bit too hot for my liking but not unbearable, Excellent hotel very clean staff extremely helpful good breakfast served until 11am

512405,Hotel Amadeus, The bedrooms were too warm at the beginning until you mastered the air conditioning, There was a lovely old fashioned charm to the hotel The staff were friendly and very helpful with maps directions bookings etc The opposite of big modern chain hotels 
512406,Hotel Amadeus, No cornflakes at breakfast my partner s usual choice otherwise breakfast was to die for , staff so helpful for a first time visiting couple Such good value at this time of year Breakfast had gluten free bread as requested when booking
512407,Hotel Amadeus, Nothing , An elegant and cosy hotel in the very center of Vienna Located in a quiet street so the city noise does not bother at all Very professional and friendly staff Very good heating in the room and in bathroom 
512408,Hotel Amadeus, I hope your renovation ends as quickly as possible because the smell is awful But after renovation you will become even better so I highly recommend this hotel, I came to Vienna for my birthday and I really appreciate this hotel and its stuff for letting me stay at room until late evening free of charge when the weather was really cold They presented me a birthday cake at breakfast when they had known about my birthday it s so touching I liked my small single room you have everything you need in it And warm floor in bathroom you know it s just amazing when you come back from winter cold 
512409,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, Before Christmas it would be desirable and positive miracles The hotel did not disappointed friendly staff comfortable room very good location Thank you 
512410,Hotel Amadeus, hot rooms difficult to adjust the aircon thin curtains allowed a lot of light into the room during the night , Very east to get to from the airport excellent breakfast selection and very helpful staff 
512411,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, Hotel Amadeus is so close to all the main sights in Vienna Literally a 3 min walk to St Stephens Cathedral 15 min walk to Staatsoper Imperial Palace and Museums Quarter All around are great shopping streets and restaurants The staff were very friendly and efficient Check in check out and airport transfer was well organized Clean and comfortable rooms that are charming I stayed here just before Christmas and there were complimentary cookies and tea at the reception every afternoon 
512412,Hotel Amadeus, We all felt the hotel was very hot so cut back on the heat That was us of course others may feel it was fine , Location great some nice touches on arrival The Hotel was very clean Breakfast was also very good staff very friendly and helpful 
512413,Hotel Amadeus, Bathroom without ventilation, Great architectur style the room reception and breakfast area introduce you in the great Austrian old style It has a great atmosphere and good position Great bed
512414,Hotel Amadeus, There is no coffee in the room just tea But they were ready to make a coffee for me , The location is perfect just a few steps from the Cathedral majority of sights and shopping district And yet very quite I was on top 9th floor I was allowed to enter my room as soon as I arrived before 11 in the morning they just found the room that was ready 
512415,Hotel Amadeus, No central air conditioning or window unit Although mid Sept it was very hot and there was only a VERY loud portable AC machine with a vent tube stuck through the window without any sealing It sat on the floor and was the size of a large dehumidifier and barely lowered the temp at all , Nice staff Good breakfast Elevator
512416,Hotel Amadeus, Nothing everything was perfect , The staff was very professional and still very helpful and warm towards me It is a sportless boutique hotel with a renovated moderb bathroom and perfect tv The location is amazing The breakfast sufficient and fresh 
512417,Hotel Amadeus, Had to use credit card while booking but then I was asked for another credit card while checking in to guarantee my stay once again No possibility to exchange money in the hotel , Perfect location close to the station Nice room clean and very comfortable Good breakfast 
512418,Hotel Amadeus, Perhaps a sitting room where one could have a coffee during the day however there are plenty of bars and cafes nearby , Had an accident in Vienna on final day the Hotel staff could not have been more helpful Generally a lovely hotel 
512419,Hotel Amadeus, The bed was too small and not comfortable Too small room and old furniture , Very well located and nice attention from the staff Room Bar was complete 
512420,Hotel Amadeus, Visited in September when the temperature was still in the high 20 s Air conditioner unit was quite noisy however it did drown out the conversation noise from the bar across the road If you switched off the air conditioner it was too hot to close the window hence the issue with the conversation noise from the bar It should be noted that the bar was not one with loud music that went all night it was just the sound of conversation , Good breakfast choice central location friendly helpful staff 
512421,Hotel Amadeus, The air conditioner is not good enough We had a suite and the only air duct for the AC was in the living room none in the bedroom I was not comfortable sleeping For the money they charged the AC should have been better Other reviews have mentioned this also , Loved the location
512422,Hotel Amadeus, Nothing about the Hotel Unfortunately there is building work going at the end of the street currently which means an early morning start at 7am when the builders start work, Location to main square Stephenplatz excellent just a couple of minutes walk Friendly efficient staff good choice on breakfast buffet Room etc spotlessly clean Would definitely stay at this Hotel again
512423,Hotel Amadeus, The make shift AC box was horrible It made so much noise that we could not sleep all three days The exhaust pipe of the ac was also broken I had to fix it Because of the exhaust pipe I could not close the window and there was lot of construction noise I wouldn t call it a four star hotel with this kind ka arrangement , Location was the best part of this hotel
512424,Hotel Amadeus, During breakfast it would be good not only to have pork meat and turkey but also chicken The breakfast area is a little cramped Bad ventilation you can feel all breakfast smells in your room during breakfast time It would also be good if hotel would turn to card keys to open and lock doors There is also a building renovation near the hotel only during working hours not much disturbance though as windows are soundproofed , The location is excellent close to everything interior is modern lift is good tv air con the room was big and clean staff was welcoming we were gifted with Manner waffles upon departure Breakfast selection includes scrambled eggs boiled eggs cold meat cuts mixed meat and turkey cheese cuts vegetables pastries muesli yogurts nuts jams coffee tea hot chocolate Good soundproofing as we never heard our neighbors although the hotel was fully booked 
512425,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, Excellent staff that went beyond their duties to accommodate you Reminds you of how great hospitality used to be You are in contact with a human being rather than a robot The place to stay if you ever visit Vienna 
512426,Hotel Amadeus, No place to hang the towel Every time I shower the floor must be wet , Located near Stephansplatz which is the most busiest square in the city This hotel can enjoy a bit of quietness although it is located so near the church U Bahn is also nearby Breakfast is tasty Service is good 
512427,Hotel Amadeus, The air conditioner in the room is not cold enough It needs replacement , Everything was great Perfect location helpful staff good breakfast everything was excellent in my opinion 
512428,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, Everything is excellent over there Comfort rooms with lift helpful staff Good location and also a surprise breakfast for my daughter s birthday 
512429,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, I was extremely pleased with my stay at this hotel It s on a side street just a 2 min walk away from the cathedral yet was very quiet at night The beds were very comfortable and the staff was wonderful 
512430,Hotel Amadeus, NA all was just perfect , I liked everything from the prompt and positive reply to my lactose free product request before arriving to the warm welcome thank you Mr Florian to the swift provision of slippers when I asked for them to the little wafer gift nicely provided at the check out 
512431,Hotel Amadeus, I was here for business and it was slightly noisy until about 11 30pm when the opposite bar shut but being in a city centre location this is too be expected and 11 30 was not too late , Room itself was very good lovely breakfast Staff were very friendly helpful Great location 
512432,Hotel Amadeus, Breakfast area where food is was a bit cramped and cooked food coukd be more appealing Breakfast range was good but not great Coffee was good though and last serving delightful, Fantastic location right in centre of town The nicest staff respond to suggestions room nice large bed traditional decor Shower works well recommended 
512433,Hotel Amadeus, Most staff were lovely however when my elderly mother arrived by herself with heavy luggage to check in in the evening the one reception staff available refused to help her with her luggage he also gave her a hard time about helping her connect to wifi, great location excellent breakfast charming atmosophere
512434,Hotel Amadeus, The location is a bit tricky difficult to figure out at which corner it is in addition the staff some of them are fabulous and very helpful other are just though with visitors , Internet speed was good food was nice accommodation was comfortable 
512435,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, Great hotel the rooms are quite big the beds are comfortable the bath is great The location is amazing near Stephanplatz The breakfast has everything you need 
512436,Hotel Amadeus, Nothing to complain about Perhaps coffee sachets would have been nice in addition to the assorted teas, Just about everything The location is excellent and is on a very quiet side street Staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was superb Free Wi Fi very good I had a single room on top floor at back of building very quiet with the added bonus of a blackbird singing outside on most evenings 
512437,Hotel Amadeus, There are number of problems with hotel business it is a four star hotel But the serv ce is below 2 star Before i went to hotel i stated that we request one queen size bed in standard double room There were two small beds in the room There were no slippers no luggage table etc in the room All of above might not be problem Indeed the real problem was the staff in the reception who is far from being a solution oriented irritable hostile acts to clients behaviours far from hospitality I will put the Picture of her below I have visited half of the countries in the world i stayed number of hotels having 3 to 7 star But i never seen before such a personnel I have to state that there were no problem with the other hotel staff we visited Vienna because of our wedding anniversary But we did not have happy times in the hotel because of above stated staff We feel ourselves deceived I will write all these reviews to hotel manager also as soon as possible in detail , The location of hotel is excellent But it is not on the main Street and horse drawn carriages are never pass in front of hotel as seen in the picture 
512438,Hotel Amadeus, The curtains allow the light to come in so if you can t sleep in the light like me this would be a problem Needs a bit of renovation The windows are not soundproof so can get sometimes noisy , Great location in the middle of everything good breakfast and tea selection room size is ok for the twinroom 
512439,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, All staff were very friendly and helpful Rich breakfast bed is comfortable Located 3 minutes to Saint Steven cathedral I do recommend it Everton Vaccari

512441,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, Cute hotel has everything what is needed to enjoy beautiful Vienna Staff are extremely kind and helpful Location is very good Breakfast is OK and the lady in charge is superb 
512442,Hotel Amadeus, I didn t like The manager of the hotel at the reception in the morning and the other receptionist lady very noisy room on the side of the street starting from 6 30 in the morning curtains are very transparent so you can t avoid to be seen at night from the facing building and in the morning I couldn t avoid the light the tv cable had only cnn tv5 and rai uno all the other ones were in duetche , Marco The receptionist Guy and a A very sweet smiley Austrian Lady at the breakfast Room the bed and the Pillow and the duvet were clean and comfortable they gave me a room with a bathtub as I requested by email at the time of booking although it wasn t included the details of the room I booked on booking com
512443,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, Clean warm comfortable great helpful staff delicious and sufficient breakfast The hotel is 200 metres from the Central square I don t know why this hotel is still 4 star on the level he will easily surpass many 5 star hotels in Europe 
512444,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, the hotel is very central and walking distance to all important attractions shopping etc clean good staff and good breakfast nothing to complain about though a bit pricey but perhaps because it was in the highest fare season of the year on December 31st 
512445,Hotel Amadeus,No Negative, The location was perfect for walking to almost everything and very close to Stephansplatz UBahn for anything further afield The staff were very friendly and helpful the room was spacious the beds were very comfortable and everything was spotlessly clean Breakfast was more than adequate I hope to return

512452,Hotel Amadeus, My room door was left unlocked on day noticed it when arriving to the room in the evening at 6 30 PM My room window was left open the day before the previous issue My room was in the first floor just above the hotel main door with the shleter below my window I complained to the reception of these issues but I had a feeling that I was ignored They did not find these issues as a big thing such a things may happen I did not feel that my room was a secure place for my staff and will not recommned your hotel except wise versa , The location was great

512458,Hotel Amadeus, Very small lift just one and restaurant The breakfast could be better When i made the reservation i requested 3 rooms close to each other and it was not attended In fact the rooms were in separate floors In my opinion a total lack of attention since I booked in advance Hot rooms no air conditioner To minimize the problem the staff recommends to open the window , Good location
