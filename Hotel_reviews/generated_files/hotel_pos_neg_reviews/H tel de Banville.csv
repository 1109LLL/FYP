68832,H tel de Banville,No Negative, Very nice hotel I like this neighborhood elegant boulevards to explore Parc Monceau and lively areas in the Batignolles I visited Paris about ten times this year stayed here twice Will stay again This visit we lucked out with the timing to hear the live jazz music hotel s talented owner Nicely decorated rooms quiet pleasant immaculate Very helpful friendly staff 
68833,H tel de Banville, We booked a taxi through the hotel for Le Bourget We were quoted 75 Euros When I queried this on the morning of our journey I was initially told that was price but I asked the reception to double check Eventually I was told the price was 50 Euros and there had been a mistake Hmmmm I would recommend not using the hotel taxi service but asking them for a metered taxi which ironically ended up costing less anyway The rooms could do with an update my room absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke The staff however were very good in this respect changed my room immediately , The location was good excellent to get onto the ringroad to get to Le Bourget Area nearby is very good lots of restaurants places to drink Area felt very safe 
68834,H tel de Banville, The room via booking com was awful drab and smelt of cigarette smoke and puts me off using booking com in future It was clearly the cheapest worst and most depressing room they had on offer I asked to be moved it was that bad which they did The next room was better but still disappointing and below par as compared to the wonderful reviews high rating and glossy hotel photos Although the hotel was a bit further out than I wanted I thought it would be worth it as I was hoping for a special romantic weekend with my partner before my work trip began This was all VERY disappointing The toilet then got blocked the next day so we had to be moved at which point they did upgrade us to a room which did look like the photos on display This was the type of room I expected in the first place and I did not appreciate the rigamarole to get it I will not be staying there again in future and am very apprehensive to use booking com which I have used faithfully for many years ,No Positive
68835,H tel de Banville, Never a 4 star hand rails hanging off in bathroom rooms smelt of not nice odour infact it actually got to me so glad it was a one night stop never worth 181 euros a night , Only the location
68836,H tel de Banville, nothing , We were given an upgrade with a view of the Eiffel Tower which was a lovely surprise The staff are excellent and can t do enough to help even printing our return boarding passes for free Size of the room was excellent considering that space is at a premium at a lot of Paris hotels Breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice and the hotel is in a good position and very close to the metro and bus stops 
68837,H tel de Banville, Nothing really to complain about except for Somehow they forgot to fill up the mini bar each day they could have made more money with us , If you want to escape the typical hotel chains and prefer personal cute Parisian hotels this is for you You are in a beautiful historic building with little balconies I had a superior room and nice view over Paris Small rooms but incredible good room layout I love the location because you are next to a bus metro station you can walk to Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower and you have one of the best Argentinian restaurants around the corner La Recoleta Romantic little neighborhood The breakfast is not the typical huge buffet from the hotel chains but perfect for us and really nice and fresh fresh fruit real scrambled eggs some ham and cheese and of course good bread and croissants as you would expect in France I find 20 EUR per person a bit overpriced but ok If you are a coffee junkie like me don t expect the best coffee but hey this is not Italy 
68838,H tel de Banville, Nothing, Staff were wonderful Room was excellent especially the bed and the bathroom Variety and quality of breakfast was superb Overall an excellent hotel in a great location 
68839,H tel de Banville, 1 after 11 pm no services at all no food no bar nothing You have to wait until nxt morning 2 brakefast is very limited 3 staff on night shift dont know anything and cant help u with anything, The hotel is vey authentic if youre looking for a real parisian hotel then this is the place to be 
68840,H tel de Banville,No Negative, The hotel is charming and comfortable the personnel is very friendly and competent The hotel interior reminds of the belle poque The breakfast is delicious and with a plenty of choice There are many good restaurants at the Pereire One can get a free room upgrade with a view on Eiffel Tower if these rooms are available Highly recommendable 
68841,H tel de Banville, The downstairs lobby area is a little bit soulless and breakfast not very exciting , I know this area well so like to stay there and its easy for me to access my office in Colombes Very easy to get to the Ternes area with a lot of restaurants and shops 
68842,H tel de Banville,No Negative, I liked this hotel in the first smile of the staff in all of the increase of humanity and made it possible to ensure the most important progress and prosperity and offer them my thanks and gratitude Mr Omar
68843,H tel de Banville, The ventilation in the room seemed to be broken as no matter what setting we put it on the temperature was always volcanic Tried to leave it off for the day but came back and it was worse we had to leave the balcony door open at night , Hotel was in a wonderful location off the beaten track but very well connected We took the bus or metro everywhere Room d cor was comfortable contemporary Lovely local restaurants a 3 minute walk away without any tourists 
68844,H tel de Banville, When hot water was run in our room or the rooms next to ours the room smelt of sewage for the next few hours The walls were paper thin I think we had a locked joining door in our room which meant we could here everything next door resulting in not a lot of sleep Staff seemed to come into the room a lot which we didn t understand why we only stayed two nights and they opened the door twice while we were in the room additional to cleaning and leaving the note Water from the tap didn t run cold and the shower changed temperatures constantly We only stayed for a quick break and spent barely anytime at the hotel as we were trying to cram everything into a short stay but if we had been there for any longer than 2 nights I would have complained and asked to move rooms , Location was a minutes walk from a metro station so great for getting about Rooms were nice and clean It was a mini moon break for us and they left a note for a glass of champage each at the bar we didn t have time for this in the end but it was a nice gesture from the hotel I found the bed really comfortable and regardless of the intermitent water temp the shower had good pressure 
68845,H tel de Banville, Nothing, The staff were brilliant Especially the night porter who had to arrange an ambulance for me as I developed a suspected pulmonary embolism and needed urgent medical attention He was calm and attentive ensuring that I was safe and as comfortable as I could be he made a very stressful situation much less so and assisted with all the medical staff translating as required I wouldn t recommend you try out the above during your stay but rest assured that should the need arise you can be assured of a unparalleled professionalism and receive the best care
68846,H tel de Banville,No Negative, Excellent location easy access to the metro Beautiful room Easy check in and room was ready as soon as we arrived before the check in time Friendly staff 
68847,H tel de Banville, The bed are two singles formed to make a double so it causes the split in between And for those with back problems they may wish for a firmer mattress , The staff was polite friendly and helpful at all Times of the day Location was quiet yet accessible 
68848,H tel de Banville, Tiny room I requested a bath but now didn t have proper shower which was a shame I think the hotel also was very expensive for what it is Maybe because our room was very small it was a cosy room but overpriced I think , Comfortable beds
68849,H tel de Banville, The room that I stayed was rated as classic room It was very small for a four star hotel , Good location excellent breakfast very friendly and professional staff 
68850,H tel de Banville, The breakfast was terrible cold dregs of scrambled eggs not much selection, Beautiful hotel lovely staff location was great close to lots of things but not too busy
68851,H tel de Banville, The rate is somehow high for the overall grade , The hotel is in a quite neighborhood and Metro station is very close Breakfast is good and the hotel front desk is well English Speaking 
68852,H tel de Banville, The last night of my stay in the hotel was terrible I had a early flight to catch in the morning but there were some kind of party with too much noisy And they continued with the rumours till 00 30 No words to describe it , The location was ok easily accessible by public transport 
68853,H tel de Banville, There was nothing we didn t like , The location is very convenient the staff provided first class service during our stay and our room was a generous size with a spectacular view of the Eieffel Tower 
68854,H tel de Banville, Nothing, We were warmly welcomed on arrival by Rudy He was such a terrific host and gave us loads of information and assistance with all our questions I must also mention Hinde who was very sweet helpful to us as well as Joshua who gave me great directions at the start of each sight seeing day Absolutely wonderful staff Our room was lovely clean modern very close to metro and buses Very spacious in comparison to other hotels close by Also both
68855,H tel de Banville, It may be unavoidable since it was an old building But elevator was bit small On the other hand it reminded us old European hotels so that this comment may be for a good point of the hotel , Hotel staff was excellent We had 2 rooms for my wife and me and 2 children staff recommended to move to roof top room for 4 of us without any increase on cost It was great experience and felt we were in Paris The room had roof window reminded us Paris scene of a movie 
68856,H tel de Banville, Breakfast a bit pricey so only had one , Great quiet location easy to get to the centre of Paris by Metro or walk to Etoile The area around Perreire has great restaurants away from the beaten track This was out 5th stay so must be good
68857,H tel de Banville, Pictures on the website You cannot see the Arc de Triomphe from the hotel as it is a 10 min walk and the Eiffel Tower 45mins , We were able to park conveniently to the hotel which was free on Sunday We liked the hotel but the rooms are a good size but overcrowded with furniture 1 large bed 2 arm chairs a coffee table a chair and 2 stools Clean and comfortable though 
68858,H tel de Banville, they work with a restaurant nearby Took more than one hour before they came with the food while it was said that it would take only half an hour Especially late at night it was not ideal but ok They offered free breakfast afterwards , friendly service nice and quiet bedroom
68859,H tel de Banville, The wi fi in the room was very erratic and dropped out frequently , The friendliness of the front of house staff was second to none I have travelled extensively and never been given a warmer welcome than I was given here and on departure it was the same Bravo The rooms were fantastic with a view of the Eiffel Tower from one Servicing of the rooms was excellent I would highly recommend a stay here 
68860,H tel de Banville,No Negative, The staff were exceptionally friendly Someone would greet us each time we arrived When our room wasn t quite ready on our arrival we were offered a drink a glass of champagne The room was bright and comfortable and the buffet breakfast had lots of choice Would definitely recommend 
68861,H tel de Banville, The drop off area for luggage in front of the hotel was constantly blocked by parking cars, The room was clean and very spacious for Paris standards Really good value for money 3 minute walk to the nearest metro station the metro system is so awesome even a 5 year old could use it the parking is a a 2 minute walk away and is reasonably priced 
68862,H tel de Banville, The walls were too thin so I could hear the people in the room next door the housekeeping staff were noisy at night and there was a lot of doors banging the deluxe room only had a hand held shower the mattress was not super comfortable but passable the hot water was temperamental quite cold early in the morning , Proximity to the metro good sized room

68876,H tel de Banville, The room was not ready when we arrived and even after cleaning it was not good enough dust covering espresso machine etc Also the bar and lobby are very small and unused but in Paris you go out anyway , Very spacious room in comparison with other French hotels very kind service

68880,H tel de Banville, The location is a short journey away from the main attractions however the tube station is about 300m away and it s only a 5 15min journey costing 1 80 each to anywhere in Paria so I wouldn t say it s a negative For our budget this was perfect and I d stay again The tube is so reliable , The hotel was so nice to come back to after a busy day of exploring Paris I liked how close it was to the tube station Porte De Champerret I think that s spelt correctly would have been useful to know beforehand which stop it was Comfy bed nice clean bathroom with complimentary shampoo soap etc A very chic boutique it feels very Parisian and the staff were very helpful
