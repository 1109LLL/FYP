206499,Mercure Paris Champs Elys es, Virtually zero air con Would NEVER stay here again to be honest because of this For a huge global organisation such as Accor to not invest in proper air con is a joke Called to mention this to the reception and they agreed the air con also was bad in the place i would actually remove air con from the hotel there isn t The shower was the most ridiculous we ve ever used Turned it on and it sprays over the top of the glass all over your personal belongings TV didn t work Called staff to mention about the air con they said they d would be up to us in 5 but forgot about us and I had to call them back Terrible , It was hard to like or get comfortable in the room as it was so small Otherwise the location and quietness was pretty good 
206500,Mercure Paris Champs Elys es,No Negative, Room was nice and clean amazing comfortable bed Tea and coffee facilities in the room Lovely champayne at the bar and the complimentary nuts was a nice touch Friendly staff happy to speak English with us and help out and perfect location for us to walk around and close to metro

206502,Mercure Paris Champs Elys es, The rooms was too small and overall it is not a four star hotel Bathrooms was very small water was leaking from the tap and from the bath cabin , The breakfast was ok fresh bread and croissant The location of the hotel is ok close to metro and 5 10 min waking distance from Act de Triumph 
206503,Mercure Paris Champs Elys es, The smallest possible room that can just fit a double bed All rooms are smallish in Paris but this one beats all records Bathroom tiny no usuable shelves only a working overhead shower Address Champs Elysee is misleading on account of the hotel s location , Cleanliness
206504,Mercure Paris Champs Elys es, Room insulation very poor and nobody answered the phone at the reception during the night The room nearby ours was doing a party until 4 30 am and nobody did anything if you like to sleep please do not go there , Location

206506,Mercure Paris Champs Elys es, It was almost impossible to enter the shower as it was tiny and there is a glass door that limits your entrance , The room was cosy clean and in the center of the city A few minutes away from the Champs Elyse and many train stations The staff was super friendly and very helpful 
206507,Mercure Paris Champs Elys es, At night there was no one manning the front desk and the electric door of the hotel was open to anyone to walk in It should only open when you swipe a hotel key for example For added security 5th floor has stairs to get to it as elevator only goes to 4th Had to carry my bag up stairs with 2 slipper discs and wasn t told ahead of time At night as a woman alone I felt there could be additional security at the hotel doors and reception to restrict who can come in as no one around to ask for help in case it is needed A tight squeeze to get into the shower If you are big or pregnant As a small framed person i had to put my back against the tiles to get in as it only swings inwards due to tight space , Comfy bed and pillows Good location Cosy
206508,Mercure Paris Champs Elys es, The carpet was dirty pieces of plastic wood etc was on the floor Very noticeable that the room was not hoovered Same applies to the bathroom we found a toe nail next to the toilet on the floor A feeling that the towels and the bedsheets were not changed , Close to touristy locations The mattrase was comfortable We could live our suitacases and pick them up before out flight
