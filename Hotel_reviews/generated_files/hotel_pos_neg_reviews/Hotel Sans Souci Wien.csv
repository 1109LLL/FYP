291547,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, They really need to improve their wifi We had to log on evertytime and for my Apple computer it was a different access code but we found out only because it wasn t working with the normal code On the last morning my husband was trying to send work emails and he ended up sending them at the train station with their free wifi as he just didn t have any success at the hotel For the price we paid it was really below standard ,No Positive
291548,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Things were a little confusing at breakfast as no one was there to show me to a table I think the waiters were multi tasking so I had to stand around for a while before anyone assisted but once they did it was great and the food and service was very good , Lovely large room the staff were very friendly and helpful and the spa facilities were excellent 
291549,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, When I arrived no door man helped me with 2 luggages the entire lobby and hote has only 1 staff I was a little bit shocked Felt like a family own hotel But after 2 mins some staff show up , I booked this hotel because it s rating was so high I stayed in Hotel Sacher and Imerial Hotel before San Sochi and I can tell you San Souci is as good as them but it s only half price so it s the best value hotel for people who don t want to spend huge money but expect luxury hotel When I booked it I don t really like the bathroom with boring doors But the real room is much more beautiful than the photos They have a huge TV embedded in the large mirror this is very smart and trendy Every staff is very polite and professional of course their front desk handsome manager is the best he gave me a little gift after checkout Thanks for that 
291550,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, We had a junior suit booked and on our arrival we found out our room was upgraded to the master suit which was amazing What impressed us much was the design and its attention to details Staff very nice and professional Hotel is super clean The location is great walking distance from main attractions and far from the chaos Definitely will come back
291551,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Nothing, The staff were wonderful It was my birthday on the day of arrival and when I got to the room they d made me a birthday cake The en suite was fabulous and the bed was one of the comfiest I ve ever had Breakfast was fantastic My partner left his glasses behind and they are sending them on to us with no charge I can t wait to find a reason to go back to Vienna and stay here again 
291552,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The bathroom lights open automatically and can not be switched off It is annoying in the night when you go to the bathroom to have it lighten up like that The breakfast is good but not excellent how you would expect from t 5 star hotel , Nice and quiet room Very close to the center of Wien 
291553,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, Awesome hotel Spa fantastic Everything smelt lovely Staff professional and courteous at all time Bed super comfortable Located in the museum quarter and easily walkable to everything Food delicious Cannot rate this hotel highly enough 
291554,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, apart from 1 2 English news channels there was little else in English to watch in the evenings not even movies or sports channels Needs to cater to international travelers , Very clean hotel with friendly staff Wifi access was easy and reasonably fast 
291555,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Struggling to think of anything that I wasn t fond of , Incredibly large and comfortable bed Spacious room and well decorated room Very helpful and friendly staff 
291556,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, There is absolutely nothing negative to report on this property From the moment you enter the hotel the fairy tale begins The receptionists are eager to please and explain about restaurants in the city directions help with US mobile phones etc they are knowledgeable The beds are like clouds the room is very spacious and the bathroom is beautiful heated floors and a very spacious shower The breakfast is elaborate and well prepared We had dinner twice in the restaurant lunch once absolutely superb The waiters and waitresses are again very friendly and knowledgeable I could not recommend this property enough We met two Englishmen in the hotel and they raved about it too We are definitely planning to return to this fabulous hotel in a very wonderful city It s a WIN WIN Enjoy 
291557,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, I didn t like having to go home after a great stay , I could not fault our stay from beginning to end The staff couldn t do enough for us and were friendly and very helpful We stayed in a Junior Suite and it was just perfect Huge comfy bed large wardrobe and lovely bathroom Hotel bar and restaurant were fantastic we did the champagne tasting with canapes on the first night highly recommend I want to go back already 
291558,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, It was indeed a fantastic stay Very good breakfast extremely responsive staff and a really nice spa Located just a few steps from all principal attractions in the city center
291559,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Ladies complimentary slippers too small, Staff attententive not intrusive very professional and helpful Beds amazing linen the softest everything faultless 
291560,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Not much really It was an expensive hotel for us but well worth it for a special occassion I could be picky about other things but not fair on the hotel as it offers an amazing experience , Staff really friendly facilities absolutely amazing and walking distance from everything Food and drink were superb and the coffee is to die for The hotel room was spotless the bed simply swallowed you up and the decor was modern but fitted in beautifully with the age of the property The restaurant served great food and the all day sunday breakfast is a great idea The staff were all well mannered friendly and attentive Overall a wonderful hotel in a superb location 
291561,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, I couldn t help notice 2 small hairs in the sink that were overlooked when cleaning Since perfection is the goal also the lesser reachable areas of the sink need proper cleaning , As before in 2016 Sans Souci maintained a high level of standards all across the board Only one small issue this time 
291562,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, It was our honeymoon and we notified the hotel prior to our stay It would have been a really nice touch to have a bottle of wine or some chocolates to say congratulations but we did not have anything , Staff were very helpful and friendly We had a junior suite which was very nice 
291563,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, No view expected the street side room to be have a nice city view but it wasn t and not worth the street noise our room was on lower floor I don t like paying this much for a room that doesn t have a view Exercise room small We were not interested in the tram so we would of preferred being in the city center because of all of the beautiful holiday lights for this price , The Junior Suite was a very nice room cleaner and more updated than most hotels The door man that does a few different jobs is very helpful and nice Its next to the tram station so that s convenient for those that want to use this transportation 
291564,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Nothing, The complimentary tea and coffee service was a lovely touch The cocktails were beautiful the decor and breakfast were perfect and the staff were exceptional We couldn t find a single flaw with this hotel 
291565,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, This hotel was by far one of the nicest I have ever stayed in I just have one quiery we had to pay a 30 euros supplement a day for extra person but I booked for four people two rooms so not sure why had to pay extra can you please answer as 180 euros more than budgeted for 
291566,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Going home , Location just up the road is a great area of local non touristy restaurants 10 minutes walk to shops and Spanish Riding School Room 324 was perfect Large and so quiet People lovely Excellent breakfast Wifi a little fiddly not a big issue though
291567,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Did not permit use of Swimming pool for children under age of 6 We went all the way down to Spa in our robes with our daughter and were unable to use the swimming pool Very disappointing, Service of Staff very friendly and accommodating Especially with our daughter who has special needs Excellent service food very nice and room very luxurious Junior Suite Good value for money
291568,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Nothing, Located in the museum district this fine hotel is close to many of the key city sites but the hop on off bus tours are a must to see all that Vienna has to offer The hotel is a fine building with clean modern interior providing excellent facilities food and drink These are underpinned by superb staff who are friendly helpful and professional Vienna and Hotel San Souci provide a great setting for a long weekend break but a week would be even better 
291569,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Price for room service was on the pricey side Selection for breakfast Gluten free options poor, Location location location Spa was excellent Room service was very nice
291570,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Whilst the staff were very friendly sometimes when booking a restaurant in the morning when we returned in the afternoon no information passed onto other staff Our junior suite whilst being large 40m2 could have been better designed with a separate WC from the bathroom A lot nicer having the WC in the bathroom for example Location is near to the Museum area but unfortunately there are no good restaurants in this area so we had to go to the centre of Vienna, Breakfast excellent but when the hotel is full the space for breakfast is limited The swimming pool is very good albeit a little on the cold side but not so cold as not to swim Staff very friendly
291571,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The only fault we can find is that there could be a few more places to hang stuff in the bathroom but when everything else was so excellent it s almost ridiculous to write that , Everything was excellent comfort staff location food Couldn t fault anything You will not be disappointed if you book this hotel 
291572,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, Great hotel in a great location Walking distance from all major attractions The staff is great and very helpful Rooms are very clean This is a true 5 stars hotel and it shows in all the little details They have a great spa where you can rest after a day of walking and sightseeing Breakfast is excellent Our hotel in Vienna
291573,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, Clean and well appointed room with super comfy bed and nice linen Vey clean Staff helpful and friendly Great hotel all round Would recommend to friends 
291574,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, A better choice of vegetarian and vegan options for breakfast At least one kind of cheese should be vegetarian no rennet Vegetarians have a rather limited choice of porridge bread and some vegetables more vegetarian spreads would be a good idea , The rooms were wonderful The food in the restaurant very tasty with some vegan options The breakfast fresh and yummy A nice mixture of old and modern and a very good sound proofing Fantastic sauna facilities 
291575,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The eggs were appalling on all levels with the eggs Benedict taking top spot for the most awful eggs I have ever had more like egg soup The towels could do with being replaced to large soft and fluffy, Excellent buffet selection Spa was amazing and the bed so comfortable best ever and the bed linen fantastic like sleeping in angle wings 
291576,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, There should not be a charge for bottled water in such a nice hotel Also we mentioned that we were celebrating our 45th anniversary and there was no acknowledgement whereas in both hotels where we stayed in Berlin and Prague upon arrival we found a special acknowledgement in our room with champagne plus along with a card It was a lovely surprise , The hotel is beautiful and immaculate Our room was spacious and very comfortable All of the staff was very pleasant and accommodating Breakfast was delightful with many fine choices 
291577,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The non smoking bar area could have been more inviting may be something that will look at in the future , Attention to detail in every way You felt like you were looked after from the moment you arrived to the second you left Special mention to the waiters at breakfast including Christian and Sebastian 
291578,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Aside from the super bathroom the room could have been laid out a tad better There was room for a comfy chair and hassock but a silly impractical chair was in its place , An elegant boutique hotel Inner Stadt on one side and a nice residential area on the other Ample restaurants in Spittelburg a few steps away Bathroom was superlative 
291579,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, Great location close to U bahn station and right near museums Comfortable and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful Would definitely recommend this property 
291580,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, We really liked almost all of the breakfast lots of variety but the Eggs Benedict was the worst I ve ever had Please ask your chefs to learn how to make a proper eggs Benedict with muffins , Amazing hotel Fantastic suite good pool and spa nice breakfast Has a pool that was mostly empty when we went Rooms are well decorated and spacious Has a good bar that serves some tasty cocktails 
291581,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, i would like a bigger closet for clothesp, i am impressed with every thing in this hotel althoug i tried alot of five stars hotels even on Austria Every thing was perfect espically the two youngladies in the reception Anna and Sarah the luxcirios cutlery glasses fine china plates the lightning in our suite the water system in the toilet really everything
291582,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Pool could be larger but you couldn t expect more in the centre of Vienna Bar wasn t particularly large or atmospheric, Fantastic location and great service from everyone at the hotel Breakfast is a fantastic buffet and rooms are large and comfortable
291583,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Nothing, We loved the hotel The staff are extremely nice and helpful Each one of them The decorations of the hotel is awesome The location is great I would love to come back one day From all five stars hotels that we stay in each trip this is the best
291584,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, pool was great but only alone bathroom needs more hooks to hang things place was a bit over designd , very nice personel attention staff everywhere friendly great breakfast comfortable bed and great bathroom 
291585,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The staff in the breakfast salon was not very experienced and usually it took some time to place orders, Very nice location close to Museums Quartier Rooms are clean and I have been positively surprised about the equipment in the fitness center and the swimming pool The hotel has a good air conditioning has been quite important due to the hot temperatures outside 
291586,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, They would have had a bonus if the hotel had a jacuzzi at the spa and a bad in our room, Everything was excellent Staff is very attentive the room is clean and comfortable and the food is wonderful The spa is of a very high level 
291587,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, It raises your expectations So going back to a supposedly 4 star hotel the next day was a bit of a bummer 8 , 5 star performance in every way Dedicated and friendly personnel excellent design and facilities great drinks and food Spacious room Location couldn t be better for a Vienna city trip Top hotel experience for a higher and fair price If the budget permits I will be back for sure 
291588,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, Outstanding hotel excellently appointed very friendly and hospitable staff Very close walking distance to major Viennese landmarks U line is 50 meters away Breakfast at Veranda Restaurant was great We liked the restaurant so much we didn t feel like eating out elsewhere had dinner there every night 
291589,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Nothing we couldn t fault it, Great pool gym and sauna Breakfast fabulous dinner lovely too Very nice helpful and knowledgable staff lovely lounge bar area
291590,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, The lobby is beautiful I loved the floral fragrance We were welcomed with refreshing warm towels cool beverages and cookies The staff was very helpful at all times The junior suite was elegant and well appointed I loved the warm toilet seat in the WC There were many hi tech features including surround sound The bathroom was large The breakfast was wonderful with a large assortment of bread fruit cereal meat cheese and vegetables The eggs were made to order The serving staff was pleasant and most helpful This is one of my favorite hotels worldwide 
291591,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The hotel staff doesn t meet any requirements of 5 star hotel Besides minor shortcomings like bad timing waiting for an ice for 30 minutes which according to hotel s booklet should be delivered instantly the greatest dissapointment was the neglect by reception to send a porter to help me to descend almost 100 kilos of luggage upon my departure Moreover the administration simply forgot to give me the letter with important documents that came by DHL to the hotel 3 days before my departure As I got known about this at the airport where was no possibility to receive it I kindly asked to send it back to the indicated address but unfortunately it didn t arrive therefore I have to restore it right now ,No Positive
291592,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, We found that the lamb and chicken were just too pink for our taste , Sunday brunch was a buffet feast to behold A great selection of mostly cold meats fish and interesting salads Good puds too 
291593,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The indoor pool water were too cold for us we ve tried in 2 different days and hours and could not let ourselves in very cold We choose that hotel ONLY for its indoor pool At the end we stayed the 6 nights without using it If we new that cold water issue from advance we would rather book another hotel near the ring in half the price We don t blame the hotel for that We ve been in many hotels where the water were warmer and assumed it ll be the same here We were wrong , Excellent place to stay no words to describe have to experience to understand 
291594,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Breakfast fruit Maybe some strawberries or a fruit compote would have been nice Being picky because everything was very good , Very friendly helpful staff Beautiful room with own steam room Really lovely bedroom 
291595,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, To much space for some kind of dressing room that makes the room itself a little bit smaller, Very nice hotel excellent breakfast friendly staff and very good location 
291596,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Noise of trams and traffic despite having requested a quiet room Getting a bill on checkout for the room which was paid in advance and when I challenged it and had it corrected there was no apology, Clean and good bathroom Good breakfast Helpful concierge
291597,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The bar s smoking area was candlelit golden and mirrored totally lovely but the non smoking area was over lit unwelcoming and totally lacking in any atmosphere We also forgot to sign the chitty and a grumpy barman who clearly disapproved of our failings had to chase us down the corridor We nearly didn t bother a second time but braved the smoke on our second visit met a happier and altogether welcoming barman and had a much better experience , The location of the hotel was really good just behind the key museums and within 5 mins walk from key attractions yet still reasonably quiet We had a very large double which was a beautiful room with a large bath shower room and with plenty of seating space It was well equipped and spacious and we particularly appreciated the Molton Brown accessories and the free tea The staff were absolutely excellent really helpful and friendly especially on the front desk and the front door Nothing was too much trouble from restaurant recommendations to hailing taxis Even the chambermaid checked every night to see if we needed anything which was a lovely touch The breakfasts were delicious with a huge variety of food and the service was equally good although we did not eat dinner there The outside of the hotel does not reflect the interior although we did not visit the spa all of the public areas were beautifully designed especially the reception 
291598,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Recomendation from concierge for dinner was misleading and disappointing but I was too polite to say so afterwards It required a 20 min taxi journey each way and a cost of 40 Euro in total We subsequently found a far superior restaurant the next day in the same price range via trip advisor I feel for a 5 star establishment this kind of misdirection is disappointing and I feel the concierge may have had alterior motives sending us out to the suburbs or had a family connection to this restaurant , Spa facilities were excellent Breakfast was civilized with no panic or crowds
291599,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, wifi did not work on my mobile computer was ok , nice boutique hotel in a perfect not so busy touristic location just next to ubahn station and a nice stroll from city center room very nice luxury extended room specially the bathroom toilet Nice spa area great pool Very good eggs benedict for breakfast all eggs and pancakes menu made on order and very nice breakfast attendants Veranda restaurant dinner 5 course menu very good 
291600,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Bigger towels The staff a little better trained in the restaurant , The room comfy bed decor pool spa complimentary tea and coffee brought to the room 
291601,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The Hotel Bar arrangement was a little unfortunate for us in that you had to walk through the Smoking section to get to the Non smoking section , The staff throughout the hotel were superb and were happy to help with any issue we had that really made the stay a great experience 
291602,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, One of the reason we booked this hotel is because they had a lady spa as advertised in the booking site However when we asked at reception no one in reception believed there is such a thing I emailed the hotel and they said that they renovated their Spa area last summer and they built an additional relaxing room instead of the ladies Spa We were so disappointed that this was not updated on the booking site , Breakfast was amazingly delicious and staff were very friendly The room was very modern and nice 
291603,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Pool a little bit cold for swimming, Very pleasant and helpful staff Tastefully decorated rooms with quality fittings Excellent breakfast Great location
291604,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The man at the reception never smiles He wasn t welcoming at all Don t understand why this hotel is 2 in Vienna We stayed at Junior suite and the room was okay but I would choose a better one next time They let us check out late but then the card key they gave us didn t work after noon so we had problems using the elevator and even entering the room So we ended up trying three different keys and of course we had to go all the way to the reception to change the keys The worst part happened when we were in the room packing and it was BEFORE the check out time a staff knocked twice or so and just barged into our room and asked if she could check the minibar Seriously the worst experience ever, Comfy bed Nice amenities Separate bathroom Breakfast 
291605,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, I ve stayed at this hotel every time I went in Vienna so I was really disappointed when they asked for a full night room rate when I asked if I can clear the room with some delay 2 or 3 hours because my car was in service Next time I will think twice about staying there , Cleanliness
291606,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Overpriced Very bad experience with my last stay I had to pay for 2 rooms to get an upgrade to better room with normal size bed , SPA location hotel design
291607,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, This was my 4th visit to this hotel I ve strictly selected twin bed room since it was available on booking com When I arrived to the hotel they said thay only have queen bed room with really small bed not suitable for two 6 feet tall men We kindly asked to upgrade to higher category if available but the claimed there is no other room available I opened booking com and saw there is Master Suite available for selected dates at 4x higher price and asked them if I could upgrade They still refused to do it telling they are full booked so I just booked that another room via booking com while I was there in the hotel I got confirmation from booking com and they had no option but to sell us that room I just could not believe they are not interested to sell 4x more expensive room Even after we told them we cannot sleep on such a small bed that we initially got After we left the hotel they decided to charge us for both rooms even we did not use the first one with the small bed Really bad experience that I would never expected from the hotel of that category I have a feeling they don t have enough personal to keep the hotel at high level Also Main meals can be ordered to room only until 2 30 PM so if you are hungry at 3 PM you cannot get anything but salads and a desert Air conditioner was too loud we could not sleep with it turned on When set to automatically it just turns on and off every minute like crazy , Location and hotel design SPA 
291608,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, Very well equipped and maintained boutique style hotel the staff could not have been more welcoming and friendly Perfect location for Museum Quarter and Hofburg Palace I travel a lot for business and leisure and this a real European gem Would definitely return 
291609,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Everything was perfect, Lovely breakfast cold or hot served with champagne Staff were excellent very helpful and friendly Nice bar where they served great cocktails before and after dinner
291610,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, These is nothing that I could think of , Nothing was too much trouble for the well trained and professional staff Little complimentary surprises were left in our well appointed room such as afternoon tea or canap s Pool gym and spa facilities very good Our included breakfast was high quality 
291611,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Cannot fault anything, Great service friendly helpful staff Good food Relaxing atmosphere Beautiful room Everything you d expect from a Luxury hotel 
291612,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, This was the only time i ate Breakfast in a Hotel and stayed Hungry From the the begining of 2016 I Stayed in 6 Different Hotels I didnt feel anything special about this Hotel and this is a Huge disappointment , Wifi Worked Well Kind Staff Metro just outside the Hotel 
291613,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, Bed was extremely comfortable large shower lots of hanging space for clothes beautiful decor great reception area excellent staff great bar overall a great hotel
291614,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, Had a great 3 nights in Sans Souci Breakfast was fantastic and spa and pool where amazing Room was lovely clean and fresh Wouldn t definitely stay again 
291615,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, we can always hear people walking with high heel outside our room The lobby is very small which doesnt seem like a five star hotel , the staff at front door and restaurant are very friendly and helpful regarding to our room we enjoyed the bath and shower in bathroom 
291616,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Slightly more choice for the buffet breakfast not really a complaint as the food was really good, All of the staff were exceptional perfect location excellent spa facilities great room this hotel has got it just right Thank you for our perfect stay 
291617,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Ordering eggs and coffee tea at breakfast is a bit chaotic but the staff are so friendly and helpful it didn t become a big deal They might want to look at how the system works however The swimming pool is long and narrow good for lengths but the material used makes if feel like you are swimming in a giant underground sink an unusual experience , Good atmosphere in the hotel Nicely designed rooms Good facilities Recommended 
291618,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Some people spend time looking for faults and I understand that reviews are a useful guide to future visitors I can not think of one negative to say about this hotel so I m not even going to try , The room was beautiful and the staff are very friendly and helpful This hotel was perfect and if your travelling to Vienna then you should look no further than this hotel If you want to go that extra mile book a junior suite it s worth it for the bathroom alone 
291619,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Having to walk through the smoking area of the bar to get to the Non smoking area Also I feel the hotel is missing the benefits of a loung area , We liked nearly everything about the hotel the staff are very professional the breakfast was very good and our meal in the restaurant was outstanding 
291620,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, If I really had to put something I would say the swimming pool was a bit too cold for me , This hotel is in a great location walking distance to most of the city s attractions Superb well trained staff nothing was too much trouble The whole place was spotlessly clean Our room was very well appointed and very comfy Food and service at breakfast also great 
291621,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, I don t really have anything bad to say If I were being really picky I suppose the breakfast buffet could be bigger in terms of choice but I found it more than adequate for what I wanted , The hotel was a five minute walk from the Rathaus Christmas Market and two minutes from the Natural History Museum I found the beds really comfortable and on the one occasion I used the spa I had the swimming pool sauna and steam room entirely to myself so if you want to relax it s a good place to stay Staff were also really helpful and we re able to recommend some good restaurants particularly on the Sunday after Christmas when not much was open 
291622,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Staff were not aware of what was around them venues etc Where to buy a cigar on a sunday Answer citycenter they did not know this They need knowledge of whats around them and how to get it , location by train and all major restaurants and shopping Location in general Cleanliness excellent food 
291623,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Nothing, Everything especially the girl on reception I think her name was Vanesha Brilliant Every restaurant she booked for us was great The guys at the door and in the bar were just fab Nothing was any trouble to the staff 
291624,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The rooms could have done with a llittle more storage space The electronics in the room were far too complex The reccomendation we got from the front desk was very poor in that it gave us a very bad table cramped and behind a door so we did not stay, The staff were charming friendly The location was good Service was very good and the bar was very nice Breakfast was especially good
291625,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Had to wait a long time for service in the bar Just went out to get a member of staff so not a big deal, The staff here were excellent Very friendly and they couldn t do enough to help They gave us some great advice on restaurants etc The room was beautifully decorated with a very impressive mirror tv The breakfast was great and the food in the restaurant couldn t be faulted Great wine list with a lovely Austrian Sauvignon Blanc Fabulous 
291626,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, The property is just lovely the rooms and bathrooms are excellent Well located within walking distance to most attractions and the staff are all very accommodating Really can t say enough about the hotel was perfect 
291627,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, I didn t found something bad but it s just small note for anyone who plane to come to this hotel in the breakfast will not found alot types of food in front of you you have to order it , I like the stuff they re so friendly and helpful Also I like the location everything are near by you Also I like Mr SARI Ms Olivia they re so kind and helpful for anything 
291628,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The etrerance to the late bar was reserved for smokers which meant that non smokers had to walk through a smelly room to get to the non smoking area When in the non smoking area the smell of smoke was obvious each time the door was opened by the waiter , Friendly welcoming staff where nothing was too much trouble All the staff were happy to in recommending place to visit and easy The breakfast was very good
291629,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, It was difficult to access the wardrobe due to its position by the bed I am rather short and couldn t see in the mirror in the bathroom, The location close to all the major sights and the metro The pool was great after a day of sightseeing The d cor Lots of excellent small restaurants within walking distance
291630,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, It is quite pricey though for a short trip and travelling with my infant it is worth it , Service was excellent and thoughtful which is very important when travelling with infant They have baby bathtub and cot Whatever request we ask we get it promptly without the need to ask a 2nd time 
291631,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, There was absolutely nothing negative to report about this hotel , Everything was wonderful room pool staff I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Vienna 
291632,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, Nothing, Location Staff Parking Cleanliness Breakfast Room facilities Toilet facilities Water Pumper machine is great for Muslims mainly 
291633,Hotel Sans Souci Wien,No Negative, Fantastic position in the Museum Quarter Our room with balcony was exceptionally large comfortable clean The breakfast buffet was wonderful with many choices All staff were always very helpful 
291634,Hotel Sans Souci Wien, The Wi Fi was only free up to a certain point , The staff was friendly and helpful and I LOVED my room It was so spacious and extremely clean I so enjoyed my stay and would definitely return The location was also perfect for me
