294505,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, Without paying a lot more I don t think you would get much better, Location Lots of restaurants nearby but the hotel was quiet Area was lively but not just full of tourists 
294506,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, I didn t like being in the basement it was a little too secluded for someone on their own , Very conveniently situated near town and hospital where my husband was staying Very reasonable 
294507,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, The parking was extra expensive as it doesn t belong to the hotel although there hardly any other places to leave the car, Close to tube station but quiet
294508,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, Parking extra 40 per day and room rates high but I guess thats just central London for you , Good location Very comfortable clean rooms Nice English breakfast buffet Friendly staff

294511,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, The cost of watching movies and that the original price i seen for a 2 night stay at the hotel on booking com was 250 and due to me having to ask permission to book this hotel i went back on to book and it cost 372 which was a substantial jump within a day I still booked the hotel based on its location and the holiday inn reputation, The amount of choice at breakfast was great and the staff were very helpful 
294512,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, Rooms are too small Bathroom is very tiny and door barely opened to pass to the toilet We were a group of 7 and every room was the same I would definitely not stay at this hotel again Just because of the room size , Breakfast was excellent Great location Very friendly staff 
294513,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, The view from our window was into the courtyard which was a roof with plastic trees , The location is great 5 minutes walking distance to Regent s Park entrance Two tube stations within 5 minutes of walking to connect you to the shopping streets and tourist attractions The breakfast was really good and very varied Continental and English whatever you wanted The twin bed room was bigger than what is usual for London Enough space for two people with weekend bags might be a bit of a tighter fit if you have huge bags

294527,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, The restaurant staff could have been more efficient they seemed understaffed the evening we ate there , We had a very good meal at the steak restaurant at the hotel although on the night we ate there they seemed a little understaffed and we actually had to ask them to clear the table as a couple we sat for well over 30 mins after finishing our main course before the table was cleared

294533,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, The rooms next to the street below are not good because of the noises from the traffic The smoking area should be relocated further from the lobby , Location is excellent Walking distance to all the places I wanted to go The front office staff to the housekeeping staff are friendly

294755,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, The first night of my stay I was on level 6 I found the room way too hot and stifling I had to ring down to reception to ask for the heating to be switched off The man on reception was very pleasant and this done asap but it took a good while for the room to cool down and I was feeling unwell as it was from my journey Also a couple of days before my trip I emailed Holiday Inn to request an earlier check in time When I arrived I was told that this email was not received but that if I paid an extra 20 I could check in early I wasn t particularly happy about that but as I was feeling unwell I paid the extra charge Just one other point The staff on reception the day I arrived Sunday 21st February were all very pleasant however it would be so helpful if at least one of them had fairly good English Even just one person out of the 3 That would make things easier after a stressful journey , The location is fantastic The second night of my stay I stayed in a different room on level 2 and really preferred this room It was light and airy I loved the little fridge in the room too very handy 
294756,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, Tired d cor with grout loose and falling to the floor in the room Bath dulling I often stay in holiday inns and this one is without a doubt has offered the shabbiest room to date Considering the location a surprise then , Location in relation to my business destination the following day

294761,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, The room was really small I mean bed and table and that was it Ok for just sleeping in but hardly any room to swing a cat in Also the lights were pot luck when you didn t know what switch did what And the light fitting was hanging loose from the ceiling When I booked I booked for a price of 140 per night When I checked on the day I could ve paid 99 per night Ridiculous that I couldn t get it at this rate for booking in advance , The central location was brilliant and ideal for getting down to oxford street for shopping
294762,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, When I arrived the room was cold and did not heat up until about midnight The reason was because when the full length curtains are closed the reflective backing on them keeps the heat towards the window They need to be half length to show the radiator , Check in was quick Room and bed were satisfactory Breakfast very good 
294763,Holiday Inn London Regent s Park, There was only one minor thing that was unpleasant about our stay we had a room with a door in between us and the next room This was a problem because we had really noisy neighbours shouting and slamming wardrobe doors at 5am in the morning This is not the hotels fault that they had Inconsiderate guests , We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel as regular visitors to the city we have stayed in many hotels but this one stands out from the rest the staff was very friendly and helpful the location is really good just a five miniute walk to regent street and twenty miniute a to London eye The cleaners did a brilliant job we had fresh towels and nice clean room to rest The hotel bar and restaurant serves good food and drinks with a relaxing environmental I would recommend this hotel I have already booked my next stay
