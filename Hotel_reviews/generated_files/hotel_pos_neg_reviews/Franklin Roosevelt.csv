77985,Franklin Roosevelt, The noise coming from the works next door first thing in the morning The staff did move us after we complained The breakfast wasnt included in the price although upon check in we were led to believe it was Consequently I paid 50 for a cup of coffee one morning When I spoke to the reception about this they didnt do anything to compensate , Comfy bed and the drapes kept the light out well
77986,Franklin Roosevelt, Having to leave the key at reception every time you leave to go out was a bit of a pain No restaurant on site meaning no room service For this kind of money and 4 stars I expected a little more While this is close to most of the major tourist attractions I found myself walking a lot back to the more happening part of town about 30 minutes away , The location is extremely central to The Eiffel Tower and the Champs lys es meaning if you are up for a night out or wanting to check out the Crazy Horse show it s only a few minutes to get back to your hotel The room I had was quite spacious with a huge bathroom area with bath and twin sinks Hotel bar was quite cute and had a small selection of decent spirits 
77987,Franklin Roosevelt, Furniture in room could use some updating and remain in theme of hotel, Staff was excellent Hotel location is convenient for pleasant walks to all of the major attractions Numerous restaurants in the area 
77988,Franklin Roosevelt, Shower head was leaking tap in the sink as well Because of that the tap was very hot to touch at first , Central Location Reception Service service of an early breakfast in the room bed silence
77989,Franklin Roosevelt, Mindful the bathtub is a big step up Shower head a bit dated , Wonderful stay staff were friendly and helpful cute little bar downstairs for a pre dinner drink Room was big for Paris had everything we needed Great restaurants nearby 
77990,Franklin Roosevelt, Not so convenient for mobile charger No charger near the bed , Stay here for 6 night business trip The breakfast is quite good but if there has a day selection special for the day will be better Because we have 6 same breakfast 
77991,Franklin Roosevelt, I have to say that room 32 the bathroom fan needs to be fixed sorry guys I know that is not bad the only thing I would say and this is weird if your sitting on the toilet and need to get paper prepare to stand up to get it hahahahaha yes that is only thing I could even think of that is bad about this hotel awesome place especially if you can get a good deal do it , Ok so I will have to say the front desk staff is excellent especially the early morning shift dude I have to admit I would think he probably has heard it all but still put up with us tourist great guy and you can see he really tries I just would love to hear what he says about us all when he goes home and has a few glasses of wine but great guy and good staff The rooms are just like the photos and clean and very nice The locations is in the heart of the city and you could not ask for a better location if the heart is what you want 
77992,Franklin Roosevelt, Their was construction going on n it use to start very early morning n there was no notice on the hotel or o The website it was very anoing could not sleep well in the morning I complained n no response from the management not happy,No Positive
77993,Franklin Roosevelt, We got the ground floor room which did not have a view Our door is right next to breakfast area which is a bit noisy Can not control the heat had to open the windows to lower the heating , Location is near the champs elysees Clean hotel and great room size 
77994,Franklin Roosevelt, bed is too small street noise in un bearable heating is too warm, location lovely four stars boutique hotel staff are very friendly and always cheerful room size is just perfect
77995,Franklin Roosevelt, Shower head was too small by today standards There are heavy works ongoing was there 17 March 2017 on the building next door during office hours during the week , Discounted 50 Shower was nice except the shower head was too small by today standards 
77996,Franklin Roosevelt, I found it weird the hotel closes the main door after midnight this is good for security but if your planning to go back late to the hotel you need to ring a bell for one of the staff to open the hotel door for you This was a bit annoying but safety wise its good , Loved everything I did not expect the rooms to be big and extremely clean The hotel is in a good location easy access to everything the staff were supurb Worth every penny 
77997,Franklin Roosevelt, they only provide complementary water in the first night, its location very close to the active street Shamps Elyssey and some other sights and shops the staff at the receiption were very kind and supportive with smiles
77998,Franklin Roosevelt, The description of the advertised rooms was appalling and not consistent with the booking confirmation We paid for a triple room for three adults with three twin beds On arrival there were two single beds and a child size roll away bed placed across feet of the single beds Upon complaining about this situation we were informed that this was the only option available a triple room The only option offered by the hotel was additional single room at a cost of an additional 1000 euros to us We paid for a triple room plus an additional single room without any adjustment to our original contract , Location and quality of hotel was excellent
77999,Franklin Roosevelt, They changed our room to accommodate us to two twins for my daughter and I but put us right next to the construction next door The jackhammer was so lud we could barely hear each other speak and our bodies vibrated from the jackhammer not good I would not put ANYONE in those rooms near the construction until it is complete , Lovely staff and wonderful accommodations we will return in the spring 
78000,Franklin Roosevelt,No Negative, Rooms were well appointed and absolutely beautiful with hardwood cabinetry and marble counter in the bathroom The bed was like sleeping in my own personal cocoon with a lovely mattress feel and a soft as a cloud duvet It was the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in The staff was friendly and courteous and speaking english was not a problem 
78001,Franklin Roosevelt, Room wasn t ready for 3pm We arrived slightly early at 2 35pm but weren t able to get in to the room until 3 30pm We were offered a coffee whilst we waited which we said yes to but this never appeared Keys to the room too chunky and I don t like leaving the key at reception when out , Room a good standard Great location for all the tourist spots Great restuarants nearby where you get a little extra bit for your money Got the room on offer and it was definitely value for money not sure I would pay full price 
78002,Franklin Roosevelt, Breakfast in nice atmosphere however price too high considering offer and choice, Friendliness of personnel Style of hotel Location close to Champs Elys es
78003,Franklin Roosevelt, Well some of the staff members were not very polite One of them made a stupid joke on the day of our arrival I accept it as it is not a five star hotel , The room was good but the view from the window was not The hotel it self is small and comfy Located pretty close to the shopping street Very silent location Not so croudy 
78004,Franklin Roosevelt, Hotel rooms were very warm even with the air con on full , Very relaxed quiet boutique style hotel Staff were friendly and very helpful The location is terrific few minutes walk to the Champs Elysees and about 15 20 mins to the Eiffel Tower which we could view from our room There are plenty of restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel Pierre Jean Paul being one that serves exceptionally high quality food but at a price to Chez Andre across the road that is a bit less formal but decent all the same 
78005,Franklin Roosevelt, Can t really fault anything , Nice comfortable room of good size for Paris Nice bathroom in which everything worked with very comfortable bath Excellent location 
78006,Franklin Roosevelt,No Negative, Walking distance to all must see in the center of Paris The room was very nice with a balcony spacy and surprisingly quite Staff very friendly and helpful Breakfast good
78007,Franklin Roosevelt, At the end of our stay we were charged with refreshments we did not consume and could not have the charge taken off , Extremely professional staff Very nice room and the location was excellent as there was plenty of restaurants and shopping within a 10 minute walk Beautiful views of the Eiffel Tower within a short walking distance We only had to take a taxi to get to and from the airport 
78008,Franklin Roosevelt, There is construction going on with the work starting around 8 30 am We were on the 3rd floor Loud banging noises on the floor above or on the roof ,No Positive
78009,Franklin Roosevelt, Could have had a proper hairdryer rather than a classic hotel bathroom machine but probably not an issue for most people , great location very helpful staff elegant peaceful clean rooms 
78010,Franklin Roosevelt, night staff looked over tired not very excited to assist us this is my second visit in three months may we had return too soon to the hotel , cleaness quite location
78011,Franklin Roosevelt, Staff and operations I almost miss my flight as I had to check out at 5am and there was no one at front desk for 10 mins AND the front doors were locked A joke for a 4 star This place should be ranked at 3 max , Location
78012,Franklin Roosevelt, Bed mattress, Cosy very clean room and hotel I have observed the lady cleaning the bathroom l have never seen such work in very high standard hotels This is my hotel for years to come in Paris Excellent reception staff Special thanks to reception staff Mr Vincent Who brought up the extra heater in the room 
78013,Franklin Roosevelt, The heating was too high which made my room really hot , The hotel is located close to Champs Elysee 10 minute walk and also close to local shops bars and restaurants It s also around 20 minute walk to Eiffel Tower The breakfast room was very good nice selection of food The staff were very welcoming friendly and always helpful 
78014,Franklin Roosevelt,No Negative, Perfect location just around the corner from Champs Elsyee and also lots of restaurants bars nearby We were upgraded to a suite which certainly added to our stay The whole experience was excellent 
78015,Franklin Roosevelt, On booking I was led to believe that the triple room had 3 proper beds but on arrival it was 2 beds and a sofa bed Which was far too small for our 16 year old 6 foot tall son The rooms were also far too hot even with no heating We were told that the air con had been turned off for the winter , We liked the location 
78016,Franklin Roosevelt,No Negative, The room was gorgeous and very spacious I had bought some CDs with me so I delighted to find a CD player in the room I was also very glad to find a boiling water jug so I could make a cup of tea when I felt like it
