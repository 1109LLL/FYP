136903,Hotel Square, One of the reception staff did not have the communication skills necessary to work on a front desk Made a few mistakes in regards to payment Interpreted me while I was asking questions Refused to give me a second room key even though we were 2 people staying in the room claiming that guests had previously left the premises without returning a key ,No Positive
136904,Hotel Square, The bath needs a box or a glass to avoid water on the floor Apart from this it was perfect , Great Location with several positive points such as Private Parking Ground Transportation in front of the Hotel Buses 22 and 90 could lead you to almost everywhere in Paris Shopping Center on the other side of the river Cafe just on the corner Room very agreeable and staff super helpful Great stay 
136905,Hotel Square,No Negative, The staff is exceptional Marie and the rest catered to our every crazy whim and need whether it was a hair appointment directions or a bucket of ice I cannot say enough about the service At the end of the day the hotel room was very nice clean and comfortable but the real luxury is the people who work there

136907,Hotel Square, all fine been there since opening more than 20 years ago still very nicely kept and updated myh favorite place in Paris, very good quality breakfast
136908,Hotel Square, This isn t a great location for sightseeing It s close to the Eiffel Tower but the other main sights and the centre of the city are a metro ride away and as the metro isn t particularly well designed very long walks to change lines for example this is time consuming We chose this location deliberately though because we were attending concerts at Radio France next door and it was convenient for the Parc des Princes too Also it s quite noisy as the hotel is at the junction of major roads and the Pont de Grenelle and the French toot their horns indiscriminately No tea and coffee making facilities in the room , This is a beautifully designed hotel with excellent beds marble bathrooms and lovely designer fabrics and furnishings The reception staff the only staff we encountered were of the highest possible calibre knowledgeable friendly and pleased to be of assistance The concierge helped us before our trip to get tickets for PSG v Arsenal at the Parc des Princes and now we are back home and have discovered we have left things in the room they are very kindly going to pack them up and send them to us Staff of this standard made it a pleasure to stay at Hotel Square

136914,Hotel Square, I tried to get breakfast on the 1st morning but no one was around the only member of staff I could see went to find a waiter but it was obvious they did not really want to serve me The room was dark and the lighting insufficient The bathroom only had a bath and no shower not even and in bath shower you could stand under There were no face cloths in the bathroom The bed was very hard indeed , The food in the restaurant on the 1st night was very nice Most of the staff were fine and pretty friendly but the night receptionist got quite upset with me when the sensor on the front door would not react to me and I had to tap on the window I was left standing outside at 11pm The decor and painting in the communal areas and the building are all lovely
