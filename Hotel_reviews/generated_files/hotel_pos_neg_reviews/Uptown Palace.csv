487400,Uptown Palace, Breakfast is poor cappuccino is more an overheated caffelatte croissant and bread were stale absent service It is not the easiest solution if you have a car there is parking few minutes walk from the hotel To enter in Area C Milan restricted traffic area where the hotel parking is located you must purchase and activate an entrance ticket , Quiet modern room
487401,Uptown Palace, Bed was two single beds pushed together which was rather uncomfortable The lighting in the room was quite poor which made it difficult for my wife getting ready Hotel bar was rather disproportionately priced for the rest of Milan 5 euros for a soda water and 9 euros for a bottle of beer the mini mart down the road has chilled bottles of beer for 1 50 and your room had a fridge , Central location and staff friendly and helpful Hotel was aesthetically pleasing and nicely furnished Shower in room excellent Breakfast was good but was included in the price of the booking Free Wi fi in rooms which worked perfectly well Staff were able to get you a taxi in minutes if you needed one Some excellent resturaunts a short walk away Piz Pizza Bar and Al Mercato burger joint well worth a visit

487403,Uptown Palace,No Negative, I like this hotel We told the staff that we are here for the honeymoon after the check in they sent us a beautiful basket of chocolate with kindness message from the staff 
487404,Uptown Palace, Cost to get to the International Airport The meal in the hotel restaurant was very ordinary , The hotel was pleasant The room was comfortable and the bathroom was fabulous The beds were really excellent However as we only stayed one night the hotel was too far away from the international airport and it cost 100 euros for a transfer Good place to stay if you have several nights and can take the opportunity to explore Milan 
487405,Uptown Palace, You could hear everything from outside or the corridor from the room If you re not used to traffic noises you might get bothered , The staff knew English well and were quite serious but professional The room was clean neat and had all necessities but I missed lotion Big shower and double sinks in the bathroom fabulous Cleaning staff were smiling and helpful 
487406,Uptown Palace, unfortunately although have mentionned at my booking that would like to have a quiet room they gave me the most noisy room of the hotel at first floor you feel like you are at the outisde and all the vehichles pass through yoor room there is also big construction just front of the hotel which starts making big noise at 08 30 in the morning for he last 2 days they gave me a very quiet room at the 8th floor did not like also some behaviour of reception staff , compared to other 4 stars hotel everything looks very new proper and clean The location is great by having only 10 minutes walk to Duomo area and also close 5 minutes walk to crocetta metro station Good quality for the breakfast

487409,Uptown Palace, There was no bodylotion provided in superiour room also room seemed a bit small just as we arrived there was hair stuck to one of the towels Huh not a good start Only one bathrobe provided when two people staying On the last day of our stay they actually left less towels than usual wondering why D bed was 1 large double but with two single matress so uncomfortable sleep guaranteed pillows plain not as soft as you would expect in 4 hotel also there was hole in curtains and very dusty room , Breakfast was amazing lots of differend thing to choose from Staff very attentive and friendly helpfull when in need of hepl perfect location 24h shop just 50m away

487415,Uptown Palace, The location is convenient and about a 15 minute walk from the Duomo However it s on a main road that it the outer limit of the inner part of Milan so if you want something really really central it s not for you , The staff are very friendly and helpful Quiet clean well furnished rooms with quiet A C Excellent breakfast 
487416,Uptown Palace, The hotel does not have a pool sauna or other similar facilities for relaxation Room was supposed to be equipped with bathrobes but we had to go ask them separately from the reception And again the next day since the cleaners had removed them for some reason , Very friendly staff at reception Room was nice modern clean and quiet Walking distance to Duomo and shopping area Breakfast was OK and not too crowded at any time

487427,Uptown Palace, Nothing all as expected, Location walking distance to all main sites and attractions plus access to lovely local restaurants staff really friendly and helpful ignore comments on TripAdvisor re breakfasts all very well organised and plentiful varied 
487428,Uptown Palace, Smell in the bathroom we had a room in the first floor to the street and it was very loud at night, Hotel is within walking distance of 10min away from Duomo
487429,Uptown Palace, The pictures of the suite that were shown on booking com were misleading and we got in some kind of misunderstandings with the staff On the picture it was looking like I got the Presidential suite but when I arrived I was given an Executive one The staff explained that they do not advertise the Presidential suite on booking com therefore they are not available and it was impossible to get one on this website It took me an hour to verify all this information Beware of the pictures , The hotel itself is amazing Very new and modern with great facilities We had a suite with a nice view of the Duomo Very nicely decorated and extremely cozy I would say pretty luxurious Loved the smell in the hotel and the rooms Simply beautiful The staff was nice The breakfast was incredible for an Italian hotel Very rich and fresh Recommended 
487430,Uptown Palace,No Negative, A bit of the beaten path 20 min walking distance from the Duomo although still City Center so quieter than expected turned out to be a very pleasant surprise Comfortable rooms friendly staff Good value for money during the busiest week in Milan

487433,Uptown Palace, It certainly did a good job as a hotel but you could have been anywhere in the world It lacked any charm associated with being in Italy , Everything was as you would expect from a hotel 
487434,Uptown Palace, The sink in the bath tub did not really work and the shower was modern but a disaster to use but there was a rainfall shower too which was better No minibar in the room and the bar in the reception area closed early , Location in close proximity to metro duomo and the city centre Nice view from our room Free working Wifi 
487435,Uptown Palace, The hairdryer in the room all of a sudden stopped working while my wife was drying her hair We tried the one we brought from the US but it shorted out because of the difference in voltage They gave us a loaner at the desk , The breakfast spread was nice 
487436,Uptown Palace, The free Wifi is a joke During Salone del Mobile every hotel hikes their rates into the stratosphere I was paying 600 and the wifi was not even secure and you had to log in every day it kept kicking me off so I was incurring data charges when I thought I was on wifi You had to pay another 9 for secure wifi I left and came to a lovely guesthouse in central Rome where the wifi is free and SECURE This is what I expect at every hotel in this day and age , The rooms are very comfortable and the bathroom is grand The breakfast is lovely and the staff very attentive The restaurant serves incredible dinner food but the dinner ambience in the breakfast room leaves something to be desired 
487437,Uptown Palace, Nothing, The staff were very helpful and friendly The quality and choice of food at breakfast was excellent The location of the hotel is brilliant as we walked a lot You can walk to Duomo the canals and other places quite easily The room was spotless and had everything we needed
487438,Uptown Palace, We were put in the first floor overlooking a main road so we couldn t have our curtains open because cars were so close Got very little sleep all night because of the traffic right outside our window and emergency service sirens It was so loud it sounded like the windows were open There was also no iron in the room water was an additional cost and there were no plug sockets near any mirrors No English tv channels Breakfast was very average Not a great experience for the price paid could ve had much better elsewhere for less They also make out the hotel is much more central than it actually is Definitely couldn t have stayed for more than 1 night , Location was okay Bathroom was nice Staff were very nice 
487439,Uptown Palace, We requested a tooth past but room service told us they don t have We asked for a plate and knife to eat fruits and they asked us to come and take it otherwise they will charge us for room delivery , I booked an extra day as my flight was at 10 pm but the staff informed me that no need to pay the extra day and rather than that I should pay 50 Euro as late check out fee That made my day 
487440,Uptown Palace, Staff attitude was not proper as i have experience of ignorance during my conversation with on of the reception staff as well i asked iron from reception but they didt respond at first and in next time they replied rudly that we are busy and you have to wait The room wasnt that spacious and the location little far, They extend my stay until 2 pm i appercitae that the break fast in room is a bonus and wad so great an generous Cleanness is good and above standard
487441,Uptown Palace, Although they denied it was a smoking room and for two allergics it was simply aweful We had a terrible night and altough we told them they simply ignored it , Location and decor

487443,Uptown Palace, For the price paid for two suites for 3 days I found ir ridiculous to have to pay extra money in breakfast for fried eggs and waffles We spend 2 000EUR in th erooms and then 8 euros for a fried egg It s not what I expect for a 4 star hotel and for suite customers Also free internet was not good so also had to pay 9 EUR for a decent wifi Again alls those extra costs should be included in the room price Disappointed ,No Positive
487444,Uptown Palace, Wifi was very bad quality the hotel charges for a better connection The room was quite small and average for its high price With no city view , The hotel staff are very friendly Especially the ladies at the breakfast always smiling The room and generally the hotel is made of very amazing materials and marble The hotel location is good just 18minuts walking to the Duomo square And 3min to a nearest grocery Very quiet and comfortable rooms

487451,Uptown Palace, Hotel restorant room service was bit expensive and pasta was not as good as it should have beein in Italy Also on arrival I was asked to show crwdit card from where i payed for my stay which i have never seen anywhere before and would never think togather with prepaying had to have card with me , Liked atmosphere Great view from my room and nice breakfast Walking distance from Duomo 
487452,Uptown Palace, For those who are seeking an early dinner after a very long day of sight seeing etc e g 6 30pm the options are limited as the hotel restaurant only serves dinner from 7 30pm Room service is an option at 7 per person on top of the actual cost of the meal which is not exactly cheap There weren t many options for food around the vicinity of the hotel with many restaurants cafes closed and there were also some which were not worth paying for This resulted in a good 15min walk to find a decent restaurant to eat at which was quite disappointing , The room and bathroom were very nice and clean 
487453,Uptown Palace, The cleaner kept throwing out the container for portable contact lenses We were not sure why this was considered garbage, I loved the breakfast in the Morning And the extra assistance at reception area 
487454,Uptown Palace, Breakfast was not so Italian except for the procciuto and formaggio Too American style for me , Rooms were clean and confortable Bathroom spacious enough Location 10 min from Duomo 
487455,Uptown Palace, Nothing of significance here really , The staff were always helpful in every aspect Also the breakfast was good the scrambled eggs were quite nice The bathrooms are very clean and room service was provided with fresh towels etc every morning The location is within walking distance of Duomo about 15 minutes which was also good 
487456,Uptown Palace, Tea and American coffee are available at the buffet but it took a long time to get a cappuccino very slow service , Very nice and clean room Very close to metro station and city center within walking distance Quiet rooms
487457,Uptown Palace, A small thing I would definitely prefer real cups instead of paper cups for the tea coffee tray in the bedrooms , The best sleep I have had in a hotel in a long time the room was not too warm heating easy to control and the bed was extremely comfortable Excellent breakfast Nice bar area for a relaxing nightcap Friendly and efficient staff 
487458,Uptown Palace, I wouldn t recommend that hotel to anyone who likes classy and respectful service The first night we arrived we were expecting a bathtub as pictured in the booking photos except when we arrived it was a shower So we complained they told us we had to wait until the next day but to check out at 10am and come back a 2pm so at first It was ok but still we were left without room The next day my girlfriend was taking a bath when they suddenly called us complaining about water coming down from the floor We were understanding but nothing came from us They kept pushing us to leave the room and made us hurried up We weren t feeling comfortable at all And finally the breakfast was nice but not amazing the location neither ,No Positive
487459,Uptown Palace,No Negative, Excellent location close to tram and subway train Comfortable room with all facilities Very good breakfast included in room rate Internet worked very well 
487460,Uptown Palace, lighting in the room could be brighter layout means soft spotlights around the room but need central lighting, very friendly and helpful staff cleanliness great room changed every day for toiletries top up and clean towels even for a 3 night stay location good choice for breakfast selection decor modern and bar area relaxing

487464,Uptown Palace, Breakfast was ok Charging extra for eggs and extras etc on top of the standard breakfast was a poor show Not what I would ever expect from a hotel, Service was overall very good nice ambience about the place Staff were helpful
487465,Uptown Palace, The mini bar is not really refrigerating Bring a good mug or ceramic cup for coffee or tea they give polystirene cups, Nice hotel spotless clean spacious bathroom great shower comfortable rooms satin lining accessible B94 from Cadorne 100 m away and then the malpensa express for airport Tram 16 24 around the corner 2 stops to Duomo M3 5 10 away Nice pasticeria and good coffee around the corner Location very good Breakfast is abandoned machine coffee on request very good I dined in the restaurant expensive but very very tasty worth the money incl a great wine list I ve been on 11th floor not much view but who cares as the lovely city is right downstairs Good fresh air from open window no street noise when closed
487466,Uptown Palace, Room was tiny and dull Dark brown was ugly and depressing Furnitures cheaplooking Soundproof doesnt work voices from street and corridors was disturbing And really disappointing was the restaurant where we eat once The food was good but the place was so tiny and ugly So this is not 4 star but only 3 star hotel , The cleanest place ever The bed and pillows best ever in hotels where I have tried to sleep Lounge and lobbies was beautiful 
487467,Uptown Palace, The location with current road work makes staying at hospital less appealing, The ambience of the hotel a very comfortable bed Good value for money overall Bell boys were amazing

487475,Uptown Palace, Business quarter A bit of a walk at night to a restaurant , Excellent breakfast with hot and cold food in plentiful supply Some subtle touches which made it high quality from start to finish

487485,Uptown Palace, It is a four star hotel with great facilities but maybe not as many comforts as would expect in a four star hotel e g Only pre made filter coffee for breakfast However this is probably why the price is so good 10 15 minutes walk from duomo , Very nice facilities in room modern and spotlessly clean Very good value for money 
487486,Uptown Palace,No Negative, Excellent location short walking distance to central Milan and the Duomo Very helpful staff Very comfortable and attractive rooms Hotel is very modern and contemporary but welcoming and friendly

487494,Uptown Palace, How perfect it was , If anything was worth paying for in my life it was this hotel I don t know where to start the welcome the perfect breakfast clean and ultra modern rooms the staff especially the reception I don t know his name but he Said he was from Africa It felt like a 5 star hotel I reccomend walking to Duomo 10 mins and to other parts go to Crocetta metro station only 4 5 mins away Milano is expensive so you will definetely leave a lot of money on accomodation but make sure its in this hotel 
487495,Uptown Palace, It was a very small room, The hotel was great and the location was just as nice The proximity to the center of Milan and the yellow metro line made it easy to her around My husbond liked the breakfast buffet alot 
487496,Uptown Palace, Would barely rate it as a good 4 star Charge 7 Euros everytime something needs to be brought up to your room Wanted an ice bucket the bar man said that I either had to come down to get it or pay 7 Euros When I asked why do they charge 7 Euros for room service he rudely repeated you either come down and get the ice or we charge you 7 Euros Never been held ransom for Ice Don t know how they got rated as one of the best of 2015 Won t recommend it at all , Comfortable in a good location
487497,Uptown Palace, The room where we sleep was in front of the street we could heard all the cars crossing any time of the day The breakfast was good but everyday was the same one nothing changed on the 4 days The bath had green and black lines with mold From 7am till 10 30 is the breakfast the restaurant was over us and we can heard the chairs moving when the people stand up this with the cars can guarantee that you not sleep anymore after 7am The lid of the toilette was broken on one side so every time you seat down it moves complete to one side so at the end you was in the ceramic again , The people who work there are very friendly and helpful 
487498,Uptown Palace, I forgot my gold jewellery in the safe in the hotel room and contacted the hotel as soon as I got back Fortunately the hotel had found them and agreed to send it to us by express mail if we pay for the charges which we happily did When the jewelries arrived we were shocked to discover all gold pieces were missing and the other jewelries were sent to us We informed the hotel but neither the hotel nor the courier MBE and UPS takes responsibility for the missing pieces and tell us off by pointing at each other Although a nice hotel we are deeply disappointed in our experience with this hotel and would never go back NOT RECOMMENDED, Nice room and lobby
487499,Uptown Palace, Our room had a funky smell that the staff did not or could not do anything about I never got an explanation to my complaint, First proper breakfast in Italy Meaning more than just sweet cakes
487500,Uptown Palace, They could have advised us that there was work ongoing but it didn t really effect us that much, The Staff were excellent very helpful We were originally meant to travel a week earlier they changed our booking with no charges without any problem Breakfast was very good great variety and if there something else you wanted they were happy to get it for you Location was very good 10 min walk to the Duomo We had a suite as we were celebrating a special event and the suite views were lovely
487501,Uptown Palace, Booked a junior suite Our friends booked a deluxe room Our room was a delux with a wall separating which made it clostrophobic where the delux was roomy and spacious We paid 120 extra for a cramped room When we complained they said they would move us but not refund the dicference We had been out all day and decided to have a night cap in the hotel bar and rushed back as we had been told the bar closes at 1am We got back at 12 54 and we told no to a drink as the bar man wanted to go home After voicing our annoyance we did get a drink but with very poor attitude and service , Comfy beds Nice decor
487502,Uptown Palace, Gym would have been nice, Interior beautiful but business like Beds very comfortable in fact everything required for a city stay Would definitely recommend it and stay again Staff very helpful 
487503,Uptown Palace, As is usually the case city hotels have relatively small rooms The prices in the bar were really quite high The hotel is further away from the centre duomo than was expected and you need to use the metro , The hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful The decor was impressive Good free wifi 
487504,Uptown Palace, Very unprofessional stuff at the reception Not possible to open the windows in the room , Location room value for money Biggest and nicest surprise was the breakfast The real breakfast not Italian one Rooms are better than on pictures 
487505,Uptown Palace, Being a 4 star hotel they dont even give you complimentary bottles of water you have to pay Eur 3 for each and Eur7 for room service if you order No iron no clock in the room Not staying here again, Location
487506,Uptown Palace, Nothing, The Check in staff polite efficient very helpful The breakfast very plentiful The rooms although on the small side ok the bathroom great loved the rain head shower Close to most sights 
487507,Uptown Palace, Nothing the staff were VERY helpful and courteous , The hotel was located fairly close to the historic center of the city definitely within walking distance of the Duomo There was a supermarket nearby for picking up groceries The rooms were clean modern and a pleasure to stay in The breakfast buffet was incredible 
487508,Uptown Palace, Prefer walk in shower rather than shower within bath , Breakfast was lovely Kettle in room to make a hot drink Very close to tram stop and a couple of hundred metres from metro Can walk to central Milan from hotel 
487509,Uptown Palace, Our room looked out onto the Santa Sofia and was very very noisy to the point of actually not being able to sleep It sounded like the windows were opened although they were not Also we ended up having a dinner at the hotel one night Would not recommend it at all no atmosphere no ambience empty tables and the food wasn t great either Oh what a waste , The room was spacious and the bathroom very modern and stylish
487510,Uptown Palace, Nothing really except the weather which could not be helped, Lovely room on the 9th floor Clean and tidy Breakfast was included which was an awesome spread Seemed to cater to every nationality
487511,Uptown Palace,No Negative, Perfect location close to the metro M3 station Crocetta or Missori Close to The Duomo and all main tourist attractions Just a few steps from the hotel there are supermarket 24 7 workings pizzeria gelateria others shops Room was great comfortable modern decorated quiet perfect cleaned Service flawless Breakfast very good 
487512,Uptown Palace, I was quite disappointed they had a service for tea and coffee but then supplied styrofoam cups x2 and 1 plastic spoon which dissolved virtually in the Hot water Also there is a fridge but there could have been milk or UHT milk supplied instead of powdered milk My thinking is they should modify this arrangement as it is called Palace everything else lived up to this except for this and i was so looking forward to a cup of tea Also i could not see any maps of Milan available this would have been helpful , Beautiful room and a large deep bath Also bed was divine They allowed me an extra late checkout as i had a late evening flight and the weather was very bad Which cleared up and i checked out just after 1 pm Huge breakfast assortment Concierge very helpful and i could leave my bags at the hotel and know they were looked after a few hours as i explored wonderful Milan on foot and or by public transport 
487513,Uptown Palace, they took a long time to make the room up late afternoon and often we did not have tea and coffee In the room We thought it was an expensive hotel not sure we would go back there , the reception staff were excellent the breakfasts were very good and nice staff 
487514,Uptown Palace, Everything was excellent, Excellent managment manger and helpful friendly people who are working there Loved the decoration of the rooms and hotel Good location You will be pleased when you stay there 
487515,Uptown Palace, The free wi fi is too slow and it is not acceptable having to pay 8 day for high speed internet Not even a small bottle of water is for free and the fridge was turned off therefore not so fresh , Nice room big bathroom quiet and modern structure Location very conveniente for the centre 
487516,Uptown Palace, Sophisticated shower system which was tricky to work The spa bath was superb Wifi was adequate for general browsing but wasn t superfast , Staff were very friendly and helpful room was fabulous the view from our room was incredible great location short walk to centre 
487517,Uptown Palace, Room service plates from next room left in corridor for 2 days Pasta ordered from the bar in the hotel tasted awful shocking considering we were in Italy , They folded down our beds and gave us chocolate Also gave us very good restaurant recommendation in Brera Hosteria Della Musica 
487518,Uptown Palace, The wifi is free but the connection was just so so many times the connection failed especially at night The entrance is a bit small we were travelling with a toddler The stroller can just fit through the door if the kid is not sitting in it Otherwise had to use the side door , The location was good walking distance to Duomo Breakfast was good Friendly staff in the lobby Clean rooms
487519,Uptown Palace, There were no cupboards or drawers to lay out our clothes so we had to live out of a suitcase other than the items we could hang in the wardrobe , Bed extremely comfortable bathroom very luxurious with twin basins bidet power walk in shower and heated towel rail Beautiful white fluffy towels which were changed every day 
487520,Uptown Palace, Staff in the breakfast room were lovely and had an array of food to choose from just found all the food a bit dried out and bland , The staff were friendly and helpful We got given an upgrade on arrival which we appreciated greatly and enjoyed since we have been in and out of hotels in 4 different countries for the past 2 and a 1 2 weeks We were only there 1 night but the room was spacious and very comfortable with plenty of luxury bathroom items and we even received a knock on the door only to be given some little chocolates after we settled in Suitcases taken to our room for us Enjoyed our stay 
487521,Uptown Palace, Nothing, Value for money breakfast as it was included in price of room Staff were excellent and couldn t do enough to help us Within walking distance of some traditional restaurants which were also value for money Duomo was about 10 minutes walk
487522,Uptown Palace, Room was small we were on honeymoon no special arrangement from Hotel Stuff were nice bed was small and there was a gap between the king bed it was scandal to us , Very clean
487523,Uptown Palace, Very dissappointed experience specifically with the services provided by the hotel and reservations team Even I was a loyal customer the reservations team charged me twice for a room and didn t informed on my arrival that under my name there was a second booking reservation Therefore I wasn t only charged but also they didn t provided me with the second room The personelle over the phone was very unhelpful and was unprofessionally blaming me for the error without acknowledging that the reception falled to provide me with the second room I don t believe that this attitude is aligned with any 4 star hotel ,No Positive
487524,Uptown Palace, Very expensive Tiny room Very little storage space for 2 people , Location was excellent 10 minute easy walk to the Duomo Good breakfast Comfortable bed Friendly efficient staff Tasty dinner in hotel reastaurant 
487525,Uptown Palace, The location is not in the best neighborhood There was graffiti on the walls right outside No restaurants cafes within walking distance We were told room service was available but when we called no one picked up We tried several times We had a view of the back of a building when we requested a view this is not what we intended Very disappointed , The hotel facilities were clean Enjoy having slippers available 
487526,Uptown Palace, WiFi needs always to re connect No Hotel parking Breakfast only medium quality No space for suitcase in the room, The Location Friendly service WiFi included Nice hotel Bar
487527,Uptown Palace, The room is a bit tiny and there was sometimes a weird smell coming from the bathrooms Water sometimes didn t go away from the tap like if it was blocked , Staff was really friendly and helpfull The hotel is well located and you can walk only 10 minutes to find the duoma the castle and all the shops The inside of the hotel is beautiful 
487528,Uptown Palace, Rooms are too tight breakfast is poor staff is extremely unfriendly In dining is overpriced and extremely not tasty escalope Milanese came burned ,No Positive
487529,Uptown Palace, Street noise but little the hotel can do about the sirens horns A couple of the front of house staff were unhelpful but some of them really excelled providing a very personal service There isn t a gym which is pretty standard for this grade of hotel , Great central location close to lots of restaurants and shopping Good decoration throughout Most of the front of house staff are friendly and helpful some no so but wasn t sure if that was a language issue more than attitude towards helping The restaurant lacked atmosphere as just us eating but the food served was really good Breakfast choice was good with enough options to suit everyones taste 
487530,Uptown Palace, The Hotel Bar Closed around mid night, a lovely modern hotel in a good location only 10 minutes walk from the Duomo and the shopping area Rooms although not over large they never are in italy had plenty of space to move about the room The beds were comfortable and the large TV was in a position on the wall at the end of the bed that made it easy to watch with out straining a neck muscle There was tea and coffee in the room as well as a mini bar A great full legnth mirror good mirrors and lighting in the bathroom the water pressure was good in the shower Every thing was nice and clean There was a hairdrier I would have liked and iron and iroing board but a quick call down to reception and I had one delivered with in 5 minutes There is a Bar area which is comfortable enough to stay for a drink and not just a meeting area The buffet breakfast was good with a wide choice of hot and cold food The staff could not have been more helpful from the moment we stepped out from our taxi on arrival to when we departed the hotel We asked for a recommendation for a resturant in a particular district of Milan the reception gave us a resturant that was tucked in the back streets we would never have come across left to our own devices it was perfect the food and the service spot on The hotel reception phoned ahead booked our tables and organised taxis to take us there I would use this hotel if I return to Milan and would recommend it to others 
487531,Uptown Palace, Having to wait for service in the dining room when only 3 tables were occupied Not busy at all but we waited at least 20 mins for someone to come back and take our order Also not given drinks menu when we sat down Had to ask for it ourselves , Everything was very clean and stylish All staff very polite and friendly Always someone available to help you during your stay 
487532,Uptown Palace, I believe the price is a bit to high Also I think the consierge must check first which kind of taxi is arriving to take the hotel guests to the airport We payed 95 euro for a small van we were only 2 guests and the way to the airport was terrible , The staff is very welcoming smiling even at 4AM The breakfast was great the room was very clean and quite We had a clean beath robe new towles ans shampoos every day We loved coming back to the hotel each evening its a great hotel for sure 
487533,Uptown Palace, No facilities at all No gym dark rooms, The Rooms are good but to dark to work in After an upgrade to junior sweet the view and rooms where good They gave me some discount on the upgrade which I appreciated
487534,Uptown Palace, The breakfast is good but not up to the expectations for such a hotel , Modern clean hotel well located a few min away from a metro station and around 15 min walking distance from the Domo Very clean Nicely decorated and spacious rooms and bathrooms Far above of what the Italian standards for a hotel are 
487535,Uptown Palace, Room 311 next to elevator and restaurant very loud and noisy late check out as requested and confirmed didn t work normal 12 2h 2pm staff said normal 11 1h 12 staff at breakfast slow waited for coffee over 30min tables dirty almost all food empty no parking 10min walk expensive Hotel charged before 50 from credit card boyfriend paid again at check out full prize so staff doesn t know whats going on, nice room new bathroom 15 min by walk to dom breakfast for italy good
487536,Uptown Palace, Room was little tight although I booked the more spacious option The breakfast was good and staff working were very nice However it lacked many hot options and lacked a variety of vegetarian options no steamed vegis etc Would call it a 3 star hotel breakfast not 4 star The hotel also lacked a gym if you re a gym guru Wifi is free and speedy The only downside is that you re provided with usernames and pw each good for 500MB only Therefore once 500 is out you need to sign in again with a different combination Quite uncomfortable for watching streams , Hotel in good location Close to Duomo 15 min leisurely walk Staff very friendly and helpful Parking close by and not expensive at 19 EUR per 23hr Room very comfortable and bed and pillows too The shower is amazing and bathroom is spacious Room amenities very good We were allowed a late checkout for the two rooms booked at 2pm as part of the Genius member and 10 lower price at booking so use it My daughter 4yo was provided with a comfortable child bed at no cost Room was clean There is a pharmacy and supermarket 2 mins away walking extremely helpful Overall recommend it and would stay again in the hotel 
487537,Uptown Palace, Fantstic staff were very informative and helped with all aspects our stay Very close to crocetta metro stop and only a few stops away from tourist attractions and shopping Will definatley stay here again when in milan,No Positive
487538,Uptown Palace,No Negative, Nice location 13 minutes walk from Duomo Square 3 minutes from Carrefour Express Market 5 minutes from Metro Station Wonderful Buffet Breakfast Modern decoration The only downside was the room size Too small And no free internet 9 Euros for 24 hours and 15 Euros for 48 hours 
487539,Uptown Palace, The wifi was free only for two hours in the lobby and then you had to pay something like 5 euros per hour the TV wasnt working and the matress was quite uncomfortable , Great location 10 min walk from Duomo and 5 min from a metro station New and clean hotel friendly staff and nice breakfast 
487540,Uptown Palace, No gym and or spa There was no iron for when I wanted to iron my clothes and the breakfast had very little variety aswell as not having too many things to choose from Other than that it was top , Loved the staff So helpful and always at the customers beck and call The room was nice and clean and spacious The location was also absolutely perfect as for taking transport or going to the centre 
487541,Uptown Palace,No Negative, The location was terrific central to the city center by foot near the subway and within walking distance to more cafes and restaurants than you can count 
487542,Uptown Palace, The choices of breakfast buffet is so less no car parking and the reception is very small, The internal design and the clearness of the rooms the location the services the staff are very kind exapt one on the disk was very in welcomed lady 
487543,Uptown Palace, The room we were upgraded to was excellent apart from being very noisy during the night even though were on the 12th floor facing the Main Street which had a lot of emergency vehicles with sirens blaring during the night , Location cleanliness 
487544,Uptown Palace, The personnel at reception were unwelcoming The room I wasa given was much smaller than the one shown in my confirmation of reservation No wifi in the rooms , The beds were comfortable the room was quiet 
487545,Uptown Palace, breakfast is too much for the mass not as personal as the rest of the hotel and as a restaurant in the evening there is no ambiente too much light and already breakfast prepared for the morning please no , super thank you for this delightful sight to the dome was close to rearrange how the bed it placed as it would be nice to lie in bed and enjoy the view maybe you do it now

487547,Uptown Palace,No Negative, This hotel was excellent and we couldn t have chosen a better place in Milan as it was centrally located I will recommend to all my friends and business travelers 
487548,Uptown Palace, the wifi is not free You have to pay for the internet The laundry is outsourcing so you have to handle your clothes in the morning and you will receive it the next day very slow , Clean and comfortable hotel
487549,Uptown Palace, Staff should be more pleasant and kind with customers Wifi should be free in a 4 star hotel such as this one How can you ask for 5 for 1 hour wifi after paying 600 for one night Come on Gym should be there, The hotel is very nice rooms are well equipped It is clean and comfortable 
487550,Uptown Palace, Poor breakfast for Italy more like average US hotel Charged for internet in the room outrageous when charging Euro 300 per night, Nothing in particular typical corporate tourist hotel
487551,Uptown Palace, selling the international adaptor is a point of question especially for guests who are staying for short period BF is repetitive not very optional , A 4 stars hotel with a services and facilities up to 5 stars hotel Rooms are well designed in a good taste Liked the hotel I recommend it
487552,Uptown Palace, wifi isn t free breakfast wasn t that great TV only had Italian channels which would all be okay but considering the price we paid not that great Also in our room we had this buzzing sound that would start every ten minutes for a good while then would stop and start again Slightly annoying at night, Very clean and stylish
487553,Uptown Palace, ultramodern shower was too weird Terrible music at breakfast and water for tea was not hot Why is it that cheap hotels give free WiFi and expense hotels make you pay, Great room fantastic view comfortable bed
487554,Uptown Palace, They charge extra money for the wifi And its a bit pricy, Wonderful hotel very classy and well built The staff is very helpful and nice The breakfast was the best i had in italy Beautifull and clean room The location is great only few minutes walk from the dumo and from the tram and metro 
487555,Uptown Palace, Initially given a room next to lift even though request was for quiet room particularly since I just arrived after a long 22hr flight Finally request for another room was granted However great Discomfort of trying to use sit on the toilet seat I believe I was given a disabled room , Short walk approx 15 min to duomo and City centre Breakfast was good After the problems with my room staff did eventually try to make up for the inconvenience
487556,Uptown Palace, I didn t like to pay for wi fi or for printing in the business center for the price of the hotel I would hope this things would be included , The room was clean which is very important to me

487559,Uptown Palace, No internet on the room if you do not pay 9 per night extra The reception ladys is rude and have service knowledge The price you pay for the rooms don t match what you get Be aware that the pictures the show is probably from their luxury suits The normal room is rather small , Walking distance to the city center Nice breakfast staff 
487560,Uptown Palace, Unfortunately we had a bad experience with restaurant staff that evening who were arguing with each other Also kitchen staff chef coming looking in on restaurant and staring at us several times Restaurant very cold and poor choices Very uncomfortable situation however after feedback with Gabriel restaurant Supvr he apologised and put into place some service recovery by offering us drinks in bar and left word with reception staff next morning to apologise again They offered small gift as part of apology Shame about all this as hotel very comfortable but they need to review staff performance and somehow give restaurant a lift to encourage more people to use Perhaps not in a convenient floor for guests to use Hope this feedback helps Manager to improve facilities and address staff issues , Hotel good location to Milan Cathedral and major shops 
487561,Uptown Palace, The restaurant was a bit pricey for what it was , Good location Not near Centrale Stn but walking distance to almost all attractions Staff very helpful spoke English Great brekky Lovely lounge bar area Thanks
