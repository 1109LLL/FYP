314161,HCC St Moritz, Plenty of personalised notes in the room Which is good But some of those notes felt like a warning rather than a sweet note One i rem was smtin abt dear valued guests Towels r for ur use while u r staying in the hotel Almost sounds like the hotel is warning us not to steal the towels But maybe im reading too much in to No complaints at all otherwise, Location is great Very clean Big enough rooms Helpful and cooperative staff
314162,HCC St Moritz, Limited breakfast buffet Not good value for the price , King size bed and size of room Shower curtain Friendliness and assistance of front desk staff Great location Complementary drink coupon 
314163,HCC St Moritz, Staff were rude Room service wasn t completed properly for example dirty sheets from previous customers were still left there Dirty taps , The location was the best thing about this hotel 
314164,HCC St Moritz, Rooms are showing their age a bit but are very clean The only quite minor thing I could comment on are the old style weak blowing hairdryers the type that are attached to the wall and take a long time to dry your hair , They very kindly had our room ready when we arrived at 9 30 am a real rarity The room was very spacious for a city hotel room and faced away from the street making it very quiet which we had requested Everything was very clean and they even provided a little vial of lavendar scented pillow spray We have stayed in Barca several times and this is by far the best location walking distance to everything and a great tapas place Tapas 24 across the street Staff were also friendly though we didn t interact with them much We would definitely choose this hotel again Our rate was 160 night which we consider fair for this city 
314165,HCC St Moritz, The room was terrible without window with glass door to hall I ve heard every minute all what was happened there Curtains couldn t be closed so the light from the hall the whole night was looking into my eyes At breakfast the staff was really unfriendly , Near passeig de Garcia 
314166,HCC St Moritz,No Negative, Thought the staff was outstanding Friendly helpful and courteous The location is also great with a lot of attractions within walking distance I have stayed there before and will probably make reservations for there on my next trip to Spain 
314167,HCC St Moritz, Bathroom very small Breakfast a bit disappointing didn t like the muesli pastries were too sweet , A surprise bottle of cava chilling for us on arrival Didn t drink it though 
314168,HCC St Moritz, The layout for breakfast could be better There were frequent delays waiting for people to clear the areas The toaster was innadequate and took ages to warm up The hot food could be improved and the range of bread increased , Very helpful friendly and approachable staff Located in centre of city however on a quieter street very near the main visitor attractions to which all are walkable Comfortable room Excellent restaurants nearby 
314169,HCC St Moritz, None , Excellent location very close to the main street Easy to reach many important places to visit Modern style nicely decorated spacious room for three people Good breakfast Very helpful kind and caring staff 
314170,HCC St Moritz, The staff were a little miserable Maybe they didn t like working at Easter , The location was excellent and very easy to find from our train stop 
314171,HCC St Moritz, Restaurant closes too early Pillows very hard and thin Had to leave the room to find enough lighting to read a book room lighting very low , Spacious public areas and nice size room Friendly welcoming staff 
314172,HCC St Moritz, We had 3 rooms reervate and paid the hotel for New Year period in one of the rooms I had an extra child No manager to explain that you have to pay something that otherwise we did it and the receptionist told us find another location The manager had a defiant attitude arrogance and discriminatory,No Positive
314173,HCC St Moritz, Did not try the food so cannot comment on that side otherwise all was fine except that I had to pay the total bill in advance upon checking in , Excellent location Everything was satisfactory and up to our expectation 
314174,HCC St Moritz,No Negative, Excellent location very close to the direct train from the airport near one of the main underground hubs and a short walk from key shopping and other attractions 
314175,HCC St Moritz, The dinner hours were not specified clearly at the hotel s restaurant , The location and car park were the important aspects for us The room and bed sizes were way above average Pleasant and comfortable hotel with high cleanliness 
314176,HCC St Moritz, Nothing to complain about however the breakfast was 23 Euro each for a buffet which is very expensive for Spain If they made it cheaper we would have used it but 50 Euro for breafast for us meant we didn t , Great staff excellent location nice rooms and comfy bed 
314177,HCC St Moritz, The room looks very dark and claustrophobic The air con was not working and hotel staff did not get the problem sorted , The front decor of the hotel is nice 
314178,HCC St Moritz, 22 Euros each for breakfast was way too expensive Would have preferred a safe with a punch code instead of locking with a key which had to be carried , The location of the hotel was close to the Metro cafes restaurants and hop on hop off buses The front desk staff were very helpful and spoke English Would recommend this hotel 
314179,HCC St Moritz, All staff members were really nice and professional except for the receptionist on my checkout day I had a disappointing incident when I received an abrupt phone call from the receptionist around 1pm telling me that I had to pay a half day charge for the room since I didn t checkout at noon time and that he called me before noon allegating that I answered him with a confirmation telling that the call was recorded Of course this alarm call wasn t received at all as I asked for the manager to come to resolve the issue This is when the receptionist agreed to let me leave without the extra charge but after giving me really hard time especially when he asked for the safe keys to be brought down after finishing up my speedy packing in less than 10 minutes I had to run to the room to hand them over , Strategic location
314180,HCC St Moritz, The breakfast What I failed to understand was why it took 25 minutes to serve the omelet I was the second guest to place the order Imagine if the whole group 44 in all started coming in Breakfast was ok bacon and chorizos were always not enough Even for 9 guests we were the earliest , The location 
314181,HCC St Moritz,No Negative, It was a lovely hotel in a good area The staff were very friendly and helpful Probably more of a business type hotel but suited us for our short stay 
314182,HCC St Moritz, Soundproofing was unexpectedly bad I m not the sensitive type and it didn t bother me that mutch but if you don t like hearing what s going on in the next room this is might be a problem , Clean and relatively newly renovated Room cleaned daily as you would expect of a Hotell of this standard 
314183,HCC St Moritz, Hotel Rooms are too dark with interior decor dark brown dark brown carpet draperies etc Bathroom air circulation is so bad that after shower it fogs because there s no ventilation air Room needs more lighting , Location location location
314184,HCC St Moritz, Should have advertised a cooked breakfast and more variety and it was far too expensive This have been incorporated with the accommodation cost , Location 
314185,HCC St Moritz, Would struggle to improve this hotel A lovely place to stay , The location of the hotel is excellent Our room was very pleasant and comfortable on the top floor at the front of building but there was no traffic noise very quiet and airy 
314186,HCC St Moritz, The coffee could have been stronger but that is just my personal preference , The cheeses omelettes breakfast meats service and mostly the room Spacious lovely bathroom Service and front desk were exceptional 
314187,HCC St Moritz, Services were not so great Often they did not have Euros to exchange They did not offer great advice on ways to get around the city nor suggestions on where to eat , Rooms were well maintained and cleaning service was impeccable 
314188,HCC St Moritz, It s such a old hotel everything stinks the carpet furniture curtins No aircondtion No coffee machine in the room or not even a kittel for hot water I had to call the resturant everytime for some hot water The staff atutid just rewind my hole day And it wasn t a cheap , The location
314189,HCC St Moritz,No Negative, There was no protection on the sides of baby bed When I told it to the hotel employess they took immediate action and bought a protection pillow for the bed That was an important service for me 
314190,HCC St Moritz, Bumpy elevator no tea coffee facility in room but they provide hot water in thermos and cup saucer when requested , Friendly staff clean room comfortable bed quiet neighborhood near restaurants groceries shops tourist spots etc good location 
314191,HCC St Moritz, Not much ambiance not many other guests around There was no choice of a lighter less expensive breakfast , Spaciousness and quietness in rooms Reception staff were very well trained and efficient 
314192,HCC St Moritz,No Negative, Location was excellent because it was possible to walk to most places to see The hotel wasa also conveniently located to restaurants buses and street cafes The staff were very helpful in making suggestions 
314193,HCC St Moritz, The service in the bar was not friendly or welcoming , The staff at the reception desk were excellent Very accommodating and helpful Avoid the bar they are not friendly The room was clean and comfortable 
314194,HCC St Moritz, Shower did not have good water flow Room very small no space for second suitcase and carry on bag carpet dirty Inconvenient having to carry key for the safe Not good set up at breakfast no good flow many people congregating in the corner waiting in line to get bread and use toaster A big probem when we are on a tour and have to be ready at a certain time Did not like bumpy elevator, Great Location Comfortable bed
314195,HCC St Moritz, There is very little one could complain about The only small niggles where no soap dish in the bathroom lifts had a small 1 inch offset from the floor which I noticed with our pram each time The pricing was a bit expensive and the laundry service pricing was prohibitively expensive , We really liked the staff in particular Tamara was lovely and very helpful with any requirements we had with our small 11 month old son 
314196,HCC St Moritz, breakfast only very limited choice of food bed matress very hard maybe old restaurant closed for all of August, very close to Pl Catalunya quiet street
314197,HCC St Moritz, The only negative thing I have to say about this hotel in the size of the beds I had a room with 2 twin beds cause my co worker and I were sharing the room I am a bit of a chubby man so a twin bed is not a good thing for me and my worker is a tall guy therefore not a good thing for him either And the bed was really not comfortable That is the only negative thing I have to say about this place , From day one the entire staff made me feel welcome Got greater every single time I stepped into the lobby Close walking distance from all the places I wanted to visit and the underground 
314198,HCC St Moritz, No Tea Coffee making facity in the room , Staff are fantastic nothing is too much of a problem very knowledgeable on the locality and local attractions
314199,HCC St Moritz, Check in staff could be friendlier she was really cold and unwelcoming the younger female receptionist We had to share only 1 little soap between the 3 of us for the whole stay the amenities were not replaced at all The pillows were the worst ive eve seen ridicilously thin and uncomfortable , Location 
314200,HCC St Moritz, Although the room was nicely designed and had a nice feel to it we only had a window overlooking the interior courtyard which made the room extremely dark with no natural sunlight , We arrived very early in the morning and the room was already available for early check in Staff were always very friendly and helpful The hotel was very quiet yet the location was excellent Loads of shops restaurants and attractions in walking distance A very good hotel overall will look to stay in it another time
