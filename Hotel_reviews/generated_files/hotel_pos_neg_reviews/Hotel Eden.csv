35372,Hotel Eden, Rooms are very small Cold breakfast is so little and unappealing for kids Quite expensive for what they offer Gym is a small room with 3 equipments only, The location Staff are great Nearby shops 
35373,Hotel Eden, The iron provided had something burned on it and it in turn burned my clothing No ironing board was provided although in fairness I did not ask for one assuming one would be in the room so I had to use a small table instead Insufficient toiletries were provided when I checked in and when they ran out I discovered that the phone did not work so I could not call down to reception and ask for more A check out one hour later than normal would have cost me EUR 50 which is an absurd amount of money for one hour When I checked out and asked if I could get a cup of coffee while I waited for my taxi I was told it would cost me EUR 4 which was double the price of a coffee at any of the neighboring cafes For the price I had expected better ,No Positive
35374,Hotel Eden, Hotel room was not cleaned properly on occasion trash bins not emptied Location a bit far from centre 15 min metro ride to Concord but manageable for most, Great little neighborhood with a Carrefour Express and Starbucks nearby Metro within walking distance and hotel was in a quiet location Rooms were modern
35375,Hotel Eden, There should be free breakfast Breakfast can have more items rather than providing same items , People were friendly and warm welcoming They arrange the Airport taxi from the hotel Best place to stay Did not have any issues 
35376,Hotel Eden, Wifi was fast when it worked It had the tendency to hang after midnight so I had to ask the night clerk to reset the router each time to get it working again For business travellers I guess an ironing board and iron would have been nice to have though didn t miss it myself , I guess I was lucky as they gave me a Junior Suite for the standard room price The suite was absolutely fine and included a proper size safe mini fridge and adequate bathroom with a heavenly shower Hotel seemed recently refurbished and looked modern and very tastefully designed Hotel is located in a quiet area close to Porte de Versailles Expo center with a 2 stop connection from the nearby metro stop Vaugirard 
35377,Hotel Eden,No Negative, The staff at hotel Eden were incredibly accommodating and friendly which is not always a given in Paris and is a reason to return to Hotel Eden The room was clean modern comfortable and had everything we needed The decor is really welcoming and the hotel has a great relaxed atmosphere I would highly recommend it and will be staying here again on my next trip 
35378,Hotel Eden, Rooms were not cleaned well floor tiles in room completely worn out and unappealing wifi connection not so good, Staff kind and attentive new bathrooms
35379,Hotel Eden, Our room was not spacious and the bath too Upper floors are better because you can hear the cars sound in lower floors , First i want to thank the staffs who were so helpfull specially mrs teymouri The hotel location is good the neighborhood is silent and it is close to metro bus station and hypermarket carrefour You can see eiphel tower from the street but distance for walking is a little far youcan use metro or bus for going to city attractions 
35380,Hotel Eden, I really have nothing negative to say about the hotel other than there was no tea coffee facilities in the bedroom and nothing hot for breakfast but I m being picky , We stayed in the hotel as part of our euro 2016 experience with Northern Ireland and had an excellent stay Our room was modern and cosy with everything that you need The staff were very helpful and I have no complaints at all A very enjoyable stay 
35381,Hotel Eden, Had requested an iron and board prior to arrival using the survey they send out but had to ask again at reception and carry it to the room ourselves , Walked round the corner and could see the Eiffel Tower 
35382,Hotel Eden, WiFi did not work unfortunately I eventually gave up They did try and make us pay twice we paid on arrival but this was cleared up fine and was a mistake only , Staff especially the lady on the front desk were friendly and we were able to check in early They gave us twin beds as asked Rooms were comfy and clean and very quiet Right near a metro and walkable to the champs de Mars and Eiffel tower We were visiting a football match at the Parc des Princes so it was a great location for that 
35383,Hotel Eden, The room was very small and the bed took up most of the room There was hardly any room even for the bags I would have reconsidered had I known it was that small , The location was convenient for getting around Paris and was selected for it s proximity to the Eiffel Tower Staff were very friendly and helpful
35384,Hotel Eden, The Breakfast there wasn t enough selection according to the value of the money Actually I was expecting some hot items on the breakfast menu I was bit disappointed , I liked the location of the room we was in The bed was really comfortable overall very nice place to stay 
35385,Hotel Eden, Too small We had a triple room but it was just enough space for the beds Very tight but ok for two nights , Perfect location Near the center and the metro 
35386,Hotel Eden, True to Paris hotels a small room But still great value for the money , Comfortable bed location was wonderful and quiet but still close to everything 20 min walk to Eiffel tower and the staff was a delight 
35387,Hotel Eden, Not much variety in breakfast options , Comfortable especially considering the fact that in Paris rooms are small The hotel is situated close to the train station 
35388,Hotel Eden, Wish we didn t have to sign in to wifi every time we returned to the hotel , The staff went above and beyond to make my family feel comfortable traveling with a young child 8 months old 
35389,Hotel Eden, A very minor improvement would be not to have the wifi set up that I would have to log in every time I want to use it , The staff was incredibly helpful and welcoming They did everything they could to make us comfortable traveling with our 7 month old 
35390,Hotel Eden, Some sort of hot breakfast would have been a nice option , The room was very quite and the hotel is in a good location very close to a metro stop and shops 
35391,Hotel Eden, To me the breakfast didn t seem worth 12 euros so I didn t buy it , Very minimalistic but super comfortable and perfect for my purpose Not in the center of Paris but 30 seconds away from the metro Very easy Loved it 
35392,Hotel Eden,No Negative, The location and rooms were excellent Staff very helpful Only 20 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower which can be seen from the street corner Secure parking EUR 36 day and Metro both very close by 2 3 min walk Good local restaurants 
35393,Hotel Eden, Too much dust in the room I don t think the cleaner takes her his job really seriously Sometimes after room service we missed our bath towels toilet paper and so on I meant those are very basic at least for room service They should fire the cleaner , One of the reception staff Maria is very friendly and helpful during our four days stay I really appreciate her help and kindness She really makes our stay in Paris The location is great 2min walk from the closest metro station and a supermarket closed to hotel 
35394,Hotel Eden, Wi Fi connection was quite poor as we live on the 6th floor for us it was ok but if You travel for business it will make some trouble , Good staff convenient metro line if You plan to see a lot in city or go to Versailles
