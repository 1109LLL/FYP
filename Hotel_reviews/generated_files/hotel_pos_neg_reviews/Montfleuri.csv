103488,Montfleuri, I did not like that the room has separate toilet and separate shower far from each other rude staff not welcoming at all the breakfast does not include so many choices no omelet , the size of the room was pretty good for a family comfy bed
103489,Montfleuri,No Negative, The staff were very helpful when I was unwell We were able to check in early after a horrid flight and they organised a Doctor to my hotel room on a Sunday Nothing was a hassle 
103490,Montfleuri, The Hotel forgot to book our taxi even though we had informed them the previous day This was avoidable , The location The rooms were spacious and comfortable Even though the property is in a very busy area the hotel had ensured noise insulation so we weren t disturbed by the traffic outside 
103491,Montfleuri, Actually no , Very good location to stay and hang around Morning run triumphal arch Eiffel Seine Louvre Champs Elysees Perfect Also very kind service here Will be first choice if back O O
103492,Montfleuri, The bathroom door cannot be locked and I do hope that I can enjoy some privacy when I was taking the bath , The position is awesome no matter after taking the bus to the airport or taking the metro The service is very good We leave our luggage in the reception before check in time and when we come back and get our key they have already taken our luggage to our room 
103493,Montfleuri, I could have used a shoehorn in the room but I recognize I am in the minority with this preference , Having stayed in a number of Parisian hotels I knew what to expect more or less however Hotel Montfleuri s rooms are dazzlingly clean Nearly all hotels fall short with their cleaning for me so this really stood out I appreciated the little nougat on the pillow and the room was cleverly laid out to make the most of the space The ability to tailor the lighting in the room was excellent too We arrived very early and were unable to get into our room totally understandable so when we did return to the hotel that evening staff had placed our cases in our room and we could go straight up It isn t a big thing but it s one less bit of bother after a long day that was much appreciated 
103494,Montfleuri, Can t think of anything , The staff were very friendly They responded promptly to queries I had emailed beforehand We were travelling with my parents who both have restricted mobility The staff helped with our requests immediately and always with a smile We also had a lovely view of the city from our room 
103495,Montfleuri, The cleaning staff didn t change our mugs glasses in our room for 3 days At the end we gave an extra 5 euros in tips which made them give us a new mug Also the breakfast for 17 euros was horrible You bearly got any food and they only had two small tables with some bread croissants ham cheese and some fresh juice Really not worth it horrible breakfast with an expensive price , Great location right next to the metro station which took us everywhere and also nice central location 
103496,Montfleuri, The toilet room is on its own separate from the bathroom , The view is great from the Deluxe rooms that are situated at the front of the property the double French window opens into a balcony 
103497,Montfleuri, The hotel looks a little bit old and needs renovation they still use the regular key when I wanted to use the safe I had to go down to the reception to collect another big key which I have to keep with me during my whole trip The wifi is free but the signal could be better, The location is great the stuff is very helpful The room size is acceptable for us as a family with 2 little hids
103498,Montfleuri, room is too small for three persons a bit of waiting for breakfast when too many guests come at the same time check in at 2pm and chek out at 12 noon are not negotiable apparently , great breakfast knowledgeable and helpful staff
103499,Montfleuri, Breakfast was a little bit overpriced for 17 00 , Very comfy room friendly staff and excellent location Near and close to most popular restaurants and a few steps from the Arc de Trioumphe Also very close to the very elegant and charm street Champs Elysees excellent for shopping and safe area Rooms are sound proof Breakfast is excellent Highly recoomended 
103500,Montfleuri, The WiFi was generally slow and worked intermittently , The hotel is very central and easy to reach from the airport by the Direct 2 bus It is a short distance from a metro station The room is clean and the staff helpful 
103501,Montfleuri, In some places you can notice the hotel s age There are better four star hotels in Paris but not with the same price , Location is perfect deluxe double is big enough for Paris and has nice street view Despite the hotel is a bit old the management makes a lot of effort to keep it clean and fresh 
103502,Montfleuri, Problem with the heating it was way too warm in the room event if we stopped the room heating Tried to open the window to get some fresh air but due to the situation in avenue de la grande armee very very noisy was impossible to keep it open Also the heating was super noisy during the night ,No Positive
103503,Montfleuri, The room was tiny maybe 3m X 3m at most Barely enough room for us to walk around , The location was terrific Walking distance to almost everything and easy access to the metro system 
103504,Montfleuri, Staff are not friendly at all and not supportive i asked for Brush teeth even they didnot be able to bring it my room and in the Second day i went down to bring it room is so so small and at all not same as Photo prices is so high just because of Location in Generla it was bad experience there ,No Positive
103505,Montfleuri, Best to tell people to disembarking at Argentine much closer to hotel, Staff were very friendly Room was smaller than anticipated but very comfortable
103506,Montfleuri, The location on a busy road means that the rooms are noisy if the double glazed windows are opened to overcome the over effective heating , Central convenient location The reception staff were particularly helpful 
103507,Montfleuri, The only negative point was the shower basin which was blocked by the water maybe on my chance Other than that all other things were quite fine Couple of mins to Arc de Triumph by walking and around Hotel is quiet cosy sufficiently comfortable and clean for single or couples I preferred having 2 croissants and a coffee like many french do at 3 50 on the road instead of getting breakfast of 17 at the hotel ,No Positive
103508,Montfleuri, Not a 4 star standard lobby breakfast room or overall experience Breakfast options very limited Some staff quite casual in dress , Great location Woman on desk spoke fluent English 
103509,Montfleuri, The cleaning staff accidentally threw away my tooth brush I asked the front desk for a new one and was told there wasn t one and also no information about where I could get one in the area She later placed one by my door in the morning with an apology note saying sorry she could not find it before Overall quite well handed but was not so great to not be able to brush my teeth that night , Really good location 
103510,Montfleuri,No Negative, Had a nice room with view on l Arc de Triomphe Top location all main metrolines are nearby Breakfast consisted of good quality products and fresh juices Friendly and helpfull staff Extra for a low price you can rent a small wifi box You put it in your handbag and you have wifi all over the city wherever you go 
103511,Montfleuri,No Negative, Cozy place in a great location Friendly staff made our stay even better they were always available and of great help The location is next to a metro station and has a nice view of the Arc 
103512,Montfleuri, breakfast menu is good but need little improvement , kind Staff Cleanness comfort near most important POI in Paris metro access free Wi Fi Secure
103513,Montfleuri, Breakfast is ok for an European but really poor for an Asian or Middle East guests I would appreciated to find in a room a toothpaste and toothbrush instead went to buy in a supermarket, Location is great rooms are small but Confortable and the price is very good for the location
103514,Montfleuri, Doesn t look quite like the photos Breakfast very small probably not worth the money better going to a cafe elsewhere , Bed was really comfy location was good 
103515,Montfleuri, The breakfast was nasty the bacon is not cooked And food is cold The room needed new wallpaper and and the bathroom door looked on the bottom was broken off The balcony view was horrible cigarettes butts every where and you have to squeeze threw the door and I weigh 120lbs The staff was rude especially in the morning Especially the male and the female with longer hair , The hotel is okay but not worth the money it s not a good location everything is over 3 4 miles Had to catch a cab or Uber The breakfast lady is nice and the ladies at night with short hair are nice
103516,Montfleuri, Cannot be called a Hotel and spa when all you have is a small sauna Thats not correct advertising Rooms were not properly cleaned Dirt was evident under the bed , Location
103517,Montfleuri, Breakfast room should be extended Personnel should be more attentive, The bed was very comfortable bathroom small but with new high standard armatures Plenty of coat hangers Modern room Ony a few minutes to the Arc de Triomphe nice restaurants nearby 
103518,Montfleuri, Internet was weak Room service super bad they left our dirty glass more than one day as it is the worst thing here someone room service staff stole our Christmas gifts we bought it to the kids back home and the management did nothing just in a cold word said we cannot do anything I am traveling to Paris several times a year and this hotel is the worst ever also the breakfast was so poor and we have to clean our class since no one is there all the time to serve you , Honestly nothing except the location 
103519,Montfleuri, Noise from traffic on avenue but that s expected with location Price relatively high for boutique hotel which is a little dated Curtain hanging off rail , Location right beside Arc 
103520,Montfleuri, Breakfast was poor No smoking scrambled egg and one sausage left Bread was dry Not a lot of choice Room was too hot even with air conditioning Couldn t lower the temperature , We liked the location and freshly squeezed orange juice 
103521,Montfleuri, Uncomfortable pillows Shabby wallpaper which was very odd compared to overall cleanness and all nice details typical for a 4star hotel, Excellent staff Very helpful and friendly clean and spacious bathroom Good breakfast Hotel is within less than a minute walk to metro stations
103522,Montfleuri, The spa was just a sauna would have been nice to have had the option for massages or treatment No tonic in bar , Nice pastries for breakfast cosy feel to the hotel The location really was great for the Arc de Triumphe and Champs Elys es walking distance 
103523,Montfleuri, they could have done better with the breakfast variety, location was perfect staff at the hotel were perfect especially the lady working at night if I am not mistaken her name is Anna she was more than helpful
103524,Montfleuri, I had a deluxe room where I should have a view The arc de triomphe wasn t so visible from my room I blame the trees maybe in winter it will be better , I loved the room so cozy clean felt like home 
103525,Montfleuri, Nothing I didn t like but was very expensive ohh and exchange rate wasn t great, The rooms clean spacious Bed comfy Good shower Location great
103526,Montfleuri, The breakfast was a bit to expensive compared to the quality of the food and the service We had to wait about ten minutes every morning to get a clean table a plate cup and knife and fork even though there were only 5 6 other guests eating at that time Likewise it would take a while for re filling of scramble eggs juice etc , We were upgraded to a bigger room free of charge The room was clean cozy and very large for 3 people The staff members were so friendly and happy to help with anything from how to get to different locations around the city to restaurant recommendations Not to forget that the location of the hotel couldn t be much better 
103527,Montfleuri, a room with only a toilet in it the washing room was in another room breakfast was exactly like a three star hotel however the price was double, great location and clean
103528,Montfleuri, The night I slept there there was a huge family in the two neighboring rooms It seemed as if they were travelling from another country since their kids didn t go to bed before like 3 am and kept opening and slamming the doors and screaming in the corridors Very annoying The windows were also fidgety with single glazing so beware in the winter , The location is good next to a metro station the rooms are nice and clean comfortable bed you have access to a private sauna 
103529,Montfleuri,No Negative, Great hotel just down from the Arc de Triomphe so very convenient location for getting to the Champs Elysees and the metro for exploring further a field Good value for money for location and this being Paris 
103530,Montfleuri, Breakfast could be improved, Brilliant staff especially the person working evenings Helped me with information for the city and ordered food for us as i dont speak French 
103531,Montfleuri, Doors are too close so when entering room it may disturb other guests No fresh vegetables in breakfast menu same all days , excellent service and ready to help stuff
103532,Montfleuri, Breakfast option was limited but it was okay not bad prefer if there is someone carrying the bags they offered to help me but i said no as the receptionist was the one who will carry my bags if i said yes and he was busy doing his job There was a bad smell in the hall ways , Amazing reception and nice staff as they were so helpful and so nice to guest always smiling and welling to help i felt at home staying at this hotel as the staff were so kind the location is perfect quit and cozy the metro was right in front of the hotel there was a supermarket near by i liked that they offer triple room as we were three and the room size was a bit small but better that other Persian hotels Arc de Triomphe was near the hotel which is perfect totally recommend staying at this hotel i asked for an airport shuttle and the hotel contacted a taxi and managed the delivery 
103533,Montfleuri, The mattress was very bad some part broken very uncomfortable The Cleaning was not so good left dirty mugs from day before , The Location was excellent for the access to the City The neighborhood has several good choices for the nightlife 
103534,Montfleuri, Bed sheets covers are not too comfortable But I ve seen this in other hotels as well Not bad just not what I expected , Location Breakfast Staff Bathrooms
103535,Montfleuri, the rooms were lovely but slightley small, our room was very clean any thing we looked for we got eg shampoo and body washes ect plenty of tea and coffie supplied rooms cleaned every day plus plenty of towles as well 
103536,Montfleuri, The arrival experience was disappointing One was immediately struck by the decor which needed updating The rugs and carpets were old and dirty The reception desk was chipped and old fashioned The lighting was poor , Good location with very friendly helpful staff Breakfast was satisfactory if a little limited Bathrooms were nice and the shower was powerful Minibar was good value 
103537,Montfleuri, Breakfast not up to standard and the restaurant very small not sufficient for all the guest in the hotel In fact if you come at specific time you may not find a table , Excellent location
103538,Montfleuri, I had to ask for English breakfast tea every day x 6 as they only put out herbal, It was all great the room was great the staff were great even arranged so we could have breakfast early due to early start on our excursions x2
103539,Montfleuri, There wasn t enough mirrors in the room, Very comfortable bed Good deal for family with breakfast included 10 15 minutes walk to Arc de triumph and Avenue des Champs lys es
103540,Montfleuri,No Negative, The staff was friendly and the location of the hotel is fantastic The hotel is only couple of blocks from key landmarks The room was small but comfortable The hotel price was very reasonable 
103541,Montfleuri, Price could be high in hot season, Room amenities are very good Perfect location Close to metro direct bus to airports and few minutes work from avenue des Champs lys es Personal is very friendly Always stay in this hotel when in Paris
103542,Montfleuri, Other than Anna I barely saw a smile from all hotel staff The hotel was a bit old The breakfast wasn t the best The hotel is a bit aged, The Best hotel staff in Paris is the night shift lady Anna she is very active helpful polite and very good at what she do The Location of the hotel is very good
103543,Montfleuri, Other than Anna I barely saw a smile from all hotel staff The hotel was a bit old The breakfast wasn t the best, The Best hotel staff in Paris is the night shift lady Anna she is very active helpful polite and very good at what she do Location is very good
103544,Montfleuri, Front desk staff was distant and mater of fact not welcoming Had drinks with a colleague we were both staying at the hotel in the breakfast room bar after returning from dinner and this apparently doesn t happen often as the night clerk had no idea what to do , Room was small but that is not unusual for Paris but very well appointed and the bathroom was large and all were very clean 
103545,Montfleuri, Breakfast too expensive for us , Excellent location Friendly staff My room was well equipped and quiet if a little small The hotel are currently able to provide secure storage for bicycles in a next door building This might change so worth checking them before booking They do respond to emails 
103546,Montfleuri,No Negative, Perfect location Close to all places of interest Easy achievable by public transport from airports and railway stations Friendly responsive persona l
103547,Montfleuri, I stayed for one day but they charged for 2 nights in spite of repeated requests Staffs in the reception were hostile Kindly requesting you to remove that hotel from your list , Nothing
103548,Montfleuri,No Negative, Very friendly staff right from the outset very accommodating of our needs even on our final day we had a few extra hours left after checkout they kept our bags for safekeeping whilst we enjoyed the sights of the city The closest metro station is Argentine use the underpass instead of crossing the road Very central location but without the busyness of the Champ De Elysees very quiet and comfortable Breakfast was reasonably good would definitely recommend
103549,Montfleuri, I don t know how or where to start I could not sleep at all because when I wanted to sleep at early morning I put don t disturb sign and it like It says the opposite The door was knocked persistently for about six times Every time I told them to please delay the room service until late noon Finally the receptionist called the room and told me that the cleaning lady IS GOING HOME around 4 pm and if you want anything as simple as clean towel you get it now or never The walls of the room are PAPER THIN you can hear everthing that s why is was impossible to sleep especially when they cleaned the room next to me It was like sleeping in busy kitchen Room service was terrible to give example I asked for large bottle of water And the guy told me I am here alone you should get it from downstairs and I can t send it to the room I don t understand how rating of booking com fooled me It ruined the whole experience Bathroom shower suck Small room and small bathroom There was no view at all in my room not even street , Honstly nothing was good about it The location may be good but you still need to cross 3 roads to get to anything and difficult to see it from distance since the hotel is small and unknown to any taxi driver You can still give the exact address to reach it easly 
103550,Montfleuri, Less varieties of breakfast compares with other 4 star hotel and fruits there are not fresh , The location is great near the triumphal arch just 5 minutes by walk so as to the RER A Charles de Gualle toile and walk to M1 Argentine just 1 minute And the service and staff there is very good Room is clean quiet but very small 
103551,Montfleuri, Neighbours smoked in a bathroom I felt cigarettes smoke in my room early in the morning Annouying , Polite and helpfull staff Quiet room with a nice soft design Comfortable bed Very usefull door to bathroom Great to have a kettle in a room Bus stop to airport 5 minutes walk 
103552,Montfleuri, If you re looking for a hotel in which you d bump into people make friends and hang out this is not the place for you The bar area downstairs is small and practically deserted most of the time , The location is 30 seconds away from a metro station Argentine Which is perfect and takes you to most of the important touristic spots in minutes while still being in a relatively quiet part of the city Also you wake up with a view of Arc de Triomphe Close by you ll find some nice high end shopping spots as well as the Champs Elysee which is way too crowded and infested with global chains Gap and the like The hotel itself has a slight vintage feel and is very quiet and serene I hardly saw any people at all apart from a couple of friendly receptionists 
103553,Montfleuri, Honestly I cannot think of anything that was not o k , Very good breakfast with all you need Location is very good 5 minutes from the Arc de Triomphe with 2 main metro lines at hand good resto s nearby Very quit rooms 
103554,Montfleuri, The breakfast was a little bit poor but it was fear The boiled egg were cold But it is because the small space of the buffet However they makes you feel that they are trying to do everything , The hotel always smells nice The stuff always smiling and willing to help all the time The lady at the reception she is helpful and she has answers for everything A supermarket is a cross the hotel which have everything Metro Station Argentina is few minutes from the hotel and a mall is located 8 minutes walking from the hotel which have access to RER trains 
103555,Montfleuri, I only brought my credit card to Paris and I also run out of my cash when I lived in the hotel I wanna cash out to take a taxi however the staff can t help me , Close to the metro station and all the attractive places It s worth its price 
103556,Montfleuri, Fitness room unavailable due to renovation 19 for a breakfast is highly overcharged, Good location very close to the Arc de triomphe and Argentine metro station quick access to la D fense 
103557,Montfleuri, The bar was closed when we got back from the France v England rugby match , We couldn t believe how reasonably priced the room was The location was excellent right on the Champs Elysees A car park is available in an adjacent road and the Metro a very short walk away The room was very well equipped we re not used to tea coffee making equipment in continental hotels clean and comfortable Ifwe were staying more than 1 night a room with a view would have been preferable 
103558,Montfleuri, Overlooked tiny room even though we stayed for 4 nights and booked early enough Not good at replenishing toiletries including a replaced towel that wasn t folded but hanging on the hook which makes one wonder if it is clean , Location helpful staff 
103559,Montfleuri, Breakfast is too expensive but rate of the room compensates , Spacious room and bathroom with thoughtful details as a shaving kit and vanity set Small fitness room with sauna available without extra charge Hotel appears somewhat dated but a renovation seems ongoing
103560,Montfleuri, Cost of breakfast was extortionate we weren t given a kettle until our last day our bedroom door would not close properly without giving it a hefty pull and we found our door open on two occasions after the cleaners had been in We did inform the reception staff, Comfortable beds very well maintained rooms cleaned to a very standard Staff were incredibly helpful and informative an example of what reception staff should be like in every hotel The metro was just a couple of minutes walk away
103561,Montfleuri, No real complaints , Funky little place just down the street from L arc de triomphe The staff was very accommodating and the room was quite large The room service was very god and the breakfast excellent 
103562,Montfleuri, The shower cabin is too small almost impossible in order to bend and wash the lower legs and feet , Location is excellent staff amazing and service very pleasant 
103563,Montfleuri, Was a bit beat up and showing it s age Carpet was threadbare in places corners on the walls dented and scratched The room was extremely cold upon arrival and the thermostat was not working The valet came up and fiddled with the controller for a few moments and finally let me know he had to make some adjustments downstairs and I should turn the thermostat back on after 15 minutes or so After 30 minutes the heat still was not on but eventually came on sometime during the night , Central location quiet even though facing the street Bed was comfortable and bathroom good sized Plenty of closet space for those staying longer and a small desk are for those needing to do a little work 
103564,Montfleuri,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly and helpful The hotel is in a great location with all the attractions nearby It also had metro access nearby which was a 5 minute walk The locals were all really nice
