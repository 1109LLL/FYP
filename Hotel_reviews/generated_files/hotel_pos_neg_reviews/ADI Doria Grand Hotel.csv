493434,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Bathrooms are a bit tired , Great location a short walk from Milan Central Station Very quiet location Rooms are very nice a bit old fashioned in decor Good facilities and excellent buffet breakfast Good value we have stayed there 3 times this summer
493435,ADI Doria Grand Hotel,No Negative, This hotel is very close to the main Milan train terminal It was just a few blocks from the hotel which made travel easy The subway was also within a few blocks and getting around Milan was fun efficient and convenient With short safe walks we could find several restaurants 
493436,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Breakfast staff pleasant but I was wanting a cup of cappuccino and after try s ngbto get their attention I gave up and bought a cup at the local cafe They were busy cleaning up after patrons and made sure the large table of business men had their cappuccino espresso not once even checking on me a lone traveler Usually someone comes over and asks if I would like something or inquires if all is ok I was never even acknowledged, Location was convenient to public transportation Hotel was nicely decorated and very clean and comfortable
493437,ADI Doria Grand Hotel,No Negative, the cleaning maids did a very poor job of cleaning the room all they did was make the bed We used the glasses for drinking and after two days they were still not washed They did not vacuum the floors etc
493438,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, We were very happy with everything , Service of breakfast staff and desk staff was excellent Breakfast was delicious with plenty of variety of foods to suit a range of tastes and needs Coffee was great Beds were very comfortable and the room very spacious clean and well appointed The reception sent very quick email replies when I was booking and again just prior to arrival They are open 24 hours so it suited us as we had a flight late in the evening Pleasant decor in the dining area and on each floor level 
493439,ADI Doria Grand Hotel,No Negative, The room was comfortable and the location was just great Just few minutes to the main station by walk and a metro line is right next to the hotel I prefer ea2lking hence i walked to all the attractions and shopping areas All staffs were great and a special mention to Charles from the reception 
493440,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Hotle doesn t have swimming pool , Ms Yulia at the reception is amazing the hotel is nice but the main reason which I came back to the hotel was Ms Yulia she is so good in her job I traveling all of the glob I have never seen like her she s very helpful and there is a guy at the reception unfortunately I forgot his name he s so helpful Thanks for your hospitality
493441,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Old hotel it has a certain style but the room lacks of plugs Sometimes issue with booking where room can be canceled without reason happened to my colleague Price ok for businees travel but I would consider another hotel for leisure , Bed was very confortable Breakfast was good Well located for the office
493442,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, We have stayed at 3rd floor internet is in very bad condition , Room is comfortable furniture is classy bed is comfortable It is 10 min walk from Milano centrale station also 5 min walk to Metro and Buenos Aires street Bathroom is satisfying 
493443,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, We reserved adjacent rooms but when the faucet broke in ours kids roomthey first tried to move them to a separate floor when I explained we had adjacent rooms they could only move them down the hall However I wasn t comfortable with that so they had to come to our room to use the restroom , The location was perfect to metro and train station
493444,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Far from sightseeing locations Also I don t like carpeting in hotels I find it very unsanitary especially in Europe where people smoke in the rooms eventhoug they re not supposed to , Beautiful hotel Descent size rooms Very clean Great staff 
493445,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, The traffic will give no quarter They are trying to kill each other and you ll just be collateral damage Be very careful outside this hotel as their are two lanes in each direction one for local traffic and one for through traffic I m not convinced even the locals know how it works Might reasonably expect a pool given it s up to 40 C in the summer here but built many years before such things were the norm , Through attentive staff Within easy walking distance of the Central Station with it s attendant plethora of eating houses Stamps and post boxes nearby or staff will arrange for you Tenth floor of 11 was high enough to have a City view and the Alps in the far distance also no traffic noise Though on a main route seemed to carry fairly light amount of traffic Excellent air con in room quiet and accurate Many many pillows A supermarket right opposite for almost everything you ll need 
493446,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Wifi was very slow in room Fact you could not use credit card in restaurant all attatched to room , Location very close to metro and train station restaurants Staff helpful breakfast very nice Check in and out easy

493450,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Everything was very nice , It was a pleasure to stay one night in this well appointed hotel that was within walking distance of the train station The staff was attentive and accommodating offering a very good restaurant recommendation Osteria Mamma Rosa and even weighing our suitcases for us which relieved me of the worry of overweight luggage on our return home flight We were offered a box breakfast if we would be leaving too early in the morning to be able eat in the dining room Toiletries provided large bathroom and bedroom king size bed minibar TV etc 
493451,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Staff very friendly and helpful , Second visit staff helpful breakfast room crowded scramble but in all nice hotel Uses Uber to get to castle and other places of interest
493452,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, The security at the desk was a bit lax They didn t ask us our name when we asked for the key in fact I asked for the wrong key and could have entered any room so I wouldn t leave anything valuable in the room or use a safe box The refridgerator didn t seem to be working , The room and bathroom were spacious and the breakfast room was pleasant Quick walk to the station but in a nice neighborhood Located within 5 min of two subway lines Staff efficient and friendly
493453,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, We were happy with the hotel and I can t think of any improvement , The location is excellent with the Metro Central Station and Trams within a few minutes walk from the hotel We were upgraded to stay in a suite on the 9th floor which was an absolute treat and the front desk staff were very helpful Milan was our last port of call having driven around various cities and we both wished we could have stayed at this hotel for longer Thank you we will definitely stay at this hotel again

493464,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, There sometimes was a grinch at the front desk , The neighbourhood is just average but the distance walkable from the main train station is an important plus Many other places can also be reached on foot The metro is user friendly 
493465,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Room cleaning was very poor only linen and towels are changed the floor wasn t even swept dirt from outdoor was left and therefore spread around the room Staff was not friendly at all Not even looked at you whole talking , Location is close to Milano Centrale railway station which is convenient for travel but therefore not calm due to many migrants wandering around Breakfast is sufficient Due to early leaving in the morning we ordered two lunch boxes which were provided 
493466,ADI Doria Grand Hotel, Wifi is almost only under the router doesn t work in the room Young people seating on corridor s fllor to get connected in 4 stars hotel is just a joke Leak in a bathroom never go there , Location
