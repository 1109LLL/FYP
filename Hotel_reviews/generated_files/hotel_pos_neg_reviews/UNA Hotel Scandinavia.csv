477738,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, Fairly priced so that s why we can t criticize what this hotel had to offer , Close to Expo 10 min walk Nicely furnished room bathroom a bit small for larger people but it was fine for us and had all the necessary amenities Good breakfast and last but not least very friendly staff Overall a nice hotel for business travelers 
477739,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, Room nice but the carpet could be changed already looked like dirty Bathroom nice but really really small and badly illuminated , I liked the place personal was very kind As a plus was the terrace where you can have a breakfast 
477740,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, Nothing property was exactly I supposed in your communication , location comfortable room inside parking in front of public transport room in the hight floor as I required good breakfast with gentle staff I ll come again 
477741,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, Internet connection was a bit sluggish can be upgraded for a fee the safe in the room is tiny and could barely hold our passports definitely not going to fit a laptop , the breakfast was great everyday and the market in Fauche street lovely Clean and charming hotel with highly friendly staff we had a great 3 night stay there s a huge supermarket across the street so you can get everything local at reasonable prices and it has a lovely cafe restaurant We had a GREAT time 
477742,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, The location of this hotel isn t great it s a trek to get to the centre of Milan and is a little too far out There is a market outside the hotel on a Saturday which leaves so much mess that they re cleaning into the night to get rid of all the rubbish and food on the floor The food available on the a la carte menu at the hotel was very limited , The hotel was beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
477743,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, Avoid staying Friday night Saturday morning if you don t want to be woken up by nearby open market however excellent fresh food and great deals , Excellent location close to newly opened metro station Very comfortable and clean And excellent value for money 
477744,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, Noisy room A woman next door or somewhere near kept us awake by whimpering for an hour which is of course not her fault but the poor soundproofing Once that was done the noise from the streets which continued for a long time till the morning came through very badly , The room was clean and the service as you would expect The market took over the street in front of the hotel which was nice 
477745,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, It was my 3d time in this hotel but unfortunatelly the staff do not know how to say thanks to the client who choose their hotel again in Milano the choice of the hotel is huge I booked the room with King size bed When I made check in and entered in the room I found out bad suprises First of all instead of King size bed it was Queen size French bed which is much less in size Queen size bed usually counts as a single bed As the result my husband and I did not sleep well all the night because we were disturbing each other everytime we were moving By the standards of this hotel chain the second towel is situated in the wardrobe and it was not in the bathroom there was only 1 shampoo and other things for 1 person Thanks to the staff at the reception and facchino i received everything after 1 call Another suprise was waiting for me when I entered in the bathroom the bathroom was for the disable person When I tried to change the room the answer was we are sorry but we are fully booked I also work in the hotel and I know that the hotel can t give the guest a room of a lesser category In case of the overbooking it should be done the UPgrade not LOW grade we paid enough for it 104 00euro or the hotel should contact the guest to explain the situation and to find a compromise So unfortunatelly it was our last visit in this hotel , The staff is fantastic at the reception facchini and waitress The breakfast is also good and tasty

477750,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, Nothing , The hotel feels very homely with thought put into the little details such as good china and quality decor It s positioned well there is metro just around the corner and if you re feeling up to it the walk down the main avenue into Milan is a delight The breakfast was very good with the added option to eat al fresco in there wonderful garden I d definitely stay again home from home 
477751,UNA Hotel Scandinavia, Residents bar prices , The hotel was very nice inside with a classic feel can be a difficult balance Loved the attention from the staff the upgrade options on the room for wifi and for mini bar Would stay here again
