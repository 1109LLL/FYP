250308,MARQUIS Faubourg St Honor Relais Ch teaux, They have 2 members of staff working as management as waiters as bell boys as everything in a 5star hotel that has no food no spa facilities no customer care and their prices are more expensive then FOUR Seasons I only stayed there because everyone else was fully booked in Paris at night I was unable To get back into the hotel as the night staff one person was somewhere sleeping and not able to hear us ringing the bell thank god we had batteries on our UK numbers to call and inform the staff memeber we are outside trying to get inside We asked for a later check out with the night staff and he was very rude And not willing to help telling us nothing to do with him we have to speak To the day staff at 12pm they called us from The reception asking us to leave and I explained that we need additional 2 hours to pack and order food and then check out and we were ready to pay for Those two Hours but also explained that in less then 24 hours they have treated us as they are the guests and us working for them and not giving a moment to relax and enjoy the room that we paid 1470 for for one night we were finally given a later check Out 2pm and we came Down at 230pm and we re present with a 735 bill for late checkout imagine the shock Until I argued how these people are simply robbing people Blind one of the staff members said he would Void that transaction and we left Two days later I find out that the hotel took 730 out of My account without my knowledge I called them and they said they don t know and their manager will call and speak to me no body ever called me I called My bank and booking com and the same thing they told me regarding a manager calling back no one has called them back either I regret not getting the police involved when I was there as this would have never happened this hotel is run by Crooks and unprofessional staff please be careful what you are , Nothing positive
250309,MARQUIS Faubourg St Honor Relais Ch teaux,No Negative, This hotel is amazing The location is so perfect Right next to a fantastic shopping street Loads of good fashion houses Walking distance from the Louvre The hotel has a lovely lounge that was stocked with cookies and sweeties all the time Midnight snacks The room s entertainment system is very up to date and you have access to a variety of English films without having to pay a dime The staff were friendly and we were welcomed with hot chocolate which we were allowed to enjoy in the beautiful foyer On our last day which was a Sunday the receptionist sent us the Marais Quarter where we had what I regard as one of the best Sundays days of my life The little streets were filled with people shopping eating falafels etc It was wonderful Great to have hotel staff that bother to give you great tips on were to go Even helped us to order our Uber The hotel is clean and the bathroom was amazing Slipper bath in front of a window over looking Parisian rooftops What more could you ask for I am definitely staying there every time I go to Paris from now on 
250310,MARQUIS Faubourg St Honor Relais Ch teaux, As it is a very small hotel 15 rooms you will not find the staff you usually find in a large luxury hotel Most of the time the hotel is run by 2 front of house staff so for instance we we checked in there was nobody to take our luggage to the room immediatly so we ended up taking them ourselves not a big deal but unsual in a 5 star hotel , Exeptionaly high end hotel the most luxurious I have seen in many years Perfect location next to Hermes and the famous Faubourg St Honor 
250311,MARQUIS Faubourg St Honor Relais Ch teaux, We got stolen from inside the hotel specifically from our safe inside the room The hotel managment didn t provide any help didn t even check the hotel cameras We were sleeping with the rooms locked inside the suits feeling a lack of security in the hotel Very very disappointing from a big chain like that relaisandchateaux ,No Positive
