41701,The Bryson Hotel, Breakfast an absolute rip off The fruit juices and milk were not kept chilled and the toaster took an age The cooked element of the meal is usually the highlight I had bacon mushrooms beans and scrambled egg My wife had bacon mixed vegetables and scrambled egg For this standard of hotel these should have been prepared to order but the impression was that all the elements had been standing keeping warm The bacon was overcooked and difficult to cut the mixed vegetables were soggy and from a tin as were the mushrooms The scrambled egg also appeared to have been standing keeping warm before serving up This cost us the sum of 18 each , Staff very friendly helpful Room its facilities good Location good easy walk to St Pauls area 
41702,The Bryson Hotel, Don t bother with the breakfast Loads of places seconds walk away that are far better , The location is fantastic if you are working in the Clerkenwell area Comfortable bed and good AC Bathroom is good
41703,The Bryson Hotel, breakfast is a bit basic, Fast check in room to a good standard and well equipped good value for money and excellent location Overall a comfy and pleasant stay Only a couple of stops on tube from Euston
41704,The Bryson Hotel, Could ve been something in the windows between the curtains and the glass Not necessarily net curtains etc but something Felt like I had to keep lights on and curtains shut even during the day , Shower was fancy rooms had everything in that you d expect Clean comfy and fancy bedside lights too I enjoyed staying there and it was close enough to everywhere I needed to get to 
41705,The Bryson Hotel, A really minor point but there wasn t a plug socket near the mirrors which made hair styling more difficult , Really clean modern design friendly staff in a good location 
41706,The Bryson Hotel, WiFi didn t work one of the days in my room Curtains would benefit from black out linings Shower cubicle cozy , Very friendly staff convenient location for where I needed to be that weekend 
41707,The Bryson Hotel,No Negative, Modern hotel good location and facilities comfy bed I thought the continental breakfast was a bit pricey at 12 although this was waived as I reported a broken curtain rail in my room Nice gesture Would use again on business 
41708,The Bryson Hotel, There wasn t enough tea making facilities and the breakfast was lacking, The room was clean and tidy with everything you need for an over night stay
41709,The Bryson Hotel, The breakfast was overpriced was limited to 2 eggs so could not have a fried egg and scrambled eggs as 2 eggs were used in the scrambled egg , the room was good and comfortable
41710,The Bryson Hotel, The leaking air conditioning I have email the Bryson are they haven t issued an apology or refund after we were denied sleep Very disappointed , The staff
41711,The Bryson Hotel, I just felt uncomfortable not having the receipt of payment right after I paid cash during check in I got it on check out , Very close to the office I went to during my stay around 8 minutes walk The 55 bus stop is just in front of the Hotel meaning going to and from Oxford Street is one bus away 
41712,The Bryson Hotel, Only issue was that the shower drained really slowly and spilled over onto the floor Alerted hotel staff when we checked out as we only used it before doing so , Very clean and amazing towels and bed Really convenient location for the areas around Kings Cross St Paul s and the South Bank Staff were really nice and the room was a dream So quiet 
41713,The Bryson Hotel, Unfortunately the bed slates kept falling down when we sat on the bed We lifted up the mattress and pulled the wooden slates over a bit to stop them falling down It was fine after that , Great loation modern looking rooms
41714,The Bryson Hotel, I wasn t overly keen on the walls being covered in fabric but I m guessing this was for sound proofing , The room itself was really nice Bed was comfy and pillows were just right The bathroom had a lovely shower and having the hairdryer was really useful One of the best things were the towels super soft and huge 
41715,The Bryson Hotel, I didnt like the way we had to go home ha The Nothing not to dislike as i said above, I liked every second of it as soon as we arrived the staff was so polite they went out of their way to ring a taxi for us for going home and to order some food the receptionist was more than happy to ring for us we shall be returning next time we come back 10 10 for everything value for your money also the train station just around the corner to bring you anywhere 
41716,The Bryson Hotel,No Negative, The staff were extra attentive to my requests I made to make boyfriends birthday special The hotel itself was modern and so clean The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful Would 100 recommend The Bryson to family and friends We ve said we will always stay at the Bryon now when we go to London 
41717,The Bryson Hotel, I think the business center is very minimal , The staff were very friendly and accommodating I had a small issue with an adjoining room that was blocked and they moved me so that the plumbers could work to avoid disturbing me and I was compensated with free laundry and a free breakfast 
41718,The Bryson Hotel, The fact that when I went to breakfast at 10 55 on the Sunday morning I was told they only serve breakfast until 11 The woman was really rude and unhelpful so we only had a choice of what was cold , The staff on check in was really nice and helpful the towels and shower were lovely
41719,The Bryson Hotel, There is a dancing or music school right next to my room with an incredible noise until 7 30 pm which was not nice The young lady at the reception was not able to provide me with written in voice in the name of my company and albeit being really friendly she asked my to spell the words Munich and Germany and she was also unable to spell the name of my company which is a very simple English animal s name not any more difficult than cat or dog , The bathroom was very good but for this price one would have expected a little bit more even in difficult London 
41720,The Bryson Hotel, No mirror in the bedroom made drying hair a little difficult There was a mirror on the back of the wardrobe door but it was the wardrobe door that faced the door of the room so you couldn t plug the hairdryer in anywhere that would allow you to see the mirror V strange to be in a hotel that made it so difficult to get ready in the morning , Loved the staff and he location 
41721,The Bryson Hotel, Hotel staff not available for check in then went to my room only to find auto key card not working went back to reception and again no one there to help waited 10 minutes and given a new key card only to enter the room and someone was asleep in the room Again went to reception and told them to hat had just happened After all that I thought it could not get any worse and it did Rooms have paper walls u can hear your next door guests going to the bathroom talking if fact it s like they are in the room with you Then to make matters worse ohh yes it gets worse The room doors don t fit correctly and they rattle when someone walks past your room or opens there room door Hardly slept at all and will never use this chain of hotels again , Nice modern room the rest was of the hotel and rooms are very poor 
41722,The Bryson Hotel, The bathroom could of been a little cleaner and we found it strange that there was only 1 robe for 2 people Our friends had 1 robe and 1 pair of slippers We had a window albeit with not a very nice view Our friends room was very dark as no window , Our room had a very comfortable bed Reasonable clean The staff were great and extremely helpful 
41723,The Bryson Hotel, No shelving in bathroom to store toiletries Entry light to room on a sensor this light is needed to see inside wardrobe much jumping in front of sensor to keep light on Room very dark, Beautifully clean Jacuzzi bath Good shower Comfortable bed
41724,The Bryson Hotel, The staff at breakfast could of be more happy helpful and the bacon was only just cooked, The staff were great and sorted us out with an extra room due to a booking error of our own fault not the hotel 
41725,The Bryson Hotel, Terrible customer service Didn t get breakfast Was ignored for nearly 20 mins when there were available tables Servers looked like they did not know what was going on Asked at reception what the system was Was met with more confusion Reception radioed through and was told there was a table available only to be told it would be another 5 mins when i got there Had to leave to go to work with no breakfast , Room was clean and tidy 
41726,The Bryson Hotel, We loved the complementary dressing gown but there were two of us in the room and only one in there , The bed was really comfortable and the staff were very helpful and pleasant even though they struggled with our Yorkshire accent We also loved the whirlpool bath that was amazing 
41727,The Bryson Hotel, Rooms were cramped and stuffy Breakfast was non brand cornflakes push a button coffee stale pastries and rubbery meats and cheeses from a packet that had been sitting out for too long Wifi was poor Safe didn t work properly and a member of staff let themselves into my room when I was in there , Location suited us for where we needed to be Price was reasonable
41728,The Bryson Hotel, Breakfast arrangements were confusing and disorganised Lots of staff but no one really bothered to welcome guests or explain the layout , Staff at front desk were very helpful Room was neat tidy and clean Towels and shower were great Bed ws comfy 
41729,The Bryson Hotel, It was a little noisy at times traffic outside and hearing people walk in other rooms, Nice clean room Friendly and helpful staff Jacuzzi was really nice
41730,The Bryson Hotel, The rooms had paper thin walls so you could hear everything going on with your neighbors I also felt there we re a few elements in the room which were not as clean as I d have hoped , The bed was comfortable enough and re location was exactly what I needed for my business trip 
41731,The Bryson Hotel, Wifi could be slightly better 2 robes instead of just the one supplied plus prefer shower were you can use just for body wash and not hair which is tricky as head is fixed Also more coffee sugar and milk required in rooms as only enough for one cup each location for train great and decent breakfast ,No Positive
41732,The Bryson Hotel, The only mirror was in bathroom There was one on inside of wardrobe door but it didn t have enough light to it and the door kept swinging shut Made straightening hair a challenge , Very comfortable bed 
41733,The Bryson Hotel, reception staff were not friendly or welcoming The first breakfast was managed by a staff member who could not speak english and was not at all helpful No bar or lounge are to have any kind of interaction with colleagues , Easy to get to and clean
41734,The Bryson Hotel, we got a room after renovation and the bathroom and especially the toilet seat were dirty although we said it to the staff it was not cleaned until we got back to the room after dinner since it was late and we were tired from a long flight we cleaned it by ourselves the next days the lady at the reception was very empathic about our bad experience but her manager strangely could never find the time to talk to us about it they offered free breakfast as compensation but we had other plans for breakfast so it wasn t a possibility for us they didn t find anything else and just left it at that until we checked out after we returned home the manager found the time to contact us by mail and again offered something that was not relevant for us she just didn t bother answering us after we said it wasn t relevant we suggested to take the first night off the price since we checked in very late and all we did in the room was to clean it and sleep but she didn t even bother considering it the WIFI was very slow the room is very small , close enough to central places like the london bridge and covent guarder and the theaters about 20 minutes walk
41735,The Bryson Hotel, I couldn t comment on the breakfast or restaurant as we did not use this service There are several excellent eating places close by and a walk into the west end is as easy as taking the nearby Farringdon underground , Good value 15 minute walk to British museum or 20 minutes from St pauls and Tate modern Staff were particularly helpful and went out of their way to explain local area and its amenities Easy access to underground rail and bus services with several buses passing the front door 
41736,The Bryson Hotel, It would have been nice if breakfast was automatically included in the price of the room , The bed was lovely Most of all being in a busy part of London the room was so quiet We didn t hear any traffic or any neighbours We were on the top floor towards the back of the hotel Staff were very helpful I would stay there again 
41737,The Bryson Hotel, Only downside was room was on the small side decor was excellent we only used this as a base and room size was not that important to us , The whole experience from start to finish was wonderful staff couldn t have been more helpful Wi Fi worked everywhere and was free 
41738,The Bryson Hotel, The breakfast wasn t the best But it was included in our room price so we didn t lose any money To reiterate It wasn t an awful breakfast but I think there is room for improvement there The WiFi needs improvement Everytime I locked my phone I needed to reconnect to the WiFi when i reopened it , Staff were excellent Especially the reception staff We arrived about 2 hours prior to our check in time but were still allowed to check in as the room was ready Couldn t have asked for any more Smart TV s in the room First hotel i ve been to which had this Really nice touch The Deluxe room as a whole was absolutely gorgeous and the Massage Bath itself makes the price worth it 
41739,The Bryson Hotel, A little short on facilities didn t find a bar for example Decent but not outstanding breakfast Expensive even taking into account the discount , Handy for my meetings and access to a good selection of pubs restaurants Attractive modern room Friendly staff 
41740,The Bryson Hotel, Thought there was a residents bar and there wasn t also drying my hair was difficult as the plug sockets were not near a mirror, Hotel very nicely presented Close to tube station only a short hop into theatre land and a very nice breakfast
41741,The Bryson Hotel, The front desk staff were not very welcoming or organised very slow to check in and out Seemed to be a new hotel where they are getting used to running it Could not access Wireless from the room, Breakfast was good quiet room even though it was next to the road 
41742,The Bryson Hotel, The safe in the room did not work When I called the reception they told me there is a manual in the room which explains how to operate the safe There was no manual The guy from the reception came and tried to help and it still did not work Breakfast was rather poor , Nothing much 
41743,The Bryson Hotel, there was nothing I didn t like , staff were very helpful and engaging breakfast was fresh tasty and never ending bathroom was fantastic comfortable bed and bedding
41744,The Bryson Hotel, I didn t think the cost of the hotel was reflected in the overall experience Rooms were basic nothing special, Breakfast has a good variety of hot and cold continental and English food
41745,The Bryson Hotel, The receptionist on arrival wasn t very welcoming The bathroom still had the previous persons hair around the windowsill and sink yuk It was very noisy through the night with traffic as my room was on the main road , The location was ideal for my trip The bed was really comfortable 
41746,The Bryson Hotel, Tiny room My room wasn t ready so upgraded to executive room so was expecting a lovely room so very surprised by this he size Surprised there was no bar, Good breakfast lovely staff
41747,The Bryson Hotel, The room was a bit dated also the cleaning lady left only one bath robe in the room and we were a couple , Great location a lot of nice shops restaurants and coffee shops near by There was even conditioner in the bathroom complimentary bottle of water coffee and tea 
41748,The Bryson Hotel, Although the room was very modern in decor it lacked in function I found getting ready problematic with no shelving for cosmetics toiletries etc in the bathroom The lack of any drawers in the bedroom was also an issue, The staff were very helpful nothing was a bother The hotel itself was very modern extremely well maintained throughout 
41749,The Bryson Hotel,No Negative, Small hotel conveniently located in the Clerkenwell area and easy access to public transport Enjoyed a free upgrade and a very quiet room to the backyard 
41750,The Bryson Hotel, The price A had a standard room for 135 which is reasonable for this location and quality of accommodation but all future bookings for Tues Wed now 184 as far as I can tell which isn t good value So unfortunately I shan t be able to stay again unless prices go down , Good sized rooms for central London with good shower room rain head shower and nice toiletries and full bale of towels Comfortable bed and plenty of room good lighting desk chair Excellent location for my work Greys Inn Rd and surrounding pubs and restaurants local shops Good double glazing means even rooms at the front on Clerkenwell Road are not noisy 
41751,The Bryson Hotel, The room needs a mirror near an electrical outlet There was a problem with the key card expiring before I checked out , Staff was very friendly and helpful Hotel and room was very clean 
41752,The Bryson Hotel, The only mirror in the room I stayed in was in the bathroom No mirror on the dressing table and no full length mirror to check my appearance before I left the room Made drying and styling my hair very difficult , I loved the opulence of the rooms
41753,The Bryson Hotel, Noisy very hard bed extraction fan not working in bathroom toilet not everyones smells of roses I would imagine the snagging list for this new hotel is very long , All staff were very helpful and doing an excellent job I noticed they now have a cooked breakfast option Clean sheets 
41754,The Bryson Hotel,No Negative, The Bryson hotel is really great i ve been the for 6 nights Very clean an the location is really good close to Farringdon station The staff is excellent especially Giulia she s probably the friendliest girl in London On my next trip to London I ll definitely be back here 
41755,The Bryson Hotel, The room was to small and quite tight for the 2 of us getting ready The view was of outside stairs, Room was comfortable but small view was really poor the amount we paid we expected something a little better
41756,The Bryson Hotel, The reception was unhelpful I has a visitor who was not allowed in Could not even get a call to reception from room , Nothing was good about my staying it was a very uncomfortable evening I leave after 3 hours
41757,The Bryson Hotel, no tea coffee facilities or even a kettle Breakfast was a disaster nothing was out at 8 00 am as promised staff could not be bothered Wouldn t stay there again for the price , Location really good very close to Farringdon
41758,The Bryson Hotel, Breakfast was unfortunately cold and to my husbands dismay there was no brown sauce, Sam who covered reception went beyond his duties Booking us into a room as we arrived earlier then upgraded us So helpful with directions to our dinner reservations and offered lunch advice too
41759,The Bryson Hotel, Generously overpriced Had a two bedroom apartment for the same price in the same neighbourhood just two weeks earlier , Comfortable hotel facilities up to standard Quiet room in the back 
41760,The Bryson Hotel, Breakfast buffet was rationed and not replenished Got 1 rasher of bacon tiny amounts of everything hot Being asked if I wanted to stay an extra night as was a few mins past check out time View from window was of a very dusty fire escape , Friendly welcome at front desk Everything was new Excellent nights sleep Able to open a window 
41761,The Bryson Hotel, Items were not fixed brand new hotel which was not up to standard of photos Our door frame fell off when we walked through the bedroom door The upholstery and interior was awful the electrics were flickering I was aware this was a new hotel but it has not been finished What had been completed was done to a very poor quality , They gave us our money back 
41762,The Bryson Hotel, No fault of this new hotel but the air went out in our room , Loved loved loved the staff They were so helpful and accommodating We will stay again Location was awesome 
41763,The Bryson Hotel,No Negative, Tried a new hotel for my stay in London Excellent quiet location close to the city center and famous Shoreditch Very welcoming members of staff helped me with all my queeries throughout my stay Rooms have been very clean and spacious 
41764,The Bryson Hotel,No Negative, I stayed at The Bryson Hotel for one night with my boyfriend and we enjoyed our stay very much We wanted to do some sightseeing and shopping in London and the Location of this brand new hotel was brilliant There are 2 underground stations with main lines and also buses to the city centre every 5 minutes and it only takes another 10min to be in Oxford Circus The British and Dickens Museum Covent Garden Leicester Square Piccadilly Old Street Liverpool street I was amazed how close everything was The Hotel was lovely it is a Brand New one and everything looks so clean tidy and fresh Our bathroom was big and spacious The bed very comfortable and the toiletries very nice Staff was very helpful I do hope we can go back soon 
41765,The Bryson Hotel, The room was very small Not enough place to be sitted on the table and work There is no signal or lights outside and was really difficult reached it from the main street They charged 50 for nothing Still waiting they will them back to me I spent there two nights instead of fours and I mstill waiting the reimboursement of the two other nights , The staff was awailable and polite
41766,The Bryson Hotel, There was only tea no sachets of coffee in my room That s it Everything else was perfect , Fantastic service I arrived at 4am after booking a few hours earlier and the man at the 24 hour desk was very warm friendly and polite Check in and check out were fast and easy The bed was comfortable the room was lovely clean and well appointed 
41767,The Bryson Hotel,No Negative, I stayed at The Bryson for the first time as it has been recently opened everything is brand new the soft carpet the beds really comfortable and definitely for London a very unusual size of rooms and bathrooms with windows Buffet breakfast is served in the restaurant with a great variety of products and a very friendly team is just looking after you all the time Very central located you can reach the office in The City very quickly and at the same time with the central line you can start your shopping on the High Street 
41768,The Bryson Hotel, The hotel tries really hard to be a contemporary boutique hotel but in my opinion it falls a bit short I m sure some of these were teething issues but the desk was really small and the large desk lamp took up most of the usable space The WiFi didn t work although this was corrected several hours later It would have been nice to have blinds as well as curtains so I could let light in without being exposed to the neighbours Not sure what s going on with the cheap looking carpet on the walls in the hallways or as skirting boards in the rooms , The hotel was new so everything was super clean The bed was really comfortable and the room had everything I needed The staff were friendly and I really liked the location close to Clerkenwell Farringdon Leather Lane 
41769,The Bryson Hotel, was upgraded 3 times in one night 1st time was advised I was upgraded but turned out to be a disabled room obviously with no bath or std shower 2nd upgrade given a room which had people living in staff not guests 3rd upgrade was comfortable but full length mirror came off the wardrobe door and missed my toes by an inch In all a total nightmare I don t see why I should pay for this room, friendly staff and comfortable bed
