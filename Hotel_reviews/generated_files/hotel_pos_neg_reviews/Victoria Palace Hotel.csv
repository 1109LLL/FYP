220227,Victoria Palace Hotel, Staff was rude and a nightmare to deal with We were there on our honeymoon We were treated poorly and the staff was incompetent when it came to helping us navigate the city If you are just staying for a night it s fine We were there six days and would never stay there again , Breakfast was good and the place was comfortable Snacks 24 7 and decent room service menu Definitely not a place to stay for multiple nights Staff members speak english 
220228,Victoria Palace Hotel, The breakfast is so bad even don t have fresh orange juice The attitude of the reception and doorman also bad don t even smile maybe this is a general french attitude The room facility is old the toilet and sink are not in the same room The hotel don t provide a any free drink coffee tea or a bottle of water It is unusually for a five star hotel ,No Positive

220230,Victoria Palace Hotel, Was 15 min late for bkfst which I had paid for Staff would not allow me to approach the buffet which was still stocked They said I could order room service So they could just bring the same food up later and make a big production of it in a small room I just wanted some meat and cheese No taxis available nearby needed to use Uber This was no problem for us but could be for the non connected , Otherwise very good service Lovely lobby bar
