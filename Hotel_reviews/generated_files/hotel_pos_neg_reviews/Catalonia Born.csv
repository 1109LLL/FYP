426570,Catalonia Born, We weren t able to use the spa that is advertised in the listing at the sister hotel because the sister hotel has recently changed it too there own guests only This should be removed from the advert It was a real shame but our hotel were very apologetic , Wonderful hotel We loved our stay and in particularly enjoyed the swimming pool and the free snacks drinks were excellent It was also our honeymoon and they left a bottle of bubbly in our room which was really appreciated Room was lovely and comfortable and very quiet Location was brilliant

426581,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Amazing hotel in a great neighbourhood It is new stylish with decently sized rooms and a great bathroom Is definitely my hotel of choice in Barcelona 
426582,Catalonia Born, The location is hidden and moisy from the nearer area I had to stay minimum 30 min In a queue to ask the staff a question The staff are not helpful and give wrong info about the city , Nothing
426583,Catalonia Born, the description said it had parking at the hotel but it was actually off side So it was t the hotel it was booking com miss leading the customer with wrong information ,No Positive
426584,Catalonia Born, Cheaper perhaps , Staff were very attentive and friendly There was a free buffet throughout the day that was very pleasant and highly appreciated The windows were double double glazed 4panes so quiet Location was perfect next to Arc De Triomp
426585,Catalonia Born, There was a problem with English tv channels for a few weeks They came back as mysteriously as they disappeared as did one of the lifts minor gripes for a stay over 3 weeks, This is a perfect central spot Close to arc de triomphe Palau de musica and gothic quarter many tours start nearby or you can leap on the metro at arc de triumphed or urquinoana after a hot day the free tapas and swimming were a godsend Some staff were fantastic thanks Lissette and reception were friendly and helpful If you have a hankering to get about by car the hotel have a special rate on great public parking very nearby We loved this boutique hotel
426586,Catalonia Born, Unfriendly staff especially in the front desk but except Pablo I gor more help and information from ousekeeping staff Musty smell in the shower room Dirty and smelly toilet near the restaurant , Snackbar comes handy after taking long walks 
426587,Catalonia Born, Hairdryer needed more power The toilet in our room was located very close to the wall which made it awkward to use Pillows could be fuller or provide another set for the bed , Hotel is located in the fantastic El Born area close to many of the tourist attractions and great restaurants Area is quiet at night so you can get a good sleep Bed was comfortable although had to ask for an extra pillow Wi fi worked everywhere in the building Amazing rooftop pool with great view Hotel staff were extremely helpful in giving us great suggestions on local restaurants and the best way to get to attractions Good amount of storage in the room and was cleaned daily 
426588,Catalonia Born, Didn t have a room with a view but wasn t in the room much so wasn t that bothered overall , The best parts about the hotel were spacious rooms large bathroom friendly staff location was perfect and quiet short walk from shops bars restaurants that were all lovely not far from the centre pool was lovely free snacks was amazing in the afternoon Would highly recommend 
426589,Catalonia Born, Some of the afternoon snacks could be a little bit better , The staff especially Victor were very helpful and gave us great tips on transportation and restaurants 
426590,Catalonia Born,No Negative, What a wonderful time we had at the Catalonia Born All of the staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful Deborah was especially nice When we arrived I leaned on a counter that had just been painted Deborah had my shirt cleaned and back to me the same day with a bottle of Cava The room was comfortable and had lots of space to put things very good wifi lots of electrical outlets and the best bed we ve ever slept in Breakfast had everything you can imagine hot and cold food juices good coffee Also every day from 14 00 to 23 00 in the lobby there was a complementary buffet with sandwiches cakes salads soups drinks it was greatly appreciated after long hours of walking There s also an excellent tapas restaurant right across the street Elsa y Fred And one more very nice memory the hotel noticed from my passport that I was having a birthday and sent up another bottle of Cava with a birthday greeting We will definitely be back in Barcelona and stay at the Catalonia Born 
426591,Catalonia Born, English cooked breakfast was cold When we booked we were not told of the extra charge of bedroom tax per night per person so not happy , Huge bed so comfy Friendly helpful staff Victor was professional and courteous 
426592,Catalonia Born, Could of been informed about the complimentary food served at 2pm 7pm at the check in stage instead of the hours before we departed the hotel, Me and my other half stayed here and the hotel all round was fantastic Check in simple and quick great location lovely restaurants around very close to the metro Would definitely recommend 
426593,Catalonia Born, Staff often only one couldn t cope with busy period in bar area buffet Coffee machine quickly ran out of water or milk , Good selection of hot and cold food at breakfast Great location for exploring city on foot Tip ask at reception for beach pool towels 
426594,Catalonia Born, Not a criticism but wish we had turned left out of the hotel instead of right on our first night to look for a restaurant because there was a really nice area with plenty of bars and places to eat but a little more challenging if you ventured the other way , This hotel is a little gem the staff are really efficient and the room lovely although we were opposite a bar we never heard a thing at all The beds really comfy The little touch of a buffet which is free for guests is so generous The breakfast was always good too not too much choice but plenty of everything that you would expect The pool was really small a dipping pool really but very sweet and clean and a real sun trap if you have time that is Also it was my husbands birthday while we were there I never said a thing but his birthday cards must have given it away and when we returned from our day out there was a bottle of bubbly how thoughtful and kind of the hotel to do this Rooms were clean and fresh towels every day Excellent would book again 
426595,Catalonia Born, Whilst the hotel is dog friendly an occasion occurred which demonstrated that a particular staff member on reception was clearly not This is a pity particularly as my daughter arrived in reception with her very small dog on a leash and enquired if she could await us in reception will we came down in the lift The staff member was disapproving of her having the dog in the reception area and when the dog starting panting it was very warm outside a disapproving SHUUUUSSSHHH came from a face like fizz My daughter waited outside Maybe this staff member missed the brief regards being dog friendly however this incident wouldn t stop future bookings but I d be mindful of this incident occurring again if the staff member in question was on duty , We have stayed at this hotel around 5 or 6 times in the passed few years it is well located for visiting family and friends who live in the area It is also well located for all places of interest and has many good restaurants and bars in the area The hotel is spotless clean comfortable and staff are cheerful and helpful 
426596,Catalonia Born, Couldn t really fault anything, Bed was excellent complimentary light buffet in afternoons was really good ambiance of hotel reception lovely staff friendly and helpful worth upgrading to superior rooms breakfast good
426597,Catalonia Born, we weren t provided with the free daily water bottle in the room and the aircon wasn t good it was quite warm in the room not cool enough, Breakfast was good daily free snacks in the bar was the greatest and yummy Lacked selection from the menu in case you want to order food if you re picky but the bar food was great 
426598,Catalonia Born, I made the reservation 1 hr before and when I arrived to the hotel they told me that it was full and they had to send me to another hotel from the same chain near Las Ramblas Not ideal ,No Positive
426599,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The free buffet after 2pm was exceptional a really nice extra from the hotel Great location not too noisy being on a side street away from some of the busier roads Friendly and helpful staff Would recommend the Catalonia Born to anyone 
426600,Catalonia Born, Room was quite noisy Breakfast was overpriced and could have been hotter, Staff were very friendly Hotel clean The snacks served all afternoon were great
426601,Catalonia Born, Being able to take our coffee from the buffet into the open outside area , Excellent location friendly helpful staff Excellent facilities and very comfortable beds 
426602,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The staff were amazing and so kind and thoughtful they made our stay in the hotel a wonderful experience sending up a bottle of champagne on arrival for my boyfriends birthday Barcelona itself as beautiful as it is was not so kind to us we were robbed on our first night Then the following day we were supposed to see Barcelona v Villareal we bought match tickets online before we left for our holiday but when we got to the stadium we were told they were invalid and someone else had already arrived in the stadium with the same tickets There were quite a few ppl around us that this had happened to so be careful if purchasing online We left Barcelona feeling pretty downhearted but we kept telling each other at least the hotel was great 
426603,Catalonia Born, Our room was 007 on the ground floor near reception It was very noisy If we stay there again we Would stay on another floor , Good location mostly friendly reception staff Good breakfasts 
426604,Catalonia Born, 1st floor room can be a bit noisy due to small streets and sidewalks next to windows can t open a window for the night due to noise Room 004 has some pipe in the ceiling just above the bed which is really loud when someone in the room on the 2nd floor is using bathroom Heating system doesn t work my first night I got really cold It takes few minutes for the hot water to start coming out of the tap especially during mornings and late evenings , Very nice location in the city center everything around is basically 15 20min walk by foot Subway station is near Staff very friendly and welcoming Buffet during the day refilled frequently Nice breakfast variety is OK Small pool on the roof however never used that myself 
426605,Catalonia Born, Nothing, The hotel born was actually over booked but they contacted me to say they can put us in there sister hotel the Cathedral born this was superb 
426606,Catalonia Born, We didn t find a lot of restaurants in the area directly opposite the hotel is a lovely little place but otherwise it was a proper search , I loved that the staff all happily spoke English and were very friendly The hotel was very clean and comfortable 
426607,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The Catalonia Born is perfectly located for seeing all of the major tourist attractions Two stops on the metro takes you to Las Ramblas perfect Safe location clean and modern hotel with super friendly staff Breakfast was served until late and the rooms were of a high standard Great breakfast complete with churros The perfect hotel for a weekend in Barcelona it definitely ticks all of the boxes 
426608,Catalonia Born, As above, Overall not to bad but some of our party were moved to another hotel which disrupted the group and it was a special occasion The staff could be more friendly was told on several occasions to lower our voices The pool was very small rooms were very tiny but the location was was good for exploring 
426609,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The reception staff was very organized and coached in high level Good Job The Buffet after noon was for free and it was a nice gesture from the hotel to make it Before going to bad there was always a chocolate gift before night to the room Breakfast was outstanding After checking out at 02 00 in the morning there was a breakfast package prepared for us 
426610,Catalonia Born,No Negative, We were very welcome with free food available Friendly bar even to hang sround with childreen Room and bathroom sizes were amazing Location is aldo very good Great value for money I would go back amd hihjly recommend 
426611,Catalonia Born, I did not like the position of my room it was around a courtyard seemed to be looking into other rooms but with so much to do in barcelona you are only there to sleep Guess I was lucky last time i stayed and had a room with small verandah overlooking the street , Location Location Location You get to know your way around the neighbourhood quickly Exciting discovering designer shops in narrow streets took a different path each day Totally loved Fred and Elsa and La Candella Restaraunt in close proximity to hotel 
426612,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The staff were excellent very professional and helpful The hotel was superb Very clean modern excellent location and the room was fantastic with a huge bathroom and a great shower 
426613,Catalonia Born, You need to install silent doors I had room nr 105 You could hear a needle dropped in the corridor outside the room A four star hotel like this it should be silent It was ridiculous ,No Positive
426614,Catalonia Born,No Negative, excellent service compact and quiet nice beds plenty of pillows triple glaze windows absolute silence when there s noise outside very clean and pleasant design The extra bonus is the free food drinks in the foyer from 13 till 23 00 We had snacks and sweets there Would love to come back 
426615,Catalonia Born, It was very hot in a room and when we turned on conditioner it became even hotter But that did not made our stay less enjoyable , It was an amazing hotel in a great location next to the Triumph Arch 
426616,Catalonia Born, Absolutely loved all of it , We really enjoyed the intimacy of this hotel and valued coming home from a long day out and being able to have refreshments and snacks Room 902 is on the upper floor has a balcony and is very quiet An excellent room 
426617,Catalonia Born, There were no tea cups as such we used coffee cups which were a bit too small for tea but there were teapots The only reason I mention this is that there was nothing else I could make negative comments about , The staff were friendly and very helpful The rooms were of adequate size with large comfortable beds The breakfast choice was varied and was of good quality A free buffet was available every day in the bar area between 2pm and 11pm There was a variety of small sandwiches cakes croissants even soup and a hot dish Tea coffee and soft drinks were included The hotel is situated on a fairly quiet side street just around the corner from the Arc de Triomp Las Ramblas is about 15 minutes walking distance Also within walking distance was the Ciutadella Park where there is a zoo quite expensive not visited the ports and beaches and the Sagrada familia church If you visit the Sagrada familia suggest you book online it is cheaper than paying at the church and you can select a time slot for your visit which avoids problems It is a very popular attraction There are two computers in the lobby area of the Hotel which are free to use at any time I have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel 
426618,Catalonia Born, breakfastroom a little small tables uncomfortably close to each other street level rooms a bit noisy, very friendly staff nice clean rooms comfortable
426619,Catalonia Born, No particular comments , We love the location of this hotel The facilities are excellent and we enjoyed the complimentary food and drink that was offered throughout the afternoon evening We will stay here again next year when we visit Barcelona 
426620,Catalonia Born, Drain in shower blocked Floor underneath window wet after heavy showers , Location Room cleaned every day even though we were quite late leavingnit some days 
426621,Catalonia Born, My only tiny complaint is that the room door could be better soundproofed it s possible to hear everything in the corridor although it s not the sort of hotel with rampaging stag hen parties so it wasn t much of a problem but the rooms were well sound proofed from each other and there was no noise from the street , This is an excellent hotel The staff were lovely we arrived in pouring rain and they made sure we were checked in as quickly as possible so we could go and get dry they also gave us vouchers for a complimentary drink each The free tapas were great it saved us going out again on that rainy night and saved us some money over the weekend The breakfast at extra cost was great value for money a wide selection and very tasty We would definitely stay here again 
426622,Catalonia Born,No Negative, we loved the fact free food was offered as a little extra between 2 11pm very nice touch also as we stayed in the terrace room we were greeted with champagne on arrival 
426623,Catalonia Born, Slightly inacessible by taxi in the old town but we liked being in the Gothic quarter so much it was a good trade off The swimming pool wasn t on the website so we didn t take cossies , The bed was HUGE everything very comfortable and thoughtfully provided We liked the street noises could shut them out with double glazing if preferred as we felt part of this interesting area And the wonderful Elsa y Fred cafe restaurant immediately over the road for amazing breakfasts tapas and more 
426624,Catalonia Born, Location was a little rough but nothing too bad at all The pool was very small , Massive bed very clean and amazing shower Fantastic location 10 to 15 minutes from everything 
426625,Catalonia Born, Everything was perfect about the hotel however only issue was that It was unpleasant every morning when there was no air con available in the hot weather,No Positive
426626,Catalonia Born, The cheap instant coffee in the room didn t match the style of everything surrounding it at all come on a Nespresso machine and a few capsules isn t such a big investment , Most comfortable bed ever great location stylish design
426627,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Very clean Comfy rooms lovely helpful and very friendly staff Free buffet and soft drinks 2 11 pm an unexpected bonus Only 10 mins walk from placa Catalunya and las ramblas
426628,Catalonia Born, The hotel describes itself as warm but the interior design of the rooms was cold impersonal and taste less fault of the interior designer rather than the hotel itself but still the rooms were quite sad It is also the most badly sound proofed hotel I have probably ever stayed in If someone was talking in the hallway it felt like they were lying in bed with you The same goes for the windows on the Street any noise was ridiculously strong From voices to garbage trucks laughter anything It was really disturbing and I was on the 3rd floor The walls were really thin and someone in the building that bordered with my room gave a small house gathering and when people laughed it was literally like having them in bed with me Strongly advise against staying there if it s a work trip because you don t get good sleep at least in the room I stayed in 309 Also in a four star hotel you expect the cleaning ladies to fold your pajama and not throw it in a ball on the pillow Finally I told the staff it is very unhygenic that they place unwashable faux leather pillows that guests tend to put on the floor when going to sleep on the pillows you then proceed to place your face on , The location was good Staff was polite 
426629,Catalonia Born, Would prefer a suite all on one level Also the coffee was not replenished in the room , Massive bed in our suite lovely quiet room Nice touch that they brought cava and cookies to our suite on arrival Great tapas right over the street at Elsa and Fred s 
426630,Catalonia Born, Alterations in hand at present so a bit of noise in the day but not a problem, Lovely hotel in heart of old quarter Able to walk to many great sites Lots of restaurants and tapa bars around
426631,Catalonia Born, Not all guests from our party had a kettle in their room which was a bit awkward in that we all paid the same , Breakfast excellent Staff really helpful sorted out restaurants printed boarding cards and were very nice even when we were a bit noisy Great location close to tube Fantastic restaurant opposite
426632,Catalonia Born, The suite we had booked had two flights of stairs to get from the sitting room to the bedroom Being old we had to move to a room without stairs Also I think they overcharged us i ll write seperately to you about this ,No Positive
426633,Catalonia Born, Breakfast was good although every day the same thing was on the menu so after 2 3 days it becomes boring The room I satyed at was very small and had a small window to the inside of the building some kind of tunnel so not view neither direct natural light Air conditioning was only heating cooling function not working even when putting the temperature low 15C the room became hot and stuffy Walls doors are not sound proof so if someone is walking talking on the corridor it felt as if they were inside the room Lack of ventilation in the bathroom Mold growing in the bath , Excellent location Long breakfast hours until 11am Super friendly staff They will keep your bags in a room even after checking out so you can continue sightseeing as long as you want Free Internet with good signal in all premises 
426634,Catalonia Born, Very disappointed that the bar was cloesed in the hotel There wasn t very many pubs around the hotel to get a drink before heading back to bed , The room was lovely Beds were very comfortable We had a walk in shower and bath tub Tea and coffee facilities in the room was great and a fresh bottle of water everyday 
426635,Catalonia Born, I was pretty unhappy about a few things but to be honest I am worried that my view may be a little distorted after new years I became sick with the flu going around and starting that Monday the hotel began gutting and fixing all the rooms on my floor I mean a complete renovation I do not think this was ok the noise was unbearable and besides that the workers were rude and loud I came downstairs to ask about the situation twice and both times waited for 20 minutes and then left as the one women who spoke English was busy , I liked the idea of the organization which is a local Spanish family who own over two dozen of these hotels The roof was also nice and some what relaxing
426636,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Excellent location Close to subway metro and nice places to walk around Very helpful and nice hotel staff A little small but confortable room 
426637,Catalonia Born, Construction of rooms next door Short bed and uncomfortable pillows, Good location close to Metro Good start of the walk journey via older Barcelona to La Rambla and Marina
426638,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Breakfast great loved the pastel de natas Fresh fruit salad cereal plus hot options Location couldn t be better short walk downhill and you are in the heart of the city Reception and breakfast staff couldn t be more helpful Great hotel highly recommend 
426639,Catalonia Born, No stairs to the restaurant Property bit noisy Facility doesnt accommodate a 4 worth , The lady at the reception was not really friendly and not informative
426640,Catalonia Born, It would have been nice to be told that the bar wasn t available due to reconstruction , Great location right by the Arc de triomphe and 15 mins walk into town Clean hotel great sleep 
426641,Catalonia Born, When asking about the opening hours or location of spa facilities I was told to google When asking for the way to plaza cataluna I was given the wrong directions In general did not feel well taken care of by the stuff My room had only window looking to another wall no day light Also the toilet was not cleaned properly as it still had blood stains Curtains were transparent so that when light was switched on I felt people can look inside the room Disappointed from a 4 star hotel where I paid 280 Eur for 2 nights ,No Positive
426642,Catalonia Born, A bit pricy inspite of the discount as we were traveling off season , Great breakfast deal Easy and safe walking distance to historic places and late night done outs
426643,Catalonia Born, The hotel should really invest on the restaurant currently only breakfast is served and food can only be ordered from outside to offer an even better experience , Excellent location friendly staff clean room with balcony and full amenities Absolutely value for money 
426644,Catalonia Born, I booked triple beds room The room is small for three people No room for chair and luggage , Staffs are very nice The location is good The bed is very comfortable 
426645,Catalonia Born, Breakfast hot food was luke warm and should have been included in the price paid Bathroom needed updating , The bed was big and really comfortable There was a good selection of food at breakfast The hotel was in an excellent location for our 4 night stay and was very well appointed 
426646,Catalonia Born, You could hear EVERYTHING going on in the hallways and courtyard while trying to sleep I woke up several times every night , Great staff and great location 
426647,Catalonia Born, They don t have sockets near the bed , Me and my friend had a great stay here The staff are really helpful and nice Very clean they cleaned the room everyday and changed the towels The breakfast was also great with a variety of choices And the location is perfect too near the Arc de Triomf on evenings you can walk through the gothic neighborhood by foot 
426648,Catalonia Born, The Airco blows only warm air in winter and only cool air in summer It d be good to point it out to guests at check in , The staff is amazing and very helpful The room quality is great and very hygienic Actually the room felt larger than 15m2 The location feels residential yet close to the Arc De Triomfe Barcelona Zoo and other attractions The rooms are soundproof Roomservice and technical support are great I ll book it forever 
426649,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The staff is excellent They are very helpful and always with a smile A special thanks to the receptionist Victor who helped us with everything we needed 
426650,Catalonia Born, The buffet breakfast was a little disappointing There wasn t much choice of fruit and the cooked food was cold , The location was great the decor was great and the staff were great 
426651,Catalonia Born, My only complaint was that they did not have very many selections for their room service menu but then again there s a plethora of restaurants in the same street 2 of which are literally right in front of the entrance , My room was very nice and roomy the individuals at the front desk were very nice and helpful It s very close from everything 
426652,Catalonia Born, Check in was slow we did check in early for 3 rooms so it wasn t the most straightforward The manager took over to help Air conditioning didn t work during november rooms were too hot at night but street below to loud to keep open Request a courtyard room to avoid noise , Comfy bed clean room helpful staff ideal location for us Rooms were ready before check in Larger room with terrace was a welcome space 
426653,Catalonia Born, Floor in the room was dirty the closet was rickety the shower was maddeningly hot cold No coffee maker only instant coffee in a 4 star hotel , Fantastic location Front desk and all staff were extremely helpful and accommodating 
426654,Catalonia Born, Several front desk staff were not very warm Room service did not provide clean glasses throughout our 5 day stay just when we arrived Only refreshed bottled water once Mould in shower , Location was good Breakfast was very good 
426655,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Brilliant staff location Excellent rain shower gorgeous mural above bed Balcony Free water and chocolates daily Spacious room Can t wait to go back 
426656,Catalonia Born, The room was a little bit small but since we stayed there only one evening it was enough for us However for a longer stay a little bit bigger room would be better , Breakfast location and cleanliness were great The hotel in general is very nice it s on the edge of the old town in walking distance from the center and right next to a metro and train station Despite of the central location the room was very quiet 
426657,Catalonia Born, Roadside room rather noisey rooms facing inwards much quieter , Staff very polite and helpfull Great choice of food for breakfast both cooked and continental 
426658,Catalonia Born, Hot breakfast was not great Should have stayed with the cold buffet , Very comfortable beds Excellent location walking distance to great restaurants beach harbour
426659,Catalonia Born, Staff were indifferent and we had to pay upfront although a credit card was taken as guarantee We were told they took payment upfront when they are fully booked Room not properly turned out on a daily basis as you would expect from a four star hotel We had a four night stay and it looked like someone had rushed through cleaning on our last evening , Beds were comfortable and location was brilliant Elsa y Fred directly opposite the hotel for good breakfast and delicious meals 
426660,Catalonia Born, The breakfast wasn t included, The location is excellent the staff very pleasant and professional It would be excellent overall if breakfast were included I would recommend it to everyone 
426661,Catalonia Born, Rooms away from street side are actually noisier than street side due to close proximity of apartment building and related noise , Very clean and modern but in old district 
426662,Catalonia Born, The pool is very small , Hotel is attractive clean modern and well decorated Our room was very quiet and had good facilities No noise from outside at all Location was excellent for Born staff were brilliant We will stay here again 
426663,Catalonia Born, The breakfast room can get very noisy when there s a lot of people in it, The staff here were so welcoming and friendly nothing was ever too much trouble and the service is very helpful and personal from the cleaners all the way up to front desk and manager The bed was wonderfully comfortable lots of pillows excellent shower has a pleasant bar and lounges It is nicely situated no traffic noise keeps it quiet a very good breakfast with lots of variety and on the edge of the old city I d definitely stay there again Much much much better value and far nicer than other hotels I ve stayed at 
426664,Catalonia Born, It was expensive all things considered although there were limited options at lower prices when we were looking 2 months prior to our arrival so perhaps Barcelona runs at a premium The room was certainly nice but for over 300 euros night it was not luxurious I found the room to meet expectations of what I usually pay for 150 180 night in the US and similar to the room we paid 200euros night for in Madrid , The location was very convenient the bed and overall atmosphere comfortable everything was clean and the staff was very pleasant attentive We would likely return 
426665,Catalonia Born, Cleare map location directions on booking taxi driver had difficulty finding, Great room friendly welcoming staff Ideal location with escape from the hustle and bustle on the roof top pool 
426666,Catalonia Born, Nothing , Worthy upgrade to superior room with balcony and generous bathroom Location in born was excellent Near metro and great tapas Rooftop terrace and pool even tho bijoux proportions and pool not heated very welcome and well designed for small area Staff excellent Like the complimentary welcome drink What a find 
426667,Catalonia Born, Cost of laundry washing was extortionate Staff assisted with this and it was reduced , Bed was extremely comfy and staff were very helpful Location was ideal as not too close to las ramblas less busy Restaurants in area where fab 
426668,Catalonia Born, Nothing it was all good , Great location really friendly staff and excellent facilities Loved roof top pool even though a bit small Great bars and restaurants nearby 
426669,Catalonia Born, The pool is small but great for a little plunge to cool off , Was here on a business trip Great location for where I wanted to be Great restaurant opposite where I ate for breakfast and dinner Elsa y Fred Very friendly hotel staff 
426670,Catalonia Born, more poolbeds or poolbeds arranged differently people were waiting in line to use the beds and soake in the sun Also it would be nice to have some silence by the pool or breaks in the music that kept playing the same tunes over and over Maybe an easier way to order up drinks to the pool other than that perfect , wonderful staff breakfast and rooms always smiling helping and being sweet It s my 3 stay and each stay just as good 
426671,Catalonia Born, Just one minor detail the shower cubicle in our room room 203 could do with an update however there is also an over the bath shower in there so it didn t cause too much of an upset , Excellent location close to most tourist attractions 5 min from the hop on hop off bus stop Hotel was clean and room was cleaned every day fresh towels were provided daily and everything was topped up Staff were helpful and pleasant Breafast was plentiful with a good selection to cater for all tastes 
426672,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Lovely staff nice quiet location but a pleasant stroll into the city and very accessible via the metro just 2 short stops into the centre We bought a T10 which gives 10 journeys for just under 10 euros it can be used on the metro and public buses The breakfast was excellent value for money 
426673,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The staff was very nice and helpful Clean and spacious room we got an upgrade for just a little bit extra per night Amazing location Cannot be beat 
426674,Catalonia Born, The standard room was a bit on the small side It was comfortable for one person but it s not a room I would spend a lot of time in , The location is perfect in a hip neighborhood with great restaurants a block away from the Arc de Triomf an awesome park and public transit It s an ideal starting point for sightseeing Across the street from a very good tapas restaurant and just a block from a cafe with great coffee and pastries The room and hotel is updated and very clean The rooftop pool and lounge though small and shallow is a great amenity 
426675,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Best breakfast we had in Europe only 10 Very nice pool on the roof Helpful polite staff Walking distance to many attractions shops and restaurants bars 
426676,Catalonia Born, Breakfast is too pricey the restaurant just in front offers an excellent brunch for less highly recommended for dinner too , Excelent location nice and confortable hotel in general
426677,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Staff were really friendly and helpful Rooms very modern with a comfortable bed Wifi was good throughout the whole hotel Breakfast had lots of options 
426678,Catalonia Born, Can t think of any problems , I can t comment on the breakfast as I didn t eat at the hotel but the room was very comfortable and modern with good coffee and tea making facilities excellent wi fi and air conditioning and a handy small safe The bathroom was spacious and had both bath and shower cubicle I stayed for three nights and was given a voucher on arrival for a complementary glass of cava in the bar The location is excellent and quite central handy for most sightseeing and tourist areas very close to the Arc de Triomphe and 10 minutes walk to the Gothic Cathedral but in a very quiet little street 
426679,Catalonia Born, Had no real issues would definitely be back , Location was great Room was lovely very spacious and well stocked and the staff were very accommodating Loved the rooftop pool for a relaxing lie out 
426680,Catalonia Born, Nothing to complain, Excellent location just a few minutes walk to the subway station bus route to the beach stops even closer Many good restaurants nearby We had a room with own terrace on the top floor and there was only a short corridor to the swimming pool on the roof No street view from the terrace but nevertheless nice view over the roof tops No street noise at all Staff was very friendly and helpful Breakfast was good room was cleaned daily and WiFi worked well All in all we highly recommend this hotel and especially the room with own terrace 
426681,Catalonia Born, Walls were thin so moved to another room because of baby in next room Hotel was very accommodating though , Loved everything about the hotel Comfortable room wonderful location excellent staff 
426682,Catalonia Born, in the inside court in the ground floor there were people smoking and the smoke could be felt strongly inside the room it was not permanent but it would have been better to keep a non smoking hotel it is a pity such the good cleanness of the hotel to be affected by bad behaviours,No Positive
426683,Catalonia Born, Maids are not qualified it is not a clean hotel the rooms needs urgent improvements bathrooms are outdated The double superior room was barely a 3 star one and the double room was a really bad one Smell proved that it is not cleaned and the wood in the room had dirt marks AC was either really cold and noisy or not working The amount of money asked are totally not worth , Excellent breakfast well trained reception staff
426684,Catalonia Born, Nothing everything was great , The hotel is in a fabulous location the staff were so friendly and helpful We had the 2 storey suite with a terrace on level 8 and it was fantastic same level as the pool too so very easy access Highly recommend this hotel 
426685,Catalonia Born, Although the private terrace was great it would have been nice to have a view of the street since there is a lot of foot traffic So don t book the terrace rooms if street views are important to you The bathroom was nicely decorated but very snug , Staff was very friendly and helpful Hotel in excellent location Lots of little restaurants and stores close by that are open late We had a room with a terrace which was lovely The room looked like it was recently renovated Would definitely stay there again 
426686,Catalonia Born, View of ugly building opposite street noise until late at night and again very early in the morning kettle considered a superior feature but was given one when asked the smallest hotel pool I have ever seen On the whole I d have expected a little more from a 4 star hotel and I found my stay a little too overpriced , Good location near old town and subway big comfortable bed nice bathroom very good breakfast friendly staff most but not all had good English 
426687,Catalonia Born,No Negative, I love this hotel Again this year we got upgraded to a better room with a view to the street with no ekstra charge There is a very nice aircon and minibar in the room and coffee and the facilities The staff is very nice and helpfull the cleaning is very good and the hotel called a doctor when I got sick and help us all they could always smiling We love the roof top with the great little pool and a fantastic view over the city And the gastrobar and sushirestaurant a cross the street are exceptionel good All in all a very good experience We come here every year 
426688,Catalonia Born, Our room was on the first floor and extremely noisy There was a lot of noise coming from the staff entering and exiting service docks outside noise from trucks and the floors above Also the AC was down for scheduled maintenance for a full day during our stay this summer Had to replace the key twice as they were deactivated I don t think the price was justified by these qualities , Great location and the pool was a nice plus 
426689,Catalonia Born, No complains , Nice hotel in the old part of Barcelona cross the road from the Arc of triomphe Walking distance to main Rambla would stay there again 
426690,Catalonia Born, our room had a heavy smell some water was dripping down from the ceiling towards the ground of the shower we told the staff about it however no one took care of it for the 6 nights we stayed at the same room also i forgot my bikinis in the bathroom while checking out after around 10 international phone calls and several e mails the only response i got was we are lookign for it it s been 3 weeks now and yet again noone cares stuff is so so careless and oblivious i cant recommend this hotel any more Altough it was my second stay at this place in 2 years i will definitely not stay here ever again , location is good rooms are decent 
426691,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Modern smart chic hotel Not a bad word to say Very clean Friendly staff Good calm atmosphere Thoroughly enjoyed our stay Rooftop pool was a bonus Highly recommended 
426692,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Great location close to everything in a quirky area Awesome staff friendly and always smiling The basic rooms don t come with tea making facilities but when we asked they supplied Rooms bigger than average for Europe 
426693,Catalonia Born, There was an issue with the air con and even when fixed it wasn t really cool in our room , Bed really comfy Good location lovely little bars and restaurants close by Preferred this location to those closer to Las Ramblas Quiet hotel with rooftop pool which was great to have a dip after a long day of walking 
426694,Catalonia Born, Breakfast was a little disappointing the hot food wasn t really hot at all but the cold selection was very good , Overall the room was very well appointed the staff friendly and helpful and the hotel was reasonably well located with excellent facilities 
426695,Catalonia Born, Nothing Wish I could have spent a week there It was hard for the driver to find the street but I loved the location , The personnel at the hotel were fantastic Checked my luggage at 10 30am toured all day came back to friendly greeting perfect clean fresh room where I refreshed for dinner Gentleman at desk made two recommendations for dinner which was fantastic Slept 9 hours Enjoyed a fantastic breakfast and when I returned after another day of site seeing they opened the bar for me and servered me two of the best ever mojito Loved my stay Very professional team 
426696,Catalonia Born, Shuttle airport transfers would have been good as we didn t get dropped off at the front of the hotel as it is in back streets , Great location The staff were very friendly and helpful
426697,Catalonia Born, As above sorry, In arrival the first woman at desk was really unfriendly not a great welcome thankfull the young men the next day were warmer we had come from another hotel and it was interesting to see the difference in attitude makes a big difference when staff are friendly just a smile doesn t take much
426698,Catalonia Born, Breakfast menu could be improved also noisy from hallway in the romm , Nice place where to stay close to the city centre Very comfortable room for first time for me in bathroom shower and bath 
426699,Catalonia Born, The climate control was not good Either too hot or too cold Although we paid for an upgraded room our travel companions got the upgrade but we did not , The staff was amazing Friendly and helpful They gladly moved us from our room when the air conditioning in the hotel went out Breakfast offered a good variety of food Good location 
426700,Catalonia Born, I can always find something negative if i want to but this Hotel was really exception The only annoying thing was Smell in Reception Smell just for some specific Air Refreshing Rest all was simply amazing , I think the best location in Barcelona Everything was very near I took taxi 2 times only Airport to Hotel and Hotel to Airport The Staff at reception was amazing very friendly and supportive The Hotel design was very impressive Generally everything was positive I highly recommend this Hotel 
426701,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Great location helpful but unobtrusive staff El Born is a fabulous area of Barcelona to explore Plenty of cafes and bars close by including a small convenience store Friends stayed a few blocks away paid a lot more for their room but I think this hotel was better Breakfast catered for my husband and myself who are gluten free so that was a real bonus Highly recommended 
426702,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The hotel is in the El Born district and close to good restaurants etc but it is still a seedy area and you have to be on your guard for pickpockets etc We did not feel safe unless walking with our group of friends The staff were helpful and the room facilities comfortable Close enough to some of the attractions especially the hop on hop off bus 
426703,Catalonia Born, perhaps slightly overpriced , Have stayed here four times as daughter lives around corner Location for all sightseeing is excellent Hotel is spotless clean Staff very helpful and cheerful Pool area great for relaxation 
426704,Catalonia Born, Not enough Electric outlets in Living room Just one We took the TV plug out so we can both charge our phones cam battery every evening We waited more than an hour to check in was really bad after the flights and looong day of arrival Small welcome desk can t deal with more than one arrival They offered us free drink while waiting though Pool is really small almost private The view is very close to other building Not quiet at late mornings Too close to street even we been to 5th floor , Clean Inviting room every day when we came back The location is great 10 minutes from Placa Catalonia through nice environment and small inviting streets 3 minutes from Arc De Triumph Staff was nice Great bath and shower pressure In front of the hotel Amazingly great Tapas Bar Elsa Y Fred Don t miss it 
426705,Catalonia Born, Soundproofing could be better , Location is fabulous Easy walk to central attractions Staff are very friendly and helpful Room well finished to a high standard 
426706,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Very good comfortable hotel Helpful pleasant staff Ideally placed for bars restaurants tourist spots and parks Would certainly stay here again 
426707,Catalonia Born, Nothing, Comfy beds friendly staff excellent location Clean and always smelt nice Towels cleaned every day paper provided and little touches such as a chocolate left by the cleaner 
426708,Catalonia Born, Nothing really alot of things are of personal choice , The staff were very helpful friendly especially Alex The rooms were very clean Close by the metro line 2 great bars opposite the hotel are open til late at night 
426709,Catalonia Born, The single beds move if you try to sit up in bed with back to the wall The double bed was actually two single beds put next to each other The staff was either not well trained or not aware of the level of customer service the hotel management wants to offer Here are couple of examples I asked for extra tea bags and creamers at 8 am in the morning there were only two Black tea bags and creamers for three of us staying in the family room The receptionist told us the housekeeping will come at 9 am and supply will be replenished then Upon emphasising the need this person consulted another staff and agreed to send the supplies immediately I enquired about booking a cab to airport The person at the reception told me there was no need to book a cab He said cabs are available round the corner and can be got in no time Not satisfied I again inquired later to another person at the reception He pulled out a booking sheet and put down time cab was required and room no He said he will book the cab I wonder why different responses from different staff , The pluses were good location cleanliness good breakfast with large variety and all amenities and supplies that you expect in a good hotel The bathroom was very good with hand shower rain shower bath tub and bath curtain We had a comfortable stay 
426710,Catalonia Born, The noise especially late at night coming from guests in other rooms and also outside was a bit of a bother , The building was beautiful and the location great The staff was very helpful 
426711,Catalonia Born, A little noisy at night from the passage behind and the construction at the front in the morning but we knew this before we came and it wasn t unbearable and the construction site didn t start very early , The location easy to get around Barcelona from here and the park nearby Lots of nice restaurants close by Bedrooms were comfortable staff helpful and a nice ambience throughout the hotel 
426712,Catalonia Born, pool on roof is a pool in name only it is barely half a regular pool long and at most fits two people wide if that Very poor view of only a neighbouring building s construction area from my window , Location close to Arc De Triomphe and the Gothic town room clean with suitable amenities multiple elevators to get you to different floors AC worked very well
426713,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The hotel is in a very good location close to the Gothic Quartier Arc de Triomp Parc de Ciutadella and metro station As such it was extremely easy to visit the city center and move around The staff was great always providing help answering questions on touristic issues and friendly The rooms were very comfortable clean and spacious It was a nice experience and I recommend the hotel 
426714,Catalonia Born, As it is in centre some Windows not providing to street but simply straight to next buiding May be this could be specified during reservation , Hotel very close to city centre and in walking distance to beach 
426715,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The Suite room on two levels was comfortable and well appointed Location was quiet and excellent for exploring Room service was friendly and efficient 
426716,Catalonia Born,No Negative, The hotel is just about perfect in my opinion Walking distance to Las Ramblas Train Stations and all the attractions but off the beaten path enough for you to enjoy a good night s sleep when you are in town The rooms are very comfortable and the wi fi is speedy as well as reliable There is a large comfortable bed and the staff is extremely accommodating The breakfast is also very good it was on special for 10 euros when I was there and worth it But all around there are great places to go Also don t miss the restaurant across the street It s outstanding Overall I couldn t be happier with this hotel and can t imagine staying anywhere else in Barcelona 
426717,Catalonia Born, Nothing not to like fantastic, The hotel was well located to access all areas in Barcelona very close to the Arc de triumph metro and the staff at the hotel couldn t do enough for us all particularly Alex on reception who was polite and nothing was to much trouble The rooms were comfortable clean and tidy and clean towels on a daily basis We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast was both continental and cooked with plenty of choice for even the hungriest visitor 
426718,Catalonia Born, No real dislikes if I wanted to be picky the hot breakfast was on the lukewarm side at times but this did not stop us enjoying it , Superior bedroom at front of hotel was very well equipped and comfortable The standard of housekeeping was excellent and we loved the large walk in shower 
426719,Catalonia Born, Needs better soundproofing in the rooms You can hear everyone in the internal corridors and stairwells as well as adjoining rooms We were warned about the noise from public and external areas but even quieter alleyways were quite echoey Choose an internal room if possible We had to keep the window open at night as the aircon did not cool the room it only heated , Modern decor and excellent central location Breakfast was good Fresh baked croissants 
426720,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Staff were lovely welcoming and helpful especially a lady called Deborah that is one of the receptionist she is lovely Great location the bed was really comfortable and I find it hard sleeping in other beds Good value for money I would also recommend the hop on hop off bus tour by Julia 2 great bus tours again good value for money we did it over 2 days which was brilliant There is so much to see I loved Barcelona and will definitely go back and stay at this hotel 
426721,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Excellent service Staff very friendly and helpful Huge bed and very comfortable Breakfast at 10 euro excellent value all you can eat including cooked Location excellent for Gothic Quarter
426722,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Everything was wonderful except for the lack of air conditioning in our room Was a bit stuffy at night but overall this was an excellent hotel with attentive and friendly staff 
426723,Catalonia Born, No thing I did not Like, The Staff members are highly polite and welcoming The location is very near to every thing I may need They have 2 computers and a laser printer in the lobby free to use that helped me so much Thank you 
426724,Catalonia Born, The bar could do with a little more selection of drinks as they only did one beer Also I thought the breakfast was very expensive at 16 per day per person There was an offer on of 10 when we stayed but we decided to go out each day to eat , The hotel was in a perfect location only 10 minutes walk to everything Excellent value for money spotless Also rooms cleaned everyday 
426725,Catalonia Born, I think my only complaint would be that the internet was disconnecting as soon as device was inactive which was a bit of inconvenience as I had to keep checking my phone to receive messages through whatsapp and skype , The staff was very polite nice and professional Rooms are neatly decorated and quiet They also have really good breakfast buffet As a vegan I was happy to find soya milk and choice of jams spreads and fresh fruit 
426726,Catalonia Born, Didn t notice any , Staying was on my birthday Administration gave a free champagne in the room Liked the option to order food from nearest restaurants to room without additional fees 
426727,Catalonia Born, The outside temperature in Barcelona was 12 degrees but the room temperature was 27 Reception advised that the air conditioning did not work at this time of year It was difficult to sleep as it was so hot I reported that our kettle did not work and was told someone would look into that they didn t I asked for an iron and was told they d look into that and I received an iron about 10min s later why they couldn t have just said Yes to my request for an iron I don t know When we booked out two days early to go to an alternate hotel that provided rooms rather than saunas we were asked why we were going early and the staff didn t even bat an eyelid when we told them why Shocking place how it is 4 star I will never know Spend a few Euro more and get a decent room nearer the centre of Barcelona ,No Positive
426728,Catalonia Born, When we arrive there was still building work going on in the room next door a drill was being used until 5pm on the Friday I personally don t think you should have guests stay while there is building work happening next door , Great location and walking distance from everywhere 
426729,Catalonia Born, We arrived January 27th the temperature was around 16C So the room was warm heater was turned off and AC did not work So we opened the windows to let some cool air in That night we got eaten by mosquitoes We talked to staff and they informed us that ac did not work in winter months I would not book there again unless it was a cold winter , Staff very friendly and help full The place is located in a great neighbor hood Place is clean and updated 
426730,Catalonia Born, Wrong advice from reception meant a wasted journey to magic fountains 15 return cab fare which were closed for maintenance They suggested it to us but really should have been aware of closure , Location perfect Stylish hotel with some rooms being refurbished while we were there will be even better when all done Nice room on 5th floor Little noisy if window open but expect that in central city location 
426731,Catalonia Born, staff weren t very friendly and not overly welcoming Room was basic shower was a bit old school with a cheap looking shower curtain in the bath , location was very good near the main districts easy to walk around from the hotel Bed was huge and very comfortable
426732,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Great hotel Super well located Only 15 minute walk from Plza Catalunya and even if you dont wanna walk theres a metro station 2min away from hotel Super friendly stuff specially Alex who gave me great advice 
426733,Catalonia Born, Room was very stuffy Air con was blowing out hot air because it s winter so made it difficult to sleep as it was warm , Was easy location to find Staff were lovely and stay was enjoyable
426734,Catalonia Born,No Negative, We stayed for 4 nights in one of their suites The staff were outstanding and went above and beyond to help us The room was lovely with a very comfortable bed especially for the price point The location was SUPERB Everything is within easy walking distance There is also a metro station on the L1 red line just 2 minutes walk from the hotel AWESOME PLACE
426735,Catalonia Born, The walls from our room to the corridor are extremely thin you can hear people walking and shouting I wouldn t normally put this but it was a big issue as couldn t sleep well Kept being waken up by people passing by our door , Location is perfect very central Just two minutes away from gothic square Staff are outstanding and very helpful 
426736,Catalonia Born, None, Stayed at this hotel a few times and it s always been good we arrived on Xmas day the checking in man was very helpful I had forgotten my passport but he was able to trace the information from my last stay Breakfast buffet is very good 
426737,Catalonia Born, Half an hour waiting at reception to check in this happened every evening Room badly maintained like tiles missing in the shower Bar and breakfast space uninviting , Room on the inner court yard was quiet Room and bathroom were spacious 
426738,Catalonia Born,No Negative, One of my favourite hotels in bcn It was our 4th stay here Good location friendly staff nice clean room with comfortable bed and kettle good wifi excellent value for money in December excellent restaurant Elsa and Fred is across the street
426739,Catalonia Born,No Negative, Staff were really helpful and spoke fantastic English great for advice help on what to do where to go etc The hotel also gave us a free bottle of Cava 40 and brought it to our room for my girlfriend s birthday Location is also ideal walked everywhere 
426740,Catalonia Born, Not a lot It would have been a lot nicer if my room had a view, Great location in the old town but really close to a convenient spot where a taxi can drop you Nice staff comfortable and large room
426741,Catalonia Born, There was a building site exactly opposite the hotel Maybe I missed it but I didn t see any information leaflets regarding things to do in or around Barcelona Not in the lobby and also not in the room , The hotel was situated in a very good location although the beginning of the street itself is not very nice The room was really nice with a small balcony It was well taken care of People at the reception were friendly and helpful 
426742,Catalonia Born, A little difficult to find Make sure your taxi driver takes you right to the hotel Ours dropped us off in pedestrian only area and point up a street We were actually still 20 mins walk with luggage to find the hotel Lesson learned , Execlent area for walking to the gothic area and all around the Rambkes area Lots of history packed into this area Staff was friendly and accommodating 
426743,Catalonia Born, I reserved at the Catalonia Born after the H10 Art Gallery cancelled my reservation I would have given this hotel a 9 10 if it had not been with an issue we had with the room temperature We stayed in October which would usually mean you do not need AC but the heater was keeping the room way too hot You probably would suggest to open the window which we did The problem was the mosquitoes where so many when you opened it that we got bitten all over the body and even in our face I would not have expected the team to have a solution for this on the first night but in a four star hotel I would expect by the second day something like a fan could have been provided to make our stay better Everyone was nice its just no one solved the problem I can expect this of a 3 star hotel but not a 4 star , Our room and bathroom where a great size on the bigger side and the location made visiting the Gothic Quarter and old city very easy The hotel staff is very nice an polite
426744,Catalonia Born, Very bad smell in the bathroom from the day I arrived Very poor soundproofing you can clearly hear people walking and chatting in the corridor The cleaning lady doesn t hesitate to enter your room in the morning when you are still asleep No view at all Very few electric plugs to recharge your computer and devices The bed is not particularly confortable for a 4 star hotel , Great location in Born spacious bathroom including bathtub and shower for a double superior room 
426745,Catalonia Born, Nothing really bad to say , Great location lovely pool roof deck and a bathtub Place across the alley was perfect for breakfast Easy subway taxi access by the arch just yards away El Born is definitely the neighborhood to pick 
426746,Catalonia Born, The bar area seemed more like a corridor , Cleanliness of the room and roof terrace Simple comfort Easy hotel to base ourselves at for touring Barcelona 
426747,Catalonia Born, Room was small for the size of bed , Everything very clean and comfortable Great location Staff were very helpful Rooftop pool and deck area were a nice plus 
426748,Catalonia Born,No Negative, We arrived after midnight but despite that the taxi driver was cheerful and delivered us safely and the receptionist was expecting us and made us welcome Spacious room and bathroom lovely white cotton sheets very helpful staff 
426749,Catalonia Born, Everything was positive although the breakfast was a little on the basic side and relatively expensive for what was on offer , The location was right in the heart of things and the suite was clean and well equipped Staff were friendly helpful and polite 
426750,Catalonia Born, On the first day we went to breakfast later in the allocated time slot and most of the cooked breakfast was cold The staff did offer to cook us fresh hot eggs instead which was nice There is free wifi but it didn t keep connected for long enough to do anything online however they have PCs in the bar for guests so we were able to book tickets etc , The staff at reception were extremely helpful and very friendly We had to check out at midday but our taxi to the airport was not until 8 30pm but we were still welcome to use the facilities 
426751,Catalonia Born, Room doors slam loudly which was a bit annoying , Close to metro opposite an excellent restaurant Friendly and helpful staff Rooftop area is great to have available 
426752,Catalonia Born,No Negative, We really liked the hotel and enjoyed our stay in every possible way the staff was really friendly and helpful breakfast was just amazing and the location of the hotel was great as you can reach out to places like the Palau de la Musica Catalanya Picasso Museum etc in 5 min of walking Next time we go to Barcelona we d love to stay at this hotel again 
426753,Catalonia Born, The only little issue was drinks service at the bar was very slow during the day They had to phone round the hotel to get someone to serve , Rooftop pool was lovely
426754,Catalonia Born, Overall location near the Arc was very good but the hotel itself is tucked away on a side street , Hotel was in great condition Breakfast was good The staff was polite androfessional 
426755,Catalonia Born, Didn t like the price went thro the roof for conference weekend So I had to relocate Still No complaints from me It s excellent, Nothing more to say Wonderful hotel Staff Location All way above standard for me 4 th time to stay
426756,Catalonia Born, We had to pay upfront upon arrival The staff weren t unhelpful but didn t get a great sense of friendliness off them We literally did check in and check out with them , The room was spotless and the bed was huge Very near the Arc de Triompf metro station and very close to one of the hop on hop bus tour stops A few streets down brings you to the Ribera neighborhood which has lots of bars and restaurants and shops More local and less touristy area 
426757,Catalonia Born, First we got a room at the first floor but it was smelly and it had just a tiny window to the interior court We asked for another room we received on at the 5th floor and it was a much better bigger and full of light room but the rooms next door was being redecorated so in the morning there was a lot of noise knocking and loud voices of the workers The price was kind of big and they charge extra for the breakfest , Location almost in the Gothic town and very close to the Arc the triumf Rich healthy breakfest 
426758,Catalonia Born, Nothing, Walking distance to beach port and las ramblas Clean quiet room with spacious terrace area Small pool area adequate for relaxation after lots of walking around the city
426759,Catalonia Born, One particular bar staff member was very rude and blatantly ignored me several times , All queries and information was given promptly and with a smile and small banter something i enjoy we needed to change rooms and it was done swiftly woth no problems Everything was dealt with amazingly Thank you 
426760,Catalonia Born, The double room that we had was really small although they were mentioning that it was 15 square meters big They have asked us to pay the first minute we arrived there with the bags on our hands When we said that we were not aware of this booking com send us confirmation that we will be asked to pay DURING OUR VISIT THERE and I have to mention that they already had our credit card as a guarantee With impolite way they told us that we have to pay even BEFORE we will go into the room We have asked them to see it first They agreed but they told us to leave the bags at their desk It was so embarrassing and the worst first experience I had at a 4 star hotel In addition 3 out of 4 people working there were not in the mood to help or give information that naturally were aware of basic things like how we can avoid the 2 hours queue for museums answer go get the tickets for all your sightseeing at the tourists office at the square nearby The 2 of the 4 days we slept there were people somewhere at the ground floor drinking and talking really loud until 3 in the morning not in a room but outside that is why I am mentioning that , The location is great

426762,Catalonia Born, Problems with check in and prepayment Required company details and would not accept letter of authorisation The booking was prepaid to help a solo traveller who was travelling on business In the end the solo traveller had to pay the hotel and the prepaid amount was refunded to the company account but it caused a lot of distress to the traveller, Good Location
