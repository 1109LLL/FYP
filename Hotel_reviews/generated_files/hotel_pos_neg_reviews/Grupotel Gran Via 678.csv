332279,Grupotel Gran Via 678, breakfast could be much healthier and more contemporary ie healthy granolas and nut milks room was dark as it faced on to the courtyard , great location quiet comfy rooms where i slept like a baby
332280,Grupotel Gran Via 678, There was a slightly odd damp smell in the room, Hotel is in a good location within walking distance of the harbour Pool was great to cool down after a hot day walking around Room was compact but had everything we needed for our stay Shower was good
332281,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Was a little bit further out than what we liked The room wasnt cleaned one day and i had to go to reception to ask for loo paper No apology from staff which annoyed me We were told the reason the room wasnt cleaned was due to the fact we had put a Do Not Disturb sign on the door which we hadnt Also on checking out i think we were overcharged for the mini bar use i wasnt given a receipt We were in a rush so didnt challenge this so just check what your charged when you depart if you have used the mini bar I think there are better value for money hotels more central , Good location near bars and restaurants About a 15 20min walk to top of the Ramblas and 5 6mins to nearest tube Welcome drink on arrival Hotel very clean and tidy and a small pool outside to cool down in on a hot day 
332282,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The pool photo is taken from a very good angle it is a very small pool But nice enough , The balcony and view was perfect The shower was also lovely 
332283,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The air conditioning in the room was useless On full and the only place that was cool was directly on top of the A C Rest of the room stinking hot The parking for your car is in a public car park adjacent to the hotel It gets very busy during the day Our hire car was damaged whilst parked in this car park Just be wary, The breakfast buffet was amazing Pool was deep and cooling for the extreme hot days No trouble finding a sun bed and with the beach just a stones throw away perfect position Great nightly entertainment Teenage kids were amused with the morning afternoon games run by the hotel s friendly games co ordinator Staff were friendly and very helpful on the front desk and in the bar areas pool 
332284,Grupotel Gran Via 678, the pool could have been bigger and a bit clearer as was bit cloudy but it was also very hot while we were there, the staff we friendly and helpful always saying Hola every day the staff s english was excellent breakfast was great Location was fantastic close to everything but just slightly off the beaten track
332285,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Looks more inviting on photos than it actually is Lack of charm and soul Four stars is an exageration , Clean and comfortable Offers everything you need on a basic level 
332286,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The pool is small and shaded by about 4pm but we knew that when booking We were not disappointed , The staff were very accommodating the rooms were comfortable and very clean The shower was brilliant the location was fantastic 
332287,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The room was tiny smallest in all our trip We had to empty out our luggage No laundry facility near by and a small fortune use hotel service I think it is cheaper to buy new clothes then wash them which is crazy since there is a hostel nearby teribly small sink in washroom as well there has to be a laundry mat nearby but we never saw one The pool was essentially a lage tub We went to see it but didn t bother mind you all the chairs were taken no one was using the pool just lying around it , The staff were good helpful Thape breakfast was good lots of choices Good central location Stand up shower only 
332288,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Happy with everything but the Internet were too slow, I had many questons before i visited you you were very helpful over Mail And both me and my friends were happy with you the room especially the cleaning and Good location 
332289,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Could not fault the staff or the premises Went back a week later just to pop in and say hello , Our whole stay was fabulous we were upgraded to a room with deck poolside Complimentary champagne at reception on arrival The buffet breakfast included was amazing Set prices for lunch and dinner were excellent value 
332290,Grupotel Gran Via 678, One of the female managers Not welcoming at all Rude and aggressive , The hotel was lovely Breakfast was nice and fresh Modern amazing look and feel All staff were so welcoming apart from one Which I think was a manager That lady was extremely rude and abrupt 
332291,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Nothing, Have stayed in a few properties over the years in Barcelona but this is by far the best yet We received a fantastic welcome at the property and had a very welcome glass of cava whilst we were being checked in Our room was spacious modern and the beds were of the most comfortable I have slept in We had a lovely city view too Also loved that there was tea and coffee making facilities in the room and a packet of crisps and a biscuit Would highly recommend this property for a stay in Barcelona 
332292,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, lovely light room we had a top floor terrace room and this was excellent Nice bottle of cava on ice for our arrival Excellent will definitely stay again 
332293,Grupotel Gran Via 678, A small swimming pool the pool area lacks sun light not good for sunbathing because it s not a rooft top pool and is hidden by neighboring buildings that block the sun also there was no extras like a spa or sauna I would expect that for the price and stars Also no free slippers again higher star hotels provide this also it s hard to completely relax because the sound of the doors slamming in neigbouring rooms comes through into my room and the cleaners are outside the rooms from very early making it hard to have complete silence and relaxation , The bed was comfortable the shower was big and fancy The air conditioning worked well and made my stay comfortable 
332294,Grupotel Gran Via 678, A microwave would have been nice and a kettle for those who don t drink coffee You can request a small kettle at reception , Location was pretty central particularly to La Rambla area This is a great area to shop and also eat as there are restaurants bars and coffee places everywhere The city tours buses all start from this area particularly the hop on hop off which are worth doing to get an overview of the city The hotel was spacious and very modern includes a buffet breakfast every morning A lovely welcome was a bottle of wine in the room with glasses this was complimentary the wine was chilled in an ice bucket on arrival The room was spacious with a large balcony which had small table and chairs plus 2 sun lounges for us Hotel also provide guests with dressing gowns and slippers For those who like coffee the hotel provides you with a Nespresso machine and pods which are replenished daily
332295,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The beds we requested a 1 king size bed and we got one made out of 2 beds wasnt very comfortable to sleep the noise was terrible people would come late and smash doors speak loud at late hours There were only 30 or something TV channels we didn t watch TV much even though we stayed 9 nights The fridge in our room didn t work properly it didn t cool anything we had to ask for ice every night Also when we booked the hotel we requested a room with terrace just to find out that they don t have any rooms with terrace available and if we want one we have to pay extra that didn t seem fair because it was an option we could choose when we booked our room The walls are very thin you can hear what the neighbors are doing lol , Close to everything
332296,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Breakfast wasn t worth the money Bredroom wasn t soundproof like they said We heard lifts going up and down all night and people chatting in the corridors very loudly , Friendly helpful staff
332297,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Size of the room in the advertisement 20 sqm in the reality 12sqm size of double bed is also good for one person , Friendly polite personal and location 
332298,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Rooms rather small Full stay must be paid upfront upon arrival Not all the staff speaks good English , Modern and classy Very clean Gorgeous bathroom Nice breakfast buffet Great four course lunch at unbeatable price 
332299,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Swimming pool a little small , Great location Friendly helpful staff We were upgraded to a superior room with terrace at no extra cost Good choice for breakfast Comfortable bed Ten minute walk to bus station to get express bus to Grand prix circuit Would recommend 
332300,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, Although the rooms are on the small side they are well laid out and very well finished with everything anyone requires The bed and pillows I found comfortable The en suite had a great shower The staff were super friendly and helpful 
332301,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The room on the road side was noisy at night The air con didn t work but we kept forgetting to mention it to staff I m sure they would have sorted it , Fantastic location Friendly staff Modern and comfortable 
332302,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The shower was sub par and the shower head didn t really work that well , The staff was incredibly friendly and the lobby area was very clean and sleek
332303,Grupotel Gran Via 678, This is def not a 4star hotel 3 at best price was to high for what it was constant hammering and drilling for 3 out of 4 days we were there very annoying You can hear everything as the rooms are so close and we apparently had a superior room, Balcony good size if we had the weather to use it
332304,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Room with three beds was very cramped Could barely get around the room It was the same size as a double room with three twins squeezed in Very very thin walls we could hear when the neighbors came home took off their shoes dropped them on the tile floor Then decided to have a conversation that lead to an argument that went on for some time all at 1 am while we re trying to sleep to get up at 5 30 to meet train This for 189 for the night way too much , The ladies at the front desk were very nice and helpful We were early for check in and they offered to keep our bags Attentive gentleman tagged them all and put them in a locked closet for our return Enjoyed a sangria at the bar 
332305,Grupotel Gran Via 678, There was some noise in the early hours as the bins were put out for collection otherwise there was nothing else we could fault The final issue was not with the Hotel but with the Taxi driver for the return journey to the airport he took us on the scenic route via the Port area which was obviously longer and took more time The final bill for the return journey was 37 euro which was nearly 10 euro more than we paid for the arrival journey The big tip here is to agree the fare in advance as stated above it should have been no more than 30 33 euro , We got straight off the aircraft walked to the Taxi stand and and got straight into a Taxi for the Hotel The price for the Taxt transfer was listed in a prominent position and at the time of this review the fare was just under 30 Euro one way The hotel was in an excellent location the interior was spotless and the the staff extremely polite and helpful The room was of a decent size and again was very clean the bed was also very comfortable We didn t book the breakfast with the room it was listed on the Booking com website as being 15 euro per person and a subsequent e mail from Booking com offered it at 16 5 euro s which we though was somewhat expensive and opportunistic Upon asking at the Hotel we found the breakfast was only 12 euro per person which is quite different The breakfast turned out to be of a very good standard with a good choice both continental style and eggs bacon etc 
332306,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Evening dining pretty much on our own the night we are in the hotel, Location excellent Staff helpful Hotel chain we use in Majorca so we knew it would be good Good breakfast
332307,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The furniture is really old worn out and not taken care off The food in the restaurant is really bad We ordered a hamburger and that meat was not even eatable Terrible From there we did not eat anything else there not even breakfast There are many small coffee shops near buy that have really good options as well as restaurants and bars When you enter the Lobby it smells like sewage and perfume to try to hide the smell That is the first impresion of the hotel , The location is the only good thing we appreciated on this hotel 
332308,Grupotel Gran Via 678, na, Excellent staff upgraded room was fantastic and clean with great views from terrace food was excellent Hotel was centrally located for main areas and only a 5 minute walk to las ramblas 
332309,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Terrible and arrogant waiteres Very small room Uncomfortable bathroom Amateur staff etc No bathrobes No slippers Pool for the ducks, location is not bad but be sure you can find much cheap room easily
332310,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Strange bathroom window they had to check me in and out many times because we changed the booking They were unable to consolidate to make the stay simpler ,No Positive
332311,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The mattress wasn t very good The pillows were too soft and thin The rugs on the laminate floor should have anti slip backings , Quiet room Tea coffee making facility Complimentary toiletries and vanity set Good quiet air conditioning Excellent breakfast with something to suit everybody including gluten free Excellent shower wet area with pull down seat is a great idea Reception staff friendly and helpful Good hotel foyer seating area with free newspapers and books 
332312,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The bed was broken and I should tell the desk staff 2 times before to get it fixed, The location is excellent and for me is just in front of the office just perfect This week the price was really convenient and it was a very good value for money 
332313,Grupotel Gran Via 678, I am not sure how small a pool could be to be classed as a swimming pool Our legs ached with all the walking , The hotel was clean and in a good central location to explore the fantastic city experience along with seafront Breakfast provided a good choice and some good restaurants close by Quiet at night 
332314,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Breakfast was very poor We paid about 12 euros They ran out of eggs mushrooms bread plates cups We asked and eventually mushrooms arrived and they were cold We should have gone to the cafe around the corner instead Staff were working very hard,No Positive
332315,Grupotel Gran Via 678, After checking in the staff sent me an email for further control on my credit card number which I used before to confirm the room This happened even if I asked them weeks in advance whether the people who stayed there neede to exhibit my card and they said no , Great position
332316,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, I really enjoyed staying in this Hotel The staff is nice the rooms are great Its not too small like a lot of people say Its clean and the bathroom is perfect and I can really recommend the laundry service The location is also perfect Its not even 5 mins to all shops and still in a quiet area I will definitely come back 
332317,Grupotel Gran Via 678, A bar bill was added to my room number which I did have I was really upset about that as I paid all my bill at the bar on the same day and had all my receipt I think that bar receptionist should checked guests I D on the list before adding the bill to your room as the person even put a signature that doesn t even correspond mine I think the staff need more training regarding this matter when they order something, Staff was really lovely hotel hygiene very clean good location 
332318,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Room door didn t close without a push and failed to lock from inside , Free upgrade to comfort room Fabulous breakfast Helpful friendly staff Comfortable bed Tea coffee making facilities in room 
332319,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The wifi signal was rather weak in our room The hotel should improve this point , The hotel is relatively close to La Rambla Welcoming drink was ok The rooms are quite big and the bed is comfortable The bathroom is well equipped and quite spacious The staff was very helpful and friendly 
332320,Grupotel Gran Via 678, It would have been better if there was more information provided on the restaurant at the hotel Also some English TV channels in the hotel room would have been nice , The room was nice and big with an extremely comfortable bed The staff were friendly and the hotel was in a great location 
332321,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The toilet door is the only thing it didn t quite close properly but that s it , Great location friendly helpful staff and a great room for our money 
332322,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Location was not bad but it would still take some walk to get to the more central part key transport hub , Our three single bed room was sufficient with good facilities and bathroom Our room on the 3 F and facing the main road was not too noisy and we had a good sleep Staff was also very friendly 
332323,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The walls are paper thin meaning you hear everything including the really loud cleaners every morning Also next door had the world s loudest squeak on their door so we knew their every move , We didn t spend much time in the hotel as we were out exploring but what we saw we really enjoyed Staff were very friendly and the rooms are very spacious Can even listen to music from the TV in the bathroom through the speaker in the ceiling 
332324,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The hotel and decor is a bit stale and you can get something much nicer for the same money and in the same location of if traveling for business but not for leisure no gym , Free glass of cava upon check in good location

332329,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Manager at reception loud rude and told me and my 80 yo mother and wife we could wait in the lobby if we keep it down She received us with grumpy face No one bothered to help us with luggage or with wheelchair access She also was rude and loud with her staff which made us very uncomfortable Ordered room service twice food came cold Never again will stay in this hotel very unfriendly for families ,No Positive
332330,Grupotel Gran Via 678, absolutely nothing all was excellent but we would ask for a bigger room with a terrace next time , Staff so friendly from the second we arrived The glass of prosecco was a lovely touch 
332331,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Room size Lack of space Not even a luggage rack Had to leave my luggage on the floor The place looks run down with stained carpets and a ripped couch in the main reception Way overpriced for the quality offered , Nothing much really I travel quite a bit on business and this hotel was a let down 
332332,Grupotel Gran Via 678, we booked this hotel because we want to have terrace pool with nice view But the terrace was on the second floor inside the building Pool closed at 6 PM, Good location nice large room Very good breakfast Parking during weekend in front of the hotel on the street was free

332334,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The size of the room it is very small If you are unlucky and have noisy neighbors it is very likely you will hear them through the walls, Location very good city center and close to public transport multiple bike rental shops Staff was very friendly Pool was small but nice

332338,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The room key card if kept by your phone wiped so you couldn t use it a very small matter but if this could have been mentioned when we checked it it would have been helpful , Our room was upgraded automatically we were offered a welcome drink on arrival and the staff were very helpful in directing us around Barcelona 
332339,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Room was a bit tight for a three person occupancy as things where moved and out of line with beds to lights , Good location not to far from the heart of the city but not to near to be disturbed with noise and hussle and bustle of city life

332344,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Given wrong room that was already occupied Tiny pool and could only use later in afternoons when it was quieter Felt embarrassed having to ask for the welcome drink that we were told would be given on arrival , Central

332350,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The layout of the VIP rooms The bathrooms were made cramped by the design the shower was amazing but leaked all over the floor wherever you angled it The patio door is directly by the head of the bed so people can see in to you in bed sitting on the bed Would be so much better if it was at the foot of the bed , Helpful friendly staff Hotel very clean Good soundproofing Great location of VIP rooms with direct access to pool area 
332351,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Pictures of swimming pool are not ok Swimming pool is very little and only a few people can sit there So don t choose this hotel because of the swimming pool THe distance to the metro is ca 500m that is a lot when you travel 5 days to museums beach shops etc There was no facility of showering in the afternoon because my flight departed in the evening A 4 star hotel always has a room available for this service Price quality is not ok , Breakfast was fine great choice nice service Fine bedroom with airco great bathroom 
332352,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Fridge wasn t working and wasn t repaired same for the shower tray We were charged 5 euros for booking a ticket for la segrada familia without any notice A drinks bill we have never seen before was signed on our behalf This was refunded but still you don t expect this to happen in a 4 star hotel In all fairness I would not recommend it , Located 15 minutes from plaza Catalunya 
332353,Grupotel Gran Via 678, There should be proper fridges in the room we had one that rather gave off heat than cool but was very kindly replaced on our first day however was just as useless as the previous one we have been advised that these are not fridges but rather keep cool boxes so we were stuck with that This was only really a problem for us because we needed to cool our son s milk 1 5 year old The pool is very small and hasn t got many loungers they were all occupied whenever we attempted to go down there so ended up not being able to use the pool, Excellent location to explire all areas also great transport links Lovely room great food from the restaurant and never before experienced speed with room service Staff very helpful and polite Great terrace and fantastic views over Mount Tibidabo from 7th top floor fabulous sunsets

332356,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Food is not good in this hotel both quality and price wise staff at front desk need a better training on fundamental hotel business like learning to greet the guests rather than stirring at them when guests arrive except Kristina who was very good , Location and the rate is great 
332357,Grupotel Gran Via 678, I felt for us it was a little further from where we wanted to be However we walked pretty much all of the time, Friendly service and great terrrace room

332361,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The pool is small and in the shade in the afternoons the sunbeds are comfy but don t have the padding on them like it shows in the photos our shower door didn t close hair dryer didn t work outside lift didn t work and a few things could do with some updating but still kept clean , Great central location Cava on arrival was a nice touch very comfy bed powerful shower quiet hotel reasonable priced drinks friendly and knowledgeable staff Lovely downstairs outside section to have a drink

332363,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The swimming pool was a little different to the pictures but still a nice addition only go in the morning though or you won t get any sun , Breakfast was great we were very impressed with our bedroom and enormous shower The location was good too I d stay here again 
332364,Grupotel Gran Via 678, everything was great no complaints, The free bottle of cava was great and the view from balcony was excellent Worth upgrading to a room with a terrace

332366,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Only a small point but the shower door didn t work properly causing some difficulty when exiting the shower and the bath struggled to drain Rm 703 , A glass of bubbly on arrival was a nice touch The sun terrace on our room was very relaxing and private The bed was very comfortable 
332367,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Walls are thin so I could hear lots of people on all sides all night I would not take a group there Breakfast was too expensive , Great facilities and staff
332368,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Breakfast was good but other food was lacking quality and choice , The croissants were extra sticky and yummy The bed was very comfy but the desk area small No chair for a second person to relax 
332369,Grupotel Gran Via 678, There was only a couple of English channels and only news The snack we ordered was practically inedible probably the worst toasties ever made No complimentary snacks or refreshments in room apart from tea and coffee but no milk , Comfy beds spacious bathrooms powerful showers free champagne in reception 
332370,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The shower, Great value and quality welcome lunch delicious breakfast good sized room and spacious bathroom friendly smiley staff Shower was poor but over all very pleased 
332371,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Provided a bigger triple bedroom it was a tight squeeze with the additional bed in a standard room , Fab location for exploring Barcelona The hotel was great value for money I would definitely recommend breakfast Didn t use the pool but it looked a great spot to relax take in the sunshine whilst sipping a cocktail 
332372,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Not a busy restaurant for dinner so small variety and some meals were good and others only ok Better to take a short walk to restaurants not in hotels , Good breakfast variety and staff are very friendly and helpful 
332373,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The only negative thing I could say is that the maids very noisy early morning not great when trying to have a well earned lie In , Very clean good sized rooms friendly helpful staff and good location 
332374,Grupotel Gran Via 678, No real lobby facilities in this hotel so over priced for room only accommodation Reception staff not very interested , Family accommodation was great 2 interconnecting room Rooms clean and comfortable
332375,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Restaurant did not carry all the menu items the food quality was below average compared to surrounding restaurants , Front desk staff and bar staff took extra steps to make us feel like home I will go back to this hotel again and again 
332376,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The bed wasn t made properly which made it uncomfortable to sleep in Wifi kept turning on and off There was no light in the hall way to our room so we could never see where we were going Also money was taken out of my account the day before we arrived which I wasn t warned about yet I still had to pay the full amount on top of this and when I asked the staff about this they didn t make much sense and acted if they weren t sure what I saying , Brilliant location Bathroom very nice Staff very helpful when asked where to go for dinner and how to get around Barcelona Gave a good map which was very useful 
332377,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Nothing, The location of the hotel and friendliness and always willing to help It was my wifes birthday and I arranged for her and her best frien d to stay in this hotel I notified the hotel ages before arrival it was my wifes birthday and they were so good they made her stay fantastic and rememerable Will definatley book again Thankyou to all the staff for making my wife Karen Newmans trip such a great one Best Wishes
332378,Grupotel Gran Via 678, It s almost 5 6 blocks away from Plaza Catalunya I m a little tired when I was in Barcelona so I didn t like a location of this hotel very well But normally I think its location is fine , Breakfast was so great Very kind and nice people Room and terrace was perfect 
332379,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, I ve stayed here twice First time as a couple second time as a family Great location Ten minute walk to la rambles loads of bars and restaurants within walking distance Food in hotel 14 95 for four courses Can t wait to go back 
332380,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Rooms are a bit small but ok Breakfast at 16 50 euros each was exorbitant for a buffet especially as a request for an omelet was said to be impossible , Staff extremely friendly at reception and the bar staff obligingly put on the England rugby game at a time when some people later may have wanted soccer Also the location was central while being very quiet 
332381,Grupotel Gran Via 678, 2 single bed was uncomfortable, We stay between 02 06 March 2016 in hotel as 80 EUR per night for comfort double room Clean room Helpfull staff Not perfect but good location They were already upgraded the room for baby crib
332382,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, Although compact the room had everything we needed and the bed was really comfy The staff were so polite and helpful from the moment we arrived until we left We plan on visiting Barcelona again and will definitely stay here 
332383,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Issue with beds as requested 3 single beds and got a double and a camp bed which was very uncomfortable for 3 nights , Friendly greeting with champagne
332384,Grupotel Gran Via 678, I can t really say a bad word about this place although I found glassed bathroom pretty weird I would also prefer to have a carpet on the floor as you could hear foot steps of guests from nearby rooms Otherwise spot on , The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful As this was our first stay in Barcelona they recommended us local best attractions and also offered to help with choosing place to eat We were also welcomed with a glass of champagne The room was cleaned every day by every smiling lady cleaned to the professional level Breakfasts were really good and plenty of food to choose from Location just perfect by one of the longest Barcelona s street few minutes of walking from the square where you can get to the El Prat airport 
332385,Grupotel Gran Via 678, They blocked my postepay card at the beginning for secure the payment but it is still blocked And this was a bad thing I m not happy for this But anyway the hotel was really in a good position and was really clean , You can rent directly in the hotel just for 15 a Bicycle for an amazing city tour 
332386,Grupotel Gran Via 678, I asked for a quiet room when I booked the room but I was offered with room right next to the main street The room is too noisy it s like you sleeping on the street And you can clearly hear the steps in the next room ,No Positive
332387,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Unfortunately the bed was very very tiny for a hotel of this category 140 cm wide max for 2 person This was not clear at the time of the reservation There is a metro station nearby and you can feel on the 2nd floor when trains are passing not really loud or disturbing but still , Very good location and friendly supporting staff We were allowed to check in earlier since our plane arrived a couple hours earlier than the regular check in time Also a late check out was offered for free Free wifi everywhere in the hotel with as many devices as you wish 
332388,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, Staff were great advising on tourist attractions and helped by printing online bookings for us They also were very good at providing gluten free breakfast options every day 
332389,Grupotel Gran Via 678, By coincidence I found out that my room price over booking com was almost twice as high as the price that previous guest payed just a day before and I find this fact disturbing Hotel personel didn t even want to discuss the subject ,No Positive
332390,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Pool area was Tiny with loads of flies Having to pay 3 euros a day for tea and coffee The double bed was also 2 single beds pushed together so kept falling through the middle , Hotel good location Staff were friendly And hotel cleanliness were excellent 
332391,Grupotel Gran Via 678, First had to upgrade room to large one the first ones we were 2 couples were very very small We were able to upgrade to larger ones and everything was fine after, Location was perfect Breakfast was very good and empty plates replaced rapidly with new ones from the kitchen Internet worked well Great restaurants and groceries stores close by
332392,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Breakfast charge was very expensive Parking charge was also very expensive and it starts when your booking starts 12pm and by default covers your whole stay If you decide to park elsewhere it will be much cheaper Some of the staff was surprisingly rude the guy that worked there on Sunday afternoon had a very offensive tone The guy at the night shift during our stay was brilliant and very helpful and compensated for the lack of service his colleague exhibited , Near the centre walking to all site seeings 
332393,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, Location is excellent most things are within walking distance from the hotel Excellent customer service very helpful staff They assisted us with maps directions tickets for the Neucamp Also I mentioned in my booking that it was my partner s 30th birthday On arrival we were given a free room upgrade and a bottle of Cava in our room Highly recommend this hotel 
332394,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Rooms are compact for the price and storage was limited but sufficient for a short break and we would use the hotel again We did not use the restaurant or bar so can t comment but the pool is so small it is hardly worth having , The hotel is on one of the main roads through the centre of Barcelona but we were not bothered by traffic noise despite being at the front of the building thanks either to good insulation or being on the 6th floor The metro is a few minutes walk away and the hotel is within reasonable walking distance of many tourist sights and plenty of restaurants 
332395,Grupotel Gran Via 678, No information about parking Fee had to pay almost 100 euros for 3 days Hidden expenses request for a room change as it was different from pics and what I paid for not changed not Happy at all , Location of property
332396,Grupotel Gran Via 678, There was nothing I didn t like about this hotel, Location is amazing staff is extremely helpful and friendly rooms are big clean and comfortable There is nothing that I would change about my stay at this hotel 
332397,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Room was small but we booked the cheapest room so it was expected , Great location lovely staff They let us have a late check out with only small charge per hour which was great cause our flight was late at night 
332398,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The bed was uncomfortable we had springs digging pinging into our backs and if you moved your partner next to you would bounce around Very springy bouncy The bed was the only big negative for us as we didn t sleep very well We didn t use the pool because it was on the ground floor surrounded by buildings and was in the shade for most of the day The pool area looks a lot smaller in real life than portrayed in the photos We didn t mind though because we had our own terrace , We had a superior terrace room room 708 and it was incredible Having our own terrace was the best part we had sun loungers and a table and chairs to sit in the sun and enjoy the incredible views could even see the tops of the Sagrada Try and get a room on the 7th floor with the view The sound proofing was excellent no noise at all from the street due to the double exterior door The room was cleaned to excellent standard every day and the bathroom items topped up daily The staff were friendly and helpful The buffet breakfast was really good It wasn t included in our room price but was only 10 euro 15 min walk to Catalonia square Because you re a distance from all the action you re near the local restaurants that aren t heavily tourist priced so you can enjoy great food without paying a big bill 
332399,Grupotel Gran Via 678, No gym but then again I was supposed to be on holiday so my partner was happy , Staff and location were both perfect They were so accomodating towards us and we even got a free upgrade to a room with a private terrace which was a great result 
332400,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Paid extra for pool terrace Pool looks really nice in pictures but is teeny and terrace is just a second shared deck Not worth the extra money Blonde bartender was not pleasant when we tried to get ice for the room , The room was nice 
332401,Grupotel Gran Via 678, We stayed in the hotel for 2nights then went to Valencia and came back to the same hotel for other 4 nights but they didn t accept that we leave our luggage there They don t have a luggage room , The room size was good compared to Europe but maybe because we took the comfort one The staff was friendly and helpful The wifi connection was very good
332402,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, fast friendly check in excellent room and bathroom no traffic noise restaurant bar very good pool quality furnishing and excellent service all round super clean
332403,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Room that fit a crib was very narrow and small Not a great window view see everyone else s back balconies Pool area wasn t as nice as the pictures we booked the hotel for the pool and location , Location was great close to main city center restaurants and metro 
332404,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Every day something was wrong but they fixed it fast e g water in the rest room safety box room cleaning , Location great breakfast welcome drink at reception 
332405,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Partially frosted glass door to the bathroom Privacy please , Being greeted with a glass of champagne on checking in Breakfast choices were excellent Location was good Staff were very pleasant

332407,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The night receptionist was rude and surly and gave us a very poor welcome The hotel is not in a great location it s a long walk to Ramblas and other good areas It s very average as Barcelona hotels go Some of the rooms looked really bad at least we had a small window overlooking the pool some looked like prisons ,No Positive
332408,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, We had an early arrival and even though our room was not ready the staff took good care of us and kept our suitcases for the day so that we could enjoy ourselves 
332409,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The rooms are so tinny standard ones that you can get real clausthrophobic in them and the bed was sooo small that we couldn t get one good night sleep I wouldn t recomand this hotel to anybody , The location 
332410,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Nothing, From the moment we arrived to a welcome drink at reception the hotel facilities and staff were outstanding The staff in particular in every role couldn t have been more friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble Walking into the air conditioned lobby from the street the hotel really lives up to its motto an oasis of calm fabulous Deluxe room with terrace next to the rooftop pool worth paying for 
332411,Grupotel Gran Via 678, When we arrived they told us we couldn t check in until 3 o clock even though it said on our confirmation that check in was 2 A nice lady at the reception said to us since we Couldn t check in we could go and help ourselves to breakfast or a coffee so we did but this very rude waiter followed us an shouted in front of the whole room that we hadn t paid for breakfast and not to touch anything Until he checked with reception Got a complimentary bottle of champagne sent to the room but because we didn t drink it the first day they took it back off us we had to ask at reception for it back Some mornings breakfast was a bit cold it seemed like when they were topping the items up they put the hot ones on top of the cold ones Also me and my family had a 3 course meal one evening in the hotel when we asked for the bill we were told they do not expect debit cards only cash even though they expect card in the reception didn t think this was acceptable for a four star hotel, Hotel was a great location it was only a five minute walk to the main part but nice an quiet where the hotel was situated Free wi fi was great rooms were spotless and the beds were so comfortable
332412,Grupotel Gran Via 678, One of the rooms air conditioning was not working properly and in the other room the safe was broken Both were reported to reception but neither were fully repaired WiFi didn t always work , Excellent breakfast which included gluten free bread Comfortable beds and clean modern rooms Good location 
332413,Grupotel Gran Via 678, the detour through the breakfast room to the pool the reliability of the Wi Fi, The location of the hotel the space in the room the design of the room

332415,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The room was exceptionally small there were only a dozen sun beds we only managed to use them once You were only allowed to ask for a towel for sun lounger once and had to use it for the duration of your stay , It was very clean and lots of hot water 
332416,Grupotel Gran Via 678,No Negative, Reasonably central Barcelona About 10 min walk to Plaza Catalonya Easy access to taxi Sagrada Familia is about 10 min taxi ride Good Breakfast choices Excellent service and staff
332417,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Air conditioning was somewhat faulty We like our room cold but at most the room dropped a couple of degrees from room temperature which was 26 27 degrees , Excellent location close to city centre clean friendly staff varied breakfast and great facilities 
332418,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Pool was okay small but still did the job of cooling us down in the hot heat No negative comments , The staff and hotel was so lovely and location was great Was a great hotel with a great view overlooking Barcelona Food was great price and really nice great value for money 
332419,Grupotel Gran Via 678, Bed was bouncy when myself or partner moved felt like on a water bed, Hotel position was good close to plaza catalyna close to walk las rambles plenty of places to eat and drink nearby
332420,Grupotel Gran Via 678, The price for a family room was very expensive especially when we found out they were 2 rooms in fact with interconnecting doors The pool photos were very misleading and the pool itself had cigarette butts and paper in it so my son did not swim there The bar area was untidy , We know the area well and so liked the location
