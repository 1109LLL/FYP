222352,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The steaks in the Marco Pierre White restaurant were nice but we have had better and more tender steaks elsewhere We didn t complain because they were edible and tasty it s just that the brand advertises superb steaks and we felt that the steaks we had fell short of excellent Also the room was not made up on the 2nd day until we asked , The hotel had a very nice atmosphere and the staff helped in this matter The staff at reception and in the restaurant were first class The housekeeping was excellent as well My wife and I liked the room design in that it had ample hanging storage drawers door hangers and was a well proportioned and ergonomically designed bathroom

222364,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The music in the bar area on the Friday evening was far too loud We came back to the hotel after a meal out to talk with family and it was very difficult to be heard , Great hotel great location as we were meeting family in Islington Lots of space in the foyer and good public space which we enjoyed the following morning Very clean great staff 
222365,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Disabled bathroom facilities meant using the washbasin was difficult without kneeling down as it was very low and there was no shelf above for toiletries Bed was uncomfortable , Room was a decent size with plenty of hanging space Buffet breakfast was excellent although queuing to make toast was a bit of a pain when the rest of your breakfast was going cold A rack of toast provided to the table would be better 
222366,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Can t fault anything , Excellent location The perfect place to stay if you want to be within walking distance of great pubs bars and restaurants We ve mostly stayed at Hilton hotels in other parts of London but I think we ll be checking in the double tree Hilton Islington from now on whenever we visit London for work or fun Absolutely lovely hotel cool classy clean and in an ideal location Courteous and friendly staff Look no further 
222367,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, No shower cap and walked a long way to get to our room A bit impersonal , Well located and helpful staff most of the time We were there for 3 separate nights twice we found it brilliant the 3rd time we went back it seemed a bit disjointed and chaotic tho the girl checking us out was fantastic It served its purpose but nothing special Room was very clean

222374,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, It was not an issue for us but maybe for others was the view from our room which was a dingy car park, Thoroughly enjoyed our stay staff were friendly and helpful Hotel very clean and breakfast was kept stocked up all through service 
222375,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, My only gripe was that the bath water was only warm whatever the time of day Shower always had nice hot water though, Spotlessly clean spacious room and great breakfast

222380,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I found the hotel bar a little noisy but it was a Saturday night and the bedroom was quiet , Attentive and efficient staff You get a warm welcome and the impression they want your stay to be enjoyable Comfortable room of good size for London these days The pricing is competitive with other hotels in the area of similar quality although ALL London hotels are overpriced Comfortable bed Close to London Underground station Angel Northern Line bus stop right outside the hotel short ride to Kings Cross St Pancras and Euston railway stations in one direction or the heart of the City of London in the other direction 
222381,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, No free water in the bedrooms iPod dock to play music would have been a lovely extra, Free warm cookie on arrival is lovely truly unique Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries were very good

222383,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, We regrettably had a broken night s sleep on this visit due to an intermittent noise sounded like distant fireworks strange popping noises throughout the night and into the morning We didn t mention it to the staff during the night not really much point and as staying only one night wouldn t have wanted to have to move rooms in the early hours We did mention it to the receptionist on checkout and received an immediate apology and offer of free breakfast they were also going to send someone up to the room to check it so very good response to the problem , We have stayed at this hotel several times and the fact that we keep going back there shows that we find the hotel generally very good We will be booking there for our next visit also The rooms are very comfortable the staff excellent and we find the location to be very handy for what we want to do with bus and tube options for getting into central London Just a short walk away there are numerous restaurants bars and shops should you not want to move far 
222384,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Early evening meal very poor Fish and chips fish batter should be light and crispy ours was inedible like a wet blanket and the chips were chunks of potatoes fried to make then chip like Very disappointing , Service and friendliness of staff was excellent
222385,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Great hotel great service but they really let the side down with really poor blow dryers At 150 per night one would expect an up to date blow dryer with a NOZZLE this one sounded like it was about to explode ,No Positive

222389,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Could not use the requested bath as tap faulty and water only tepid This was most disappointing as I had suffered a fall the previous week and was looking forward to a soak This apparently was not the first time there had been a problem with the taps in this Room so I really do think staff should have checked the water was running hot when they prepared it , The prompt response from staff maintenance and their attempts to rectify the hot or rather lack of water problem When they could not solve it they offered a drink at the bar or free breakfast but we declined as had already had sufficient and plans for next day too with friends elsewhere
222390,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, REALLY didn t want to get out of the bed Ridiculously comfortable lol, My stay at the DoubleTree by Hilton was absolutely amazing The staff were exceptional the room was immaculate extremely spacious with a bed I REALLY didn t want to get out of Breakfast was more than excellent value amazing quality with a wide choice of items for every diet taste Best hotel I ve ever stayed at I will definitely be back

222392,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The lift door didn t stay open for us to get in when someone got out on our floor possibly because another one was already open with people entering it Confusing and then no response from any lifts so we took the stairs , The controls for the heating and fan were effective There was no noise even though the hotel is close to a major road We liked the location as we could walk to the train stations we had travelled to from and to the family were visiting and the local town centre
222393,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Room was a tad on the small side wifi wouldn t connect as my device said not secure , Comfortable room good staff service Nice bar area Welcome cookies a nice touch

222395,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, No still water in the room But that s just me being super picky , Cookie on arrival was a lovely touch Really great hotel with all the facilities you would want All staff were really amazing Which is a such a lovely point of difference from other London hotels I would definitely stay here again 
222396,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Was in an accessible room bathroom very uninviting feel for those that have to use these facilities and this was on a Hilton HHonours floor, Location excellent for my business
222397,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Some things in the bathroom could do with a refurb and our room door would not open on several occasions and we had to get help too get in but this was dealt with immediately , The location is fabulous and lots of places to eat and drink close by Nice spacious rooms and well furnished The warm cookies on arrival are a nice touch and the bottled water etc in the room is good too

222399,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Staff rude and did not sort things out fast Room service and mark restaurant food terrible Caused both me and my partner upset stomach and toilet problems Overpriced food and a terrible standard Check in too late and breakfast terrible, Location
222400,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The breakfast was too expensive compared with what other hotels charge in the area , Very nice hotel clean and the staff were very friendly Check in was easy and because it was prepaid made the whole thing stress free 
222401,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Provided with map from hotel to find car park we drive around for 2 hours looking for it it s completely out of sight under shopping Center and no signs in the end we paid a taxi driver 10 to show us advice better map better instructions, Just about everything
222402,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Random people using the late bar facilities who were not residents of the hotel and being a nusiemce to the people who had paid for a room, Great location
222403,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Breakfast was nice however fairly simple for the price and had some noisy guests running through corridors but can t be helped beds were super comfy would like to be able to wash my hair in the bath with an extendable shower head , rooms stylish and clean enjoyed a nice relaxing bubble bath which was lovely Wish I d stayed longer 
222404,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The bathroom was a little compact but can t fault it otherwise , I asked for a nice view and got a great view of the city skyline at night Very much appreciated 
222405,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Staff were really friendly on check in However my room key didn t work and it took longer than I would have liked to rectify The original staff member who was with colleagues but no customers told me to wait for someone else who then suggested it was my fault for putting it next to my phone or something Seriously I held it in my hand between the reception and the elevator just apologise and fix it don t fob me off onto another colleague and then make it out to be my fault , Good value rooms available if you can book in advance Modern clean an easy and comfortable place to stay 
222406,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington,No Negative, The Location was good for us this is the 2nd Double Tree we have stayed in and did not let us down The cookies are great The staff were very friendly and helpful
222407,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There wasn t really anything bad if I m completely honest, I loved the free cookie as you walked through the door and the staff were really helpful in helping me to park my car in the cheapest place possible The hotel was in an ideal location in that it was only a 5minute walk from Angel tube station The room was lovely and cosy and when me and my girlfriend got back from our first day out even though I hadn t left the towels on the floor to be cleaned they still gave us fresh towels and gave the room a general tidy
222408,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I wanted toast before bed and that seemed very difficult Only one member of staff the bar man obliged I was very grateful , The bed was better than I expected
222409,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There was only one hiccup at breakfast on Saturday Morning where the buffet had run out of bacon and sausages creating congestion around the buffet area Staff did all they could to alleviate the congestion but the replenishing the bacon and sausages took too long and most went without, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Bedroom was very comfortable and no Traffic noise could be heard from the busy street outside Location is quite central and a 10min tube ride to London Bridge A short walking distance to great pubs restaurants shops and underground tube station at Angel 
222410,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There was a faint smell of smoke in the corridors at times in our room The price of breakfast , Very comfortable hotel in a good location with lovely staff The warm cookie upon arrival was a lovely treat too

222413,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, It was very very warm Tried to use aircon but you turned it cool for it to hit a temp and it then increase again My 28 week pregnant wife and I must have seen every hour throughout the night We gave in at 6am and put the tv on , Location
222414,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, No parking There is parking a 7 minute walk away but in the rain and with a case that was exceptionally annoying , Daniella on reception was amazing So professional and ready to help in any way she could She even phoned me on my mobile to check if I had found the car park ok 
222415,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, No left luggage service It is the reason for security I understand but it was a bit inconvenient However King s cross station has this service Don t worry , Great location It is King s cross station and Angel station nearby It was very convenient And everything was clean 
222416,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Location from centre cost in taxis hotel was pricey stayed in better accommodating hotels for less money Only one bath robe Rubbish window view , Free cookies on arrival friendly staff bath and shower bath robe good bar and general food menu 
222417,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The fact we had to keep getting our room keys re programmed to use them was an inconvenience Unable to barely order anything from the bar menu on our return at night snack wise Plus we didn t receive our free cookie on arrival , The lounge and executive lounge Bedrooms ample and comfortable 
222418,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The price , Very good hotel in a good position at 5 min walk to angel station and very close to a bus stop where you can catch some buses to go in a lot of point of interest The staff was very kind and helpfull and the hotel room clean If I ll come back in london I ll look certainly for this accomodation 
222419,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Wifi is not working in the room We are at the last room of the floor but it works when we are at the lobby When I told the staff in the lobby they just think I dont know how to set up and refuse to check the problem and after I come down several times and she gives me a tel no to deal with it I found it too troublesome and we just live here for 2 nights thus didn t call the tel The air con always switched off automatically and in the mid nights we always felt cold and need to get up to switch on again , Bed is comfortable They allow us to keep the luggage for half day for free 
222420,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The pillows The pillows caused me a great deal of stress as I would prefer a firmer pillow or at least the choice It meant I didn t have a decent night sleep either of the nights I stayed I was coming to the end of an extended business trip and returned to work the day I checked out feeling unrested , The breakfast selection was really good although quite a lot of oil in the sausages and bacon The room was very spacious with copious amounts of wardrobe space which is always appreciated As ever the staff are wonderful and always happy to help 
222421,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, No heating on in the room didn t get to bed until 11 30pm and the room was at freezing temp I wasn t told on arrival earlier in the day that I need to turn on the heating system in my room The maintenance man arrived and it still didn t come on until he requested his Manager to resolve the heating problem The duvet was a summer version wafer thin so I didn t sleep for 2 hours until the room heated up I had to put my coat on top of the bed because there were no spare blankets in the room We ordered bar snacks the night before which came an hour later barman under pressure and the snacks were cold My colleague found black hair in the bath and I found a long black hair on my pillow Lovely This is my second time to this hotel the last time I was sent to a room that was empty no plumbing or carpet it was being refurbished I gave their staff the benefit of the doubt and came back I didn t report a complaint This hotel is not up to the standard I expect They gave me a free breakfast which was a small compensation I was tired and exhausted from not sleeping and I had more meetings the next day before getting a flight Not happy , The warm biscuit on arrival raised my expectations but sadly it wasn t enough to compensate for the poor experience Its a pity about this hotel as it does have a good breakfast but the cleanliness and warm room should be the least anyone can expect in the height of winter Very disappointed 
222422,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The air con in the room did mot work and it was very cold in the room as a result we were unable to turn up the thermostate and as a result room remained very cold,No Positive

222424,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Comfort was an issue Whilst the rooms are very clean and the facilities are good we were staying on a particularly cold weekend and because we were going to a show in the evening wanted to spend some time in the room in the afternoon The heating is not sufficient The staff were helpful but could do nothing to improve the system ,No Positive
222425,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, More attention to detail when dealing with telephone requests and room service breakfasts as our order was incorrect , Staff made an attempt to help us though this was hit and miss When we booked we asked for an accessible room to accommodate on of our party On arrival the staff at the hotel appeared to know nothing about this but were able to alter our allocation to give us what we need 
222426,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The bed was too high for my wife I think because it was a room designed for the disabled The hotel did not seem that crowded surely there were other rooms , The hotel was very convenient for what we wanted 
222427,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Room was miles away from main recption took a good 5 10 minutes depending on what floor lift was on to go out for a smoke, Room was clean and big bed was lovely
222428,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, discrepancies in the information received from different members of staff regarding the price of breakfast We were going to book for friends to join us but when I wanted to book a couple of hours later after making an enquiry about the price per head it had more than doubled We didn t bother in the end ,No Positive
222429,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Old furniture usually any hotel provides you with a lot of staff that you need like shaving kit shoes brushes tooth paste but it has only 2 hair lotion 2 body lotions and 2 soaps , Staff only

222431,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Bathroom had a constant running water sound Not loud but noticable but did not disrupt our stay , Beds were comfortable room was clean Executive lounge access was very good value for money complementary food and drink during our whole stay Good location Angel Underground Station is just around the corner Much cheaper than other similar hotels in the area 
222432,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Room was VERY small for a double Lounge and bar area very busy probably due to other functions going on , location and suitability for our needs was very good DID NOT EAT IN THE HOTEL 
222433,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The temperature control unit was difficult to understand and even when I worked out how to use it I couldn t get the room as I wanted it I was freezing the first night morning Some instructions in the room would have been good , Room was large and comfortable bathroom was good It basically met my expectations 
222434,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The noise of a band practicing in the late afternoon was ghastly and reverberated through the ground floor Customer comfort was not considered A meal ordered at the bar created a discussion as to whether they were serving It would have been better if they hadn t it was not good we re both disabled so my request for a taxi was necessary But met with a booking of a private hire car and we were advised that there was a delay ,No Positive
222435,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Breakfast was too expensive You should eat at a cafe around the hotel There were no personal care products as mentioned in the bathroom Toilet wouldn t flush properly , Hotel was in a great location closed to Angel and King s Cross station WiFi was excellent on all the hotel areas and especially in the room The staff were very friendly Room was ok 
222436,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, heating wasn t working it was freezing therefore very little sleep combined with a toilet that wouldn t stop flushing The staff were excellent however and I have been offered a free upgrade for next time, staff
222437,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Not as clean as expected in bathroom Breakfast table not properly cleaned Extraordinary idea that filling up used milk bottle on table used by previous guests was ok for hygiene which it definitely isn t Chaotic at buffet breakfast Items missing utensils missing having to wait while plates and food items were fetched or prepared Uninteresting main course selection in restaurant not worthy if MPW, Very comfortable beds in larger than expected room Very friendly and extra helpful staff Restaurant very comfortable with attentive staff Laminated Menu card however resembled a greasy spoon menu We half expected it to be spattered with ketchup 
222438,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, For a room with three beds only enough toiletries for one, Sheet had odd stain in middle I only realised in the morning and couldn t be bothered to complain
222439,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Only a small niggle was the bed could ve been slightly bigger and an extra blanket in the wardrobe would have been nice as my husband found the duvet a bit light whereas it was fine for me Also the bathroom hand basin was too small for us , The room was lovely and quiet without generators or air conditioning making a noise which is a pet hate of mine
222440,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Bedsheets were old and frayed Shower was worse than pathetic , The staff were lovely on arrival and it looks from the outside like a reasonable modern hotel but even though I was in a renovated room it just looked and felt like a soul less second rate provincial budget hotel Comfy bed though let down by the sheets and it was a reasonable sized room 
222441,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There was no option to have a blanket rather than a doona Given that this hotel is in the UK it was strange that sheets and blankets were not available Also for such an expensive hotel the breakfast did not include barista coffee i e only filter coffee , Hotel is in a good location Room was pretty standard for a large chain hotel 
222442,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, 1 There were no personal care products pcp toothpaste toothbrush slipper razor shaving gel comb 2 The air conditioner was little bit noisy 3 Room temperature did not increase as we required 4 The room had only two bath towels the staff ought to put in a couple of extra towels in the wardrobe or bathroom 5 After all don t worry about that it was oky , 1 Room size was sufficient and comfy 2 The staff were friendly interested and quick 3 You could use the internet in the room and it was successful 4 the location was in zone 1 and you can use underground where you want to go 
222443,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Thought I had booked a twin it was a queen room possibly laid out as a disabled room with one bed Long queues at checkout , Accessibility of hotel from Euston 
222444,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There were Xmas parties on till 1am without any prior warning I was on the 2nd floor despite requesting a higher room which has too much noise from the road and street during the night , The rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was fine 
222445,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Staff entering my room in the morning when I m asleep Do they not know when you have checked out The constant noise outside my room by the cleaners in the morning didn t help they really need be be more considerate to hotel guests in my opinion Not everyone checks out at 8am , Cookies on arrival
222446,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Need could have been more comfortable and the room was very noisy a combination of a bathroom fan that never went off and proximity to the lifts , Staff were really helpful 
222447,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Mix up with my room and other parties in my group at reception and check in was at 2pm but room was not ready till after that , Great size beds One reception girl in particular was very good Overall staff very welcoming 
222448,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The carpet had nail tacks sticking out so easy to stab your toes when going from bedroom to bathroom Was reported to reception but wasn t fixed when we returned to room Reported again on checkout so no idea if attended to , The location is good being just a few minutes from Islington tube Quiet hotel at night so able to get good nights sleep 
222449,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, breakfast room was so busy noisy understaffed it would have been more relaxing to have breakfast in the baggage claim area of Heathrow airport, Staff was extremely helpful rooms are clean late check out was possible
222450,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The breakfast was stupidly expensive so we had breakfast at McDonald s We had booked a room with breakfast included but when we got the confirmation email it was a double room FOR ONE PERSON ONLY So once that was sorted we found out there was no breakfast included We were so frustrated by this point we didn t try ringing back and just had the room for a lot more money than originally shown which I m guessing is because it was now for two people not one , The hotel was not too far from the tube station It s great that you can leave your bags at the hotel before check in after check out we wish we had taken advantage of this instead we had to walk around London for a day with our suitcase We thought we d be able to leave it at Kings Cross We had a lovely meal in the restaurant Very good food 
222451,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Breakfast was chaotic and badly managed No eggs or tomatoes left at 10 45 yet still 15 minutes to go Nobody checking Water for tea was lukewarm Waiter didn t bring orange juice and milk to the table on day 1 but did on day 2 Not acceptable Booked a deluxe queen room but didn t get one After a lot of hassle eventually managed to get them to agree a refund which they then forgot to deduct from the bill Also had to wait 3 hours after contracted check in time to get room at all HOPELESS , The Marco Pierre White Steakhouse is superb for dinner but not open at lunchtime 
222452,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The carpet upon arrival into our room was soaked and heavily stained The shower pressure was minimal even on max The shower tub creaked alot also The beds moved easily you could not even lean on them And the room was freezing even when the heating was put up to 26 , The staff were friendly The room was big and comfy Location was perfect 
222453,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There was mold on the bathroom ceeling I asked for another room and got another room They told me it was an upgrade for the mold but it was the same size room the gave me discount for the room and free 4 drinks and breakfast Sorry it was not enough I did not feel well for some time after sleeping in the room A hotel should not rent out rooms like this , Breakfast was ok
222454,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington,No Negative, Whilst when we arrived friday evening we got a disabled room because no other were left apparently we were a bit disappointed However Filippo working at reception was very responsive and helpful the morning after we got a much better room The breakfast was great too 
222455,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Cooked breakfast wasn t great Bacon undercooked fried eggs over cooked , Great location for Islington and also Euston Station Really nice room Very comfortable bed and lovely soft pillows Continental breakfast choice good
222456,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There are both newly remodeled and older rooms at this hotel We stayed in both and found that the older room was a bit worn but okay , We enjoyed having access to the executive lounge It was worth the extra cost The breakfast and evening snacks served there were tasty and generous 
222457,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The card in the bathroom mentioned a lot of complimentary items such as razor shaving gel comb etc however we never saw them in the bathroom this was not a major problem since we had our stuff with us anyway yet I wonder why the management offered something when they didn t provide it The room had only two bath towels which is a bit difficult to deal with when one of the guests has long hair and thus needs two towels herself The management really ought to put in a couple of extra towels in the wardrobe , The hotel is close enough but not too close to Kings Cross and the Euston Road artery You can be in central London Russel Square Victoria station Covent Garden etc within 20 30 mins on the Northern line and the buses I agree that they are slower nevertheless they are more comfortable since you don t have to breathe in the bottled air and stand in a crowded tube can take you there too Angel has excellent cafes pubs and restaurants We had all the meals there There are many shops and the normal brands of supermarket and a proper market Chapel Street St Mary s and St Silas s churches and Sadlers well theatre are nearby Buses 207 73 and 30 stop right next to the hotel Angel tube is a few minutes walk away Check in and check out were smooth The room was spacious for London clean and tidy and the soundproofing was excellent Proper controllable AC was present in the room Excellent staff gave us all the time when we took a extra time to check out They also have 24 hour manned front desk we came back in the wee hours of the morning D 
222458,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Booked for a triple but only toiletries for 2 on first night although extra towel found in wardrobe, Location good and easy access to the tube Hotel prices reasonable and staff very pleasant
222459,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Although the cookie on arrival was nice I would have liked some biscuits on the tea coffee tray in the room to have in the morning , All the staff were particularly nice and helpful The cookie on arrival is a welcome touch 
222460,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Nothing they can help it s just a chain hotel that doesn t have a soul, A convenient place to stay in Islington not too far from the underground There s also a good bar around the corner 
222461,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The bed was comfortable but the pillows were too soft and offered no support Asked for additional pillows which arrived the same day but could ve done with being firmer , Staff were friendly and responsive Rooms were clean and tidy Food at Marco Pierre White s Steakhouse was excellent Close to underground Angel and not too far from Kings Cross Station 
222462,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington,No Negative, We were going to a concert in Islington so this was an ideal hotel Very close to Angel tube station Nice large room with comfortable beds with good sized bathroom Good staff at reception friendly and efficient Ideal for a stop over in London

222465,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There was not really anything we didn t like , Warm friendly atmosphere as we arrived Helpful staff and excellent location for main centre and Islington itself Rom clean and bed very comfortable 
222466,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The location is quite central but if you intend to use the tube you will habe to change at Kings Cross or Euston for most of the trips It is time consuming buses are a good option there are plenty to go to the center, Staff at the front desk was very helpful they fullfilled all our request for he room and also provide assistance in terms of restaurants and bars If you plan to stay around the area Angel is a great option to go out at night many restaurants pubs and bars to choose from
222467,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Taxi driver missed the entrance and took a while to get back round to it but that s the worst thing I can think of, Everything as good as you d expect 
222468,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The quality of food for room service was poor I had hardly warm tasteless pasta It took reception ages to answer the phone from the room , Good breakfast selection I had a problem with my TV remote control and reception sent someone immediately who changed it for a new one without any fuss Excellent location and a spacious room 
222469,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Rooms are incredibly small we got a triple room that was a single bed plus another bed of half size of a king bad really small for 2 adult to sleep I have booked based of the website wichc state triple room and thinking that the space was enough I would have mind spend a little more but 400 pound for 3 night and what we get is very much on the poor side No wonder when we check out nobody at the front desk dare to ask any question of our stay, Excellent location
222470,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Not enough towels and toiletries left for three people in triple room Had to request for more, Location was great Overall a pleasant stay Breakfast was very good

222473,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington,No Negative, This is such a handy position to be in Islington is full of trendy bars and restaurants and some quirky shops The station is a short walk and buses run regularly With an Oyster card it is incredibly handy Could not fault this accommodation 
222474,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Nothing If you want a better room i e larger with a view I expect you ll need to upgrade , Very comfortable bed although a small room on the bookings com discount offer but we only needed a bed for one night so no problem with this Great location for Angel City Central London Shoreditch etc

222476,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, on arrival after 22 hours traveling the front desk receptionist advised me no access to my room until 02 00 if I paid 30 pounds per night for my 3 night stay immediate access to the room this shaped my impressions of this hotel and I felt less inclined to use the hotel caf etc I tried the hotels breakfast no plates and limited food , internet speed security 
222477,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I didn t dislike anything the towel ring fell off the bathroom wall when I put the towel back I reported this and it was sorted out straight away excellent service , The location the cleanliness and the comfortable bed Staff were polite and efficient No complaint at all

222479,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Service behavior from a male staff person at the bar in late evening was nonchalant and arrogant Finally served by a friendly female person Also a room almost without a window and towards a shabby backyard ,No Positive
222480,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, quality of the room was nothing special Food was terrible poached eggs with my starter still had runny whites no one likes that burger was too hot to eat but the fries were only just warm how do they do that No table check in fact no service at all for over 45 mins as the staff were too busy no drinks offered no puds or coffee offered I had to chase to pay breakfast was way over priced self service rubbish buffet style with everything cold half a cup of coffee offered after 20mins you get a better service at premier inn for a lot less Why can hotels not go back to the days where a chef actually cooks your breakfast and it s hot This is the hotels last opportunity to impress a guest it s the last thing we remember they should make the effort would not use Hilton again , not much really location as it was close to where I needed to be but no parking and way over priced 
222481,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The view which was not very good was balanced by the fact that city lights and sounds were not a problem Breakfast in the dinning room was a bit hectic , The room was good but the view was not but it was quiet and cool enough The bath room had good lighting and the shower was excellent The warm weather was on in London so the air condition was wonderful 
222482,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Very comfortable bed for 2 if a little on the small side, Staff very friendly and helpful on arrival Got a room at the back which was very quiet for this part of London A good location for Islington events and music pubs such as the Lexington etc A short walk to Euston station
222483,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Dreadful dinner in the restaurant for which refund was issued Marco Pierre White Really Very noisy bar area and rather surly barman Hospitality tray rather stingy considering the price , Excellent location for our needs Spacious and comfortable room Front of house staff friendly and professional Free wifi Nice to have good iron and ironing board in the room Surprisingly quiet area for central London Wonderful Chapel Market nearby with proper market traders very local feel coffee shops and a very useful M S Also a Bill s restaurant in White Lion Street just a couple of hundred yards away where we had an excellent meal Very convenient for Angel underground station

222493,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I liked everything , Ricardo originally from Portugal was the concierge who greeted us and helped us throughout the stay He made the experience so much better and welcomed He gave us recommendations on places to eat and visit and told us about how London compares to other cities Every night we d get back to the hotel looking to see if Ricardo was working The important aspect of it is that we d have honest two way communication It felt as if I was catching up with an old friend who wanted me to have the best experience while in London 
222494,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The bath width was approx 8 inches wide before it started to slope making it impossible to move At 37 weeks pregnant this was dangerous , Bed was very very comfy location perfect and staff amazing

222499,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Bathroom requisites that weren t available from the maids eg shaving kit shower gel sewing kit etc all stated as being provided on a card in our room Did report to reception who kindly offered a beverage from the bar but we were leaving to connect to our transport Everyone was friendly and our stay very comfortable and convenient Thank you ,No Positive
222500,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, We were told we could park the car for 18 for 24hrs in The Business Centre and N1 centre This wasnt correct We parked at Business centre on arrival and it was very expensive so we complained at reception on checking in We had to go and move the car to the N1 car park which was 18 24hrs reception said they would pass on the complaint so on checking out we asked the outcome to which we were told there wasnt any feedback When we arrived home we had left my husbands spectacles in the room I called the hotel reception who said they couldnt help but would transfer me after being transferred twice and waiting 15 mins on the phone i gave up , Bar area

222504,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I had booked a Triple room but the only room available on arrival was a double room with access for the disabled this was not clearly explained So the lay out of the room was strange the double bed was small the shower was inconvenient and the sink was tiny , Good location for exploring areas in North London Close to great bars restaurants
222505,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Nothing could have been better , The staff were amazing always happy to help Not too far away from the tube and a bus stop round the corner Roof top bar next door We will definitely stay here again

222509,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, One of the receptionists could have been more helpful when my travelling companion sought a charger for his iPhone He got the impression that the receptionist wasn t really interested in dealing with the query , Ideally situated just a 15 minute walk from King s Cross this is a splendid hotel with very comfortable and spacious rooms I d also recommend sampling the bar which is pristine in its condition and offers wonderful refreshments 
222510,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Breakfast a bit expensive also fire alarm went off and woke us up although hotel did apologise we expected at least a free breakfast, Only 15 minute walk from Kings cross station Perfect location near bars restaurants and a shopping centre Hotel very nice and clean cocktails were 2 for one before 7 Thought breakfast was a bit expensive due to the fact that you could get a three course meal for one person for five pounds more 
222511,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Tube station at least 10 minutes walk away Unable to get any food at 23 00 hours not even a sandwich at this hotel No restaurants open close to this hotel at night , Warm chocolate cookie on arrival was a nice touch 
222512,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, A hair in the porridge was disappointing On the first morning breakfast was chaotic and we had to wait a while to be seated and everything had run out The poor staff looked frazzled Didn t live up to the recommended score Receptionist on checking in was curt but everyone else was very helpful , The beds were very comfy towels and toiletries were nice and most of the staff were lovely 
222513,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Nothing, Everything about this hotel was excellent from the moment we arrived Friendly courteous staff couldn t have asked for better Will definitely stay here again

222515,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Noise I really hate being able to hear someone else being in the toilet in the next room Decor I have to say was a bit tired , My double room was spacious and bed comfy Love having an iron and board in a room 
222516,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The area was good for us for proximity to St Pancras but might not be ideal for all tourists , Breakfast was good Beds were good Solid functionality of rooms and contents 
222517,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington,No Negative, Excellent all round property close to Kings Cross Station bus stops right outside Neighbours onto vibrant Angel with its fantastic restaurants and cafes Friendly helpful staff who made our stay very pleasant 
222518,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The toilet wouldn t flush and it took 3 hours for someone to turn up to fix it in the morning we needed to checkout We had to ask for another room key which they did provide on the other side of the hotel but they didn t really seem in a rush to help and we didn t get an apology for the delay or inconvenience , Hotel is good value for money
222519,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington,No Negative, For what we needed this hotel was perfect nice area but close to St Pancras for my early start the next day staff informative and helpful and the restaurant was very nice with good service Thank you 
222520,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, unfortunately no 24 hours room service but that s only a problem if you arrive late like me, very friendly staff amazingly soft bed and pillows felt like sleeping in a cloud accessible rooms plus they gave me a delicious cookie upon arrival felt very welcomed
222521,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The size of the room was smaller than I expected , The staff were beyond helpful when I lost my bag They checked us in quickly and were available at all times 
222522,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Sheets were not fitted and did not have a sufficient tuck in so they came off during the night No bottled water in our room, Location was really good for us Very quiet
222523,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The water in the shower had very little pressure and the room was smaller than it appeared on the photos Breakfast was not great powder eggs and lukewarm bacon and sausages Alcohol was only served for two hours and due to high demand very little supply , Warm cookie on arrival and executive lounge to relax 
222524,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Our room No 514 was rather small perhaps this is normal for London The price for breakfast was much too high We went to Bill s in White Lion St instead only 200 yards away They are excellent , Location good Hotel facilities excellent especially the heated mirror in the bathroom which prevented it steaming up so you could have a shave easily 
222525,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Our only complaint was that when we needed to print something their computer bizarrely didn t have a mouse Also whilst everything was great it was quite pricey, The bed was very comfortable The room was lovely and complimentary cookie went down very well 
222526,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There s only one set of shampoos and cleansers and even slippers for a triple room But it is fine for me as its more environmental friendly, I have stayed in a triple room for three nights The room was very comfy Great location lots of chained restaurants bars and sipermarkets around and just 5mins walk from the Angel station very friendly staffs they even served you welcoming cookies I will definitely recommend this hotel
222527,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington,No Negative, Excellent location staff sad value for money and we were upgraded to an Executive room Warm cookie on arrival is a great touch Also very handy for Kings Cross and a great range of restaurants in your doorstep 
222528,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I fell out of the bath before using any soap or shower gel as the bath was very slippy no non slip mats injurying my finger my finger thankfully it could have been a lot worse, nice and clean staff really nice 
222529,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, the scrambled eggs and bacon were tasteless shame as the rest of the breakfast was outstanding , the staff were very friendly efficient and sorted out the payment that mucked up the room was clean and we ll equipped lovely bathroom and shower 
222530,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Would have liked the bathrobes and slippers on first day of stay rather than second , Loved the welcome cookie Staff very accommodating and any requests eg a sewing kit were dealt with promptly Very comfortable bed and room great cooling system 
222531,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Our room was a fair walk from the lift at the back of the hotel however I explicitly asked for a quiet room so perhaps that is why I wasn t complaining about that , Warm chocolate cookie on arrival friendly staff helpful staff good breakfast great location quiet rooms decent sized room very clean and tidy room
222532,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Booked a room for 2 adults expected a Queen bed ended up with double bed in a disabled room asked reception if there were any other rooms no was the answer I suffer with a bad neck and found I could bend over the low wash hand basin in the bathroom also the bed was small and hard , Clean room and staff at breakfast were good
222533,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Woken up by building work next door Felt rushed at breakfast by table being tidied away before we had finished Bad service received when collecting luggage didn t feel secure , Warm cookie on arrival happy helpful welcome Friendly staff in bar area nice food and drink Lovely room 
222534,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Shower could have had a shower pipe rather than being stuck to the wall , Bed and pillows where extremely comfortable Didn t get a chance to taste the food

222569,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Parking is not on site and directions to the parking location was not the best and we ended up parking in the wrong lot and paying 18Lbs to get out, Loved the pub across the street from the hotel Great food at a great price 
222570,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The hotel is very conveniently located in zone 1 with easy access to the city centre The rooms have all mod and cons and are very comfortable Free luggage storage facilities , The standard is more that of an Inn than a DT by Hilton There was an extremely long walk to the rooms through various corridors and no offer to help with luggage I had 3 big bags arriving from a long haul international flight Half of the toiletries were missing in the bathroom The duvet was very thin there was not extra blanket provided and I felt cold in the middle of the night although it was April London was experiencing winter temperatures I was extremely unimpressed with the payment procedure I was asked to both pay on check in and then again when checking out leaving it unclear if payment had been taken once or twice The offer to contact them again in case of double charging is not my idea of customer service procedures should be clear 
222571,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Cleaners only changed bed sheets one day and had to phone for toilet rolls and spare towels Also had to phone for milk replenishments When left customer feedback card manager didn t comment on complaints, Close to Angel tube station and walking distance to kings cross Rooms very clean

222576,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, This is more a personal preference than anything against the hotel but I always like a king size bed so I never get as good a night sleep in any hotel room with the wife when theres a smaller one At the price a pool would also be nice but that s London prices for you , Very clean tidy Staff helpful prompt with requests to room Nicely located 5 mins from tube Islington High St which is great for cafes 
222577,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, My view from the room was not the most picturesque but some rooms have to have unappealing aspects and there was nothing terrible about the view just mundane with an undeveloped area which no doubt will be used for building at some point Other rooms would have had nice views of the charming houses opposite , Breakfast very good everything you could hope for and more Overall a very smooth and comfortable stay Very near to bus and tube stations Difficult to understand the room rates which seems to change from day to day on booking com but ended up with a satisfactory cost for a good hotel in a good area with very good breakfast included There was no hard sell either so I didn t pressured to take extra services but they were available if you wanted them There were lots of notices saying to let them know if anything wasn t right with a promise they would put it right which was re assuring though I had no cause to complain at any time 
222578,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Fridge didn t work Light was on but we didn t realise it wasn t cold until too late , The room was a good size and well appointed with comfortable bed Plenty storage and hanging space Warm but not stuffy as we could open window Excellent bathroom with space to move and big shelf Shower easy to use and towels big and good quality Communal lounge very pleasant although bar prices expensive

222580,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Unfortunately some hotel basics weren t completely as they should ve been First the room we stayed in was reasonably noisy particularly a lot of sound came in from the corridor Second the shower was never really comfortably warm Unfortunately the reception staff didn t ask about our experience when checking out so we weren t able to bring this up , In general it s a nice place to stay good breakfast nicely decorated spacious and clean rooms Friendly personnel Comfortable bed Angel is a nice area to stay definitely worth checking out I hadn t been in that area of London before 
222581,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, waited an hour for our meal at Marco Pierre White restaurant we were given a complimentary drink each but steak was not good waitress was faultless apologizing continuously whilst waiting for our meal , excellent breakfast cannot fault the staff 
222582,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Staff on reception were variable female staff were excellent male very snooty Very noisy in the morning when I was trying to work at the desk recycling being tipped into a hopper in the courtyard at 8 am made my teenage kids jump out of their skins doesn t signal that my rest is important to the Hilton company It is a very old fashioned attitude in today s competitive climate Hoovering at 7 45 am outside my door wasn t a settling start to a very tense day I paid a similar rate for a top rate hotel recently in London for a single night stay this is a very ordinary hotel with no extraordinary warmth , Very clean hotel Great social area in foyer where I met friends before they were performing at O2 Super Marco Pierre White restaurant in the building With a great value residents price

222584,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Hotel looking tired especially carpets We had problems in the shower area but were moved quickly and compensated for the trouble , location and easy access to public transport especially buses as we find the underground difficult to negotiate due to disabilities 
222585,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Breakfast is expensive Cheaper to eat out especially with lots of restaurants a short walk away , Very comfortable quiet and clean rooms Excellent location Minutes from tube shops and restaurants 
222586,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Actually I would not change a thing , A very comfortable bed The air condition worked The breakfast was excellent The best of all was Claire at the front desk She booked all of our activities for us and gave wonderful suggestions She made our stay extra special

222588,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Nothing, Everything service and the facilities The room was spacious and very clean The room we booked gave access to the executive lounge which was a nice place to relax and enjoy the snacks The check in was very efficient and the warm cookie was a nice touch and tasted divine Couldn t fault a thing 
222589,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Had to queue for breakfast on the Sunday morning We chose this hotel as there was a reduction of 20 for our stay otherwise it s rather expensive , Comfortable bed and room very clean coffee and tea in room just opposite the Angel tube not far from St Pancras Internationl shops nearby Marks Spencer Fat Face GAP etc great selection of restaurants and coffee shops nearby good breakfast 
222590,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I honestly can t find a fault with the hotel , Staff were excellent Room was very cosy and comfortable Location is excellent Room service was very prompt There was no charge for storing our bags on the last day of our stay which is nice as most other places charge a fee The hotel is spotlessly clean from top to bottom 
222591,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Rooms were not clean the carpet was full of dust and of hair There was a strange smell in the room when we arrived The room we got was very small Bathroom very small , Nice location lively neighborhood Staff was vey helpfull and nice Shower was good
222592,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I did not specifically reserve a room with a wheelchair shower and bathroom set up When I arrived the staff person who checked me neglected to inform me this was the sort of room they were giving me The sink was impossibly small and low and there was nowhere to put my toiletries No matter whether you re standing or in a wheelchair the sink seemed too small The walk in shower was alright but it would have been nicer to have a bathtub The AC was also set to cool and it was not possible to change it to heat There was nothing in the mini fridge And room service was only available until 11 00 p m with no vegan options , The room was very spacious and quiet The bed and pillows were comfortable 
222593,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, No apologie for loss of power in our room in the middle of the night Cobwebs in room we stayed in room 475 Poor light in bathroom No ceiling lights , We liked the location The breakfast room was verry pleasant and food berry good 
222594,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington,No Negative, Great Hotel fantastic value for money don t be fooled into paying them Covent Garden central London prices Hotel held our bags 3 hours prior to check in and 8 hours after check out for free which is great to allow that extra time in London

222596,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The bar could ve been open longer for residents , The little touches like warm cookie on arrival toiletries in the room and the location was fantastic Would definitely stay again 
222597,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Towels not replaced on second day Had to request the travel kit and it only had men s deodorant Construction work outside which spoiled the view , The bedding was really comfortable 
222598,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The breakfast buffet was very poorly managed The food was rarely replenished and staff looked like they didn t know what they should be doing , Ladies at reception we re so lovely and welcoming 
222599,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I could not pay by Visa electron so I had to go to the bank In double room is less bed , The hotel near underground station Welcome cookies Pleasant staf
222600,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Small queensize bed was too small for us A kind request for separate beds the second night was turned down because we did not pay enough The fridge was empty both nights not even a small bottle of drinking water Too bad for a hotel that appears to offer equal service to everybody , Location is nice near the tube and student area 
222601,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, We had a king room with executive room access which really was a waste of money Either the non King rooms are tiny or the King room isn t much bigger than a standard Also the executive room is a bleak room stuck on the back which is only open for restricted hours I also get irritated by hotels which don t replenish water tea bags etc for the second night when you pay the same for both nights We only had 2 normal tea bags to start with which meant no tea on the second morning , Clean and comfortable
222602,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Bath base was too rounder and caused me to slip as the shower is over the bath Soap holder is too close to where you stand in the shower ended up slipping and banging my back on the meal soap holder , Decor was modern Close to tube station
222603,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Could not have been better , We found the staff to be excellent very friendly and very efficient and very pleasant We were exceptionally impressed with the hotel We had stayed there a year or so ago under the previous ownership had liked it then but standard was infinitely higher under this new ownership 
222604,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Were given a wheelchair adapted room which means a sink the size of a large shoe no bath and nowhere to put your toiletries Also there were no set times for closing the bar which apparently closed 2 minutes before we showed up each night with no way to serve us a beer though it was still staffed and full of customers , Nice clean and professional hotel with all the amenities you want great beds and super location 
222605,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, We had reserved room for one overnight stay The room was cold when we entered 9pm and no instructions available to heating air conditioning so had ring care link first person who answered didn t know and passed on to another staff member who was helpful and able to instruct us on heating but room was quite uncomfortable to 20 30 mins which si not ideal for young children , Reception staff helpful pleasant and efficient in booking in and checking out

222608,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, We booked this room on a deal 40 off there is no way I would have paid full price for the room as it was quite small and I would not have seen any difference between the room and one in a Premier inn or similar Maybe we just had a small room , Great location and lovely staff very quiet even though on a main road we were at the back Ideal for the West End Camden Islington North and East London
222609,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, We didn t like their response when we told them to heat up some food for us They refused in a very straight upright manner This was the only problem we had, Everything was great about this place No major problems 
222610,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Breakfast a bit pricey had breakfast elsewhere as so many options locally , Easy access to Angel tube station and therefore ALL of London Very comfortable good sized room Vibrant bar restaurant area Helpful and efficient staff Welcome cookie a nice touch 
222611,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, There was a random single bed in the room but the double bed was small Breakfast would have been improved by full size croissants and scrambled egg that was not watery and tasteless , The room was good and fairly spacious 
222612,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Booked as a Queen room only a double supplied problem with hot water or lack of it and miss information on carpark was told a reduction would be given but had to get the token processed at the Hilton went to the Hilton and they said what I was told was incorrect bit embarrassing ,No Positive

222615,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The shower in room 145 was a dribble but probably because it is a disabled access room with a wet room so maybe it s set so it doesn t spray everywhere Breakfast is far too expensive with no option just to order a piece of toast and there s a Wetherspoons 2 minutes walk away which is cheap and cheerful , Travelling with my guide dog Lorna We were made very welcome The reception staff were super friendly and helpful Location is superb Bar meal very nice and a good choice 
222616,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, More tea bags there were only 2 which is a bit mean , Comfortable room and very quiet no road sound or sound from other guests which in the centre of London is quite amazing

222623,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Not a bad experience as such but you can t keep breakfast hot in a self serve buffet same in every hotel it does spoil it somewhat, Very comfortable bed and although we faced the road we barely heard the traffic but we cant say the same for the paper thin walls We heard more noise loud and raised voices at 3 30am in the morning 
222624,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Cheaper breakfast Too expensive when whetherspoons is round the corner Some nice cafe bistros in Islington too, The bed was hard and not very comfy but the room and shower were great

222637,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, I was allocated a room from which another visitor had been moved before I checked in There was an empty complimentary biscuit wrapper on the dressing table and the toilet had been used but was unflushed There was also a wallet of tickets for the Eurostar left on the dressing table which I brought down to reception and asked for them to be reunited with the previous occupier of the room who checked in on the same day as me and was returning home the following day , The bed was very comfortable and there wasn t much noise in the hotel environs The staff were friendly and welcoming Breakfast wasn t included in my stay so I can t comment on it 
222638,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, Slow check in Distant and impersonal service , Location close to bus and tube stops in a nice and quiet part of London Easy and frequent buses stop right outside the door Islington in itself is absolutelely worth exploring Great eateries and good shopping on a string 
222639,DoubleTree by Hilton London Islington, The pillows were very uncomfortable and gave me and my partner both neck ache The cleaners didn t replenish the milk for my tea coffee on our second day stay Room service did not answer the telephone once this was during their serving time but resulted in not being able to get room service and order food from outside the hotel because they stopped , Reception staff were very friendly and helpful Room was ok and had a bath with a reasonable view of London Location just as we required
