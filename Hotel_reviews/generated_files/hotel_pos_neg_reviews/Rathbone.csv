143306,Rathbone, Having to pay for wi fi unheard of these days Noise from the street property would benefit from better glazing , Staff very friendly and helpful Good location with a number of areas of interest in easy walking distance 
143307,Rathbone, The wifi was over 20 pounds a day what a rip off when nearly every hotel now offers this for free The Wahaca restaurant is downstairs in the same street and it s free wifi can be reached from many rooms The decor is dated but very high quality so it s a bit like being in a Bond movie from the 70 s The corridors to the rooms stink of dust they need a good airing deep clean However the room itself was very clean and fresh , Despite the dated decor the rooms are very ample and have windows that open as well as air conditioning The bed was comfy and the room was clean though see my comments regarding the corridors 
143308,Rathbone,No Negative, Excellent stayed in one of the new refurbished rooms beautiful huge walk in shower loved the new decor windows opened onto the street the staff at this hotel are all very friendly helpful especially Christina who is amazing and an asset to this hotel good breakfast will stay here again 
143309,Rathbone,No Negative, Great location and good value I had a single room so it was a little small as was the shower Really liked the quaint location and the ease of access to everything and public transportation Staff was extremely friendly and helpful Will definitely stay there again 
143310,Rathbone, noisy room the window din t lock so was quite a rumour from outside the location is great the hotel ok staff very ok the junior rooms have very small bed and old furniture 3 5 star hotel ,No Positive
143311,Rathbone, single roon was tastefully appointed with a nod to history but way too small for comfort, Very attentive concierge reception staff especially the night shift 
143312,Rathbone, The bathrooms require renovation and to be honest I prefer a shower to a bath , I love the location And it s a great value for money The rooms are spacious too 
143313,Rathbone, No cons , Perfectly positioned for Oxford Street Tottenham Court Road Quiet location Lots of good restaurants in the area No complaints about the hotel staff Very friendly staff excellent service 
143314,Rathbone, Tried the breakfast 1 morning out of 2 and decided to visit cote brasserie the next day The promised selection of pastries and croissants didn t happen 1 croissant or 1 pastry appeared to be all that they were happy to give away The view from room 206 is rubbish a brick wall actually We asked a receptionist to give us directions to the London Palladium which was 0 4 km away and he couldn t understand what we were asking started telling us about local shops and beware our credit card got blocked whilst we were still in London as the hotel had applied to take our whole 2 day predicted bill before we turned up from the card that we had registered and as we paid cash on leaving we could have been left without any payment option if we hadn t taken a back up card Very naughty of them The toilet was in a very awkward position in the bathroom if you didn t lock the door you could have had your legs taken off , Bed was comfy and location fab really close to loads of eating places british museum and oxford street Air con worked well 
143315,Rathbone, But there was SO MUCH NOISE at night People drinking and screaming outside the window and communal collection of trash including a lot of bottles being collected and crashed I don t know why it was so noisy there and not in other hotels I have been to I barely slept the first night the trash was until 2am At least the reception has earplugs , Comfy bed warm shower great restaurants around 
143316,Rathbone, The room was noisy and no free wifi We got a room on top floor and we could hear noise of the air machines Unfortunately we were not able to sleep much , Location Close to Oxforf St e Regent St and really nice with lots of restaurants around 
143317,Rathbone, On the downside the I booked a single room and it was TINY There was a shower no bath The head in the shower couldn t be adjusted so you have no option but to get your hair wet they didn t supply shower caps The room was very clean and good amount of TV channels but the decor was very dated The biggest disappointment was that this hotel charge for WIFI It was 15 for wifi access for 24 hours in any decent hotel wifi is free For this reason I would be reluctant to stay here again , The room was clean and location was good There s some nice restaurants close by and Goodge St tube is less than 5 minutes walk 
143318,Rathbone, The bathrooms are small and dated with shower curtains but very clean and good mirrors Nothing to worry about , The lication is perfect for restaurants bars shopping and theatre yet its not overcrowded The hotel is small cosy not pretentious but a nice touch of modest luxury Bed linen immaculate and beds pillows very comfortable Jewel in the crown are the staff get the impression they are happy in their work and they are friendly helpful We always stay here when in London if we can get a reasonable price 
143319,Rathbone,No Negative, Spacious comfortable clean room Bathroom was clean and well kept but not modern Staff were friendly welcoming and extremely helpful Location was excellent walking distance to Oxford street Leicester Square and Covent Garden 
143320,Rathbone, Nothing it was all perfect , I loved that they put the rose petals on the bed that I asked for And they brought my girlfriend a little cake as it was her birthday which they didn t have to do But it was very nice of them all the staff was helpful and friendly and I d definately be recommending this hotel to anyone who is going to stay in London Thanks very much for the lovely time 
143321,Rathbone, Marked the hotel down because in the alley way behind the hotel the restaurants have to clear away the empties from the night This is very loud and our room did not have double glazing so we were awake until 1am being disturbed by the clatter of bottles and then we were woken again on Sunday morning at 6am by the rubbish collection I did complain at reception on check out but all I got told was that they would put a note on my account so I didnt get that room again I didn t feel this was a satisfactory response considering I d had only 5 hours sleep Shame because I love the rest of the hotel , Excellent location close to the tube brilliant restaurants close by including a cute little street opposite with about six independent cafes offering great healthy smoothies juices breakfasts etc Comfy beds 
143322,Rathbone, Very noisy outside with what sounded like beer glasses being thrown into a bin through to early hrs then again from early morning When complained to hotel I was told yes we know about the problem and next time we can give you a better room , Good location
143323,Rathbone, Room too small mattress too soft shower difficult to regulate a persistent smell of ancient smoking Barman really couldn t speak English at all , Very good reception staff excellent location 
143324,Rathbone, Nothing, This is a lovely hotel very comfortable and of a high standard This is the fourth or fifth time we have stayed here and we have always been very satisfied with the whole experience 
143325,Rathbone, Pillows were very uncomfortable Bit of a shame when the suite itself was so lovely , The suite was lovely We received a free drink in the bar and free wifi as we booked a suite 
143326,Rathbone,No Negative, Staff were superb Helpful friendly and eager to make my stay the best Great location near Charlotte Street restaurants several tube stations shopping and sights 
143327,Rathbone, Several wines on the list were not available at the bar and the bathroom was maybe a little eh snug , The bed was exceptionally large Well exceptionally wide But very comfortable All staff were friendly efficient and attentive 
143328,Rathbone, They charged for wifi if booking through booking com THe free drink they offered me on upgrading did not include cocktails The bar was very small The bath in the room was tiny too , This is a great location and the hotel is comfortable 
143329,Rathbone, Nothing, Excellent hotel like walking back in time into the 1930 s Hotel great loaction very clean breakfast wonderful bed very comfortable and staff lovely Will definately go back again and higly recommend

143331,Rathbone, I had a flight early in the morning I assumed there was a way to make coffee before I go at 4am such as cups and hot water but there wasn t , The room was very comfortable good AC controls great bed and good location 
143332,Rathbone, Jet lag was a bit rough Maybe serve smoothies to people who have jet lag With extra ginseng oh the women staying across the hall from us they were also American Pretty obnoxious and loud But you couldn t have know that us being up on 5 We didn t call to complain either So maybe serve ginseng smoothies AND ear plugs to Jet Lagged visitors Just ideas here , Beds were very comfortable Elevator was handy and always available we were on the 5th floor Location was PERFECT Weather was PERFECT did you guys arrange the weather that week Bathroom was STELLAR we did not use the bedet don t know how to spell it even Great that there is a window in the loo Re Staff Patricia from Romania was most charming polite patient All of the staff great but she is the one we communicated with multiple times 
143333,Rathbone, There was a crack in the corner of the bathroom mirror The bathroom was a little on the small side A couple of the pillows on the bed smelt a bit funky , The bed was really comfy
143334,Rathbone, Room not soundproofed properly a noisy street at night , Excellent location for an easy walk to Oxford Street many varied restuarants within a short stroll multiple pubs almost 20 counted in nearby streets one even over the road and the tube nearby Very friendly and helpful staff in all departments Clean rooms 
143335,Rathbone, Paying separately for wifi isn t really something that shuld be done in 2017 Makes a good hotel like this look petty I was also charged for two nights wifi instead of one but in fairness they rectified the invoice quickly, Nice Room
143336,Rathbone, Nowadays Internet is a basic need and it should be free The hotel could at least offer free wi fi access at the lobby or restaurant , The single room although really very small was comfortable and quiet offering a good mattress pillow a boiler with some tea and coffee and others nice room amenities The hotel is old but everything inside from furnitures to utensils inside bathroom are of good quality and well kept All floors of the hotel common areas and room except for the bathroom are covered with carpet but they do not smell and are kept clean It is a totally smoking free hotel The staff was very helpfull and polite I arrived at hotel 3 hours before check in time without advice tired and asked to store my luggage Promptly the reception not only accepted my request but searched for a ready room and offered me immediate check in which I appreciated a lot Walking distance to Goodge Street subway station allows good connection to the airport and other parts of the city 
143337,Rathbone, The bed is small and not very comfortable The bathroom was not very clean We didn t sleep very well in the morning as the staff was coming in and out in the next room and slap the door during 1 hour , Location is good
143338,Rathbone, dont like the rather old Jacuzzi bath needs updating also prefer an opening window in the room my partner will not stay in a hotel if the window wont open i realise its for safety but a rail fixed to the window frame perhaps would solve this ok at this time of the year but wouldn t like it in the summer also the air con was a bit noisy the room was quiet no outside noise , helpful friendly staff comfy bed good location clean fresh room nice bar area food in the bar was good and available late after the theatre 
143339,Rathbone, Charged wifi was only connectivity option and against normal hotel rates the charges were very high for Wifi Slightly noisy location with bar opposite emptying bottles into bottle bank very early morning , Great location
143340,Rathbone,No Negative, Rooms were a little small but otherwise nice it was nice for one night if I was staying longer I would want a bigger room but can t fault the cleanliness

143344,Rathbone, I would like free wifi but this is not a deal breaker for us , Great location and staff Great breakfast Housekeeping was prompt and the rooms were always immaculate 
143345,Rathbone, If you are more than 5ft don t bother with the bath it was only half sized and absolutely no good for my husband who is tall his knees were at his chin On checking in my debit card was authorised for half the bill this amount stayed as a pending transaction even after we had paid and left I had to get my bank to sort it out when I got home as I hadn t realised until then , The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel itself was in a good location The room was clean and comfortable Breakfast was good too We would stay again because the hotel etc were good but I would be checking my bank account before I left see below 
143346,Rathbone,No Negative, The bed was super comfortable room very tidy and staff were always happy to help everything was done efficiently and not only was the hotel services and staff great but the location was fantastic as well 10 10 would definitely be coming back here next time I m in London 
143347,Rathbone, Water pressure is weak so shower is no good especially in winter My room is on first floor and a bar restaurant is downstairs so quite noisy in the night time , Room is large comfort Reception is very helpful Good location and many restaurant is around 
143348,Rathbone, The location of the hotel was convenient however located on a dim lit street , Hotel staff was great very helpful with hotel needs and recommendations for local attractions Very close to lots of shopping and theatres 
143349,Rathbone, No doorman in busy arrival times was a bit strange and this meant loads of people leaving the front door open on a cold breezy evening spoilt the bar area atmosphere a bit , All the staff seemed to go the extra mile to make me welcome and felt well looked after when entertaining colleagues in the bar area Sausages are best breakfast item in London 
143350,Rathbone, Nothing , Superb location Excellent staff who were always cheerful and willing to help Not part of a national chain so decor had individuality and character 
143351,Rathbone, I could hear every step made outside and my room had the windows at the front where the staff of the restaurants were clearly taking out the radish or bringing in more supply for the next day by the sound of it I slept after 2 am For 4 star hotel the breakfast could have more choices but the service was very good and the staff very kind and nothing was to much for them 5 stars for the breakfast staff , The room was nice and spacey had all that you need apart from good windows 
143352,Rathbone, should be free parking for what we paid for room not enough tea bags an milk in the room, room very clean staff very friendly good discount for parking put should be free for what we paid for room
143353,Rathbone, The room we had was at the front of the hotel and it was quite noisy Although it had double glazing there is a lot of noise from a local pub in the evening and deliveries to restaurants early in the morning , Great staff who were very attentive and highly professional The hotel is in a great central location with fantastic restaurants literally just around the corner 
143354,Rathbone, No replacement coffee and milk we arrived in the afternoon and used all the milk so there was none for the morning I suppose we should have asked but it was too much hassle , Very comfy bed Good service Very pleasant staff Very helpful 
143355,Rathbone, We didn t have drinks facilities but were told on check out they were in cupboard we should have been told this as on a previous stay they were on show so we spent extra money on drinks , Overall feeling of quality in a lovely area Stayed here in the summer and at Christmas Really nice shops and good choice of places to eat not touristy very easy access to underground but also within walking distance of other attractions felt safe in the area with my 15year old son day and night Would stay there again 
143356,Rathbone, Don t believe that internet access should be charged for as an extra Very poor Breakfast at 18 seems very expensive particularly when you can get it cheaper around the corner for half the price , Clean and comfortable though the air conditioning was noisy and convenient for the theatre and restaurants 
143357,Rathbone, The facilities are old bathroom very old breakfast very limited and no free wifi which is very important to me , Great location close to tube station easily get to all meeting in London 
143358,Rathbone, You have to pay for internet 15pound per a day but they said if you book from the hotel direct its will be free breakfast very limited and expencive, Near of oxford street clean and they staff serviable

143361,Rathbone, not a lot really hotel getting old so will always stat to look a little worn but they had a man with a paint brush touching up the place shows they care Was surprised they closed on the 24 12 at lunchtime so could not leave bags for storage , It was my wife s birthday on Christmas eve and they managed to upgrade us and supplied a lovely cake and spread flower petals on our bed which was a nice touch and much appreciated Location was excellent Staff very attentive and polite 
143362,Rathbone, The decor is a bit old fashioned but ok The wifi is far too expensive Most hotels offer it free nowadays , Very helpful and friendly staff It was good to have plenty of surfaces in the bathroom to place our toiletries on this is so often overlooked Appreciated having windows that can be opened to air the room 
143363,Rathbone, The WiFi in this hotel is 15 pounds a night which I think a quite a steep price , The staff was incredibly helpful hospitable friendly and professional They truly made us feel welcome and helped us in every way possible The location of this Hotel is great just a 3 minute walk from all the shops at oxford street en near various subway stations The hotel had a very luxurious and personal feel so we got a great hotel at a very fair price I would choose this hotel again if I were to stay in London City The only downside was the steep price of the Wifi 15 pounds a night 
143364,Rathbone, Provide free WiFi, The hotel was one of the best I ve ever stayed at in London Everything was superb and I would ve given this a 10 10 rating if it wasn t for the expensive WiFi The staff were exceptional and the fact that I was upgraded to an executive room was so much appreciated that I ll definitely be back here in future I absolutely loved the bedroom and bathroom design the breakfast and the overall sense of comfort that was provided Thank you so much for a wonderful stay I was under much pressure for work but staying at this hotel in its superb location helped me a great deal I ll see you in 2017 
143365,Rathbone, A little expensive and the hotels decor a little tired in places but overall good value for money, The rooms very clean the staff very pleasant and helpful and location perfect for us
143366,Rathbone, Obviously being in a central location means street noise but settles down about midnight , Excellent location near Oxford Street plenty of bars and restaurants Pretty lobby with bar bed comfortable 
143367,Rathbone, The WiFi costs 6 an hour really , In a fantastic situation staff were helpful room was clean and decent tea and coffee making available Good but not groovy place to stay
143368,Rathbone, Maybe complementary water when you paying 200 for a night, The water was so hot even when a member of staff came to fix it I couldn t wash my hair and when I came out of the shower I was all red
143369,Rathbone, Very dated decor in rooms mentioned on my booking it was for a birthday night stay hoping we would be given a modern room as per the photos however was given a very small room and bathroom and felt like I was in a caravan , Clean and friendly staff
143370,Rathbone, Room facing front street noisy at midnight bottkebanks being emptied Early morning traffic , Hotel is very accessible good quality friendly and very approachable staff Immaculate rooms and equipped fir your needs

143376,Rathbone, Main walkways dated and carpets threadbare Plumbing needs attention having a shower the water couldn t drain so ended up having a paddle as well , Lovely comfy bed and nice warm room staff very helpful
143377,Rathbone, The room I had was at the side of the hotel opposite a pub This wouldn t have been an issue if the window sealed properly but as it was it was akin to having it open so it was very noisy until late at night and then the general workings of London kicked off again at about 4 On top of that even with the aircon turned off it still rumbled away so all in all I managed about 5 hours sleep , The hotel is very close to central London and the price I paid for the room was very good The room was small but only to be expected for the price I paid and the bed and linen were very comfy 
143378,Rathbone, The pillows, The friendliness of the staff It was my wife s birthday and without prompting we were brought two glasses of bubbly and a chocolate brownie with happy birthday written on the plate 
143379,Rathbone, There was some construction in the hotel which I was warned about as I checked in but not prior to it which was a bit disappointing Luckily I am an early riser , The concierge was so friendly and nice He was telling me all about Portugal as he s from there and gave me lots of tips on London He got me a bottle of water when I was leaving and helped me with my ridiculous amounts of shopping bags Just really lovely

143383,Rathbone, Charged incorrectly on leaving, We booked a suite when I first turned up I was vaguely disappointed as the room seemed ordinary but over the two days I came to really like the room and the location and staff at the hotel 
143384,Rathbone, Too bad the restaurant doesn t serve lunches and dinners The first morning there were croissants for breakfast the next two mornings there were none , Convenient location Excellent service 
143385,Rathbone, Small Room and the air con in the room didn t work very well Noisy road outside , Complementary newspaper Friendly staff and let us leave our bags the next day after check out Near to tube and central London

143389,Rathbone, WiFi wasn t free in fact it was 6 for 2hrs In a 4 star hotel in the center on London having to pay for WiFi is outrageous , We were asked on arrival what kind of room we would like quiet or one overlooking the busy streets I thought this was a nice touch 
143390,Rathbone, The only Negative is having to pay for wifi at 6 an hour I was very disappointed but didn t have the heart to complain to the staff as they were really nice , The staff were lovely Hotel was clean and welcoming For our anniversary they made an extra special effort to welcome us 
143391,Rathbone, Water slow warming up Fight going on between couple in room next to me kept me awake one night , Staff were excellent friendly and helpful Welcoming pleasant reception area and dining area

143395,Rathbone, The bathroom was very old the shower either had boiling hot or freezing cold water you had to pay extra to use the wifi which wasn t explained very expensive for a basic room that you could get for half the price in an Ibis etc , Central location 
143396,Rathbone, Shabby even dirty in places the room had a terrible stale smell Sold as a suite I ve paid less for doubles that have been bigger Toilet bathroom door arrangement ridiculous Ordered one bowl of chips on room service and waited an hour to be brought a bowl of crisps ,No Positive
143397,Rathbone, The fact that there was no free internet and that getting WiFi everywhere in the hotel was expensive The stipulation that one was not allowed to consume food not bought in the hotel in the room , Location Breakfast
143398,Rathbone, Arriving back from the theatre and trying to get a drink in the bar Initially there was not enough staff and the bar man had to call for assistance, Staff were very helpful The English breakfast was very good
143399,Rathbone, Could not fault a thing about this hotel, My husband and I were going to see a show in Tottenham Court Road so the location of this hotel is fantastic The staff are very friendly It was perfect for a one night stay in London Would definitely stay here again 
143400,Rathbone, The service in the evening was poor and v slow as the bar men was also cooking the food that was ordered Wouldn t recommend eating there , The room was Lovley and they left rose petals on the bed saying happy birthday for my mum Reception staff where helpful And the hotel is beautiful 
143401,Rathbone, Disappointed in the facilities and thought that the wifi should have been included for the price I paid but I guess the price is because of the location because the hotel interior seems quite old and shabby , The location was perfect as it was less than a 5 minute walk to oxford street and my uni 
143402,Rathbone, An iron facility to iron would have been useful Based on our local experience felt a cooked breakfast could have been included in the price , Location the room and the pleasantness of the hotel and staff We were able to get straight into the room when we arrived midday and could store our luggage on vacating the room for later collection Two nice touches when we arrived in our room happy birthday message in dried flower petals for my wife and a choclate brownie with a candle which was delicious too Thank you

143422,Rathbone, Bad bed small room small bathroom Could not arrange a taxi to airport Have my card detail online at check in because leaving early Still had to give them my card when checking out And cheapest of all They re charg for internet access , The location
143423,Rathbone, Rathbone Hotel looks quite impressive from the street but also a little out of place being situated on a back street off Tottenham Court Road As a lone female I m afraid I didn t feel very safe arriving quite late at night as I did The hotel s policy seems to be that they hold a fee on your credit debit card for potential purchases even before you ve decided to use any bar services I managed to talk the reception staff out of this due to my late arrival but it s not appreciated to try bumping up a guest s final bill especially if they might be on a budget If I had wanted to spend more money I d have used a more centrally located hotel with more stars , A very warm welcome on arrival staff were very friendly both in person on the telephone I arrived quite late at night having called ahead earlier in the day to advise and this was no problem at all I really just used the Rathbone as a place to lay my head at the end of a very busy day of theatre with friends I d booked a Single room I was pleasantly surprised at how much space was allocated The bed was dressed in spotlessly clean white cotton sheets big fluffy pillows an absolute pleasure to fall into after such a busy day Bathroom was quite small a little dated but perfectly functional with very nice toiletries to hand No noise issues rare for central London although there was a big gap at the base of my door so unsure whether this might be an issue on other occasions I didn t get a chance to use any of the hotel s public rooms bars so am unable to comment In summary it s a very nice hotel at the cheaper end of London s accommodation perhaps a little dated but very clean friendly 
143424,Rathbone,No Negative, The location was right in the middle of everything just off Oxford street It was spotless would recommend this hotel and would definitely go back and breakfast was Quality
143425,Rathbone, For the money you are paying I d expect a higher standard of comfort The room single room was very small cramped and it appeared a bit run down There wasn t anywhere to put my suitcase , The location was good as it was near a lot of resturants The reception staff were very professional 
143426,Rathbone, The treatment of the lady who Chek out out She ask me upon Chek out If everything was fine and I said yes all was fantastic with the exception of the swear smell in the bathroom you may want to Chek thei for the next guest she said did you report it I said no I was very tired and jet lag so no time As all we wanted was to rest at the time I was not finish explaining when she interruptly said well if you did not reported there is nothing we can do if you would of to report it to us or the maid we could of fix the problem then honestly it was not a big deal but her attitude was I obviously wante to respond to her out of line comment but I figured that working my self in the hospitality industry would not have any effect addressing the situation in addition to the arrogant tone of her respond made me feel like when I have a problem is my issue We had cleaning service every day so I don t understand why the maid would not be trained to take action or report to maintence he issue so gest enjoy a pleasant experience I guest is a point of view situation in a hotel with such a nice location and facilities I m sure they welcome descent guest who deserve the well care of this fine city I must say that this same lady was difficult up on checking when the reservation we maid included a extra bed for my 1 5 year old soon and she wanted to charge us 15 pounds daily for the extra bed just because my soon did no feet into the small cribs they have once I showed the reservation details even then it took her a while to accep that the extra bed or crib was included and requested prior checking in Maybe booking com needs to look into what specification are shown when advertising are equal to confirmation info to the hotel I requested a wake up call thanks good I woke up on times as the fine only rand once and as we wore showering could to pick up the call no one called again or showed up in the room , I liked the location I liked the toiletries and the safe in the room complementary water and tee I liked the blackout in the room their fantastic and the proofsound windows I loved all the staff as their are very attentive there is a girl from Spain who was very attentive and nice to my family and soon Same with a guy that comes from southamerica and with the exception of one lady who was presented to us as reservation manager up on choking then she would have a trainee tag instead her name at Chek out so it was difficult to see what hat her role was 
143427,Rathbone, My room was obviously once a smoking room so whilst very clean did still smell badly of smokers Didn t interrupt a good night s sleep though , The staff were super friendly The location is very quiet and very well situated for local shopping and eating out I was upgraded without even asking
