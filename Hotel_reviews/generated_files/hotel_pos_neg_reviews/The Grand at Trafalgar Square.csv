247613,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Room was a dark but not a major issue, Brilliant location A cupboard in the corridor from where guest could help themselves to refills of all beverages and bathroom accessories An ice machine and a chilled water machine in the corridor was a really bonus Very quiet considering the location 
247614,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Absolutely fabulous location approx 100m from the official centre of London Rooms clean and ok for size given its a central London hotel No fancy trimmings but perfect for a short stay if you re exploring London Excellent value for money very helpful staff 
247615,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Nothing other than the window, The hotel was superb but the room was in the middle of the hotel without a window but otherwise very good the room was of a good size with air conditioning a large TV and good WiFi The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower first class
247616,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Basement toilet facilities were not well cleaned , Great location for a weekend stop in London nothing is too far or difficult to get to Hotel is relaxed and secure Nothing was too much trouble for the staff 
247617,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, value for money was terrible 300 for one night in a hotel whose rooms are tired and furnished extremely dark does not entice me back the bathroom had a shower which was fine but certainly nothing more than average overall i wouldnt return After I checked in I went to the bar to ask for a glass of wine which they seemed very shocked by despite it being 1230pm , the location of the hotel was fantastic and the reception staff extremely friendly 
247618,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The staff was not friendly or helpful We lost power in the middle of the night and they acted as if we inconvenienced them when we reported it The wifi connection was pretty poor , Our room was clean and comfortable The location was close to the City center 
247619,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I believe hotels should alert you when you book about events such a the Gay Pride Parade that coincide with your stay That event totally eliminated one full day night from a three day once in a lifetime visit to London Very disappointing that the hotel did not alert us with small children that this event was at our front door On top of that upcharged us for that night , Location was fantastic Providing cool water stations in hallways is a nice feature 
247620,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, At one point I had 4 staff at the front desk ignore me completely to listen to a collegue on the phone The phone in the room didn t work and they didn t replace the battery so I had to go downstairs to ask for towels to order room service and to request assistance with bags , Well located central to many things 
247621,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, fridge in room is needed in this day i was running in a 10k and i had jucies no were to put them, was ok bit over priced close to everything prime location
247622,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We were misinformed twice on two days we asked about buying day Tube passes and were told FALSELY that it was not necessary as if you used you credit card with a tab you would only be charged the maximum for a day Well low and behold that only applies to residents not visitors The last experience was simply the worst as we were checking out and we asked about a cab taxi and they said the street was blocked off in front of the hotel and all we had to do was walk to end of street and they were there waiting Well NOT the case at all the entire area was blocked off and my wife and I had to cross the Thames hauling our bags to eventually take an Uber about 30 minutes later We were stressed and sweaty Just barely made it on time to the airport I was so upset contacted them from the airport and they said we should have read the signs in the hotel and Web site about street closing due to events they did not acknowledge the inconvenience at all Conclusion do your own research and lower your expectations for service at this hotel , Booked because of vicinity to our needs So location was perfect 
247623,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Room is a bit small for the price and shower could be modernized i hate shower curtains that stick to you while you trying to shower , Bed was very comfortable location great
247624,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Nothing It couldn t have been improved on , The staff were helpful but not obtrusive overpowering The downstairs bar dining area was roomy welcoming with a nice blend of traditional modern Water dispensers in the corridors a fridge microwave a nice touch 
247625,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Didn t like food at breakfast Couldn t get poached eggs from kitchen chef No evening hot chocolate available at 9pm Not very inspiring in room service Wouldn t eat at you restaurant Also no lounge area to relax at end of day for a drink Just work areas looked like everything was catering to conferences , The staff were good The location good 
247626,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Room cleaner window broken frame dirty very unhappy wth Booking com No phone no no and to my email that U advertised the room cheaper I like u guys but not when behave like cheapoair flim flam artists R Chillemi, Location Staff
247627,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Room was a bit tight no drawers really narrow wardrobe had to keep clothes in suitcase , nice feature chilled filtered water and empty pba free ready to fill containers in hallway 
247628,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The price Overrated even for London standards , Very friendly personal Excellent location Free concierge service for keeping bags during the day before checking in and after checking out 
247629,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I wasn t there long enough for anything to come to light There was a minor line at check in but once one member of staff clearly doing another job by the way noticed they dropped what they were doing and checked myself and the people behind me in whilst his colleague was busy FABULOUS , As a former Londoner location was everything The price was just a bonus 
247630,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I was there in unusually hot weather and air con in room was not as cool as that in foyers etc , Nice big room very helpful staff and useful facilities that are not common in London hotels tea and coffee making fridge microwave and chilled water and bottles to refill available in corridor A cupboard with guest facilities such as ironing board and iron made it easy to get those as needed This is the best London hotel I have stayed at 
247631,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The room was particularly great and apparently it was an upgraded room really not worth the money, A great location close to everything we wanted to see
247632,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Furnishings in room were a bit worn and tired Bed sheets or mattress underneath had a few stains but in fairness they were clean I did check with a small UV light I carry with me Also in fairness on the sheets I did not complain as it was pretty minor and they were clean If I had complained I suspect the staff would have addressed it Also didn t like that I had to use stairs regardless of the direction I approached the room not bad without luggage but if you have luggage in tow it would have been nice to have a ramp in at least one direction The technology for the TV was overall great but I would have liked the ability to sign on to my own social media accounts such as YouTube in order to access my own playlists , Lots of use of modern technology the machines on each floor to get water and ice guest lockers rooms on each floor where you could get extra supplies and amenities the available DIY guest laundry room 
247633,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Wonderful hotel it looks like it has been very recently refurbished gorgeous carpets everywhere and the room was amazing booking in and out was a breeze also our room was ready when we got there at 1pm so gave us a chance to change before going out to lunch All the staff were very helpful will definitely be going back again 
247634,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Staff are curt to the point of rudeness at checkin Appear to have a preference for dealing with business suits rather than tourist guests although guests must be well healed to stay there Appear to have less than adequate English skills We requested a room after 7 days stay and were returning 2 weeks later for another 3 days Clearly no attempt was made to address this Just told the hotel is full sir Room was very hot and stuffy Windows only open 10 centimetres Bathrooms could have been cleaner especially the toilet and ice machine on most floors not working , Great location to be so close to Trafalgar Square Coffee good down stairs Ice machine and cool water dispenser good Easy walking distance to Soho and Convent Garden 
247635,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Absolutely no staff service or support from taking ur own luggage up to getting any assistance for information or facilities No managager on site to address issues despite requesting for Mgmt , Brilliant Location
247636,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Did you have breakfast in hotel at 20 each seemed high for all that we have for breakfast Garfunkels only 25 yards away offering full English breakfast at 5 95, The wifi was the best we ve ever had in a hotel 74Mb in the room Water supply and bottles in corridors Check in very efficient Location perfect only 60 metres or so from Trafalgar Square
247637,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Beautiful hotel and room a great location and price for 150 195 per night on a holiday weekend I was also able to check in at 11 30am Air conditioning worked great and I was even able to do my laundry for free I would stay here again 
247638,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We booked three rooms and the rooms were very far apart We even had to take a different elevator to get to one of our rooms That made it difficult for a family , Location and cleanliness
247639,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Nothing at all everything was perfect , This hotel is excellent the location is great the beds are really comfy and the room was really well equipped fridge and microwave Will definitely return here for my future London visits 
247640,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The street outside the entrance is a main street with a traffic light therefore always in a traffic jam it took me 20 minutes to order a cab from the hotel better to walk around the corner and hail one and is somewhat noisy , Spacious clean rooms with comfy bed and modern facilities and extra amenities strategic location and friendly staff
247641,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Booked two non smoking rooms but only received one One couple had to sleep with the window open in the cold rainy weather on our first night and were both subsequently sick for our stay Had complained on initial entry and asked to be moved due to the unbearable smell of smoke but they put a machine of some sort in the room instead which only helped marginally , Location Walk out the door and you are surrounded by great cafes and pubs Trafalgar Square on one corner buckingham palace in view as is Big Ben and Westminster abbey Easy walk to all Multitude of buses and the rail system on the corner 
247642,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I wish I d known to ask if the room had natural daylight even if the windows looked over the street Consequently you needed the light on all the time which for all the comforts a room has makes it like feel like a cell , Art deco of the restaurant and bar area Breakfast was good although black pudding was hard as a clay pigeon Location was excellent 50 yards off Trafalgar Square but on a relatively quiet street 
247643,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I requested a bath tub when booking a long time ago but the room allocation was not selected till we arrived when no such facilities were available even if we up graded to a suite I am sure that at the time of booking availability would have been easy Staff very efficient but not happy or at ease with residents , Thje location is superb for everything in central London for theatres restaurants shopping and the Thames 
247644,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Only a minor complaint we were close to the lifts and we could hear the doors opening closing all night , My wife and I travelled to this hotel Right beside Trafalgar Sq There is a tube station about 100 feet from the front door of the hotel Great service We told the hotel that we were celebrating our 35th wedding ann anand asked for a quiet room with a view Not only did we get that we could see hear Big Ben but the hotel left us a complimentary bottle of wine sweets crisps water and something for our computer Really great service thank you There was even a free water bottle service in the corridor and you could fill your bottle with ice cold water before you left the building and ice and ice bucket service beside it excellent A great BIG thank you 
247645,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Effectively this is Club Quarters the two are in the same building and share a front desk The rooms and public spaces are definitely not as nice as the pictures And query the cleanliness when I opened the curtains moths flew out, Staff was super friendly and helpful Water machines in the corridor is a nice feature
247646,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The bed was rather small although good Breakfast has no a lot of choice it is not good value for money taken Shampoo is not good enough , Location is exelent Staff is very friendly The room was clean 
247647,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Tiles on the floor of the shower were cracked and sharp the extractor fan did not work so everything steamed up when the shower was in use We reported this and were promised that it would be dealt with but it didn t happen Bins weren t emptied daily and neither were our water wine glasses washed no big deal we did it our selves but it s the little things sometimes which leave an impression , The location was perfect for sightseeing in London We hardly used the underground or public transport because everything was within walking distance from the hotel 
247648,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I liked everything, I first chose the hotel for its location but i was so pleased with its staff and everything else that whenever in london i try to stay at this hotel
247649,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, only 2 normal tea bags in room Need more better choice No complimentary biscuits Microwave in room Why customers would rather have better tea facilities , Large room nice ensuite with good shower location for central London Bed comfy good size Telly 
247650,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Rooms basic bathroom very 70 s even had a shower curtain that clung to you when showering yuk , Breakfast surprisingly good value Both had English and good attentive staff and the breakfast was great
247651,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I was told you had a shuttle to help with airport transportation and then 1 day before my arrive they told me it was 85 I couldn t afford that The underground and express was exhausting , I didn t eat breakfast it was too expensive 
247652,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The pictures of rooms offered on Booking com were creative to say the least They showed the rooms in their best possible light which resembled little the actual condition of the two rooms that we stayed in , The lobby restaurant and public areas of the hotel are charming and food was good Location was as expected excellent for our needs shopping sightseeing and dining 
247653,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Very small reception with minimal staff No room service available as too few staff No hairdryer no fridge in room 1 pillow each Thought it would have been more welcoming Obviously only pay for location Might have well booked travel lodge as no difference , Nothing particularly Was like a glorified travel lodge wirh unhelpful few staff 
247654,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Nothing, Super stylish and really functional for business They have thought about everything Bright lights in rooms for reading iron and board soaps filtered cool water outside your room with an ice machine Very stylish marble throughout the building and very lovely and helpful staff 10 out of 10 
247655,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, A little dusty mattress and pillows getting old and saggy probably time for a change , Microwave and tea making equipment in room Water dispensing machine on every floor 
247656,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Would have been nice to have more than one sachet of sugar tea coffee of each type without needing to request more Slight noise of traffic but nothing to stop you sleeping , Very clean good sized room Bathroom was also a good size and clean Staff on check in and check out were very helpful and friendly Excellent location for theatres and art gallery and plenty of places to eat nearby if you don t fancy the in house bar restaurant 
247657,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Very helpful up graded us to a room with an extra sofa bed for our son for only 10 Rooms very clean quiet and comfortable friendly staff great location
247658,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Nothing at all to complain about , Great location Nice touches like a Toni and Guy hairdryer Sky Sports for my partner But could not ask for a better located hotel Close to a local Tesco too Check out was 12 o clock too Which is fantastic 
247659,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, View from the room was a joke not what I paid over 200 00 a night for Bed was small for the size of the room as was the bath shower room Also literature in the room said breakfast was until 12 noon however it was advertised elsewhere as 11am which meant we missed breakfast Finally getting woken up by the cleaners at 9 30am when checkout isn t until 12 noon is not acceptable , Entry hall is fantastic that s about it
247660,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Breakfast is expensive and not so good Better go to the nearest cafe or restaurant Printme com service is not actually working or I just wasn t able to figure out how to do it there is no such app where you can enter your document id If there is no paper in printer you need to go to reception on another floor I was expecting bathrobe and slippers in such hotel Only 1 small tube of shower gel and shampoo for 2 people is just not enough People on reception may be a little more pleasant except the guy who did check in for us he was great , Location is perfect Room is clean and furniture is good Nice interior in lobby 
247661,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, No concierge service We needed help as it was our first visit to the city We were handed a stack of tourist maps only , The location was excellent within walking distance of numerous attractions and stores 
247662,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Directions to room was confusing didn t like our room on opposite side to Northumberland Ave and especially did not like the stairs we discovered we had to take once out of lift and into the area where our room was located I was very tired from flight and was sick of having to lug my suitcase up and down underground station stairs and then had to lug it up yet more stairs to access our room in hotel Staff at reception should have warned us of this and maybe offered some assistance Rooms on Northumberland side much easier to access we stayed here once before and preferred our room on last visit , Perfect location in London lovely feel to Hotel especially the front entrance very grand Filtered water available on all floors was appreciated Fantastic shower with the best water pressure ever experienced in any Hotel we ve stayed in and we ve stayed in a few Room was very quiet
247663,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The bathroom was not up to standard A curtain at the shower is not the most hygiene standard I was very surprised at no mini bar also, The location was fantastic The bed was comfortable
247664,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Worst pillow I have ever slept on room was hot and stuffy aircon useless and unable to open window for fresh air window faced onto another building so dark and gloomy won t be returning , Location was fab
247665,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, No hotel bar in the typical sense Bar restaraunt in house run by outside provider which closed at 11 pm , Excellent location and comfortable room Helpful staff
247666,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Bed was slightly small as was the bathroom Confusing information in the hotel directory in the bedroom breakfast was stated as being served until noon It in fact finished at 11 00 We checked but could have led to disappointment for some guests , Offered an upgrade upon arrival 30 per night very reasonable Staff were very welcoming and helpful Id forgotten my phone charger I was loaned one from reception Little extras such as ice and chilled water FOC on each floor 
247667,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Ironing facilities should be in the room and not stored in a communal room for pool usage Also Iron Quaslity was very poor cheap and nasty Bar closing at 11pm for residents and reduseed service, Breakfast quality was goo and staff in restaurent and Bar were effivcient and friendly
247668,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The room had the only window facing the internal walls therefore no natural light could get in The TV was not working properly On a Friday night hotel guest were not allowed to have access to the restaurant bar due to an on going private party, Position is for sure excellent for touring around the center
247669,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We couldn t figure out how to get to the business lounge Seems like it s members only , In my opinion the Grand is exactly like the perfect hotel should look like Very cozy room firm mattresses air con a bonus of a good size fridge and microwave good quality toiletries free unlimited drinking water to pour in a bottle plus 1 to zero waste karma good noise isolation what else one could wish for Great bar downstairs The location is super comfortable To be honest we have never thought we d rent a hotel room near Trafalgar square for such budget friendly price We are definitely coming back to the Grand 
247670,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Nothing , Great location within walking distance to shops attractions and shows Good size room which was very comfortable Underground very close by Would definitely stay here again 
247671,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The inconvenience of laundry facilities Only one and have to head to via another lift walking through the lobby That being said most other hotels do not have this facility , Located near Charing Cross station and just across from the National Gallery 
247672,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Could not have asked for a better hotel whilst staying in London My sister and I had bought a trip to London for my Mom s 60th birthday and we thought The Grand was reasonable The room was big compared to others I ve stayed in in London and the room was ready upon arrival at 11 30 which was a pleasant surprise We checked in and were on our way When we returned in the evening the sofa bed was made up and extra towels were in the room as requested The staff could not have done any more for us and the location was brilliant only a 2 minute walk to Charing Cross Tube Station 
247673,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The rooms could be more clean and the light switch it s nice if they all work Also when you order the late night room service it ll be nice if the hotel take in to consideration that the food it s delivered in separate containers and being able to have a plate and cutlery in the room is good, Liked the look of it as you enter the lobby No noise friendly staff and good location
247674,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Room had a very strange layout which was a safety issue Room was sized like a large closet bed and wardrobe took up entire space leaving no space to open suitcase Then a step down between bed and bathroom which is easy to forget in the middle of the night causing a header down the stairs if you re not fully awake , Location is amazing and I love the fact that I could open window in room even though did open up to a roof top which did not make me comfortable People or rodents 
247675,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Ice dispenser on our floor was out of order , Check in was fast and efficient Bed and room was very comfortable Wifi good with no login needed Innovative use of technology gives access to big range of in room dining options Great location and for central London good value for money 
247676,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The Italian reraurant next door did not step up to the mark Bit of a let down but this was outweighed by the hotel experience , Room facilities Hotel staff 
247677,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Fairly basic room any negative side was highly recovered by the many positive aspects , Good value for money very kind staff room was pretty standard but the real value added here is the awesome location 
247678,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We had to request more tea coffee for the room surely this should be provided automatically , The staff at reception were so pleasant and helpful 
247679,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The room was fairly small for the price and the view was mostly building works It s a bit of a shame that a fantastic hotel in terms of staff and lobby is let down by average rooms , Great staff and an excellent hotel bar and lobby 
247680,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, A fridge in the room would be nice for the price you pay Only stayed one night so not a big issue really , Amazing location and nice room Asked for more pillows which arrived promptly Free water refill bottled which is a nice touch
247681,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The bed was a bit hard for my liking and we would have liked a couple of extra pillows Also a little disappointed that there wasn t a hair dryer in the room, Great location staff were lovely and everything went very smoothly
247682,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We stayed for 3 nights and the sheets were never changed It s no big deal but I thought the standard would have been higher , Nice staff and great location 
247683,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Room looked out onto a brick wall Odd shaped room Breakfast wasn t included plus the staff weren t very attentive at breakfast and they got our order wrong,No Positive
247684,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Both bars in the hotel were closed on oned of the nights for private functions with no where for guests to drink and relax I thought this was poor and the staff did not deal with this well or offer any compensation I would not stay there again, Comfortable bed and good location
247685,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The bedroom could have been bigger , The location of the hotel was perfect and the complimentary bottle of wine and basket of goodies was a lovely touch thank you 
247686,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Bedrooms are basic we booked a superior queen room and in comparison to other hotels it was a basic double View from window was a building site, Location and general ambiance of the building
247687,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The temperature of the room was rather cool and the air con heating unit not very responsive , Excellent location with friendly helpful and professional staff The entrance and style of the hotel is Grand 
247688,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The beds were two king singles put together so it was uncomfortable in the middle I found the room heating inadequate They are also quite busy here so concierge service was absent when I arrived with my considerable load of luggage Bathroom was cramped and very ordinary The floor ends up with a big puddle when you shower and the extractor fan is hopeless so it turns into a sauna , The location was good The room was clean I love that the hotel has a laundry for guest use This is a rarity 
247689,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, nothing, the location was excellent for remembrance Sunday service I would like to point out the fact that on check out I informed the reception that if the house keeper came across my watch which was an expensive one would they get in touch with me half hour after we checked out I received a call to say my watch had been found and was at reception a big thank you goes out to that cleaner as my watch has sentimental value I had a disabled room which was more than adequate for me and my wheelchair the hotel itself boasts a very relaxing atmosphere considering its right on Trafalgar square will definitely be using this hotel again 
247690,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, for London the rates are not surprising and although pricey this is still not a 5 hotel and don t expect luxury treatment Toiletries are limited only one bottle of shower gel shampoo and body lotion per day per two persons No hair conditioner no earbuds no seeing kit no shoe polish etc You won t be finding a chocolate on your pillow we only got one face towel to be shared among two persons and two shower towels As a standard everyone should have a separate face towel This really is not a budget hotel no socket in the bathroom so you can only dry your hair in the room there was no minibar in the room there was a fire alarm at 9am Hotel staff were not around and were not informing guests if we should evacuate The reception desk And housekeeping weren t answering the phone and we couldn t get any information if it was safe or not , the location is as good as it gets in the middle of all main attractions very close to the Embankment and Charing Cross tube stations and you can walk anywhere I ve stayed at many places in London but this was by far the best our standard room was very spacious and very quiet despite this very central location we did ask for a quiet room You don t get woken up neither by street noise nor by other guests passing by your door the bed was large and very comfortable and wifi was free and good the bathroom was small but clean the hair dryer as very good there was a little kettle and complimentary tea and instant coffee There was a filtered water dispenser in the corridor close to our room and you could fill up your bottles anytime 
247691,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Minor inconvenience I think that a hotel at this level should provide an iron board as standard rather than via a phone call to Housekeeping However whenever I asked for these items they arrived within minutes at all times of the day or night , The location is fantastic within easy walking distance of historic Westminster the Thames good restaurants and many of the theatres The staff were friendly and helpful The room was large light filled and very quiet as a result of the double glazed windows All the facilities worked well and I loved the old English ambience of the building 
247692,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The breakfast experience was disappointing Scrambled eggs were rubbery toaster no butter had to ask no sideplates had to ask Marmalade was in a bowl rather than individual pots Cost was 20 On the second day I went to the Cafe Concerto a few doors away cheaper and food was good , Staff were most helpful and made you feel very welcome I had an issue with wifi and staff helped with the issue 
247693,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The room that I got was in serious need of a renovation The windows did not close properly and the cold would come in easily The walls and doors needed a serious paint job The room had a very weird smell , Excellent location and clean 
247694,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Queen size room very small and only with shower no bath tub Noisy and inefficient air conditioning , The location is superb purified water fountain on each floor is a good idea 
247695,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We asked for two extra pillows and it took an hour for them to arrive We were awoken at 6 30 as a member of staff knocked on the wrong door number , The room itself was lovely and Matthew at the desk was particularly helpful Loved it 
247696,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The beds were ok but the pillows were huge and very hard However we didn t ask for new ones so we didn t give the hotel a chance to fix this , Super location Located in the middle of everything Walking distance to Big Ben Oxford Street London Eye Dungeon Buckingham Palace We had a Family room for two adults and a teenager One of the better rooms we ve had Nice staff and all in all a very good hotel 
247697,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Can t get a drink in bar after 11 30 totally spoils everything as hotel residents should be able to get a drink when they want at least till 12 30 1pm this is the capital man , Location fantastic great beds lovely hotel
247698,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Very basic room Bed hard had to ask for extra pillows No room safe Room quite small and dark No nice touches Only one hand towel provided for two people Door to fridge cupboard dropping off No lounge downstairs No porterage or help with luggage No one to get a taxi for us , Good location as we were attending a wedding at the Corinthia Hotel nearly next door 
247699,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The shower had a shower curtain not always the most hygienic of things No minibar or safe in the room you need to go to the reception for the safe The lobby has been re arranged it was much more comfortable and inviting before The hotel bar does not stay off very late , The location was excellent the staff were very friendly and the room was spotless
247700,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, My only criticism was that they came to replace the sofa midway through my stay and came at a time when I had the do not disturb sign up Ideally the sofa would have been swapped prior or post my checking in out or at least memtioned at check so we could have set a time when I was out Other than it was a lovely stay , Great location could walk to almost everything helpful staff and nice room I loved that they had a room with a kitchenette available 
247701,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Would of liked a room with a large window like the one shown on your website Instead looked out of small window onto roof with large extractor fan , Good central location for want we wanted to do 
247702,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, They have the largest rooms I ve encountered so far in London And if you book early even for a very reasonable price All the amenities you need for your stay e g free WiFi or around the clock room service not that you would need it in this neighborhood Great housekeeping compared to other hotels they are almost not to be seen or heard just like tiny elfs Great location as well Close to the tube and a lot of sightseeing musts musical theatres and Soho 
247703,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The main road is quite busy with traffic so parking up to drop off bags etc was a little stressful but the staff were really helpful, Location was excellent and the parking wasn t too far away
247704,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Bar closed for residents too early last orders 11 30 When you are resident the bar should be open til at least 1 30 2 am, Beds comfortable beautiful architecture nice bar area
247705,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I would have enjoyed a small fridge I guess no fridge is part of the low cost , Such a lovely spacious comfortable well designed room in such a location AT SUCH A PRICE you can only say EXCELLENT ps eating breakfast in Bols restaurant was a plus also 
247706,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, bar was closed before 10pm on the Sunday of our stay, hotel is in great position very clean with marble entrance hall free bottle water in hall Great shower
247707,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, nothing could have been better first class from check in to check out , the stay at the grand was perfect as stayed at hotels in london before i have not been as satisfied but our stay at the grand was perfect thank you
247708,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Told Reception that during breakfast someone entered my room and stole my Kindle Receptionist said Sorry about that and gave me my bill , Good breakfast
247709,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I ordered a pocket wifi to be delivered in the hotel It was confirmed the hotel staff received the package but for some reason the package got lost After we left from 2 day booking they have found the package and returned it to the company I rented the pocket wifi Very strange I will never book this hotel again Still waiting to be reimbursed , location is excellent
247710,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Hotel room was really shabby for a 4 was embarrassed as had booked a 4 as a gift It was grubby around the edges rust marks in bathroom on wall it was just dated , The entrance hall was amazing Reasonable prices wine and good service in bar 
247711,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, minor dislike room was a bit dark and gloomy due to the windows having pattened film on which is a very good idea if the windows face a wall or unpleasant view we didn t realise it was such a lovely sunny day until we actually got outside Room rate was bit high would have been better if breakfast was included, the room was spacious for 3 adult no bumping into beds etc when moving around loved ice machine outside our room and bottles for fresh water Boyds restaurant was lovely 
247712,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Bed linen and sheets were dirty and had a bad smell Not something you would expect from a 4 star hotel , Location was perfect You can just walk to most of the attractions in the center 
247713,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, No lounge facilities Reception is tiny and not a welcoming space It felt like walking into the lobby of an office block, Central location Spacious Clean Comfortable Quiet Room
247714,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, No fridge but then when one considers the price and that a supermarket Tesco is two restaurants away its ok , The room was surprisingly large and elegant for Central London at this price I loved that I could get up and walk over to the National gallery The bus to Oxford St was right there Boyds restaurant was such a beautiful room to have breakfast in and not expensive Staff were lovely 
247715,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, No resident bar on a Tuesday at 11 15pm and were told by a member of staff that it was very late Pillows very thin and extra pillows in laundry room didn t seem that clean No lounge seats in foyer Reception desk area v small when busy , Great location for touring the city clean and hardly any noise in room Lovely pizza in restaurant 
247716,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, It would be difficult to find any faults , As a solo traveller I really appreciated how friendly the staff were they were helpful and informative and took the time to make me feel at home although I was only there for 5 nights 
247717,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, When booking a period hotel Would have liked a period room as well A fridge in the room for our water etc would have been great , Front staff always at their best Prompt room service Location was marvelous
247718,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Fridge in room would be better stocked as mini bar instead of being empty, Beautiful building decor really salubrious beautiful entrance lobby good size rooms and comfortable beds too

247721,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The bar was closing up when I returned from dinner and I was not able to get a night cap even through room service Surprising for a hotel of this level , It is indeed a grand hotel with impressive Victorian marble lobby Very spacious bedroom
247722,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Rooms a bit small Would have been great if a bar fridge was included , Great location close to top sights to see Nice restaurants nearby Staff were very friendly and accommodating 
247723,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, The staff were really welcoming the hotel is absolutely stunning We love coming to London looking out on to Trafalgar Square was amazing Would definitely recommend The Grand Trafalgar Square 
247724,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Lovely Hotel very close Trafalgar Square to many of the London landmarks bus taxi links We didn t eat at the Hotel Their is a great cafe Garfunkels just a few yards away that does a really nice breakfast for about 5 6 each that we tried 20 each in the hotel Well worth a visit I would definately stop here again the location is fab they have a lovely bar area too 
247725,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The room that was given to us we thought was very poor even thou we was in it much it was tiny and the view was terrible Shame as we really had a nice time , The location was fantastic
247726,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Well the rooms were very small and very expensive as well no breakfast makes this a very inconvenient location is ok but for solo business travellers like us there r better options at this price may b IHG properties makes it a better sense ,No Positive
247727,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Hard pillows , Excellent cocktails in Boyd s served by a polite and friendly member of staff Great room with everything you would expect On tap chilled water and ice at the water stations on each floor was a real bonus 
247728,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We had the worst view from our second floor room We ordered room service and the expensively prices dishes arrived on paper plates and looked not far from dog sick The selection of artisan ice creams tasted like some cheap brand from a tub and was a half melted slush , The location is unbeatable central London but nicely positioned just off Trafalgar Square 
247729,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Nothing Staff excellent It was my 60th birthday and we were presented with a bottle of wine and a few goodies A nice touch , Didn t have as very expensive
247730,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Breakfast very expensive so many excellent cafes nearby for less than half the price of the hotel , Our room was fabulous and the bed was just superb Trafalgar Square is just so central to all the tourist sights We walked everywhere and you just see so much more 
247731,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We arrived at one o clock and although we could leave our bags would have liked to have been able to freshen up in our room before three o clock Surely if guests have to leave by twelve noon some rooms will be vacant before three it felt like someone was sticking to a rigid rule rather than putting them selves in the shoes of the customer which is the essence of good service But the staff were otherwise friendly and helpful ,No Positive
247732,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Water in the room in addition to the coolers outside , Great location covent garden and Leicester square just a 7minute walk away One of the better rooms in central London at the price 
247733,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The shower leaked on to the floor which didnt affect its use but made a bit of a mess for the cleaners , The bed was very comfy location great and overall a lovely hotel 
247734,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, On our arrival we had Dirty sheets and towels which were quickly changed once we told the staff This hotel takes payment and then holds an extra 300 for a week after your stay, Amazing location for attractions in central London
247735,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The atmosphere felt like we didn t belong in the building The staff seemed very blunt and un willing to welcome me We assumed its because we were young and looked like a waste of time We wanted to eat at the restaurant within the hotel but due to not feeling wanted we found other places to go , The hotel was nice and provided a lot of facilities for us to use Very high standards 
247736,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, No complaints at all , The room is more spacious than most locations in central London at this price range The location is excellent in easy walking distance to many attractions and public transport offerings 
247737,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Noise We couldn t open the window because there was an engine on the roof that made a lot of noise constantly Day and Night So we had to close the window and open the air condition But the air conditioner was very old and made a lot of noise too So i couldn t sleep well I guess it s not relevant for all the rooms but the rooms that happen to be at the side of this engine Unfortunately I forgot the room number , Location is perfect Ideal to visit theatres 2 underground stations near by just couldn t be better 
247738,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Unfortunately our stay was marred by drunkards in nearby rooms arguing in the middle of several nights sleep No fridge in room We had to drag heavy cases up stairs due to layout of floors Not good for a hotel claiming to be classy , Great location with most of London s big attractions within an easy walk If you like bustling cities you can not get a better base point 
247739,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The lift didn t work very well sometimes, The staff was very nice and the location is absolute great Two mins to the underground station and lots of supermarkets in that area

247741,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, No door man Poor reception area very small Very expensive expected three beds not a fold up sofa No complimentary sweets or biscuits , Convenient location for a theatre trip 
247742,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Toilet facitities in hotel entrance needed to use a lift that did not work and corridors full of trollies and boxes , The locality was great accomodation was fine restaurant was excellent 
247743,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, nothing really was better than expected and we only had breakfast o 1 time which was fine bar was available for quiet drink so nothing not to like unless your expecting 5 star luxury, location for the price in London absolute bargain was expecting motel type accommodation but was nice clean and walking distance to most tourist spots
247744,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Bad smell of moisture and fungus in lift corridors Smell like a grave yard and dean corpse Horrible feeling for such a hotel Very disappointed staying there , Not much indeed Location difficult to find
247745,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Complimentary chilled water available nearby but the ice machines on our floor and the one above were both inoperative by nighttime although working again in the morning No late night residents bar , Very comfortable good sized bed Period high ceilinged room with ample space Effective and quiet air conditioning View overlooking leafy Northumberland Avenue All this in a standard room in The Grand 
247746,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Ideal location for London sight seeing or a trip to the West End Very helpful staff that made the experience smooth and seamless easy access to the underground and plenty of options for dinner brunch and shopping
247747,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Baby cot was not suitable for a baby baby bed like a stone I paid hotel fee before our accommodation but reception holded a block 110 to my credit card It was an expression of distrust, Location and staff were perfect 
247748,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Could of done with more pillars on the bed very minor issue , Iced water which you can fill up in the hallway fridge in your room great feel to the room nice size too Amazing bar area friendly staff

247751,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The staff were not very friendly or helpful Nothing was explained to us on arrival with regards to opening hours of bar or any other services offered It s a shame as this hotel has great potential to be fabulous Location is fantastic but the lack of services and staff let it down , Location was excellent Very central The reception area was traditional and very grand just as expected Impressive to enter but the bar was closed early every evening so didn t even get a chance to visit after day out 
247752,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, There was no mini bar The ice machine in the corridor never worked there wasn t even water in the room There was no room service Will not be back, Location
247753,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, noisy specially early morning when the cleaners and stuff walk around or clean other rooms the walls doors should be more sound proof our first room had a weird smell I think it s coming from the kitchen thru the air conditioner but the staff changed our room and really appreciate it, Great location friendly stuff really enjoyed staying here which it just 15 minute walk to Covent garden and picaddily circus and 2 minutes walk to underground station Decent size of room and bed very clean
247754,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The price They call their rooms queen rooms which one could stupidly mistake for meaning queen sized bed as opposed to a slightly less small standard room Would have booked elsewhere if it had been made clear , The decor in the lobby was the only thing I liked really
247755,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Traffic noise heard from front facing room but moved to very quiet room in Club Quarters , Excellent cooked full English breakfast very rare in London Free filtered ice cold water tea coffee milk sugar available from store room Very important for tea drinkers 
247756,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Paid separately for breakfast but were overcharged three times before they got it right Booked for three persons but apart from number of beds room was only set out for 2 persons e g toiletries Apart from two hooks in bathroom no where to put clothes towels Extra hooks and or a chair bench shelf would enhance bathrooom , Staff were very friendly and helpful Good breakfast plenty of choice Room was spacious kitchenette was good Filter water available plus ice Had a Dolche Gusto coffee maker but no pods 
247757,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, hotel needs to renovate a bit more, Very nice Hotel in an outstanding place Rooms are very good i loved the ICE Machine in each floor very near to the tub stations and 10 mins walking from most things to do in London
247758,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Ironing facilities which were one of the reason to choose The Grand among the similar hotels in the area are not really a part of room facilities they are shared Not a big issue but requires a bit of an extra arrangement The room we booked standard queen room was rather dark and with a strange smell didn t feel right for that class of the hotel Staff were very nice We were offered to change to a brighter but smaller room without a safe box and mini bar Not sure if it was a fair exchange but at the end we jury s enjoyed the location a lot , Location It s perfect for a short trip to London close to basically all the city highlights 
247759,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Very noisy with workmen drilling outside at one in the morning Smoke detectors activated my shower as there was no extra in the bathroom Was told I could drop the car off at hotel and it would be parked this was not the case , Location
247760,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Elevator doors close too abruptly and hit my husband s shoulder before stopping apparently the motion sensor wasn t working properly , Location it was close to everything We could walk ANYWHERE 
247761,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Didn t sleep well with creaking noises into the night even though I was as the end of a corridor Full freeview was not available therefore limited channels Under the bed had bits of wood rubbish gathering dust , Room service from Boyds was excellent 
247762,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Quite simply the entrance and bar restaurant is a disaster Tables and hard chairs in front of the bar What was wrong with how you had it before with soft comfortable leather sofas and chairs It was much more welcoming and looked classy and in keeping with the hotel Now it looks like a cheap cafe and something you ve just added on for the day If you think about it what else is on offer to visitors It all centres around the entrance It s a meeting place We won t return unless this is changed, Love the building and especially the location Rooms very comfortable and quiet
247763,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Whoops all on wrong side so guess this won t be included and i m not writing it all again Situation and friendly staff only REAL good points Room had problems with key and 9th floor so a real PAIN having to go down to reception Not great cleaning view not great smelt funny in room and could not open window more in the column pop , We forgot to take do not disturb sign off the door and bed room not serviced i apologised and asked for towels i told them don t worry about making the bed they didn t ha my own fault NO BATH we were told they had smoking rooms by your company wron they have no facilities THEREFORE CIGERETTE ENDS ALL AROUND THE FRONT STEPS not good AND I M A SMOKER BUTI USED THE BIN PROVIDED BUT THEY SHOULD NOT ALLOW A PARTY FROM A PRIVATE ROOM TO SPILL OUT AND YOUNG PEOPLE SAT ON STEPS WITH GLASSES SMOKING AND A BIT ROWDY i don t sleep well so i came down to get air as WINDOWS DO NOT OPEN and felt very uncomfortable Our room had dust on top of microwave and not that well cleaned i had to ask for sugar not refilled The view was supposed to be the best room as it was our wedding anniversary we could see Big Ben etc but more the air conditioning units again Not Great Our key for our room 4 times we had to return to reception they gave us a free breakfast oH AND THE HEATERS dO NOT WORK SO BIT NIPPY AT NIGHT We paid 550 for 3 nights tHE HOTEL IS A FEW MINS WALK FROM TRAFALGAR SO AS I DONT SLEEP SPENT A FEW OURS SAT IN THERE AS NO SITTING ROOM AND I DID NOT WANT DISTURB MY HUSBAND A lot of info but all true 
247764,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I suppose the bar experience was quite good with very good and friendly staff The price of drinks was i felt high hence the reason why very few were there when frequented it , The business Center was a great help and quite The printers kept running out of paper but the staff at reception were professional in sorting this out

247767,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The small room which looked out onto a building site Little drawer space No dressing gowns , The location was excellent with friendly efficient staff 
247768,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Well we booked the Grand and ended up in Club Quarters I use them on business but would not have used them for a weekend away they make me feel as if I am still working so I felt I had been missold why not promote as CQ if thats what you are selling I guess I am not alone and that fills the rooms at the weekend, Well positioned comfortable hotel
247769,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Poor breakfast arrangements The cooked breakfast did not include the continental buffet so if you wanted anything from the buffet as well you had to pay for the full continental breakfast on top of the cost of the cooked breakfast The Air conditioning in the bedroom was ineffective and the room was stifling Even with the window open it wasn t possible to get the temperature down to a comfortable level, Excellent location
247770,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Lack of tea and coffee facilities unless you helped yourself as advised by housekeeping Sort of self service but you had paid well to stay at the hotel Bad mistake , Location and room
247771,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Hotel doesn t have its own kitchen need to order out and had to use adjoining restaurant freezer to store ice pack Towels weren t changed half of our stay used dirty towels were rehung Rooms old and cramp Odd AC Not many appropriate restaurants around , The staff were very friendly and helpful Free water fountain and bottles Environmentally friendly Location was near two stations 
247772,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The room wasn t made up and had to ask for more shower gel , Plenty of sockets UK 3pin type isn t charger built into the bedside socket iPod speaker for use on an iPhone 6 connector Free wifi air on Decent bathroom with plenty of mirrors Free ice and cooled water in the corridor

247774,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, The beds were so comfy slept like a log A lovely quiet room very spacious too Really nice tea coffee provided in the room Loved the purified water machine in the hallway to a real bonus The hotel was in such a brilliant location across from Trafalgar Square Walking distance of Covent Gdn China town Leicester Sq Piccadilly Booked to go back 
247775,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, window looked out onto a wall on check in staff did not mention anything about breakfast or meals at the hotel should this be required, Excellent location clean room
247776,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Prices in the bar are a bit steep with the added 12 service charge, Ice water dispensers and free water bottles available to use as desired is a nice touch
247777,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Kettle was faulty in the room Automatic switch off once boiled did not work so kettle got so hot I scalded my hand trying to turn it off manually Reported to reception who apologised , Comfy quiet room Free water is a plus and hotel in great location

247780,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The decor is simply terrible and the lighting grim Strongly in need of reformation , Nice bar but the rooms are depressing charmless and institutional
247781,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The lady receptionist at the arrival till was not friendly She was out first point of contact and yet she provided a bad service Appreciate the other staff were great in their services but this first experience nearly ruined our stay , The accommodation was value for money and extremely neat Highly recommendable 
247782,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The carpet looked outdated, Staff were helpful and friendly the location is within walking distance of many places of interest like Big Ben Buckingham palace and Trafalgar Square We booked a standard queen room which was very spacious
247783,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Absolutely nothing , Location was excellent easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace Big Ben Westminster and the Leicester Square Bedroom was large really quiet and the bed really comfortable We highly recommend this hotel and can t wait to come back soon 
247784,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Watch out for prices in the bar they add 12 5 Service to everything Go to one of the cafes next door for breakfast and save 30 a head Room price quoted did not include VAT so watch for such extras , Bed very comfortable and room very quiet ask for one at the back no view but you will sleep soundly Location is one of the best around for things to walk to and for transport hub 
247785,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,No Negative, Very comfortable bed and clean room Great location We went to the theatre in Covent Garden which was easily walkable and location was very close to all the sights and many restauarants nearby 
247786,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We were showed three rooms all small poor view no fridge some no bath anyway we eventually ended up in a SHOW room Next morning we asked room service for fresh coffee we had to go down for that okay we went down and your male staff did not even know what coffee it was we tried one it was look warm we left it and went down the road for a decent coffee That night after the show we went to bed 11 00 pm and had the worst nights sleep possible with the noise outside and residents slamming the doors subsequently we only got a couple of hours sleep The next day we wandered around London like zombies having a few drinks thinking that would help however despite this again we had an appalling nights sleep to such an extent Monday we just checked out going straight to Victoria with a train back to Brighton, Not much this was booked on the 25th April through booking com my requests were a quiet double room with a bath and if possible with a view I called your hotel on Friday 29th to see if all okay however the male staff that answered clearly told me he had no record of my reservation that was obviously the start of the saga I had to then call booking com costing me time and money they assured me l was booked in so l called your hotel and your Olga verified my booking not a good start When we arrived it looked impressive however they were still sorting a room out so we had some drinks and food at the bar and that was good after this it was all downhill 
247787,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The hotel had a lot closed off think this was down to it being rented for a wedding or something , Excellent location Clean spacious room with comfy bed Staff were very helpful Tea coffee sugar milk mugs spoons and kettle Fridge Heating and air conditioning easy and manageable Allowed luggage to stay with the hotel till end of stay free of charge 
247788,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, We did not realised we could order a different pillow and my wife was not that comfortable with the one provided plus she thought the room wouldn t heat up enough , Susana did a tremendous job checking us in recommending a better room for 10 pounds more that was worth it and helping us all the way including early check in which helped us scheduling the rest of the day She made a difference in our stay for sure

247795,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, For the price the rooms were standard nothing wrong just nothing special and at the weekends not all room service available, Location was great and reception and bar lovely
247796,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Did not like the fact that money was stolen from a locked suitcase after house keeping cleaned the room the staff did not seem to care about the fact money was stolen or do anything about it the fact that when I checked in they tried to up the price by 100 and that housekeeping woke us up at 8 45am to clean our room Would not recommend to anyone unless you want money stolen and want to be woken up at the crack of dawn , N a 
247797,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Expensive for 1 night for 2 people and the hotel room did not even had a bath Noisy at night sound insulation could have been better as i could clearly hear the outside, Great location and on walking distance to Covent Garden and Soho Hotel room and toilet were clean 
247798,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The price hardly any drink making facilities and the fact they must have asked for my card details at least 3 times and before we went to bed they wanted to take 30 more than originally stated, Very clean the shower was lovely 
247799,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Room tired Shower house leaked profusely at its joint with the wall No light switch for the main light by the bed Room very cold at night and no extra covers available Finally I asked for help to carry my case down the stairs from the entrance to the street and was told that the staff member who was standing inside the door said he couldn t leave his post I walk with a stick and the short lift wasn t working A black cab driver waiting for someone outside saw me and came to help Diabolical , Comfortable bed

247801,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Old fashioned room Would have liked a fridge for the money the room cost Furnishings were old fashioned and why would we require books and a dictionary , Good location
247802,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, I thought that there might be biscuits provided with the tea and coffee as in other hotels we have stayed in and I was disappointed there were no robes provided to wear around the bedroom , The location of the hotel was perfect for the theatres and stations The bed was comfy and the toiletries a nice touch The teas and coffees were of a good standard The staff especially in Boyds Bar were exceptionally friendly and accommodating 
247803,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Fire alarm going off at 3 30 in morning and staff no idea what to do and how to turn it off got to sleep at about 5 45 after allarm was turned ofc,No Positive

247805,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, hardly open the toilet door due the bed blocking the way tooth brush and toothpaste was not supplied in the hotel amenities, wifi connection was very good and I like the little kitchenette in the room and of course the chilled filter water along the lobby and nice location for everything restaurants and sight seeing tours and walking distance from phil embassy which is great 
247806,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, N A, Great service Excellent location and very clean Restaurant catered for my wife s dietary requirements very well and everything was of a high standard

247808,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The room was quite cold and the heating was controlled by a noisy fan Service charge was added to all drinks ordered at the bar and was not cheap Staff were friendly , The location was excellent 
247809,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The bathroom was a little small and the bed wasn t as comfy as it could have been The room could have been cleaner , The staff were so friendly and helpful and the shower had really good pressure The location was spot on 
247810,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, A shame the bed was only Queen sized but we knew that on advance Breakfast too pricey so we didnt bother , Good sized and well equipped standard room in a quality hotel and superb central location
247811,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, For the high quality of this hotel it was surprising that there were no luggage porters and no doorman outside the main entrance to meet and greet guests hail taxis or assist with luggage This is more of an observation than a criticism , Fantastic location Beautiful main lobby and bar Very hospitable and courteous check in staff 
247812,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Breakfast was not included in my room rate and I did not want to pay 20 Pounds for breakfast the hotel charged There were 2 restaurants just a couple doors away that served a full English breakfast for just under 6 Pounds , Location was perfect Close to 2 tube stops and a 2 minute walk to Trafalgar Square Staff was very accommodating when we arrived hours before check in and let us store our bags so we didn t have to tote them with us Room was large by London standard and bed was very comfortable 
247813,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, A range of pillow thicknesses but I m sure there may well have been some in the visitor lockers if I d looked , Always stay here when go into London to the theatre Love the breakfast 
247814,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Cups n saucers in room rather than black mugs But only if I m being picky Other than that wouldn t change anything, Location was fab n whole experience was great
247815,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, Breakfast is extra and quite expensive particularly when service and VAT which don t appear in the advertised price are added , This hotel is very convenient everything we d planned to do was within walking distance Our room was reasonably sized and had an open view a firm comfortable bed and a large HD television The hotel was spotlessly clean throughout Our room was a fraction cool though I d rather a slightly cool room than an overheated one it may be that I didn t understand how to operate the heating 
247816,The Grand at Trafalgar Square, The charge for breakfast I thought was rather high when you can eat in the restaurant on an evening for less I would recommend not booking breakfast as there are plenty of places nearby where you can pick up a coffee and something to eat I also thought the queen suite for a family of three would be larger than it was there wasn t much space at all in the room for a family When you opened the bathroom door it banged against the sofa bed The only place to sit because of this on an evening was on the bed , Location of the hotel was fantastic with everything you need a stone throw away I like the fresh water and ice on every level of the hotel too readily available The bed was comfortable and the fridge in the room was a bonus There is a Tesco express under the hotel for all your requirements We had a room on the front of the hotel and the room was nice and quiet We didn t use any of the hotel facilities purely because we were so busy I would recommend this hotel purely for location purposes
