117428,Sansi Diputacio, First room the air conditioner wasn t working old room separate beds for us couple and horrendous smell We asked for another room but again air conditioner wasn t working in the middle of heat wave The breakfast is 15 euros p p You can cross the street and eat a real local breakfast for half of it , Restaurant across the street opens at 6am and closes at 2am Food was delicious service excellent good energy nice spot to eat all the time 
117429,Sansi Diputacio,No Negative, The value for money was the greatest I ve seen during our trip for Barcelona at least with the Booking Genius price The stuff was really helpful and we could store our luggage both on very early arrival and a very late leave Location was good for taking a bus to the airport
117430,Sansi Diputacio, Seems like the cleaning personal misunderstood the sign at the door Cleaning sign means cleaning and sleeping sign means don t disturb But not at this place The window was open and no handle to the window so had to go and ask for it But guess the usually have control over it its a good hotel , I like the area its close to passeig de gracia and shopping restaurant and sightseeing streak I recommend this hotel 
117431,Sansi Diputacio, Having a Pool would have been better I felt the check in was not secure and gave a bad first impression as only tiny desk and lots of staff running about Asked for a double room and got twin Couldn t sleep well as Windows too thin For a fairly quiet street it sounded like there was a party outside the 6th floor window at 3am , Location was good as very central 
117432,Sansi Diputacio, to be asked to forward my booking com booking via e mail upon check in being told that it is company policy the bed which had a very cheap mattress that my room was not cleaned while I was there, location smiley staff
117433,Sansi Diputacio, Our room was rather small not sure if all are like this but you expect to be bigger at a 4 star hotel There were some on going construction activities inside the hotel We were not announced about this and one morning we were woke up by the noise made by the workers It wasn t a big deal as we had anyway to wake up and start the daily tour through the city It s just that we were not announced about it so we adjust our schedule accordingly going to bed earlier so we wake up earlier And of course during such a period a compensation for customers is expected , The hotel has a very good location being close to the Barcelona attractions to the city tour station As well a lot of nice restaurants and coffee shops are in the area It was clean and the personnel was very nice 
117434,Sansi Diputacio, Yeah the glass bathroom doors is a designer s fail but not a tragic issue Would be nice to have kettle and tea coffe self service in room available but that doesn t seem to be a 4 service standard in Barcelona , The staff provided probably the best service I ve come across in Barcelona and I ve been staying in a lot of hotels in this city over the past year All the little details of a great hospitality level calling the elevator and actually acompanying to the room to make sure the key was working helping with luggage even if it was just a carry on etc The room was comfortable clean looked fresh and nice 
117435,Sansi Diputacio, A C in room noisy and useless felt like a hairdryer blowing hot air Coffee at breakfast not great, Super friendly staff and brilliant location Breakfast great
117436,Sansi Diputacio, Couldn t understand why the room s window was locked and we had to call someone every time to get some fresh air, Good location 3mins walk from Passieg de Gracia 7mins walk from Placa De Catalunya 25mins walk from Barceloneta good sized clean room very comfortable bed very friendly polite staff
117437,Sansi Diputacio, This is not a four star hotel Certainly not yet 1 ply toilet paper small crispy towels bathroom fittings are worn and in disrepair Scuff marks across the walls You can hear everything going on in other rooms from the window which faces into a central courtyard They claimed not to have received our special dietary request and made no effort to cater to it , The staff were friendly and helpful The room was clean The bed was a proper double bed which is rare in European hotels Best stocked mini bar I ve seen yet 
117438,Sansi Diputacio, Aircon not switched on yet because still on winter program even though 25 degrees in room needed to open window for cool 2nights Friday and Saturday in hotel nightclub across road had hundreds of people talkimg in the street both nights until 5am And room too hot to sleep with window closed, Elegant
117439,Sansi Diputacio, We were not allocated a double as requested and were given the option of an uncomfortable twin or a tiny double that seemed to be for single occupation Overall we felt the hotel lacked the quality one would hope from a 4 and would liken it to more of a soulless 2 We frequently visit Barcelona as it is such a vibrant and stylish city which is not reflected in this lacklustre and unremarkable hotel , The location was fine
117440,Sansi Diputacio, Room Phone was not working There was no soap in the soap dispenser Internet very slow But in compensation they extended my check out time till 3pm so I am happy , it was a comfortable stay The room and toilet was very good decor Clean Location very good for me just round the corner of the university Staff was friendly 
117441,Sansi Diputacio, The positioof the breakfast room was off putting , The beds were the most comfortable I have had in an hotel room You can open the windows Showers were great 
117442,Sansi Diputacio, Bed sheets were not changed at all during our 5 nights stay Poor light in the room Windows cannot be opened, Location of the hotel Really comfortable bed Friendly stuff
117443,Sansi Diputacio, Breakfast buffet reminds me by orphanage food Room on street on friday sat is very noisey illy coffee aparently not served although the machine is displayed in front of us it looks like being put for decoration Worst was that big insect in shower Not once but twice , Friendliness of staff
117444,Sansi Diputacio, Bathroom they need to clean around the bath so mouldy and disgusting Building works a real pest Stayed on 5 floor and could still hear the banging as if it was next door Not what you need when you are trying to relax , Room bathroom were beautiful Room clean Staff very helpful friendly 
117445,Sansi Diputacio, The bathroom needs to be renovated We had not only a damaged shower but also a yellow huge spot like 1m radius on the ceiling and rusty bath on side lt doesn t look like 4 stars level not nice at all I mean the bathroom is decent but these cosmetic things simply stand out and spoil the whole picture , Ladies at the reception were very friendly and super helpful Room was rather quiet did not hear any neighbors although there were plenty of people in the hotel may be not on our floor Location is amazing if you want to be close to the great restaurants and tapas bars to the metro and Aerobus and in walking distance from the old city

117449,Sansi Diputacio, The staff was unacceptable Especially Aylin We were precharged for parking and by the time we arrived they said they no longer have a parking place so they sent us to another one for which we also paid 61 50 The problem is we still didn t get our 72 60 that we had prepaid And it s been 2 weeks since our stay Aslo a week before our stay they had sent us an e mail telling us that there had been something wrong with the payment but the bank said they had already got the money weeks ago Nothing like that has ever happened to me before and I am traveling a lot They still haven t paid me back for the parking they don t even have Barcelona is amazing Just choose another hotel , location
