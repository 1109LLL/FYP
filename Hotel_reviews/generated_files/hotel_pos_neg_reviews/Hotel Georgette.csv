162826,Hotel Georgette, Booking com did not make it clear that my child could not stay Vincent and staff made a one time exception and we will always be grateful , Vincent was superb 
162827,Hotel Georgette, There wasn t a complimentary water , I loved the excellent customer service and location The staff makes you feel like you are the only customer there They are very attentive and helpful They made me feel so welcomed there I felt safe to walk around solo There is so many restaurants to choose from Also all the attractions are walking distance I will definitely return 
162828,Hotel Georgette, Sometimes the Wi Fi was very slow , Very cozy and clean hotel Though the rooms are small but as i understood all the rooms in Paris are small and there is no really a need for in a bigger space Me and my friend shared a room of two and it was quite enough The location is great quiet and close to transportation shopping centers and there are really good restaurants in a walk distance of several minutes only The staff is more than kind always happy to help Very recommended 
162829,Hotel Georgette,No Negative, The room was very comfortable if small The location was excellent it felt like everything was within walking distance including many good restaurants This hotel is especially well located if you intend to take the RER to or from the airport 
162830,Hotel Georgette, Hairdryer stopped working when it got hot Nowhere to hang hand towel in bathroom, Excellent location really friendly and helpful staff lovely clean hotel and room very comfortable bed 
162831,Hotel Georgette, More information in the room about local restaurants bars and how to get around But don t get me wrong the hotel georgette is a beautiful hotel and definitely value for money , The staff were very pleasant and helpful The hotel was very clean and I would have definitely paid more than the room rate for the room that we had 
162832,Hotel Georgette,No Negative, Fantastic location perfect if you are in town for anything at the Parc D Expositions an easy walk to the Ch telet les Halles station with a direct train to the grounds Staff was friendly and helpful Great area if travelling alone or too tired to venture far after a day out tons of restaurants to choose from I like staying in this arr and this was the best location I ve stayed at 
162833,Hotel Georgette, I was told I was getting a free upgrade but the room was tiny I can only imagine what my standard room would have looked like They make you hand in your room key every time you go out and also the main door can only be opened by receptionist in and out So when I was standing there waiting for it to be opened it was freezing that night When I left at 6 30am the next morning the night guy wasnt there and I couldnt open the door my taxi was outside waiting to take me to airport I was shouting hello to try to find someone when they turned up I just wanted out I d already gave them credit card for charges so they could charge anything from mini bar But he said no we d need to do it now I was locked in so no choice I had only one small bottle of Evian for which he said was 8 65 Euros I didn t have time to ask or argue just paid so I could get out The toilet was a sperate small room from the shower sink so not good for washing hands The safe didnt work , Location
162834,Hotel Georgette, Just missing a car park but there is an underground public car park not far but very expensive , The situation was ideal central and near public transport The rooms were great modern and quiet The staff was very friendly The cost was very reasonnable
162835,Hotel Georgette, Room sizes were on the smaller size however it s a city centre hotel so that is to be expected One thing that we didn t particularly like however is that the pictures show when booking are of the top floor rooms so we booked under the assumption that the rooms would be bigger than they were and also have a nice bath tub however this wasn t the case What they gave us wasn t bad it just wasn t what we were expecting Also by booking through booking com we were supposed to have late check out at 2pm on the final day as part of being a member of the website however we started getting calls at 12pm saying we had to check out I reminded the reception staff that we had late check out through our booking and he said that s dependent on availability which I thought they could have mentioned from the beginning , Staff were really friendly and happy to help hotel location is perfect for visiting the sights around Paris was also generally very clean 
162836,Hotel Georgette,No Negative, The photos are accurate The rooms are gorgeous I stayed in two large rooms with king size beds and spacious baths and sitting area Clean wonderfully decorated and so very comfortable The staff is friendly and helpful Conveniently located on the heart of the Marais District The Hotel Georgette is walking distance from great restaurants buzz worthy bars the Pompidou Museum and a Mass Transit hub 
162837,Hotel Georgette, the hotel is on an extremely busy road and even with the double glazing the noise was unbearable I had to sleep with ear plugs the extra large bed is actually two singles pushed together so you can feel the split down the middle when you are sleeping the deluxe room seems outdated and not as deluxe as I would have hoped the wifi is really slow there were no toiletries on the second day of my stay so I had to request them from the front desk , the location is brilliant the hotel is right next to a metro stop and within walking distance to all of the central tourist spots the staff was very friendly and the deluxe room had a bathroom that was really nice with a huge shower and bathtub there was a minibar and safe and the a c worked well 
162838,Hotel Georgette, It s overall clean the bathroom was spotless clean but the bedroom lacked some attention to details like stains on the wall and overall a bit dusty For the wifi you need to get a ticket with the login and password for each device and it only lasts 24hs not very convenient some times , It was the 2nd time we ve stayed here and again really enjoyed it Will definitely come back Great bedrooms excelent bathroom and great location We have been before during summer and the air con works perfectly great after a hot Parisian sunny day 
162839,Hotel Georgette,No Negative, The location could not be better for walking The rooms aren t big and things were a bit tight for having a baby stroller Our baby was 11 weeks during our visit and we had a travel bassinet which was perfect I would definitely return to this hotel 
162840,Hotel Georgette, The room could have been a bit bigger although for this price it s normal in Paris, Breakfast was great value for money as was the daily glass of champagne 
162841,Hotel Georgette,No Negative, Apart that the hotel has good breakfast good location near 3 main metros clean helpful staff and a very nice room We also requested a certain room and they managed to make us happy and also gave us a complementary Champagne Will definitely recommend this Hotel 
162842,Hotel Georgette, A bit tiny room but hey That s Paris And we didn t spend much time there , The very friendly and profesionnal staff a glass champagne each at arrival you had me by champagne and of course the location The street isn t especially charming but it s SO close to everything Bring walkingshoes 
162843,Hotel Georgette, The toilet facilities are deteriorated and the shower didn t work properly it was a hassle to switch the waterfall shower on and off we have booked for the hotel about 6 months ago to reside in the penthouse room and they have give us the deluxe room on the 1st floor and we have been charged for the penthouse room , The location close to many grocery shops and close to the metro and railway station

162848,Hotel Georgette, The rooms were very small so tricky to get cases arranged and there was no cutlery or even a teaspoon if you wanted to buy snacks or have drinks Didn t opt for the breakfast as it was quite pricey considering the same money you could spend at cafe to get more options , The staff were lovely and helpful at the hotel and kindly upgraded our room The beds were huge and so comfortable Very quiet room and had some nice cafes close as well as grocery store on the opposite side of the street The bathroom was exquisite 
162849,Hotel Georgette, The breakfast , The hotel was in a excellent location staff was friendly and helpful Room was big and comfy Bathroom is amazing My 4 year old son was very pleased too Also I good location for Disneyland 35 40mins 
162850,Hotel Georgette, I have booked for a superior double room upon my request I stayed there 1 more day and they had to changed my room with a standard one but the standard room was more quiet and bigger I did not understand their classification try not to have a room on the side road there is an event center where people talk loud till 3 am , The room is very professionally furbished shower is excellent A C well functioning minibar available lift is secure and new the corridors are new and the carpet in very good condition compared to those in same cat in Paris 
162851,Hotel Georgette, We got one of the superior room that was cute but a little bit unpractical Very tiny closet far too small Idem for the washbasin The bed was comfortable but high so high that our heads hit the roof many times Why an open shower put a curtain in please , Great position close to Etien Marcel Rambutou and Hotel de la Ville metro station Clean and nice friendly staff
