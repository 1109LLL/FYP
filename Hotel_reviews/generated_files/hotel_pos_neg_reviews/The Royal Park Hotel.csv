138214,The Royal Park Hotel,No Negative, This was my second booking at the hotel and we found it a quiet place to stay in the Sussex Gardens area Room was large and we enjoyed having a bathtub The location can t be beat A five minute walk to Paddington Station We chose to not eat breakfast at the hotel because as with all hotels it was fairly pricey Delightful little cafe a short block away for breakfast 
138215,The Royal Park Hotel, Our room was missing the compendium , Bed extra comfortable The room was extremely quiet and air conditioned The window had very heavy drapes that helped reduce the noise Location was fabulous with easy access to Paddington Station and Hyde Park 
138216,The Royal Park Hotel, We liked everything about the Hotel and location , Elegant and welcoming Hotel Friendly and professional staff The surroundings including the bar and garden area were comfortable Our room was beautifully furnished with some thoughtful welcome platters of fresh fruit Excellent shower We would not hesitate to return to explore the area further especially the delights of Kensington Gardens There were also some excellent restaurants and bars nearby 
138217,The Royal Park Hotel, There is nothing I don t like about this hotel , As a returning client over many years I cannot speak highly enough of the service which is above and beyond expectations The warm friendly welcome and most obliging staff are superb I could not have been better treated as a guest As a long haul traveler I usually arrive at the hotel at an unavoidably early hour and the staff go out of their way to ensure I am made as comfortable as possible if my room is not ready Much appreciated The new bar area and bar service is a welcome addition too the decor is very nicely done and the light snack menu is great when you don t want to dine out 
138218,The Royal Park Hotel, Breakfast is awful Do not have breakfast in this hotel Less than a min away you will find excellent cafe bars serving a good full English breakfast for 3 50 This includes unlimited tea and coffee and beans as a standard part of a full English Breakfast Unlike this hotel Both mornings we came down to an empty restaurant bar where breakfast is served both mornings we had to find a member of staff to clear a table so that we could sit down We ordered breakfast which as we are both Gluten intolerant not by choice this is a medical condition we could not eat anything offered on the continental breakfast list However the continental choice is limited to pastries yogurt and fruit There were fruit juices on offer however no glasses to drink it out of We waited 10 mins for 2 glasses in order to have some fruit juice We orderd a full English breakfast and asking for beans as part of it along with Gluten free toast and poached eggs and smoked salmon On day one we received nothing close to our order however as we were meeting friends in London we had no time to wait for an elusive member of staff to appear so just left Hungary and thirsty as our tea arrived 30 mins after we had ordered it On the second day we ordered toast as soon as we had cleared our own table along with a decaf tea unfortunately the member of staff did not understand that tea can be decaf and kept trying to bring us coffee which we don t drink After three trips back to the kitchen we finally got hot drinks however no toast Our full English breakfast came without beans after asking twice more we both received a huge bowl of beans to go with our now half eaten breakfast still no toast Finally again after asking we received toast but no butter A lovely American guest sitting next to us offered us her butter so we could at least have hot toast unfortunately our toast was hard and cold it had obviously been waiting in the kitchen for a long time , Staff very friendly Bar staff particularly excellent nothing is too much trouble and they make amazing cocktails The bar tender will adapt any cocktail to suit your tastes If you are spending the day in London I would recommend spending the evening in the hotel bar The small sharing plates are excellent Could not fault food and drink in the evening Reception staff all very friendly and welcoming very nice extra touches in the rooms and attentive staff 
138219,The Royal Park Hotel, Room is a bit small but understandable given the location , Good location near the Paddington station It s very convenient for us coming back from Cardiff in the midnight The staffs are very kind and helpful 
138220,The Royal Park Hotel, They forgot our night turndown and therefore was no bottle water in the room , Excellent bed clean room excellent service staff doorman Fantastic location great price Welcome macaroons were a nice touch we always stay at St Pancreas this was as good or better 
138221,The Royal Park Hotel, Room was terribly noisy right beside the kitchen Must have been the noisiest and worst hotel room for noise that we have stayed in Terribly noisy till midnight noisy from 6 00 am Probably a very nice place to stay if you have a nicely located room Ours was not and we would not return for that reason alone Wi Fi was useless and didn t seem to work much , Good bar
138222,The Royal Park Hotel, The WI FI did drop a few times and did seem to be better later at night but that was my only quibble , As a returning guest I always like the greeting upon arrival The conceirge always remembers me and makes me feel at home The location is excellent with Paddington Station 2 minutes away and the lovely quaint Pride of Paddington pub which we always visit for a few evening drinks 
138223,The Royal Park Hotel, only gripe I ever have is that the only mirrors are either in the bathroom or inside the wardrobe with no plug socket nearby to be able to dry my hair but I always manage , Love The Royal Park We ve been many times and stayed in all types of room from standard to four poster with the same excellent quality in all rooms Extremely comfy beds and the addition of coffee machine kettle is great The new bar area is a great addition and although we didn t eat from the menu the food that other people were having looked really nice Very handy for the Heathrow express underground stations and buses including the London Tourist bus 
138224,The Royal Park Hotel, The variety of continental breakfast was less than expected although it was ok , The room was clean Wifi worked well Bed was comfortable I will be back in the future 
138225,The Royal Park Hotel, I was very happy with my stay , Very comfortable bed selection of different pillows which is excellent as I like a thin pillow nice room fabulous sheets big bathroom quiet great location good bus and train links close to Little Venice and pleasant staff 
138226,The Royal Park Hotel, Few good restaurants nearby , The management upgraded us as soon as we arrived Amazing bed quiet neighborhood Friendly knowledgeable staff Cozy bar 
138227,The Royal Park Hotel, NOTHING, The most friendly helpful and courteous receptionist they knew the value of customer service We hope to be back for a longer visit in the near future 
138228,The Royal Park Hotel, No electrical outlet in bathroom for hairdryer Room smaller than expected , Bed was comfortable Room was clean and modern Staff was kind and helpful Location to Paddington train station was excellent In room coffee maker 
138229,The Royal Park Hotel, Conditioner in our room wasn t working properly as an air funnel in bathroom But it didn t bother Need to mention that we didn t complaint at reception in other way I think it would be fixed during day time , Staff I ve seen excellent reviews for the staff in this hotel and was sceptic about it I was doubt Room was made perfectly special thanks to the reception staff Everything was perfect Clean room comfy bad maybe it will be bit noisy for people who like to woke up after 10AM Bear in mind security deposit of 50 00 GBP per room per night will be blocked on your card We haven t purchased breakfast so I won t be helpful in this issue If you re not in a mood in the morning be sure hotel s staff will make you smile when you leave Seriously it s the best customer service I ve ever met in the hotels 
138230,The Royal Park Hotel, Super slow WiFi in the room sometime very hard to get connected TV and walking noises from neighbor rooms especially from upstairs Old fashioned bathroom faucets were very noisy and hard to adjust to right temperature , Excellent location near Paddington station Minimal traffic noise no noisy bars around Very friendly and professional staff Comfortable and warm room Beautiful and stylish decor
138231,The Royal Park Hotel, Because there was no clear indication of the hotel and the hotel was not directly facing a wide street it was very difficult to find the hotel There should be an indication of the hotel more clearly , Staff people were very kind and friendly Location was good easy access to railway subway stations 
138232,The Royal Park Hotel,No Negative, Great style helpful staff right next to Hyde Park Traditional hotel that has been kept up to date for facilities This is not part of an international hotel chain which for us was a major positive feature 
138233,The Royal Park Hotel, Could not think of one thing This hotel is truley a gem , The Royal Park hotel exceeded our expectations in every way We moved to London for work and needed to stay in hotels while waiting for our home We chose the royal park while we explored kensington So happy we did The Royal Park Hotel is a gorgeous hidden gem in kensington Great location just a short walk from the beautiful italian gardens and plenty of restaurants The hotel itself is lovely There is a small bar with a great menu The staff went above and beyond professional and extememly nice We brought our small dog and everyone was very sweet to our pet We were given a fruit basket and note upon arrival and departure You are also delivered fresh baked cookies in a cookie jar in your room with glass bottles of cold water everynight Wonderful little surprises everywhere reminds me of the service that you would find at the Four Seasons Hotel I also noticed how clean our rooms were after house keeping Most hotels do a quick clean not the royal park they wiped down tables vacuumed and smelled clean We have stayed in many hotels and have not seen anything quite like it We were very pleased with everything Thank you again 
138234,The Royal Park Hotel, I liked every I fault no faults, I found the room four post bed twin sinks excellent view from bedroom area quiet staff excellent in every way and best room service ever they went out of their way to help They left a hand written note of welcome in the room I have recommended them to all my friends I could find no faults with their service 
138235,The Royal Park Hotel, The location of the room s door whereby you can directly see the bed when you open the door giving the feel of less privacy The unstable complimentary wifi it often drops and then ask us to login again after not using it for a while , Great location few minutes walk from Paddington Very English flavor with great decor England made and high quality toiletries unique bed jar of cookies in room gorgeous intimate breakfast room Excellent service very nice staff all around Great cleanliness Comfortable beds though we can feel that our double bed consist of two single beds joint together 
138236,The Royal Park Hotel, Not really a dislike but a communication problem that may have been Booking s not the Hotel s Booking sent me an e mail saying that free transportation from Heathrow came with my room option so I requested it from the Hotel It didn t evidently and the Hotel did not confirm that until after I arrived No matter as I took the Heathrow Express , Friendly staff always with a smile Upon check in desk staff showed me to room and helped with luggage which I appreciated Very comfortable bed Charming breakfast bar area with fireplace nice for Jan Easy 10 minute walk from Paddington Station 
138237,The Royal Park Hotel, As the hotel is in an old building it can be sometimes a bit noisy as the wooden structure moves with its guests , Great hotel with 5 service Cosy clean and very well maintained The staff is professional friendly and attentive the location is very good close to many attractions and well communicated Rooms a bit small but over the London average anyway Everything you need is provided in the room Will come back 
138238,The Royal Park Hotel, The room was a bit stuffy at times and the wifi didn t always work very well , The staff was great the building was beautiful and really nicely traditionally furnished Everything worked really nicely 
138239,The Royal Park Hotel, At this day and age didn t really expect a hotel to still be using blankets instead of down quilts especially for the price they charge Breakfast was over priced Breakfast in bed was very well maybe try it for a day for the experience but there s plenty of restaurants close by that serve English breakfasts , Location is perfect minutes from Paddington Station or you can walk the opposite direction and there re buses that go from Lancaster Gate to Marble Arch Oxford Str that s even quicker and more direct
138240,The Royal Park Hotel, Unfortunately the Ipod docking station did not work as the cradle was broken It was looked at but wasn t fixed which was a shame as we like to have our music on when we are getting ready Also Lancaster Gate tube station was closed which was a pain as it is 3 mins away from the hotel and perfect for getting into London Queensway was a good 15 minute walk , The location is excellent The room was spacious and clean and although our room overlooked the main road we did not hear any traffic in the night or morning Also the porter remembered us which was nice as we always stay at this hotel when we are in London We hadn t been there for 3 years and they still remembered us We were very impressed 
138241,The Royal Park Hotel, The plumbing was very noisy flushing the toilet created a loud long groan from the cistern Bath shower water not always as hot as we would have liked cracked wash basin , Friendly staff excellent location clean well equipped room excellent coffee machine
138242,The Royal Park Hotel, Creaky floor boards we are a couple with 3 children and were looking forward to a lie in NO CHANCE the floor boards were so creaky when the guest above us woke at 7 we were wide awake too Dirty tissues in the robes Maid walking into the room while we were in bed, bed was so comfy
138243,The Royal Park Hotel, Building work taking place at weekend in room next door bad noise and smell complimentary water not provided until asked for several times no newspaper as advertised ,No Positive
138244,The Royal Park Hotel, Communication between front office and booking com No refund on an extra night booked in my error although booking com was notified 48 hours before , Excellent breakfast choices 
138245,The Royal Park Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable bed lovely open fires very cosy we parked our car very close at a reasonable rate only 15 minutes by tube to the theatre that we saw a show at
138246,The Royal Park Hotel, Loved everything, This is a real gem of a hotel Staff very welcoming and great at their work Very charming and English Great location Hyde Park seconds away short walk to Paddington station Only 15 minutes by express train to Heathrow airport Cosy lounge and lovely bar with open fires very cosy and great decor Lovely view from our room Very clean loved the comp water delivered each night Reasonable prices on the menu Beautifully presented meals Will definitely return enjoyed every minute at this hotel 
138247,The Royal Park Hotel, The only thing I would suggest to improve the hotel is to vary what is offered for the Continental breakfast change the cold cereals around perhaps offer packets of oatmeal or something , We booked our 4 poster king bed suite to celebrate our 40th anniversary and could not have been happier The hotel was adorable located on a lovely quiet street with easy access to the tube and Paddington Station We wanted a hotel with some of that inimitable English charm and the Royal Park Hotel delivered just that The staff was the best part as friendly and helpful as possible and just plain good company Our room was perfect for the two of us to spend what little down time we had during our week s stay We highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be well taken care of while visiting London 
138248,The Royal Park Hotel, Breakfast was a bit of a disaster We had to wait about 10 minutes for our table to be cleared and re layed the range of food was limited coffee took 20 mins to appear and the croissants were stale Then to top it all we were told to eat up as the room needed to be cleared by 11 00am which I thought was unacceptable due to us waiting for a table to be cleared in the first place Pity as everything else was wonderful , Staff were very friendly and welcoming The room and facilities were excellent 
138249,The Royal Park Hotel, I didn t like that the door to the hotel room is so thin and has such a poor sound isolation You hear even the faintest whisper through it Beds were not too comfy My main concern is breakfast The continental buffet has literally no proteins You ll get white bread jams honey pastries Ham Cheese will run you 5 5GBP and eggs will also cost extra See my photo , This is a posh stylish British in the most positive meaning and friendly hotel I liked the atmosphere and staff Clean and consistently designed Pretty also from the outside See my photo 
138250,The Royal Park Hotel, Renovations and a change of concept in the lounge dining area were under way although not disruptive I hope when finished the new bar arrangement brings the expected benefit this area was already nice before the alteration not sure that a bar service would add substantially to the quality of the stay but all will be revealed when complete , As a repeat guest I love the English comfort of this hotel Location close to Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate Underground station is also a major plus 
138251,The Royal Park Hotel, Noisey plumbing noise from above and next door room Cost of parking And breakfast , The efficiency of the staff the location and parking facility and the comfortable room 
138252,The Royal Park Hotel, Breakfast was not working that good to many wanted breakfast but not enough space The staff was not quick enough to clear tables and make it ready for new guests so a left table could easily not be cleared for 15 min The buffet could be extended with diff bread and cheese , Very nice and cosy hotel with a good location 
138253,The Royal Park Hotel, Room could have better view backside from hotel although requested from front side , Very clean close to hyde parke you can walk all famous places always coffee and english tea at room
138254,The Royal Park Hotel, The room was very small breakfast was not included , The bed was comfortable The linen and towels were clean The staff were very friendly and helpful 
138255,The Royal Park Hotel, Nothing, Hotel close to Paddington Station for easy acces to Heathrow Staff very helpful and our room was clean with some nice extras The hotel was very well presented and reasonable value for a London Hotel Location was quiet and far enough away from Paddinton station area crowds 
138256,The Royal Park Hotel, A loyalty card programme for returning guests , Attention to detail impeccable The pillows are the crispiest I have ever slept on The staff can t do enough You are always welcomed upon returning to the hotel 
138257,The Royal Park Hotel, No negatives , Friendly helpful staff Comfy four poster bed Nice little balcony to sit out n enjoy evening drinks Breakfast in room included in the price 
138258,The Royal Park Hotel, The room was a little tired Our coffee machine and kettle were propped up on the armchairs which was a bit precarious and no dressing table meant I had to sit on the floor to use the hairdryer in front of the mirror , The location was fantastic 10 mins from Hyde Park Free newspaper and WiFi was a bonus too 
138259,The Royal Park Hotel, On this visit we again had a room off street room 209 but this time we could hear surrounding guests and a creaking floor as they moved until quite late Also although we used nothing from the minibar we found a card charge after we returned to Australia We objected but no answer from management Disappointing , It s very close to Paddington station which was the big selling point for us coming in on the Heathrow Express We had stayed here before and found it comfortable and quiet in a room away from the street frontage As last time staff are very helpful and pleasant 
138260,The Royal Park Hotel, Our only complaint was that the wifi service was at least for our electronic devices not up to par , A very quiet elegant boutique hotel where the staff was excellent Great location
138261,The Royal Park Hotel, The same old bugbear the wifi does not maintain constant logged in status even when the devices have not left the room Annoying when others are trying to communicate , Now have tea coffee making facilities in the room Excellent welcoming hospitality The location couldn t be better for Paddington and underground connections 
138262,The Royal Park Hotel, Had a few random problems The cold tap would provide hot water at certain times of the day Car parking was very expensive in that area although I suppose that applies to the whole of London , Nice old world style of hotel with a lovely comfortable general lounge area Whilst it was very close to areas such as Hyde Park it was in a nice quiet side street Close to underground and to main line station at Paddington 
138263,The Royal Park Hotel,No Negative, in total it was very nice and comfortable service convienince all very well just the breakfast could offer a little more its a bit selective but this is just a tiny little remark out of my view thx 
138264,The Royal Park Hotel, Room was a bit stuffed full but well appointed nice furniture Bathroom was lacking some shelf space so it looked good but was a bit impractical , Staff excellent Location fantastic All was clean and welcoming Very good value for London 
138265,The Royal Park Hotel, Well if I compare this hotel with other 4 star ones I stayed before I can say that breakfast is pretty much basic No cheese ham egg Moreover breakfast room was considerably small, 1 Location close to Lancaster Gate tube station and Kensington Gardens Peaceful location 2 Free cookies everyday 3 Staff in general 4 Air condition works very well water pressure and bed quality were also good
138266,The Royal Park Hotel, A little thing but the tea strainer let the tea leaves through so they floated about in the cup of tea The strainer needs to be smaller or use tea bags Also beware the promotional offer of free flow Prosecco with your evening meal it could cost you an extra 10 each , Very comfortable bed and quiet room Plenty of hot water for bath and power shower The complimentary drink offered on arrival was very welcome The staff were friendly and helpful 
138267,The Royal Park Hotel,No Negative, We were a two minute walk from Hyde Park Every morning we went into Hyde Park and walked along the water before stopping to have breakfast by the water Fabulous Love the park 
138268,The Royal Park Hotel,No Negative, Five star excellent service especially by the front desk A luxe boutique hotel with great furnishings The restaurant serves amazing Michelin star quality food they should advertise it more Will definitely come back 
138269,The Royal Park Hotel, There were problems with internet on both days The food was a bit disappointing at breakfast pancakes were not properly cooked , beautuful small luxury hotel that feels like a private home The staff at front desk are very friendly helpful
138270,The Royal Park Hotel, No tea coffee facilities in room Too expensive for 2pots of tea 9 00 is far too much to pay , Room was beautiful very clean comfy beds Great toiletries attentive staff 
138271,The Royal Park Hotel, We were given the wrong room at the fault of the receptionist and then asked to move rooms after we had unpacked and were about to eat dinner In addition the booking was in my name yet the receptionist would not address look at me and kept saying Sir to my partner even after I filled out registration form pretty strange and rude Although we didn t move rooms in the end the hotel overall had pretty bad terrible customer service There s no security lock on the door I stay in hotels on a weekly basis for work and this is not the norm glad I wasn t a lone female traveller , The room we were accidentally put in was spacious Four minute walk from Paddington 
138272,The Royal Park Hotel, Rubbish luke warm shower shower head wouldn t angle so water everywhere complimentary coffee took 45 mins to arrive no one asked us about our stay when we checked out , Small but cosy room Comfy bed 
138273,The Royal Park Hotel, Shower had no hot water I waited 20 minutes for it to warm up but had to catch the express to Heathrow so I took the fastest shower on record Miserable experience Room 207 avoid this one Also absence of a kettle and coffee tea in the room was a surprise I was in the UK for a week on a book tour and even the humblest hotels had a kettle Would have been nice Obviously management has a phobia about hot water , Elegant old property lots of character 
138274,The Royal Park Hotel, Staff needs a lot of training e g can t follow simple instructions don t hold doors open for guests will sit you at a dirty table and leave you there little things that add up to what am I paying you for Not up to standards for the price Facilities need renovation , Very charming old building Good location 
138275,The Royal Park Hotel, Super thin walls There was a couple upstairs who were in a violent fight for about 3 hours and i heard the whole thing , Staff members were friendly and attentive Close to Paddington station
138276,The Royal Park Hotel, No tea making facilities ordered a pot of tea at a VERY expensive price, Very comfortable bed and pillows good shower very informative and enthusiastic front of house manager
138277,The Royal Park Hotel, The was no mirror in the bedroom so drying hair and applying make up was difficult A mirror could very easily have been fitted above the console table in room 507 ,No Positive
138278,The Royal Park Hotel, Having to sit on the floor to dry my hair as the cord for the hairdryer was very short No decent mirror in the bathroom and where to put anything in the bathroom , The staff
138279,The Royal Park Hotel, A bit of a challenge to find on foot The sign is not visible unless you are standing right in front of it , Room was lovely Staff was very helpful and friendly Welcoming tasteful and quite 
138280,The Royal Park Hotel, Aircon was iffy but staff will do their best to help at anytime of day or night Sometimes has hot water issues in the morning and the plumbing can be a little noisy Was the same on our last visit two years ago so could use some work , Stay here everytime we visit London Love the friendly staff and the location Close to Oxford Street and Hyde Park off the busy roads and 5 minutes walk from Paddington Beds are very comfortable and overall facilities are good Breakfast is good but a little on the expensive side Love the garden A little oasis in the center of the London bustle Overall another great stay
