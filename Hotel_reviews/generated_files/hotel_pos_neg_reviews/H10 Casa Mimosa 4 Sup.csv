402244,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, Excellent service perfect location in eixample with views of La Pedrera friendly staff well maintained and very clean overall Loved the interior and overall design An excellent hotel that feels like a 5 star hotel 
402245,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Maybe it is too pricy but given the quality of the facility it is acceptable , Amazing beautiful hotel with large size room and beautiful garden Location is also spectacular for shopping dining and tour Absolutely recommend
402246,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Water was off for one day but staff was very helpful, The staff is exceptional reception helpful for giving us suggestions and supplying detailed maps Breakfast server was excellent as well as door man Loved coffee and drinking water every day 
402247,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, The bathroom shower needs a shelf for soap and shampoo but that s a minor quibble considering how spectacularly designed the room is , Our room was modern generously sized and gorgeous It was one of the most luxurious hotel experiences I ve encountered with my own money Lovely view from french doors overlooking the garden and pool Rooftop view of Gaudi s La Pedrada Bathroom was huge and glamorous Never has a hotel room had such sophisticated and beautiful lighting Nespresso machine helped us get our morning started without having to set foot outside Breakfast was a bit pricey but ample and delicious Try the daily cake O M G There s a small pool which was a great amenity after a long day of touring in the hot sun And the staff at the concierge was extremely helpful sweet gracious and looked like they came from a modeling agency I never wanted to leave 
402248,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, A greater range of fruit at breakfast would have been nice but overall the standard was very good , Very clean and tidy hotel with good facilities and friendly attentive staff 
402249,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, Very convenient location and great neighborhood With amazing garden you feel like you are also away in resort while you are located in the very center 
402250,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, This has nothing to do with the hotel we liked it but we found the food at the restaurants to be somewhat dull Apparently no herbs or spices are used to flavor the dishes there and surprisingly the quality of the olive oil is mediocre We did enjoy some of the tapas , The hotel staff was helpful friendly and kind We felt very comfortable and safe at the hotel because of the employees there Also it s a great location especially for walking around Barcelona which was our favorite city 
402251,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Nothing really , The restaurant that we went to near the hotel was not bad but catered primarily for tourists We were there only for 1 night so did not have to chance to venture around 
402252,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Lack of fridge Corridors on the upper floors without air conditioning The video commercial of H10 hotel network switching on automatically every time you enter the room and put the key card to the slot although the song was nice and the video pretty fine it was awful to hear it for the hundreds of times , View of La Pedrera from the balcony of the room Everything with class and freshly clean Bathrobe and slippers provided for the guests Perfect state of the washroom Remote air conditioning in rooms Big screen of TV Possibility of switching every light point from various parts of the room Perfect beds although not in queen size they were extremely comfortable and cleen 
402253,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Cleaning rooms and changing towels are being done very late even after 3 p m Too small amount of shampoo for the 5 day stay not provided every day Lack of refrigerator only mini bar , State of the art interiors of hotel lobby and rooms Wonderful view from the terrace Good cuisine 
402254,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Nothing , From the moment we were greeted by staff on arrival we were impressed by the friendliness helpfulness and cheerfulness of all employees they really looked after us well The room with garden terrace faced toward La Pedera of which there is an excellent view from the rooftop terrace Good sized well equipped very comfortable room and the sun loungers were an unexpected bonus 
402255,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, The rating of 9 6 which is the highest in any Barcelona hotel was not justified at all Some staff members were a bit indifferent and not well informed about the area 2 swimming pools are rather small the gym is v basic A bit expensive for the kind of facilities , The location is great Room size is good Complimentary welcome champagne and sangria in the room 
402256,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Breakfast service was a bit inconsistent although staff were very warm and friendly and the food was nice , Beautiful luxury hotel set in lovely building and grounds Good location for metro and a stroll into the centre 20 min walk to Segrada Familla Reception staff were excellent polite friendly and very helpful Rooftop bar listening to live jazz at La Pedrera was an added bonus 
402257,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Just a few minor niggles The air conditioning keep resetting to default in the night which was too hot We heard the restaurant staff quite early as our room was next the atrium wall, Locacation that it had a garden and that our room had its own private terrace Staff were excellent 
402258,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, Stylish facilities with luxury linen bed and pillows fixtures and fittings equipment amenities great view wonderful rooftop bar close to attrations transport shopping and restaurants and knowledgeable professional staff
402259,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, My name on the birthday card they wrote for me was not my name and very disappointed , Front desk staffs were very helpful I loved the balcony they had They gave us a champagne and chocolate cake for my Birthday We will definitely go back to the hotel when we visit Barcelona again 
402260,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, We were warmly welcomed to the hotel and every encounter we had with the staff was top drawer All suggestions given at the front desk were right on A special shout out to Noah on the friont desk who was helpful knowledgeable and personable and made our stay superb The hotel s location is wonderfully close to the Casa Mills and the Casa Batll The outside patio was a wonderful surprise It was a bit pricy but we thought it was worth every penny If we ever go to Barcelona again we would stay here 
402261,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, There could have been a little more attention to detail in servicing the additional extras in the room, The hotel staff were very friendly The breakfast very good and the room was wonderful
402262,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, The terrasse with the pool and the view on the Pedrara were a highlight a calm oasis to load batteries after a day of shopping or biking through Barcelona Great for chilling out in the sun with a great local white wine tapas feet in the pool and a service to make you feel like a million 
402263,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Really nothing to complain about If I must come out a recommendation I would say the bed is just a little bit too soft if someone needs to stay more than 3 days However if you only stay for 2 to 3 days its still very comfortable , There is absolutely nothing to dislike about Comfortable room size perfect location and wonderful professional service 
402264,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Nothing it was great and we would stay again , Great size room for Barcelona standards and a nice price to match too outdoor garden is absolutey delightful room with balcony was serene breakfast was very nice 
402265,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, The lack of an onsite restaurant able to offer more than tapas late at night after a day of walking around the city The kutchen clised at 22h30 with no room service after then either We arrived late after our flight was delayed and had nothing to eat until the next morning, This well situated hotel close to Diagonal metro was a haven of tranquillity in a bustling city Exceptional staff paid every attention to detail to make our stay in Barcelona extra memorable Welcome champagne a fabulous upgrade to a terrace suite Sangria in our room on arrival friandises afternoon tea gift the list goes on The tranquillity of a rooftop terrace serving fabulous Mojitos overlooking one of Barcelona s most famous sites 
402266,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, The hotel is of an excellent standard in every department but there was one thing that let it down unnecessarily the breakfast It was inconsistent with all other aspects of the hotel We came to breakfast just after 10am and there was no bread left no bowls for the fruit salad at the buffet empty boards with no ham and almost no cheese left so we could not serve ourselves at the buffet Nobody came to our table or the table next to us to offer coffee or menus for 10 mins in this small breakfast area I asked a lady for some service and to stock up the buffet Nothing happened for a further 10 mins so we left and went every day to the excellent bakery round the corner instead 3 mins walk from the hotel I would have gladly paid the 22 Euros per person each morning but I needed a better reason Don t let your guests take their money round the corner Otherwise everything was great , A stylish excellent quality hotel There is a beautiful welcoming garden in the courtyard to relax in and also a great roof terrace both perfect to relax in with a cocktail after a day s walking in Barcelona Our room was decorated in good taste with understated elegance subtle texture and colour Every object from the room furniture to the bathroom cosmetics the bed linen the fabrics were thoughtfully considered and of an excellent quality Our room was very large and full of light It felt like a spacious light apartment with a large bathroom and with a good view The hotel was quiet at night Very close to the metro but also close to a main sunny street in Barcelona so you can take an afternoon strolling past excellent shops and markets all the way to the sea The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood close to small good quality shops and restaurants All staff were very polite and very friendly at every interaction We re coming back 
402267,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, This is the best hotel I ve ever stayed My first 10 10 mark on booking Definitely worth that money Pools patio restaurant service room and hotel design is just tremendous stunning Amazing hotel breakfast you have plenty of local Spanish Catalunya snacks but You can still have some continental breakfast or even some special ones breakfast catalunyas dishes 
402268,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, great location and nice staff in the hotel They even have two pools Most importantly the room has a fantastic terrace When they know we are there for honeymoon they prepare wine and cake for us It is a memorable stay 
402269,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Can t think of a thing The room the staff the amenities and the food were perfect , This was the first time we stayed at an H10 hotel Outstanding 5 night stay from a start to finish We felt very well looked after by the staff We will look for H10 for future travel 
402270,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Honestly The whole experience was great I definitely recommend the hotel My only thought here is it is probably cheaper to get breakfast at one of the nearby cafes than eat at the hotel , I love this hotel Upon check in the staff immediately greets you with a welcome glass of champagne and also gives you an overview of the city with recommendations on restaurants and attractions The rooms are great and pretty spacious The style is transitional modern and contemporary but still the character of an older building We were celebrating a special occasion so they gave us a bottle of champagne and chocholates in the room A great treat I really enjoyed the area of town as well It s not far from luxury shopping or the city centre and in walking distance to most local attractions The beach was under a 10 euro cab ride I definitely will be staying at this hotel when I come back to Barcelona 
402271,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, This is our third stay in Casa Mimosa and it certainly won t be the last we love staying at this boutique hotel The staff are charming helpful and friendly the rooms are airy and bright with comfortable beds the location right behind Gaudi s Casa Mila is excellent No wonder we keep returning

402273,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, Modern clean and comfortable accommodation with very nice attention to detail fluffy robes excellent service really great staff The location is fabulous a quiet street a short walk from three no four of the best gin bars in Barcelona some of the most beautiful Modernist buildings a fine variety of restaurants and caf s and many small art galleries We have stayed here before and shall certainly do so again Recommended 
402274,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Being overlooked by tourist whilst on sun loungers on our room terrace Breakfast didn t have a vegan or cheaper option If we had been given room 103 4 5 we wouldn t have been overlooked and had the sun longer than we did , Yes Bed was beautiful Shower was great too Lovely coffee machine Sun loungers were very comfortable 
402275,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, My special requests were seemingly not picked up until I arrived but once they were acknowledged the staff did everything possible to accommodate these within the availability constraints , The Staff were absolutely fantastic from the welcome drink through to departure nothing was too much trouble for the whole of our stay 
402276,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, They don t have airport pickup service , Perfect location Not far to almost every scenic spot but very quiet Perfect service Helpful and warm staff Nice view that you can see La Pedrera on your own terrace 
402277,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, Elegant and cleverly designed makes it feel even more spacious than it is Found it ideal for myself partner and our very active toddler Street view is nice very quiet thanks to good insulation and location is superb Currently staying in the W for a week and miss Casa Mimosa really badly 
402278,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, Brilliant location next to Gaudi s Casa Mila lovely garden excellent staff They upgraded our room to garden view without us asking and without any cost

402280,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, The breakfast was a little bit of a disappointment especially for the price , The location was sublime super central and easy to find no matter what state you end up in The hotel has great views of la Pedrera from the roof terrace The staff was super friendly and the champagne on arrival was a nice touch Comfiest bed I ve slept on for a long time 
402281,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup,No Negative, The service was excellent The staff was truly wonderful I had emailed ahead with a special request a piece of birthday cake for my husband We arrived and we re not only greeted in our room with a cake but he received a thoughtful handwritten birthday card To top it off as a gift the hotel added a bottle of champagne Also the hotel is in a perfect location near everything basically The rooms are wonderfully designed the bed super comfortable No expense was spared here 
402282,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Breakfast is quite expensive at 23 Euros but it was very very nice , Beautiful hotel in a great location When we arrived we were greeted with a glass of champagne and upgraded to a garden view room which was a lovely touch Great selection of toiletries in the room and possibly one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in The staff were all friendly We didn t want to leave 
402283,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, Nothing to dislike about this hotel, Fabulous location and most comfortable bed we ve slept in in any hotel Spacious room and the view of Gaudi apartments from our window was an added bonus Reception staff the best A welcome glass of bubbles was a lovely touch enjoyed every aspect of this hotel and would thoroughly recommend 
402284,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, They could consider not charging for late checkout if there isn t anyone checking in immediately after we were offered a 2 hour complimentary extension and would have been charged 20 euros per hour thereafter Hotels that have comp ed my friends and I because the room in question isn t booked back to back have always left an impression on us , Gorgeous contemporary decor extremely friendly staff from electrician to front desk

402287,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, i can t say a single bad thing about this place the only question is the price compared to other hotels , small but magnificent hotel beautiful large room Staff was freindly and help with all quieries in fluent english view of CASA MILA roof from the top pool didn t try the food but it looked great as well
402288,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, As I wanted to pay our total payment on arrival the staff said ok and gave us the invoice which was only 338 eur as i asked back it is a lot less than expected he said that is the total We even got an invoice for our total lenght of stay with 338 eur However when we were checking out they said it was a mistake and we should be paying the whole amount which is 938 eur Well it was not a big problem just annoying that somebody made a mistake they recognized it and then only let us know at the very end Because in the meantime we were happily enjoying the Black Friday since we thought have some plus , Gorgeous breakfast excellent location

402293,H10 Casa Mimosa 4 Sup, As this is a new hotel the facilities were not fully operational such as the roof top bar however we look forward to returning one day and experiencing everything the hotel has to offer , Having opened the day before our arrival we were unsure of what to expect at Casa Mimosa and we were not disappointed The staff were efficient and friendly and their aim was to ensure the comfort of all guests Our favourite place was the outdoor courtyard area a popular area to enjoy the delicious breakfast included during our stay A bonus was the view of La Pedrera s spectacular rooftop by day and night Thank you Casa Mimosa
