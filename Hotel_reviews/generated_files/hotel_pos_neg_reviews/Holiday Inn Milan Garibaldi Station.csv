492841,Holiday Inn Milan Garibaldi Station, When we booked we were thinking it was a Walk across the road from garibaldi station but it is actually a good 15 minutes in the heat of the day Better to get a cab, Room was good with kids in a separate room but joined to ours
492842,Holiday Inn Milan Garibaldi Station, Noisy neighbourhood tram track next to hotel poor air conditioning limited breakfast option for hot cooked meal mostly cold cuts were served Charged a city tax which was not mentioned at time of booking , Beds were comfortable bathrooms were clean modern 
492843,Holiday Inn Milan Garibaldi Station, I felt the front desk was frequently condescending And you never knew when bottled water would be available Inexplicably they would draw a curtain down over the dispenser and feign ignorance , We were given a corner front room that was larger than others There was a self service laundry very close There were two tram lines literally out the front door and Metro not far 
492844,Holiday Inn Milan Garibaldi Station, Very less options for Vegetarian person in the breakfast, The staff was very polite Being sunday all ticket outlets for local transport was closed The gentleman at the reception gave me the tickets they kept for guests There is an excellent Indian Restaurent within 8 10 min walkable distance from Hotel 
492845,Holiday Inn Milan Garibaldi Station,No Negative, We came in very late and the staff was very accommodating They made lots of helpful suggestions and were able to call up a taxi when needed They gave us an excellent breakfast the next morning I really appreciated all of the front desk staff and the kitchen staffs help 
492846,Holiday Inn Milan Garibaldi Station, We were accomodated first in a room close to the train rails it was way to noisy The safe was broken the shower looked a bit old but that was not the problem the shower had some dark spots would help a deep cleaning or maybe was just lack of paint , The staff They were very helpful and change us to another room because the safe was not working
492847,Holiday Inn Milan Garibaldi Station, The room wasn t clean enough and the garbage can had not been emptied before we arrived , the tv the central position and that the hotel is walking distance from Corso Como too

492851,Holiday Inn Milan Garibaldi Station, It is the second time I am staying at this hotel The hotel is nice and the rooms are comfortable but the bathrooms are just a let down They are not nice and poorly done And during this specific stay the shower bath was blocked and I nearly slipped twice when trying to get in , This hotel is good for its location if you land at Malpensa airport Malpensa Express stops at Garibaldi train station and the hotel is only a short walk away I also like that you can take the Tramway in front of the hotel to get to the city centre
