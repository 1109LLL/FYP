467428,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Nothing you are near the south bank tower bridge Borough Market , The hotel is brilliant we had a terrace The area is very relaxing A nice community The staff were amazingly helpful A cinema is 20 yards away There is a market there once a week I shall try to stay there every time I go to London It was like living in London staying there The room was very modern and well designed I have never raved so much about a hotel before Please stay there if you can 
467429,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, A little closer to the underground would be good but they can t realy help the location Tbh it was only a 10 minutes walk to the tube and lots of buses stopnear by , This place is amazing Super comfortable beds Clean and well presented rooms The view was stunning we could see bit ben the London eye the shard and the gherkin from our window On the evening we left the curtains open so we could see it Amazing walk in shower was like a waterfall Great TV reception and I can t thank the staff enough for being so helpfull Even helping us choose the right bus routes for where we needed to go Right next to a park so pretty quiet to We had a continental breakfast and it was one of the best I have had due to the fresh meats cheese and pastrys available ALeo there is a mini Sainsburys across the rd so handy for grabbing snacks and drinks I will be going back again Thank u for making our weekend one to remember
467430,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, It was impossible to open the windows for ventilation because the windows were from floor to ceiling I would like to note that there is not enough slippers and a robe ,No Positive
467431,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Fussy rules for breakfast option Omelette choice did not allow my wife to have continental breakfast as well Not an easy location to get to If you re looking for close proximity to a station forget it, Bespoke hotel and bespoke breakfast excellent Charming Square and very pleasant Quirky room design Loved the wet room shower Reception girls brilliant
467432,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, There is no alcohol and no pork being sold at the restaurant but I guess this is for personal reasons of the owners Fridge in room wasn t cold at all , Lovely terrace room TV had excellent connectivity HDMI etc 
467433,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Relatively expensive but that s London , Upgraded to a room with a terrace overlooking a Sainsbury s Local and a coffee bar Very good size room for London Very clean modern comfortable bed good shower wi fi Within walking distance of Tower Bridge Would stay here again 
467434,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Not ideal that they can t serve alcohol but as I said lots of bars near by so no real issue , Very cool area with plenty of bars and restaurants to look around Bermondsey seems to be a very up and coming area and this hotel fits the neighbourhood perfectly 
467435,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, See above plus the size of the rooms the shower leaked onto bathroom floor and the breakfast coffee was not appealing Full Continental breakfasts were included in the tariff and we were allowed to store unwanted luggage not required on side trips even though there wasn t a specified store room This was appreciated , The location of the designated rooms was quiet however the bed at first stay was like a hammock very uncomfortable the subsequent visits we requested and were given twin beds a slight improvement but still too soft with regard to the mattresses We were allocated the same room for both the second and third visits The location was convenient for our purpose The prices varied and were too expensive for the accommodation experienced 
467436,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Shower closure allows water to leak out and leave the floor wet every time I take a shower , Overall The Bermondsey Square Hotel provides a good value for money accommodation in good location The room has a decent size although odd shaped The bed is comfortable Wifi is strong Shower is powerful All basic amenities are provided Staffs are helpful There is a mini Sainsbury s right opposite the hotel There is a very good cafe serving English and authentic Turkish breakfast with amazing value and friendly staffs called Roca Cafe nearby Antique market is right outside the hotel every Friday Ropewalk and Borough market is a short stroll away A few buses stop right outside the hotel which takes you to 1 of the 3 underground stations nearby if you don t fancy walking which takes around 15 mins Mercato Metropolitano is a short bus ride and a bit of a stroll away 
467437,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Some noise supercars racing in the early hours from the street Is it possible to further soundproof the windows This didn t spoil my stay overall though will definitely consider booking again , Arrived to find I d been upgraded nice surprise Lovely spacious room fabulous view of London Bed was very comfortable Room immaculately clean Very handy location liked the fact that Sainsbury s was just opposite and open until late Close to a good selection of restaurants 
467438,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The reception desk the amenities not the staff and the entrance to the elevators do not correspond to the high quality of the rooms Strange way of rearranging towels some stains were present in the bathroom , Comfortable room with an excellent bed quiet nights made for a good night s sleep The bathroom was well equipped Great neighbourhood with bars restaurants and a beautiful park nearby 
467439,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, staff were inefficient no bar no 24 access to hotel Had to force open door when returning to hotel , upgraded to a suite after error with booking and them not having my room 
467440,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Beds a little on the soft side I think for the price that breakfast should be included, Great location comfortable and clean rooms which are a decent size Breakfast was tasty and good selection
467441,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The hotel did not come up to my expectations of a 4 star at all It was definitely not worth the price I paid I had to pay an extra 25 on my credit card I was told it was if I required any extras even if I didn t want any extras I still had to pay the 25 I had no choice it was mandatory no mention of that one before I booked On checking out I was told that the 25 would be back in my bank account by the end of the week Not at all happy with this , The area as we were very central close to Tower Bridge and Bermondsey Street
467442,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Like many hotels now they have in room smartphone tablets for services Mine delightfully woke me up with an alarm call at 1 30am The device was locked with a PIN so I couldn t switched the thing off Most annoying , Great location The rooms are small but very comfortable This is London after all Nice bar and food area downstairs though note this is a dry hotel no booze 
467443,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, My teenage daughter and i were given a room with a double bed i thought i had asked for 2 singles but i wasn t too fussed when i found out i was given a double since we are both petite For 2 people with a huge suitcase each the room was relatively small One of us spread out luggage on the floor and the other had to spread our suitcase out on their writing table behind the bed head i think the room we were given would have been perfect for the business traveler carrying a small suitcase , Bermondsey is located in a nice part of the Southwark Borough It s close to the sites like Tower of London 15 minute walking distance Borough Market about 20 minute on foot Tower bridge It s about 15 to 17 minutes to the Bermondsey and London bridge Underground The hotel has a nice quiet location close to nice coffee shop and has a great Turkish Restaurant at it s doorstep a stone s throw The hotel feels modern and clean 
467444,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, A room a bit small and curtains did not cover all the light in the morning , Quiet comfortable bed very clean Convinient location if you are keen to explore neighbourhood 
467445,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Customer service Our first room didn t get a wifi signal and some staff flatly didn t care or showed no interest in remeding the issue It was only after raising the issue with a manager was some action belatedly taken Second room had wifi but a partially broken a c It pumped out cold air but did so with a loud high pitch drone unless we turned it to a low setting to offset the drone Again staff didn t seem to care that much , The beds are very comfy and the location is pretty good 10 12 minute walk to the tube Good restaurants and coffee nearby on bernondsey street 
467446,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, May be it s a little bit away from city center but as I was not expecting that it was OK for me , The hotel is cute it looks like any other but when you cross the reception you see some style It s confortable with big rooms and quite area Probably I ll go there again next time in the area 
467447,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The bed was very soft i do prefer a hard bed other than that nothing else to report , Friendly staff very kindly let us have a late check out on the property as we were running the next day and we were able to come back to the room for a shower The shower in the room was fantastic one of the best i have ever experienced The view was excellent of the Shard and the EYE
467448,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, nothing, Excellent location near to good restaurants and cafes and very convenient for public transport A very nice tranquil hotel The room was spacious and comfortable and the staff were very friendly and efficient 
467449,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, There wasn t anything to dislike , Everything was as we d hoped We asked for a room with a view and we got it We had some reservations about booking because of a previous review whuch claimed the staff let the hotel down not in our experience they were very polite and exceptionally heloful We ll be staying here again 
467450,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The only problem we had with the entire visit was with the booking We booked this in January to stay in May and only found out the week prior that there was some problem with our booking and the payment had neither been taken or contact made with us to advise so We were advised that there was some problem between booking com and the hotel where the card details had not been transferred across A simple call as soon as this was discovered would have resolved this Had to call the hotel several times and then booking com in the evening to resolve When finally resolving the problem with the hotel I did request a room on a high floor and thought this was little to ask by way of making good but we were allocated 1st floor so not even this was done as a gesture both parties blaming one another , Great location within easy walking distance of London Bridge and Tower Bridge Lovely community feel to the area surrounding with the park opposite 
467451,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel,No Negative, Great location Lots of nearby restaurants and bars Hotel does not serve alcohol however there is a Sainsbury s opposite and a fridge provided in the room with glasses if you really can t go without There are so many bars within a minute or two s walk away that it did not matter at all Comfy bedroom with everything you need including good air con which actually works well and a bathroom which has space unusual for London Breakfast was excellent I can highly recommend the Eggs Royale and staff were friendly and courteous They do not serve pork products either but my husband loved the chicken herb sausages and turkey rashers instead Within walking distance to Tower Bridge St Catherine s dock area and Borough tube for access to central London Would definitely recommend and would stay again 
467452,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Room was unprepared one light bulb needed replacing selection of teas not refilled short one set of towels and innovative free internet mobile device would not connect so was useless Different reception staff on second next day rather rude and disinterested in answering questions Thermostat set to go no lower than 19 C fan helped because picture window not made to open No wardrobe in contemporary room only racks near door with 6 hangers Note the hotel restaurant has no alcohol licence and limited food selections not full service Finally there seemed little security The outer door to London streets still unlocked 12 AM and no one at reception By day we often walked through to the elevator and up to room with no one around , Staff at check in very welcoming convenient access to room with wonderful modern shower and bath Bed very comfortable large picture window in contemporary room small refrigerator and excellent television Location is 10 20 minute walk to train or tube but all manner of shops restaurants cafes and stores within a minute s walk The square has conveniences food and antique market every Friday Hotel restaurant s food above average in quality within a large open plan lobby and sitting area Laundry service was timely 
467453,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, People in other rooms made lots of noise which was disappointing it was so easily heard not great sound proofing, If you like boutique shops and restaurants great hotel location easy access to central London
467454,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Blonde receptionist not what I d call rude but not very friendly either and it was a bit off putting considering the price of the hotel per night She looked like she couldn t wait to be going home Only other staff I met were cleaners who were friendly , Very clean and comfortable room 
467455,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Stain on carpet Woke up to realise the blind on the on the big French windows were missing despite a terraced room with overlooking offices and flats So spent the morning in the dark Fridge didn t work the woman who came to look at it just shrugged her shoulders and huffed and walked out Hairdryer broke staffing didn t seem pro at all in the lounge area Microwaved carrot cake not fresh Not an Apple TV as described , Good location for wandering and hanging out Glad I had a huge discount through booking com Otherwise I d have been upset as it was meant to be a romantic break 
467456,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, We were told on arrival that alcohol was not served at this hotel this was not advertised on their site also we found out at breakfast that they did not serve any pork products We are extremely angry that we were not informed of this as we would not have booked this hotel The bed was awful and far to soft the air con did not work and the shower flooded the bathroom, The view from our room was fabulous 
467457,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, advertised as full English breakfast no bacon turkey rashers was Halal hotel wasn t too much of a problem but I don t like being misled I find London overpriced for more or less everything, lovely bedroom with large balcony cleanliness bathsheets rather than bath towels location was ideal for purpose of my visit helpful pleasant staff
467458,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Was a little bit far from the tube stop 10 15 minute walk Food was good just not great , Very spacious room overseeing the square Quiet clean new very nice Restaurant staff friendly though the food is not exceptional can sit outside which is nice Nice location near a lot of restaurants 
467459,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The staff were very efficient but quite cold and impersonal They didnt seem to communicate with each other very well as we were asked to sign forms several times that had already been signed, The location is excellent not far from London Bridge station and most attractions in walking distance The bed was very comfortable and all areas of the hotel was very clean
467460,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The breakfast was not included in the price I paid , My dog is welcome Clean rooms Nice staff Excellent location Superb restaurants and shops around 
467461,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel,No Negative, The position of the hotel is just great walking distance from London Bridge Shard Borough Market etc and very well connected also by bus for example to go to London Waterloo The area is very pretty with lots of local coffee shops restaurant and trendy pubs Despite the area it is not noisy and pretty well isolated being located in a tiny nice square where on Friday and Saturday mornings there is a small market The room is very well furnished with also a small beauty area hairdryer nice and wide mirror with led lights Big bathroom and good wifi connection We did not try the breakfast in the hotel but there are plenty of coffee shops in the area one just on the corner in front of the hotel where you can have great coffee and food 
467462,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The booking arrangements did not work properly I was threatened with cancellation of my room booking unnecessarily , The room was clean and tidy and a decent size 
467463,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, We paid 143 00 for one night with no breakfast I know it is in the heart of London but still quite pricey especially as they also could not offer any parking facilities The reception is small and the staff although pleasant were very matter of fact There is no alcohol served on the premises which is unfortunate as it would have been nice to relax in the comfy chairs with a glass of wine , Really lovely room very clean Bath towels were fluffy and nice and big The room was a good temperature and despite being in the heart of London was very quiet we had a really good nights sleep 
467464,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The air conditioning did not work Unfortunately I only discovered this at 1 am and did not feel it would be productive or conducive to more sleep to ask the hotel staff to come and sort it out at that time of night , Good spacious room comfortable bed spacious walk in shower
467465,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The attitude of the staff not friendly and not professional Terrasse rooms are ok but are on the first floor with a view on the building across the classic room is not nice at all bathroom especially not convenient , Area is nice and developing
467466,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Non pork breakfast sounded unappealing and dining area open to lobby so again not appealing Quite basic communal areas , Helpful reception Room newly refurbished and clean with good sized shower well located for restaurants and south bank Parking cheap secure parking nearby We even got free parking for the weekend just outside the hotel door 
467467,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The windows do not open so you are reliant on A C, Great check in experience and the bedroom affords excellent value for money in a central London location
467468,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Being a disabled person trying to find a parking space nearby was a bit tricky but Daniel came to our rescue , The staff were very helpful and kind Daniel especially welcomed us Lovely chap 
467469,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The bed was way too soft , The feel of the hotel the staff The room was pleasant And the hotel is very well located next to a great neighbourhood 
467470,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, There is no bar or minibar supplies and the restaurant area seemed to close quite early Breakfast could be improved but is okay , Rooms and bathrooms are excellent for a hotel of this size and price Interesting design and layout 
467471,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, I asked staff to turn off the radiator in my bathroom before I went out for the evening When I got back later that evening I found that they hadn t done it and so I tried to ring reception but no one picked up despite me trying several times So my room was too hot Other than that it was absolutely fine and I would go again ,No Positive
467472,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Was a little overpriced for a basic room The shower room smelt of stagnant water, The shower was excellent and the bed was comfy The mobile phone in the room was great as you could take it out with you and wifi all day 
467473,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Just one for me catastrophic problem was that in most of the rooms the windows are hermetically sealed with no opening I find it impossible to sleep in a room without access to fresh air even if somewhat diesel laden Once I discovered this was the case I found out that there were a few rooms with terraces which of course did have opening French doors so I had to pay for an emergency upgrade at 30 extra This for me of course reduced the value for money as I had to pay more for access to fresh air a commodity I view as standard , Stylish decor with a quirky edge Very clean and well maintained Comfortable bed good sized main room and bathroom Well lit mirror with power point for hair and make up Despite busy location on a plaza with shops restaurants and cinema it was surprisingly quiet for sleeping Excellent continental breakfast with good strong coffee and lots of choice Fresh fruit cereals bread ham cheese smoked salmon pastries etc plus cooked breakfast option for a small extra fee Good value More than all that the staff were really lovely and created a great welcoming ambience I felt very happy and comfortable as a solo traveller which counts for a lot 
467474,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, A weird humming from an air vent but I doubt it s like that in every room , Good location near where I had to be with transport links and nice places for food and drinks nearby on Bermondsey St The room was modern and spacious and wouldn t hesitate to recommend it as a place to stay 
467475,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Cold water the shower wasn t working properly Understood there was a wider problem but there wasn t much of an apology given the situation , Great location comfy and good size room
467476,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Bed was quite hard and the quilt was too small for the bed 11am check out that extra hour other hotels offer sometimes comes in handy , Great location 10 minute walk from London Bridge Station Hotel very quiet and surrounded by lots of unique businesses except sainsbury s across the road try the coffee shop right next door Didn t use the hotel for food so can t comment on this I m not sure boutique is a description I would use for the hotel but all the same it has some quirkiness about it Would definitely stay again without hesitation 
467477,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, There was no hot water for a shower in the morning The staff member on reception used the annoying and non committal I can only apologise No actually there are plenty of other things you could do like offer a complimentary coffee or breakfast offer a partial refund or discount off another stay Disappointing response ,No Positive
467478,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, There was no hot water in the morning Apparently the boiler had broken No compensation offered Reception area v small just a desk chair behind a screen ,No Positive
467479,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Shower head needed cleaning Limescale not a monsoon more of a light summer shower The Full English Breakfast was not chicken and tarragon sausages and turkey bacon No pork option Designed to appease the minority not to feed the majority The heating would not go below 19 degrees to warm to sleep in , The bed and room were comfortable clean and quiet 
467480,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Lack of hot water in the room so not able to shower and having to boil kettles to wash so it defeated the object of a relaxed weekend , The bed was lovely and comfortable the room spacious and the location great
467481,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Hot water wasn t working properly although this wasn t the fault of the hotel staff and they did make us very aware of it straight away and were very sorry which we were thankful for , Great location and friendly staff great wifi 
467482,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The reception area appeared disorganised and the receptionists have no defined work space which added to a generally unprofessional first impression Be sure to have the original credit debit card to hand on arrival as this is required before a room key will be issued The request for a quiet room did not appear on the booking information , Location was quiet and convenient for my needs The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable The bathroom had a spacious shower area with an excellent shower 
467483,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, No bar albeit I understand why no alcohol This usually creates a focal point and a buzz about the place that was lacking, Location and room were good
467484,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Agree with previous reviewer regarding lack of bacon , Very nice amenable hotel exactly in the area where we wanted to spend the weekend near our daughter s flat Ideal parking arrangements nearby Wonderful Antico restaurant just opposite 
467485,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The way they take money from your account day before you arrive and it clearly states on your site no payment will be taken until you arrive this is clearly not true the hotel just say it s only testing card and not taken money when it clearly left my account and had to wait six days to get my money back to my account I won t be going there again , Shower was lovely and comfortable bed
467486,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The walls were pretty thin and I felt like the room wasn t safely closed because there was a gap between the doors and the recess At night we could hear someone being really loud in the hallway I didn t like the decoration of the lobby but that s just a preference The decorative pillows and duvets weren t clean and even had some stains on them In the area around the hotel there wasn t that much to do but there is an outside gallery where you can find food stalls and take a look at the Tower Bridge We asked for a second duvet because the ones that the give you are quite thin , There was a fridge a kettle some tea coffee and a packet of cookies in the room Room 510 has a pretty nice view of the shard and you can see the London Eye In the bathroom they give you bio shower essentials and a shower cap but you have to pay 1 50 for a razor etc The hotel isn t that hard to find but the area at night might feel a bit unsafe There are many bus stops really close to the hotel and right across the square the is a Sainsburys local You can also get the radiator in the bathroom turned on They can also print tickets for you you just email the file to the reception It also has a hairdryer but remember to bring UK adapters or you ll have to pay 6 95 at the hotel you can get one for cheaper at Boots 
467487,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, A bit of a walk from the station about 15mins from London Bridge which isn t too far but needed a taxi with our bags , Overall a very good hotel it s rare that I go up in my budget but it was a nice change and worth the additional cost The staff were excellent facilities very good and the room was spacious and nice No complaints
467488,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, air con didn t work as room was too hot I complained in the morning and was told it would be fixed for my 2nd night it wasn t I had another hot night , room was nicely designed
467489,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Nothing specific it was quite a small room but for a short stay perfectly acceptable , Room arrangement was fun quiet with view over the square Comfortable beds and bed linen 
467490,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Strange room arrangement with desk behind bed Noisy heating system could hear hum from it all night , Clean and serviceable No road noise on 5th floor Near some great places to eat on Bermondsey st
467491,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Needs a proper reception desk rather than a chichi cabinet with no where to rest on You can take retro too far Also on a personal level the B 2 logo grates on my mathematical nerves as it is Bermondsey Square not squared , Just used the room which was lovely clean 
467492,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Location is a 10 15 min walk to any tube station No alcohol served in the hotel bar The check in reception is a random desk person that checked us in wasn t very clear when explaining the card pre authorisaton process , Comfy bed clean room but nothing special Nice large shower Big towels We able to leave our bags in the luggage room the day we checked out whilst exploring London Bermondsey market is on the door step Friday morning Sainsbury s local opposite 
467493,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Complex arrangements about when coffee was free and when it wasn t Plumbing issues our loo blocked and there was a pouring tap in the breakfast area all a bit undermining, Nice big room
467494,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Very limited space for hanging clothes No dresser Necessary to live out of suitcase for 5 days Used large desk surface area for suitcases Wonderful location for our purposes with easy connections to bus lines, Clever room design focusing on the business traveler Staff consistently friendly and helpful Poor drainage of water from shower with overflow into bathroom but very nice bathroom overall 
467495,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Didnt like there was no bacon so could not have traditional English breakfast of bacon and eggs Hotel owners should not foist their own dietary restrictions on their paying guests , Liked the ambience and quirkiness
467496,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, the quilt just say fitted the bed if I d been sharing a bed I would have had to fight for it, smoothies were lovely and scrambled eggs freshly made
467497,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, no convenient parking no alcohol served onsite, trendy boutique hotel located on Bermonsdey square cafe cinema few steps away nice food interesting room layout
467498,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Duvet was very bunchy some areas had no filling in at all Shower was fitted badly and could have done with a bleach to make it look brighter Not a great location for the tube although only a 15 minute walk and there was a bus stop nearby Bottles of water for the kettle would have been good , Quiet area and great staff We had a bite to eat before going out one night and food service was very good 
467499,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The fluctuating rate from one day to another it s understandable for high and low season but not day to day the days of instant coffee are long gone, The neighbourhood and its restaurants The hotel has the basics for a comfortable stay no bla bla bla
467500,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Directions to hotel weren t great so required a phone call to find it , Room spacious and nicely decorated Wonderful shower Great choice of food for breakfast with attentive staff
467501,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, No safe in your room no wardrobe either to hang your clothes Just some hangers at a coat rack Small breakfast buffet It is London but the room price is expensive for what you get , Quiet location nice neighbourhood 10 minutes walk from the London Bridge railway and underground station Friendly staff complimentary smartphone A good size room with comfortable bed 
467502,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, New management has imposed a no alcohol policy Obviously many of us think it is nice to have a glass of wine with a good meal although I can perfectly well survive without and certainly respect other peoples different preferences on this However being imposed a hotel management s biases is something that I am not expecting or happy with at all and never experienced before This feature of the hotel s policy is also not advertised on the webpage or its profile so it appear management realize it could impact bookings On the contrary the webpage advertise it is located in the heart of ever evolving Bermondsey with its thriving restaurant bar and club scene The omission of this policy on the webpage makes people like me feel there is a not full and honest transparency of the hotel s profile I have stayed many times at this hotel before but this new policy will make me reconsider returning I would suggest management consider changing it back and respectfully let their guests decide for themselves their approach to alcohol , Location is great comfy beds and staff very nice 
467503,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The bathroom smelt I complained and something was done which made the smell slightly better I think it is due to the open drain in the bathroom In the end I bought a 60p bottle of bleach from the Sainsburys next door and that sorted it , The bar restaurant in the square 
467504,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel,No Negative, The rooms overlooking the Square are quiet The hotel is in a great location with many independently run restaurants Fifteen minute walk to Tower Bridge and the city It is a cozy establishment which has a restaurant Staff pleasant and helpful Very clean with a really good shower room Toiletries provided with towels Really good value for the money
467505,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, The hotel is located in a very nice area but terrible for accessing public transportation , The room was great the staff incredibly nice and professional 
467506,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Check in reception is part of the cafe on the ground floor there is only one terminal and one member of staff to check in hence the process is slow when 4 or 5 rooms have to be checked in as when we arrived The superior room only has a shower with a fixed head and sound insulation between rooms is poor so much so that we were kept awake with some hanky panky which was clearly going on in the next room , Staff very friendly room was clean and adequate for a one night stay Bed was very comfortable
467507,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Not enough storage in room Rooms smallish but well designed Not enough coat hangers Always bring my own Reception and dining area lovely but decor in rest of hotel could do with a little revamp, Great location Beds very comfortable Breakfast good value Coffee and tea making facilities in room plus provision of iron Large desk Quality toileteries provided Hotel is quiet
467508,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Young male employee at breakfast was surly However the older proprietor manager and the young female staff member were lovely and seemed to try to compensate for the young man s attitude , Upon check in ordered English Tea and Brownies through room service which arrived promptly and brownies were delicious 
467509,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, I didn t have breakfast in the hotel I thought it was a little expensive but the food I did have was really nice so I am sure it would have been lovely There are lots of nice cafes on Bermondsey street which I went to , Getting given a free Mobile phone with data included in the room was just fantastic I could use the maps while I was out and about over the weekend The food I had in the hotel was all lovely the room was a good size all comfortable and it was a great location Also great value for this location 
467510,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel,No Negative, Great location in Bermondsey near London Bridge and related tourist attractions Fantastic and friendly staff who offered to mind my bags while I went exploring for the day 
467511,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel,No Negative, Lovely comfy bed great bathroom and facilities in room Great location as wanted some where to stay close to the shard and was only 10 minute walk away

467590,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, We checked in quite late around 11pm but having advised the hotel of this earlier that evening and were a little baffled at their disinterested attitude approach to check in we were pretty much left to find our check in sheet and chase up staff who were sitting around Although the rooms are very modern labelling them superior when they re actually very small and the smallest room on offer is a little misleading There s also no storage space which means manouvering your way around the room with stuff everywhere is a little difficult , Fantastic location comfy beds and lovely bright bathrooms Great location

467596,Bermondsey Square Hotel A Bespoke Hotel, Breakfast not included in price of room Room smelled a little unpleasant this was probably due to the construction work in the reception and our room not having a window that could open Added to this it rained hard the entire weekend which not the hotels fault of course , Staff were friendly when we arrived a staff member came outside to help us with our bags and show us the alternative entrance as the hotel reception area and lobby was being modernised
