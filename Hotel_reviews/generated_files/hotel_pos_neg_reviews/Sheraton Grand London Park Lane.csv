410514,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Was told by the check in staff whether we would like an upgrade for 60 which we could have free afternoon tea and free drinks at the bar when leaving were charged for everything embarrassing trying to argue our case at reception we had afternoon tea and one drink at the bar before going to dinner not the behaviour you would expect from a Hotel of this standard , Nice hotel very comfortable
410515,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Arrived back at the hotel after an evening out at 11pm to find no food was available other than room service which we ordered for 5 people Unfortunately it took 1 75 hours for it to arrive and was cold and not edible very disappointing The staff were very understanding the next day and apologised, The rooms were beautifully decorated beds really comfortable fabulous bathroom Superb polite staff throughout the whole of the hotel Excellent location for events in Hyde Park 
410516,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Ordered some more milk for a cup of tea never arrived asked to stay another night and was told fully booked then I asked for reservations a few weeks away got put through to another reservation area asked the same question and yes we have another night booked all to do with who we booked through previously , The staff were lovely and the decor is beautiful
410517,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Can have more fish and salads items on menu but like what s there , Gym staff everyone helpful More French wines at bar All in all my stay was great and I plan to be back after a visit to Essex Thank you to all the staff 
410518,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, The room allocated had no view at all but a view on the staircase of the next building Some individuals at the front desk staff not helpful at all rather arrogant no replenishment of in room amenities breakfast price outrageous , The Concierge Service was TOP they were on hand for their guests they are the heart of the hotel A few individuals at the Front desk were very friendly Location of the hotel is great overall feeling of the property fabulous 
410519,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Breakfast staff were not helpful and rude Some were difficult to understand because of their non English background , The bed was large and very comfortable
410520,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Perhaps the entrance to the hotel did not reflect it s status When we arrived we had to walk through the afternoon tea area and were a little bewildered as to where the reception was However a member of staff immediately stepped in and helped us with our luggage and showed us the correct reception desk , From the moment we arrived we were treated most politely and helpfully The room was very comfortable especially the bed superb 
410521,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane,No Negative, The property is fine but the staff is very unhelpful and way from being service oriented Very an placenta experience with the staff the Recprion specially
410522,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, The hotel does not meet all 5 star criterias The windows are all very old and has to be changed The bathroom window must be 30 years old and did not close But this is in no way to say the hotel is bad It just has few things to be adjusted and we did enjoy our stay , In general it s nice
410523,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, No housekeeping when we arrived back at room 4 30 in the afternoon to change for dinner Breakfast and staff are poor Wait to be seated empty hot trays and no offer of a coffee refill One day would be bad but we had breakfast prepaid for three days eat elsewhere , Pub staff were great and the location is central for shops restaurants and easy to get to shows 
410524,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Difficult to remember however I would say that lifts are a bit slow , Hotel has just been rennovated Perfect location I got luck to get a free room upgrade at arrival Wi fi is fast and works everywhere on the territory of the hotel Excellent breakfast 
410525,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, There club lounge food variety was not good at al Far behind all the other hotels in the park pane piccadilly strip They should work on improving that for sure , Overall really good hotel and location

410527,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, The lift had a mind of its own and every time took me on a floor by floor tour which was quite annoying, Room was lovely and Decor was great throughout 
410528,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Thought the rest of the staff were not so inviting The room was cold when we arrived Breakfast was cold Overall the hotel does not meet the standards of other 5 star hotel in that area I have stayed at the Millennium also the Mont Calm I would not stay at this hotel again unfortunately Also lifts were so slow , Thought the concierge who I think sounded French was exceptional Shame we did not see him again as I wanted to tip him
410529,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane,No Negative, Wonderfully renovated rooms with an art deco flavour Beautiful atmosphere in the lobby bar music and decor very tasteful Great service reception The rooms are very comfortable 
410530,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Windows were not insulated for sound or heat Bathroom window was so bad there was a freezing wind blowing right onto the toilet seat making the bathroom very cold Traffic noise all night even though we were at the back of the building , Large comfortable bed and well decorated room 
410531,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Disappointing Bathroom Horrible view despite booking superior room expecting view of St James s park, Large very comfortable bed bed linen Room decor
410532,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Moving around with a baby pram was difficult even accessing the breakfast lounge No staff around at any time to help with pram Not children friendly Missed doorman , The staff was very helpful and nice The bed is extra comfortable Room was spacious The lounge is very agreeable place to have a munch or a drink Wonderful ambiance 
410533,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Prices are high food taken in the room had an additional service charge cover charge and an optional gratuity added They tried to add 180 to our bill for breakfasts which we hadn t taken, The room was opulent the fittings and facilities were first class The location was perfect with many good restaurants just a short walk away
410534,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Room housekeeping is not as of five stars hotel they should be more professional in room cleaning one time the bathroom napkin found wet after they make up the bathroom also they put only one bottle of water while we are two person in the room The reception at check in didn t explain the hotel facilities locations and opening time He just gave me the key and that s it No view from the room window , The location is great
410535,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, dissapointed having been out site seeing all day with the family to arrive back some 8hrs later for the room still not to have been serviced and having to sit in the lounge area for an hour whilst the room was cleaned etc ,No Positive

410537,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, We went to reception to check on our reservation The mistakes started there First the girl named Caterina told us that our reservation was wrong and that she would show another room with extra charge We accepted because she told us that the hotel is all over booked and the others hotels in the city Then we gave our credit card and we got about 1100 pounds from our credit card in the name of a Russian customer We noticed and we objected Then She said She made a mistake and said that we had reservation she took about 1500 from our credit card And we asked him to show the room and cancel the credit card receip which s he had takes for for the Russian customer Although I did insist she did not show the room and did not cancel my credit card payment We asked for a signed letter about it will be canceled later She went a room next to reception and then gave us a signed paper She did not even look at our face when we went to the club brekfast room for breakfast the next day When we went to the room the room was cold we told to room service and then the technician came to our room after 20 minutes he said the air conditioning system would be late The room was not even warmed The room we had come from was like ice The technician said the radiator in the bathroom does not work and said it does not work in such rooms It was unbelievable we wanted to take shower but every stuff r was for a person Towel tooth brush soap etc There are so many things to tell these are just a few Unfortunately we could not change the hotel at that time because it is a very full hotel On the last day we waited for a taxi for 1 hour They said they were calling a taxi and they said they would arrive 10 minutes after 10 minutes They did not even find a taxi and by chance we were able to find it We found a taxi and we grew up on our plane I will never stay and recommend to anyone again personels behavior was really bad ,No Positive
410538,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, The beds were on castors and did move around quite a lot especially if leaning against headboard to read A brake would help , Twin beds that were more than standard 3ft and a thin and thick duvet to choose from Spacious room with a table and two chairs so needn t sit on the bed all the time Superb afternoon tea with free top ups of our favourite items Amazing selection of breakfast foods

410540,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, There is only two elevators so we have to wait for some time During my stay which is 4 nights everyday there is bad smell in the ground floor near the lobby area and reception also the restaurant ,No Positive
410541,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, The elevator was the only thing I didn t like Small and slow Yet if I ever was in London again I will for sure book the Sheraton Parke lane , Seriously this hotel is super great Clean comfortable excellent location friendly staff and secure I guess am not surprised since it s a Sheraton I never regret boozing at Sheraton anywhere I go honestly 
410542,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Poor service slow and poor breakfast at 25 extra 216 per night plus 25 for breakfast isn t good value recommend walking a few doors along to get a better breakfast 10 at Hendrys Waited 25 minutes to get served in the bar Ordered a bottle of champagne waited another 20 minutes to be told they didn t have any we left Poor Check out slow ,No Positive
410543,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Unfortunately we had an unexpected maintenance man visit at about 9 30pm Who had to turn off the hot water due to a leak which meant a cold shower in the morning The duty manager never did call to make arrangements for another room , Friendly staff

410545,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, The entire property is non smoking As a smoker it is very inconvenient and I will not stay at the hotel again because of this reason I understand the reasons behind that but I am not paying to stay in a place where I have to change and go out in the cold every time I need to smoke a cigarette There are other competing hotels where I don t need to do that , Location
410546,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, I made a reservation several months before my trip and made full payment already I was informed that the hotel rooms were over booked when I arrived the hotel If the rooms were over booked wondered why the hotel did not inform us in advance Don t know why the hotel staff managed it so badly In addition the smoke alarm was beeping at 5am but obviously there was no smoke ,No Positive

410550,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Reception staff Room too small Rooms hygiene breakfast offered not up to standard At night limited foods available to the rooms No varieties, Location of hotel
410551,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Breakfast was pretty busy Not all food items were available when I went up and had to make more than one trip, Nice lobby and bar area Enjoyed a few nice cocktails there Rooms were really nicely decorated and very comfortable 
410552,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Staff Two phone calls for ice Room wasn t serviced one of the days Asked to extend stay wasn t organised for us Only one lift operating, Location
410553,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Nothing exceptional air con needed to be off at night as a little chilly in the room , The location was suberb for us and what we wanted to do All the staff were polite courteous and without exception could not do enough for us 
410554,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Staff is extremely under trained and they are short of hands it seems It took forever to check in and I requested a connected room and the receptionist insisted that they don t have a connected room that turned out to be connected at the end Also one very slow elevator that serve the whole hotel , Location
410555,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Pricy Slow check in and we booked a twin bedroom but when we arrived they said its not available and we had to pay 40 per night to get an upgrade with twin bed, The hotel is nice in a good location and rooms are a good size
410556,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Only one lift working to 2nd floor No stairs I am claustrophobic and always use stairs No stairs Main desk staff very indifferent to my concerns over this Long queues for the lift Chevon was slow Not enough staff on, breakfast good Breakfast waiter was very quick and helpful Lovely waiter at the cocktail bar who was very friendly Room was good
410557,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Check in was terrible We arrived at 7pm to be told our room was not ready This was despite being told we would be charged 30 hour for a late check out The staff who handled our check in were arrogant unhelpful and unsympathetic While waiting for our room to be ready we saw two other guests who were given alternative rooms because their rooms weren t ready When I asked about that no satisfactory response could be given Having come off a long journey I was too exhausted to argue We waited There were no offers of drinks not even a glass of water The two times we ordered room service it took more than 20 minutes and countless calls to place the orders The first order which was a very straightforward American pancakes with maple syrup and streaky bacon per listed on breakfast menu arrived in 45 min in the form of pancakes with maple syrup and no bacon And because it came so late we ate them anyway without any butter cream or butter The second room service dinner came over an hour later and if not for multiple calls to chase following breakfast experience it would likely have taken even longer An apologetic staff Bastien was so far the only staff who genuinely demonstrated remorse at the shoddy service and removed much of the anger we felt toward the hotel He is the only staff who took some pride in his job Everyone else we encountered really sucked Needless to say we will never return to this hotel nor recommend it to anybody , Nothing This hotel should not be classed as a five star I have travelled extensively and stayed at the world s best and leading hotels and this is one of the most shockingly bad hotels I have ever had the displeasure of staying I have had better stays at Best Westerns 
410558,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, Breakfast in the club lounge was poor Dinner at the Italian restaurant was bland and poor service I note that the restaurant was offering 50 discount so I think that was fair value Perhaps it was new , Great hotel staff Lovely new room Terrific comfort
410559,Sheraton Grand London Park Lane, There is only one lift for the hotel and it was very slow so there was often a queue , Great location and lovely breakfast very friendly and accommodating staff
