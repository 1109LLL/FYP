324569,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, The only very minor negative comment was that the Lift was particularly slow This wasn t really too much of a problem but worth noting so that others are not surprised , The location was very quite and safe yet perfect for visiting all central areas of Vienna All areas were within easy walking distance from the hotel eg The Belvedere The Naschmarkt The Hofburg Palace etc etc The staff were very professional especially Reception staff and Breakfast staff including the young Italian Lady responsible for the Bar area The Room was very well appointed and immaculately clean The Bathroom was particularly well appointed On our arrival the gift of a Kaiserhof Sachertort was much appreciated and very tasty When we return to Vienna we will certainly stay at the Kaiserhof 
324570,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Absolutely nothing could be better, the reception staff were brilliant could not have been more helpful Reserved excellent local restaurant for special ocassion
324571,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, The location is just outside the core Innere Strasse but still only a short walk to all the main sites and is wonderfully quiet on its side street The Admiral Suite was excellent and good value if you want a big suite to treat yourself or for a special occasion without breaking the bank 
324572,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, We liked everything about this hotel, We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel The room was large the bed was comfortable The bathroom was modern with a great shower The hotel has a large breakfast room and a buffet breakfast with an excellent selection of both hot and cold items The location is on a quiet street about a 5 minute walk to the metro 10 minutes to the central train station and 10 minutes to central Vienna But what really made this hotel special was JOHANNES at the reception desk He was so pleasant and helpful He made us feel like welcome guests in his home 
324573,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, NOTHING, Johannes at the front desk was the best and most helpful concierge in the business Great and comfortable beds and pillows EXCELLENT breakfast all included in what was a very good nightly rate beautiful bathrooms Would stay here any time Totally great value even if the price had been higher Great location too 
324574,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, The bathroom was adequate but a little small And the shower would not consistently stay at a given temperature it would sporadically get really hot or really cold The location is good if you like a quiet neighborhood but not great if you like being very close to everything We found ourselves wishing that this hotel was inside the ring , After 3 weeks in Europe my wife and I both agreed that this hotel stood out for the friendliness of the staff they were all just wonderful but especially the woman at the front desk who always greeted us warmly by name The breakfast buffet is amazing in both variety and quality Who doesn t want to start their day in Vienna with a mimosa in a beautiful dining room with smiling and friendly staff attending to your wants needs We stayed in a romantic room that was very comfortable and romantic 
324575,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, There is no evening restaurant although very good bar snacks soups burgers salads etc are available and good value for central Vienna and prepared to order so this is more an observation than a dislike , A very nice hotel in central Vienna Our choice of room was a junior suite all of which are on the top floor and really quiet Very well appointed the beds were comfy and the rooms are air conditioned and spacious The bathroom was large and well stocked with essentials had a powerful shower over a bath which is unusual to find It s more usual to have just a shower Breakfast service was good with a wide variety on offer including hot options and as much as you wanted Staff were helpful attentive knowledgable and kind We would have no hesitation in staying again if we are visiting Vienna 
324576,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Lift from the 4th floor was out of order and no noticeable work to repair it was obvious despite a note in the room on our arrival to the contrary stating repairs would be carried out as soon as possible , Breakfast was very good staff attentive and friendly Room was very clean and comfortable I would certainly book here again 
324577,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, Best value for money hands down This hotel had everything and more Private sauna and steam room to ourselves lovely breakfast amazing location clean and well decorated room Can t say one bad thing about this place 
324578,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Nothing I wouldn t change anything , Everything was great The staff were very friendly and attentive Breakfast was fantastic I have a lot of food allergies and there was no problems for me with so many food selections Room was very clean and comfortable Great location Would definitely stay again and highly recommend 
324579,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, My room was on the ground floor and throughout my stay three nights there was an ominous looking vacuum cleaner parked next to my door most of the time On the second day I also found a bulky dirty laundry bag hanging on the door handle packed with what appeared to be towels and bed linens There was a message for you hanger attached which indicated that the bulky load had been left in response to a do not disturb sing on my door When I took the bag to the reception to ask what I was supposed to do with it I was told that the contents were for me to refresh myself I have never come across this do it yourself approach at any other hotel Considering that there were two bathrooms in the room and plenty of towels and considering also that the hotel has an environment friendly policy of not using extra towels unnecessarily the purpose of the laundry bag which I carried back to my room after the staff member s explanation remains a mystery Very odd , A beautiful hotel in a historical building located in a quiet area Very spacious comfortable and clean double room with two separate bathrooms Ideal for a business trip My check in experience was great and most staff members were very friendly Good breakfast selection The bar area is superb nice to have a quiet drink and read 
324580,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, We were not warned that hotel parking was off site and that cars were effectively inaccessible once parked by the hotel staff , The generally high standard of everything The staff were most helpful The position was very convenient for central Vienna The quietness of our room which looked onto a central courtyard 
324581,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Nothing of any note but if pressed there was no view from our room window We looked into a space surrounded by other room windows with a roof below , Whilst a large hotel it had a very friendly feel The staff were welcoming and nothing was too much trouble The room was spacious comfortable and clean 
324582,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Nothing Only that i couldnt stay longer and had to head back to Australia , I have travelled through Europe extensively over the years and have stayed in mostly 5 star hotels This hotel exceeded every expectation including superb rooms room12 clean and comfortable beds bathrooms that worked flawlessly excellent staff including the friendliest front desk service staff and wait staff and an ambience and decor second to none The breakfast selection was of the highest quality with the best choice of coffees and an extensive range of food This is a clear 5 star winner in my books and my 17 day European vacation could not have ended in a more spectacular fashion Thank you Kaiserhof Wien You gave me a sensational stay 
324583,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Nothing I didn t like , Very comfortable clean and staff extremely efficient and friendly More of a traditional style hotel Near a lovely park and transport systems Quiet but restaurants close by Excellent choice at breakfast pleasant bar in hotel Short walk from underground trains and some historical sites 
324584,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, This hotel is beautiful and should be five star I could not fault it Staff were welcoming and friendly the room was gorgeous and the facilities were excellent Staff became aware it was my birthday upon arrival and left a beautifully presented cake and message of congratulations in my room I would highly recommend this hotel and hope to return in the future

324586,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Add a daily newspaper , We treated ourselves to a small suite Well worth the added cost Very comfortable Located between Opera Karlskirch the Nascht market Only 5 min walk to Opera the Ringstrasse and fab Kartnerstrasse pedestrian only great vibe with shops dining people watching ending at St Steven cathedral Hotel close to bus tram metro GREAT breakfast Excellent staff 15 min Walk to museum quarter Vienna is THE classic European city 
324587,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, Great location near Old Vienna easy walking distance 5 10 minutes to Opera close to underground outstanding breakfast good service all around excellent experience 
324588,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, The hotel had not changed over to air conditioning but they did provide me with a fan Alas there is very little soundproofing in this 120 year old building and I had to endure three nights of disturbing noise from other rooms For the price one paid it was most disappointing , The pillows and bed were very comfortable Breakfast was fine with a fair amount of choice Service was excellent Staff was most accommodating in providing assistance in trying to plan trips outside Vienna as well as going beyond the call of duty in trying to alleviate the problems I encountered 
324589,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, In the room there was a little step undistinguished between the shower room to the sleeping room caused me and to my girlfriend bump into it I had to put a linen on to distinguish it I highly recommend the hotel staff to add a strap over it to avoid people from falling , Very friendly and helpful staff Johannes was very obliging and honest regarding money exchange Good breakfast I liked the cakes and the honeycomb Quiet and clean room The location is great Close to the center of the city We hope to come back 
324590,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Really no complaints , I travel a lot for work and leisure and been to many hotels in many places this hotel is the definition of an excellent 4 star hotel We loved everything from staff experienced professional breathing customer service to the lighting to room to amazing breakfast cozy atmosphere all the little details are there a chocolate on your pillow on hello a little far of jam at good bye Would gladly come back 
324591,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, If you re making your way from the metro it s a bit of a walk down a back street , Excellent boutique hotel about 500 meters from the Karlplatz metro Clean Superb breakfast 
324592,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, There was no true restaurant for dinner on the property but this was not really a problem staff made wonderful suggestions , The full breakfast buffet was delicious and fortified us until dinner The two Sachertort awaiting us in our room were amazingly good The location was ideal within walking distance of the Opera museums the ring tram the open air market Naschmarkt and the subway The staff was super and were able to arrange taxis tickets and reservations This is a super hotel and we were able to stay for a super price We will stay here again on returning to Vienna in the future It s a no brainer 
324593,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, That I had to leave because it was fully booked the next day and I wanted to stay I payed 280 there and had to pay 480 in the hotel K nig in Vienna Simmering which is a dump compared to the Kaiserhof This hotel took advantage of room shortage in Vienna Unacceptable bad business practice But I will wright this again when getting the request from booking com, Tradition and style as wel as class and Austrian hospitality at its best
324594,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, My three children had two comfortable beds and one sofa chair bed between them The latter was uncomfortable and we had to get it changed, Bed was particularly comfortable the breakfast was very good
324595,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, The Kaiserhof Hotel is a lovely small hotel approximately a five minute walk from the Opera in a quiet back street It has a period charm and the public areas and the bedrooms are all immaculately clean and well presented Our bedroom on the fifth floor was well equipped and had all we needed for a 3 night stay All the staff are very friendly and obliging and will assist with restaurant reservations travel directions and printing of boarding passes You never felt you were imposing when asking for assistance and nothing was too much trouble Crista is the stand out gem with a wealth of information at her fingertips and an excellent sense of humour Finally the breakfast is excellent with a huge choice in elegant and charming surroundings 
324596,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Nothing , Excellent breakfast with a huge choice something for everyone Very helpful staff without exception they were all approachable and nothing was too much trouble Room was lovely being both comfortable and very quiet Lovely bedding too All in all an excellent hotel which was close to a good train station with links to all parts of the city Would definitely stay here again if in Vienna 
324597,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, The mattress was unfortunately not that comfortable and could use an update And the movie channel sky had horrible connection sound and a sleep function would be nice , The dinning area and breakfast is amazing Staff is very friendly and helpfull Super location for getting around the city and all sights shopping restaurants etc Big rooms clean and silent Got a bottle of complementery wine on my birthday and a box of chocolate eater egg when leaving Highly recommend this place 
324598,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Cannot think of anything, The breakfast was the best ever both for choice which was exceptional and quality Never had better in 40 years of travelling The staff were wonderful extremely pleasant and nothing too much trouble A top class hotel with wonderful service
324599,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, The temperature control in the bedroom but it wasn t a problem really I m just trying to think of something when actually everything was great , Yes the croissants were extra flaky in fact the breakfast was fantastic 
324600,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, We re English we would have liked fresh milk for our tea in the fridge in our room I m sure room service would have brought it in a flash , The Kaiserhof is well located in a quiet side street about a 10 minute stroll from the centre of town and the Opera House The comfortable building is immaculately maintained with impeccable attention to detail Our room was spacious thoughtfully equipped and competitively priced Breakfast was a delight with lots of delicious Viennoiseries as well as a cooked offer which changed daily and a generous assortment of fruits yoghourts etc But what makes the hotel exceptional is its staff knowledgeable helpful welcoming and genuinely charming they made everything about our stay easy not to mention giving dynamite recommendations for good places to eat We have already recommended this hotel to picky friends and would certainly stay again should we return to Vienna And they have a well priced limo service to the airport 
324601,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Irregular temperature of water in the shower at times Not a major problem only very slightly uncomfortable , Lovely helpful and attentive staff throughout Very comfy bed Pretty good buffet breakfast Convenient location 
324602,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, It is really worth of staying and I did not find ANYTHING that makes me sad though as I have been to many hotels in all over the world and I know what I am talking about It is lovely clean good atmosphere good food and location and the staff is doing exactly what u expect from such hotel Amazing experience , The stuff is absolutely helpful the hotel is really really great I have been to many hotels but this one is really good I usually very sceptical about hotels but this hotel is beyond my expectations It is really well done and rooms are clean and they have great location and good value for its money No need to look for another hotels try this one and u will never regret it I was very very surprised how good the management of the hotel keeps it 
324603,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Having to leave , The suite we chose was excellent very spacious It was immaculate in every way Breakfast was excellent every day There was an excellent variety of food on the breakfast buffet and the soused herrings were wonderful All the staff were very helpful 
324604,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, The Premier Best Western Kaiserhof surpassed my expectations I had read the excellent reviews and as a result booked the property The excellent reviews do not do the hotel justice Staff was helpful professional and friendly The room was exceptional with anything available to you if you did not bring it with you Beds and pillows were very comfortable the bathroom was nice and big with a bath and shower The location was excellent as well with free parking on the week end Last but certainly not least the breakfast was outstanding I have stayed in many four star facilities in Austria and this one is the BEST

324606,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, breakfast, breakfast very good but overpriced room and reception personnel very efficient only weak point is d internet reception but on d whole a very good and central hotel will recommend and if we r back in vienna will surely come back
324607,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, I have one small issue I was greeted by a very enthusiastic helpful nice young man on my arrival on Tues evening Indeed I rang my wife to tell her how nice he was However I was then dealt with by an unfriendly woman who I thought was quite disrespectful Perhaps being Irish a smile comes easy but with my chronic health problems it s difficult to see how this woman could have worse issues or couldn t scrape up a smile little bit of positivity Other than that this property is a fantastic facility in a great location in a stunning city , I really couldn t fault this wonderful spotless hotel The ladies taking care of breakfast cleaning were exceptional and the chaps on Reception on Departure were really friendly 
324608,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Unfortunately the corridor before our room smelled like a painter s studio in the sauna there was no dressing room and just three couchs and last but really worst the meals we consumed in the bar for lunch were merely the quality of a bad diner the meat burnt and the cheese of our burgers still cold really disgusting The chicken in our chicken salad was comparable to McDonald s like it never had been a whole chicken Not at all what one expects from a hotel like this Moreover there was only one waitress in the bar at lunch time who obviously had to do all the cooking if you can call it like this for defrosted meals as they seemed and serving the guests , The room was perfect the staff more than friendly the breakfast was extremely good 
324609,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, If you want to feel as a princess or as a reign couple in everything start with entrance food room comfort people and personnel all organising options city location everywhere everything is of very high level We were offered even this hotels net membership card All is very very very magic 
324610,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, There s barely any public transportation accessible directly to the airport and taxi charges a fixed fee of 37 euro I took the airport bus and transferred to metro U1 to get here But as long as you ve got here everything is fine you can go everywhere almost by walking Room was not ready when I arrived at 4 p m Room quality is same as on the pictures but single sized quilt is a bit constraint for one person , Good breakfast staff at pantry are nice Good value for money Nice wifi 
324611,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, The gym was rather basic and tiny area not suitable for use with more people at the same However the equipment was in good conditionand the room was clean and had fresh fruit available , Great atmosphere old nice building but with todays comfort Great staff
324612,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, The free wi fi was actually limited This was a big problem for me I would not have booked this hotel if I had known There were few English channels To compensate we tried to watch TV over the internet but due to low data the internet cut off within a couple of hours We stayed at numerous hotels in other European cities and this was a first The internet was flaky even when we had it The room was a little cold and we could not control the heat in the room Not close enough to city center for me , The front desk staff were very helpful in all aspects of our stay They went out of their way to answer all questions I appreciated the cleanliness of our bathroom spotless I enjoyed the incredible offerings for the breakfast buffet and the really nice support staff The room was nicely decorated plenty of storage for luggage They offered chocolates on our pillows and fresh chocolate cakes and a large bottle of still water on our arrival On our departure we were offered fresh jam

324618,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, They had no room service because the person at reception was alone and could not leave the desk but overall it was a really nice hotel, Very beautiful enjoyable breakfast coffee was really good Stuff at reception is friendly and take care of small details
324619,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, All services were great The hotel was located just near the university where we had meeting A pleasent suprise were welcoming sweets on the pilow nonalergic cosmetics 
324620,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, A pity the hotel does not have a full restaurant and you ll only get some snacks so you will have to venture out in the cold of the night looking for dinner , The breakfast is excellent the proximity to public transport be it tram bus or tube is also a huge advantage The hotel is in walking distance to the Karlskirche and many other famous places 
324621,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, My partner and I liked everything about this hotel but especially the staff and the hotel atmosphere were perfect I usually do not stay twice at the same hotel in the same city but after this I am considering to make an exception

324623,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, The hotel was spotless all the staff were really kind and helpful especially Christa on Reception who arranged for a wonderful birthday surprise for me I was served pink champagne for breakfast and had a Sachertorte cake waiting for me in my room on my return at the end of a lovely day in a beautiful city 
324624,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Pillow why do European hotels persevere with those oversize pillows that have absolutely no body to them You completely sink into it useless as tits on a bull Ended up using the tiny pillow, Friendly staff good breakfast close to major underground station good sized rooms
324625,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, The bed linen and towels could be crisper Bell boys should help particularly the elderly and women irrespective of tip expectations, Excellent breakfast Efficiently managed
324626,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Wifi was a bit erratic at times I chose a romantic room for a special occasion which was lovely but largely due to exchange rate changes between booking and visit turned out to be more expensive than expected I m sure a standard room would have been fine and represented better vfm , Wonderful breakfast Large comfy bed Friendly welcoming and helpful staff Great location to access much of the city by foot or public transport A really nice touch with a card and cake to welcome us on a special occasion 
324627,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Wish we could have stayed longer , For our first ever trip to Vienna we are lucky to have chosen this hotel Loved the quiet location but within easy walking distance to the town center The classic room was very comfortable and the bed and pillows super comfortable The breakfast buffet was extraordinary Worth the price of the room in our opinion 
324628,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Poor air conditioning Very uncomfortable bed Little items missed If you were not at breakfast early many food items were not replenished, Room was large Staff tried to help when asked
324629,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Absolutely nothing , Everything about this hotel is simply first class Its location is within walking distance of the vast majority of major visitor attractions in Vienna Should you wish to go further then the historic centre it is very near to Karlsplatz Underground Station The Staff from top to bottom are extremely helpful and very warm in their approach to guests The breakfast is first class very difficult not to find something which you like every morning The general ambience of the hotel is simply elegant Rooms are spacious What more could one wish for Value for money in the true sense of the word

324632,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, I didn t like that the kitchen is limited only for serving breakfast and after serving the breakfast is closed I didn t like that asking for a fork and knife than I have to pay some euros as service charge this is not a 1 2 star hotel , I like the friendly staff in all the areas 
324633,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, This hotel is extremely well appointed Helpful staff clean very comfortable nicely decorated rooms Nice quiet A short walk into the city centre Would highly recommend this Hotel in Vienna

324635,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, We arrived around 8 30 pm and were given a room on first floor even though we specifically request upper floor room with our booking The lady at the reception was not accommendating at all just dismissed our request and saying that the room we were given was the last room which we later suspected was not true , Love the great location comfy beds and pillows and the very rich breakfast buffet
324636,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien, Nothing It was all very nice , The hotel was beautiful from the lobby to the sitting room for cocktails or tea Then to the lovely breakfast room White table cloths but yet feel of informal for comfort I think this was the best breakfast Ive had in any hotel I had a bad experience in Italy before arriving I was pickpocketed and arrives in this hotel without any Credit Cards or money The staff was very helpful particularly Corrine who was able to find the proper numbers for me to have CC sent to the hotel This took much pressure off my stay They also accommodated any of my needs due to my circumstances I will stay there again and in fact plan another trip soon just to enjoy this lovely hotel

324641,Best Western Premier Kaiserhof Wien,No Negative, After traveling for four weeks in four countries in Europe this hotel was my favorite I was nervous at first thinking that since it s a chain hotel that it wouldn t have charm but it was the opposite the staff was super friendly helpful and knowledgable I hope the manager realizes how professional and kind his staff is The breakfast as well as the restaurant staff was AMAZING It was healthy and fresh and had something for everyone The beds were the most comfy we slept in during our entire trip The bathrooms were also really nice The location is also really convenient Thanks for a great stay We will be back Did I mention that breakfast
