221268,The Chess Hotel, The view could have been a little better , Staff was excellent very helpful Hotel was in a pretty good location and not far from lots of attractions I spent 3 weeks in Europe and this by far was the best hotel during my entire stay 
221269,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, Lovely boutique hotel with the theme of Chess in black and white Very comfortable beds with good quality bedding Located very close to the Opera and easy access to all places Nice food around too 
221270,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable bed excellent shower heated towel rack sound proof double glazed windows on lower floor rooms quiet nicely decorated reception lounge and breakfast room Security is good The Staff is extremely helpful and patient with many questions coming at them My only complaint is the elevator which is completely inadequate for a hotel with that many bedrooms typical of many Parisian hotels 
221271,The Chess Hotel, There is only one lift so it can take ages Breakfast is rather overpriced , Hotel feels super luxury The beds are so comfy the water pressure is great and the amenities are of a high quality It is walking distance to lots of sights and a lot of good shopping The hotel feels super private and is super quiet It is also quite secure entry into the building by key card 
221272,The Chess Hotel, The hotel was not very clean specially on the hallways and elevators Phone in the room was visibly broken on the earpiece Curtain in the room was stained by what we think was food Made staff aware of this Airconditioning not working properly and room was stuffy We had stayed before and the first time was perfect this time around not so much, Location of hotel and friendliness of staff 
221273,The Chess Hotel, It was a bit expensive but I guess it is normal for a nice hotel in central Paris Also there is loud music playing in the halls which wakes you up if you want to sleep till the afternoon , The staff were absolutely amazing and very helpful Also during your stay you get a free phone with unlimited calls and data which is really good when you are completely new to Paris and maybe even France 
221274,The Chess Hotel, Air conditioning was available in the room however this was controlled by the management we were advised that it was only available to warm the room and not to chill the room due to the time of year of our visit We visited late March and it was warm in the room so this would have been useful , Excellent location with a good range of shops cafes and restaurants nearby Within a few minutes walk of metro stops an ideal base for visiting Paris either on foot metro or by bus Beautiful hotel throughout with friendly and welcoming staff 
221275,The Chess Hotel, No amenities in the bathroom how nice it is to wash your hair with a plain soap sheets with stains on the top fortunately the inside seemed clean very small hanging rail and closet , Calm and modern Nice lobby Nice bathroom No noise Nice pillows Nice location nearby the Opera House 
221276,The Chess Hotel, its way to expensive for what you get the room fecilities isnt that amazing you have hotel such a scribe 7 min from there and the same rate but much better rooms and fecilities , staff
221277,The Chess Hotel, Breakfast is expensive compared to other restaurants on the doorstep Very few non French tv channels for when relaxing in room which was not a lot but it did happen option to change subtitle language on the tv menu but it didn t work , Fab location walking distance of many tourist attractions close to metro stations clean and safe to walk around any time of day Many restaurants and supermarkets nearby A good selection of breakfast foods in the lounge each morning Very clean rooms big shower with adequate water pressure very comfy bed and pillows Mobile phone in each room which gives free calls and texts to anywhere in Europe plus free 4g and able to take with you around the city for web surfing this was an excellent tool 
221278,The Chess Hotel, 1 Reception We stayed for 3 days but our room card was set only for 1 day Therefore we received the farewell SMS on the first day and we had to go to reception and explained that we are staying for 3 days instead of 1 2 Elevator The elevator was not in good condition for us which made a noice and it shook severely every time when it started to lift 3 Very noisy when it rained It was not possible to sleep when it was raining because the room is right next to iron roof top which made huge noises when it rained 4 Equipment There was no electronic kettle 5 Temperature problem We booked 2 rooms together one room with air conditioning set at 17 degrees was very hot but another room with 26 degrees was cold It was not possible to lower the temperature we tried to open the windows but the problem is that the room is located just in the face of range hood which the smoke made us uncomfortable Staff offered to turn off the air conditioning but it would be no air floating which we didn t like it All these elements made is an unpleasant stay , Location is great 5 minutes walk from RoissyBus direct bus from the airport 3 minutes walk from Galeries Lafayette and Monoprix supermarket is just around the corner downstairs Staff were nice and greeted us with small box of chocolates and hand written card We really like the design and chic equipments 
221279,The Chess Hotel, This is an unusual small thing to comment on but the three low hanging halogen lights above the bed drove me crazy I kept turning them on by accident and felt like I was under an oven griller or being seriously interrogated , General location is great for a shopping and sights trip but I wasn t really a fan of the side street although it s quiet and well lit Rooms are modern and tasteful 
221280,The Chess Hotel, We had asked for a double room as my son and I wanted separate beds We were not expecting such a small room and hotel it was more like a double bed which my son and I had to share , Everyone was really nice hotel was clean 
221281,The Chess Hotel, Nothing Common parts small but that only matters if you want to spend time in the hotel Bedroom v good size, Super staff team lovely bedroom great experience
221282,The Chess Hotel, Coffee and tea equipment in rooms , Hotel is very nice and comfortable rooms are not too small security is respected can not enter the hotel without key card breakfast is generous great choice very tasty and fresh bread croissants sausages cheese various type of coffee juice etc staff is very efficient and helpful Internet is strong enough no connection problems in rooms I found local fully charged phone set in room which I could use for free Very rare service Location is perfect 
221283,The Chess Hotel, The entrance is not that inviting it is a cold hallway and the reception is upstairs which is hidden from the rest of the hotel There are no open spaces It is all a bit small and not what you would have suspected from the photos , The room is good with an excellent bed and a great bathroom 
221284,The Chess Hotel, I asked for connecting room however the room is side by side without door to connect each other and breakfast don t really have many choices , the staff are friendly location is very near
221285,The Chess Hotel, I know it s France but tea coffee making facilities in the room would have made it perfect , Location was excellent and everywhere was accessible Restaurants Theatres and shopping were all within reasonable walking distance to the hotel Staff was so approachable and nothing was too much trouble for them Events and shows were all accessible by the mobile phone allocated to your room so you could check on shows distances and table booking before leaving the hotel 
221286,The Chess Hotel, Breakfast didn t start until 7am we had a 645am pick up from hotel and the gentleman covering the night shift was less than helpful We had advised reception the day before departure of our pick up time and breakfast was included in our rate , Loved the mobile phone that was provided free of charge for the duration of stay Loved the security
221287,The Chess Hotel, Room was a little small but shower was big and the bed was great so in the end no complains at all , Very good bed and shower Really tasty and complete breakfast Close to the Opera so to the shops in the middle of town I won t search for another hotel next time I m in Paris I will go to the Chess Hotel Friendly and helpfull staff they make you feel at home 
221288,The Chess Hotel, Access and initial impressions were a little disappointing plus bar area in the hotel was a little underwhelming , Location was perfectly central to enable us to do all the major tourist places Beds were super comfy as well 
221289,The Chess Hotel, Landry service was auful they will charge for huge amount but was not properly washed at all They will give you a Wifi code which is only accesscible with one device per code and room was extremely small compared to other rooms that you could get with same value, Bed was comfy
221290,The Chess Hotel, yes entrance hallway is a bit tricky but wait until you get to the social area at the reception level , beds are super fresh comfy and linen extra crispy big plus breakfast was high quality food and really nice selection loads of fruits great espresso coffee water with mint available at the reception also a welcome water in the room 
221291,The Chess Hotel, We always make a short trip to Paris in September and have stayed in quite a few boutique hotels but the rooms at The Chess Hotel were shockingly small We made reservations for the SUPERIOR Double Room but it felt like what we would in England call a SMALL double room There was only space for a bed and a long narrow side table to one side of the the wall right below the suspended TV Also there needs to be more than ONE staff member in the evenings The poor man was in charge of manning the reception as well as attending to inquiries made by guests at their rooms and preparing the meals that may apparently be ordered from the 24 hour dining service the hotel advertises We decided against ordering in room service when we realised he had to do everything by himself , The location was good 
221292,The Chess Hotel, Nothing to complaint , Fantastic Staffs are helpful and informative Location is really great close to restaurants shoppings and metro They have a mobile phone you can use for data and phone calls Enjoyed our stay so much and will revisit for sure 
221293,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, Happy that the room was air conditioned While not a fan of rain showers there was a hand shower option and the water pressure was fantastic Most comfortable bed I ve slept in at a hotel in a long time 
221294,The Chess Hotel, Rein , Excellent hotel with a great location We got the room at an excellent price also and found it particularly comfortable Location near to Opera has been very useful also 
221295,The Chess Hotel, The kitchen bar was closed for the week that we were there Our bad luck , The bed was amazingly comfortable and the complimentary mobile phone with data was a very welcome bonus 
221296,The Chess Hotel, Side street where hotel is located is dirty , Great location Room was really nicely decorated and very comfortable On a side street so no street level lobby but the staff was very pleasant 
221297,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, This hotel has so many good points Fantastic staff excellent location close to metro stop opera good selection for breakfast with gluten free option clean rooms gave a mobile phone full of information bathrobe slippers toiletries provided Air conditioned rooms Close to restaurants and cheap fast food places
221298,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, Quirky decor and fabulous location especially if you are travelling to Charles de gaulle it s just round the corner from bus stop Rooms were spacious and the bathroom was a dream Slippers and dressing gown supplied 
221299,The Chess Hotel, The room rates were a bit high but reasonable considering the location , You can ask for kettles It is very close to the tourism centre the Lafayette shopping malls and the Opera house with sightseeing bustops close by Easy access to underground and trains The hotel had good security because you need your room card to access the front door The music played after you enter the front door was nice You could store your luggage for free after check out The hotel has very modern and cold interior design 
221300,The Chess Hotel, Approach entrance gives wrong impression otherwise of a good hotel Breakfast is less exciting than being offer the hotels , The location the staff and reasonable but not too exciting breakfast I must especially mention of two receptionists Ms Virgine and Stephanie they really care for their guests and are very cooperative
221301,The Chess Hotel, Access is one door onto the street so waiting with suitcases for a taxi was an unusual experience not really a dislike , Walking distance to so many interesting places including Galleries Lafayette Liked the breakfast room 
221302,The Chess Hotel, Staff and service Nearly midnight fire alarm was activated accidently during 15minutes No explaining neither excuse about that happening Some staff s French is quite difficult to understand as well , Location and possibility of having a connecting family room 
221303,The Chess Hotel, There is only one elevator for the whole hotel The staff don t help with the luggage Their normal superior room was too small , The location of the hotel was perfect The deluxe room was the perfect size and it had all the necessary facilities and amenities and more The hotel was also very clean and the chess theme made it interesting I will definitely be staying here again 
221304,The Chess Hotel, There is one elevator that services all the hotel so you have to wait sometimes to get to your room The lobby reception bar breakfast are all in one small area, Small hotel but well designed Rooms are small but have all the amenities and comfort Decorated with style Location is excellent near the department stores No one can access the hotel without a key which gives a feeling of security Love the small entrance and music in the hallway 
221305,The Chess Hotel, The concierge persuading us to take a bus trip that he recommended rather than a more appropriate one we had picked because he received a commission on the one he picked For older people this hotel is a little difficult as there is no assistance available and the entrance is quite a distance to the rooms and the lift is small I still have the bruises from the door closing on me , The shower the room which although small had a large Tv screen and the breakfast was excellent 
221306,The Chess Hotel, The only access up to the hotel lobby and rooms is through one lift at the end of a long thin corridor Access to using the stairs is limited to leaving the building only This means you can be waiting a long time to get up to your rooms lobby Some of the plug spots are so tight that once you plug in an adaptor your plug doesn t fit But there are quite a few plugs around the room Although annoying this didn t hamper our stay or how much we liked the place , Comfy beds cool airy rooms large window large TV 2 showerheads rainforest regular great hairdryer staff were all lovely and spoke English free mobile for bringing out and about Great location too just a ten minute walk from the Louvre beside Galleries Lafayette shopping centre like Harrods and for coffee addicts Starbucks and McDonalds are just around the corner Nice bars for all fresco drinks just around the corner too 
221307,The Chess Hotel, The morning afternoon staff mistaken my booking i booked two bedrooms connecting to each other but they gave me only 1 room with 1 bed I checked in very late in the evening so the midnight shift staff didn t really know about the booking already prepared by the morning afternoon shift he said But the midnight staff is very helpful though Elevator is very small and only has 1 to serve the whole building , Beds are comfy location wise very good Room is tad small 
221308,The Chess Hotel, A couple of shirts hanged on the chair was lost after room cleaning The room service contractor company was informed but no help The reception apologized for the missed items but that was it Keep your shirts in the luggage next time , The room amenities minibar check in 
221309,The Chess Hotel, The breakfast could have had more choices but it was still good , The bed was really comfortable The bathroom was my favourite Love that I got a phone to use during my stay
221310,The Chess Hotel, The cleaning of the room need to be better as we found dirt on the floor and fruit pit from previous occupiers , The staff at the reception are excellent 
221311,The Chess Hotel, Can t think of anything , Great hotel base for getting around the centre of Paris The metro is a few minutes walk and the local area has many bars restaurants so you don t have to go far for a good evening out The staff were all very friendly and the rooms quiet and clean Would happily book there again 
221312,The Chess Hotel, Could not have been better , Rooms were airy and light Much larger than other hotel rooms in Paris Spotlessly clean and up to date decor A must stay hotel 
221313,The Chess Hotel, Narrow entrance top attic rooms is small and the air condition flow directly to our faces and bodies and we wake up sick No tea or coffee maker facilities , It s the best location near opera shopping streets air francs shuttle bus resturant cafes and night life Very clean comfy beds clean and new baths
221314,The Chess Hotel, I was lucky to get a discount price because I booked the last moment but regular pricing is rather high But it s Paris after all One thing I didn t like is almost no wardrobe space in a double room so if you come for a logner visit or with 2 people staying in the room placing all your beautiful garments on the racks will be challenging , It was my first time staying on the Right Bank and I enjoyed it a lot A cosy hotel beautifully designed with great service comfy bed and practical shower room If you plan shopping or Louvre tour or a night at Opera Garnier you can t find a better location 
221315,The Chess Hotel, The design of the plastic shampoo bottles make it very hard to get anything out , This hotel is perfectly stuated one block at away from the Opera and close to the main Dept stores and metro The rooms are well thought out with quality finishes I liked the breakfast selection for the quality food and simple set up There are also drinks available in the afternoon if you desire 
221316,The Chess Hotel, I paid via booking online for my stay I was shocked that when I was checking out the receptionist asked me to pay 145 Euros Tax when the initial amount I paid for the room is almost the same This wasn t mentioned anywhere when booking the hotel which was a bit disappointing There was no concerige service when I checked in had to carry my suitcases by myself which was inconvenient , Loved everything about the room very comfortable although a bit small The location is amazing 
221317,The Chess Hotel, Had to ask for kettle and cups but it was provided right away The entrance was a bit odd but got used to it and it was entering an apartment building and felt like home , The room were nicely and smartly designed The receptionist was great and the location near shopping area and Galleries La Fayette and lots of cafes and restaurants cinema Walked to the Louvre Museum The TV had a good selection of English and Arabs channels which was a bonus 
221318,The Chess Hotel, A little expensive , The location was perfect and central Staff were friendly and spoke good English free wifi and the room was clean I would consider staying in this hotel again for sure 
221319,The Chess Hotel, A bit more space in the room is always welcome but hard to expect in central Paris , Very stylish design for an affordable price Discreet yet super convenient location 2min walk to the subway 
221320,The Chess Hotel, There was an AC but we couldn t turn it on because the control panel didn t work There were no extra beds or electricity converters or coffee tea makers No english speaking channels on the tv so we didnt enjoy watching anything , The location was really good and the high security before intering the hotel The rooms are beautifully decorated and clean 
221321,The Chess Hotel, Maybe could have a bit more cafe bar service , Great Location clean and tidy premises clean room and comfortable bed Good price quality ratio for Paris standards 
221322,The Chess Hotel, The door in bathroom doesn t shut properly so it s not particularly private and the breakfast is rather expensive , Excellent staff so helpful helping to get tickets for museums and really great cosy rooms Very comfortable bed Good chocolates left in the room 
221323,The Chess Hotel, Lobby area small Reception also Didn t get the sense we were staying in a hotel as the lobby was on first floor The welcome was lukewarm and at the end of stay we were not asked did we enjoy our stay , Excellent location Very comfortable room and bed and good shower Nice welcome card 
221324,The Chess Hotel, The breakfast could have been a little more plentiful but I guess it was ok for France, The staff was so friendly and helpful and check in check out was quick and easy My room was very spacious and clean the bed incredibly comfortable and the shower just perfect 
221325,The Chess Hotel, Breakfast was pricey , Great location Just round the corner from the Palais Garnier and Galleries Lafayette Quiet stylish and comfortable rooms too A great base to explore central Paris 
221326,The Chess Hotel, No bad experience , The location was ideal as it was near to Galeries Lafayette It is also walking distance to the Louvre The staff was very attentive especially Patrick 
221327,The Chess Hotel, Only access from entrance via lift caused regular delays due to small size , Great location Comfy bed Decent breakfast Staff very helpful with local restaurants etc 
221328,The Chess Hotel, The booking information seemed to suggest that parking was available and actually it was at a public car park or on street which wasn t what was expected It was all fine in the end, Location was great and everything was as expected
221329,The Chess Hotel, The hotel was hot I m guessing bc it was unseasonably warm they were reluctant to turn on the air conditioning I woke up covered in sweat and the lobby was super warm also , It was quirky and luxurious but the staff was far and away the BEST part of the hotel They were accommodating and helpful at every turn Fantastic 
221330,The Chess Hotel, Breakfast wasn t really worth the money but it wasn t bad , The bed was very comfortable The reception on the first floor made it feel more secure 
221331,The Chess Hotel, That they have charged me twice and now trying to claw my money back costing me time off work to do so as has cleared my bank account , the location and how the hotel looked
221332,The Chess Hotel, My only issue was the air con heating in the room which I think is controlled centrally and our room was too warm We had lovely big windows that we could open though , Almost everything Chess hotel is a fantastic hotel and would definitely recommend Staff extremely helpful friendly and spoke fantastic English Location superb Even the gorgeous smell as you enter the hotel is worth it Our room was a good size and bathroom was quite large with a fantastic big shower 
221333,The Chess Hotel, The room was quite small with no room to put suitcase , Excellent location very safe and clean hotel the room was lovely very modern the staff were excellent 
221334,The Chess Hotel, Room was too small Bed is small Aproximately all TV channels are french TV channels Too expensive not worth the money you pay No hairdryer in the room We had to ask 3 times to bring one One lift You have to wait long to go up or down Not good sound isolation you hear everything from the street or from the other rooms , Clean location is good but not perfect 
221335,The Chess Hotel, Nothing, The staff and the service was excellent The facilities and the room were lovely and the hotel was reasonably centrally located without being noisy Would definitely visit again and have reccomended to others 
221336,The Chess Hotel, The room is a bit small, Good location just 5 min s walk from the metro station to the hotel the staff are very friendly as I was rushing to the airport I asked them to help me post the postcard not sure whether they did it already thanks in advance 
221337,The Chess Hotel, Hotel freeze full amount of stay from the credit account although free cancellation is stated when booking Then it is unclear who is responsible for the freeze and when if it is released hotel staff have no information on it Dealing with this issue took much time , Facility was ok renovated and in good conditions Good location for shopping in the large store 
221338,The Chess Hotel, the room did not have any complementary coffee or tea even after ask The final bill was significantly higher than quoted in the booking com, location staff room cleanliness room decors
221339,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, The staff here were lovely Really friendly as soon as we arrived and really couldn t do enough for you The room itself was stylish and very comfortable My Wife and I stayed for 3 nights and it was a great base to explore all of the sites It s only a 15 min walk from the Louvre and Opera itself is a good location with plenty of Cafe s etc 
221340,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, The welcoming and helpful attitude of the staff was 1st class The facilities excellent the location excellent the free Wifi is great in the room or at the bar great service and response time Food at the hotel was also excellent quality I simply loved the experience and will be back when next in Paris 
221341,The Chess Hotel, Room was very very small and I booked a bigger version and view was towards a white painted concrete wall No desk to work at in the room Very claustrophobic Even corridors and entrance was small , Nice decor Nice concept
221342,The Chess Hotel, A welcome tray tea and coffee in the room would be appreciated The bathroom amenities could be more generously supplied , The hotel is very conveniently located and easily reached by all mode of transport The staff is very professional and efficient The rooms and bathroom are tastefully decorated and very comfortable 
221343,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming and helpful We were assisted with some last minute sightseeing plus they went out of their way to assist us in retrieving a lost mobile phone Couldn t recommend the service highly enough 
221344,The Chess Hotel, Rooms are tiny for the price you pay Wifi for my husband was not as smooth, Helpful Staff Excellent location Clean and well maintained as new hotel Comfortable bed
221345,The Chess Hotel, Breakfast too expensive, Everything has been perfect thank you to all the staff for being so kind and smiling we definitively will come back great hotel
221346,The Chess Hotel, when booking I learned that mini bar is free but when i checked in found out that was not true lift needs maintenance as it had uneasy sound , reception staff were very helpful 
221347,The Chess Hotel, Like many other 3 to 4 star hotels in Paris the standard rooms are very small in isize , Great location if you are interested in visiting shopping places such as Galleries Lafayette and Printemps Also for metro connections to other areas 
221348,The Chess Hotel, I think the rooms should have a coffee tea maker It would be my only request , Location couldn t be better really close to the big stores to metro station to restaurants but in a calm and silent street Hotel is new clean the bedroom very comfortable comfortable bed front desk young ladies very helpfull and always with a smile in their faces 
221349,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, Last year we stayed at W round the corner from Chess it was x2 the cost the bar noise was dreadful my advice stay at Chess visit the W for a late night drink
221350,The Chess Hotel, The bathroom is far too small and the shower floods , The location is second to none Right in the middle of the city yet so quiet we could open the doors windows at night 
221351,The Chess Hotel, Only minor point is that hotel is not on main road but staff were great in getting taxis for us within just a couple of minutes Overall it was a wonderful stay , Excellent location near Opera and Galerie Lafatte Very close to stop for toir buses Ultra modern hotel and facilities very stylish All staff were superb and helped with a number of requests including tickets for shows and directions Free WiFi

221353,The Chess Hotel, There is no kettle coffee or tea in the room which is unacceptable for a four star hotel , The friendliness and understanding of the staff Location excellent 
221354,The Chess Hotel,No Negative, I just have to commend Emanuelle and Isabelle They went ABOVE AND BETOND to assist me and my son We were delayed by train from Lyxembourg which would have prevented us from picking up our Paris Pass documents Even though short staffed they went to the facility that distributes these passes and pick them up for us so we would be able to enjoy Paris and not waste our investment I run Customer Experience for my company Alriaource and I can honestly say that these two employees are two of the best service individuals o have ever encountered I would hire them in a heartbeat It is my hope that they are aptly rewarded and recognized for providing exemplary service Thank you Regards Jennifer
