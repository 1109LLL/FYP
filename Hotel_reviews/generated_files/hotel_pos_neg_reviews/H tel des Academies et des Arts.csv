55145,H tel des Academies et des Arts, There was nothing we did not like , Managers and staff were so helpful and friendly Really made our stay extra special The Hotel was very comfortable quirky and the extra effort to highlight the arts was excellent 
55146,H tel des Academies et des Arts, I looked a place in Saint Germain from Booking com but the hotel is in Vavin Saint Michel and room was very very small , staff especially reservation officer 
55147,H tel des Academies et des Arts, The room was tiny although this is almost normal for Paris hotels but it hardly could qualify for 4 stars , The staff was very friendly and helpful and the location is excellent 
55148,H tel des Academies et des Arts, absolutely the same breakfast every day with almost only bread, Great location nice personnel very good wi fi rooms are quite small but cosy and clean very nice interior
55149,H tel des Academies et des Arts, Nothing it was just what we wanted for our paris stay , The reception staff concierge were great Very friendly helpful with great advice for local restaurants and just getting around Being in the middle of a heatwave the air conditioning in the room was fantastic and really made our stay Plus the sound proof windows really blocked out the street noise considering how close it is to a main intersection There are some great restaurants within a minutes walk Dorr Moustache Invictus Timbre and the Catacombs are an easy walk as is Port Royal metro station Also if you re an eastern state Aussie looking for sport from home Cafe Oz is nearby 
55150,H tel des Academies et des Arts,No Negative, The service and staff were excellent and really stand out in this boutique hotel They were very helpful and attentive and would always greet us with a smile Moreover not only did they speak perfect English but also other languages such as German The breakfast was very good and on the second day our order was already remembered They also serve breakfast on the room which is convenient if you are lazy or under time pressure The location is ideal being situated in the heart of Montparnasse and very close to public transport even though we preferred to walk instead which is also no problem The rooms were very clean and there was a lot of attention to detail The bed was very comfortable especially the pillows were probably the most comfortable I have every slept on in a hotel Would definitely recommend staying here and would visit again 
55151,H tel des Academies et des Arts,No Negative, Unbelievably friendly staff Amazing breakfast was filled with art lesson and story of the building with paiter s atelier For our trip this was the perfect location during a sunny day Jardin des Luxembourg is within 5 min walk Lots of nice restaurants around Highly recommended 
55152,H tel des Academies et des Arts, I liked everything There was a temporary problem with wifi in the rooms on the first day but that was swiftly fixed and WiFi continued to be available in the library So no problem , An exceptional little hotel All the staff very so friendly helpful and as it is such a small hotel the service was so personal My room was small but who comes to Paris to stay in their room It had a modern chic bathroom immaculately clean And the most important aspect the bed was very comfortable There were even different types if pillows to choose from I loved that pillow so much I took the cover off to check the brand it was a Tempur memory pillow but not the hard one Will have to buy And the common area had the charm and atmosphere of a very elegant private sitting room lots of art art books cushy sofas and free hot drinks all day long 
55153,H tel des Academies et des Arts, All Paris hotels are compact This hotel is no different but the service and quality of bed and peaceful location make it a great place for a few nights , The genuine care of the staff was the best I have ever experienced in Paris The location a 5 minute walk from Jardin de Luxembourg means you can have great continental breakfast in hotel walk through the most beautiful gardens and then down past either st sulphice or Saint Michael to Notre Dame to the promenade on other side next to river
