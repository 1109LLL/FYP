329210,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The staff both at the pool bar and behind reception left much to be desired in terms of cordiality and efficiency It is expected much more from a 4 star standard , The location is very good away from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla In addition the room was spacious meticulously cleaned every morning and all towels and toiletries replaced We were on the Club Lounge floor and though a coffee machine is not present as advertised the pastries offered were of good quality The infused water at reception was a refreshing bonus 
329211,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Maids set up right outside our room 123 and we re very noisy in the morning , Comfortable rooms great rooftop bar and pool Friendly staff especially bar tender on roof with dark rimmed glasses Thanks 
329212,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The reception officer tried to give me a lower category of room in spite of mentioning that I was in a superior category I had to complain many times to obtain the room I paid for,No Positive
329213,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Although the restaurant for dinner is advertised it only opens in the winter , Rooms facing the main street are VERY quiet Breakfast menu is nice and dining room staff is friend y Staff at main desk helpful Location terrific Three short blocks from Plaza Catalunya 
329214,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, That we couldn t use the pool area as always full So few sunbeds and always occupied we were very disappointed , Beds divine breakfast 5 star standard including champagne Pool area beautiful though impossible to get a sunbed as only about 12 Staff fabulous nothing too much trouble Brilliant location 
329215,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, A little bit far 10 minute walk from nearest subway station , Excellent breakfast it was one of the best breakfast buffet ever had Clean and quiet room nice rooftop pool with bar Nice security measure on elevator need a room key to go up down Friendly staff I highly recommend this hotel I will definitively stay again at this hotel when I go back to Barcelona 
329216,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The rooms facing the road can be noisy as there is plenty of traffic outside at times , This hotel is well located and with plenty of restaurants and attractions within walking distance Great facilities and a very comfortable bed Staff were extremely helpful
329217,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Disappointed with the cocktails very expensive and not worth the money , Perfect location for la rambla la sagrada familia if you don t mind walking the beach is approx 30 minutes walk Hotel rooms spotless beds extremely comfortable Very helpful cleaning ladies friendly staff on reception and hotel pool bar staff Not far to walk from plaza catalu a to hotel if you get the airport bus shuttle Would definitely return to this hotel 
329218,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The arrival at the hotel was really poor The receptionist was much more interested in chatting to the young girls who had come into the hotel asking for directions than they were checking us in to the hotel the girls were not customers guest The junior suites we were due to stay is was best described as truly horrendous no daylight no view a ridiculously small wardrobe and a crazy bad layout of bathroom When we returned to the section to complain about the junior suite the staff were disinterested in our feedback about the junior suite they were not friendly nor were they accomodating We had said we were so displeased with the junior suite that we should move to another hotel The hotel staff said nothing could be done as the hotel was full We went and spoke to two other guests who arrived as we were checking in and who also had a junior suite We took great comfort that they ALSO thought the junior suite was horrendous and that the staff unhelpful They told guys they were to be moved to another room the next day Returning to reception they then agreed to move us to another room the next day Upon reflection I wish we had moved to another hotel Our trip involved a return to the city for 4 further days on the return leg of our trip and decided not to stay here as I would not consider this hotel nor its unhelpful staff again Undoubtedly the hotel will make all sorts of excuses but plain and simple the hotel does not represent value for money and I would not recommend it , The location was walking distance to most sites Other than that there was very little that could be said positively about the staff nor about the hotel 
329219,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The air conditioning wasn t working stuck on cold so room was very cold at night After 3rd day housekeeping started to go wrong with no coffee left cups were removed pool towels removed , room was good and bed very comfy and bathroom spacious and well equipped Bar area was very good

329222,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Booked a junior sweet room was really dark and dingey with a view of a wall The bathroom wasn t very nice no wonder they don t put pictures up Staff at the pool bar where very rude We paid extra for the breakfast which was terrible worst breakfast I think I ve ever encountered ,No Positive
329223,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, There is no swimming pool it is medium size jacuzzi On the terrace no umbrella no shadow unbelieveably hot from the sun therefore this balcony is useless during the day , Good location 5 min walk to metro or 10 min to the city center 
329224,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The bathroom was cramped and not well appointed Some hotels have great bathrooms this was not one of them The drains were clear though Don t laugh this can really be a problem The HVAC unit was really annoying and while you could turn it off you had to remember to do so every time you returned to the room If you like waking up to a fan blowing cool air into the room in the morning then you have no problem Thought that the hotel was a bit overpriced but then again it was Barcelona and getting to be summer when the hotels are best booked well in advance , Room on 1st floor faced Gran Via but double glazed windows kept out the street noise Great blackout curtains kept out the light so I could sleep late no problem Very friendly staff Had Roland Garros on television a big plus in Spanish hotels Very comfortable bed and the big king I especially requested Convenience store on the corner gothic quarter just a few minutes away I would have no problem staying here again 
329225,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Outside the elevator there was a strange smell, Excellent breakfast The staff was very kind The swimming pool and bar in the rooftop were ok Great amenities and very comfortable rooms
329226,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The wi fi was hit and miss The reception staff always seemed busy there was a special hotel event on the week we stayed but we didn t find out about it until the day we left We found out about it from visitors to our hotel who had more success sccessing areas snd better service than wd did as residents , The roof top area was the stand out feature of this hotel The breakfast was excellent 
329227,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, I would have liked a complimentary bathrobe and a vanity mirror in the bathroom, Rooms were clean staff were helpful restaurant was good value pool terrace was a nice area to relax after sightseeing
329228,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, This is the second time I have stayed at the Havana with its very friendly and helpful staff ideal location and really nice facilities including the restaurant which serves very good food La Rambla Passeig de Gr cia Gaud s La Pedrera Casa Batll La Sagrada Familia and even the beaches are within walking distance some walks being longer than others If walking to places like the Gran Teatre del Liceu and the Tablao Cordob s for Flamenco is too far then there are taxis waiting outside the hotel for ease of transport Public transport is also nearby The Havana is a lovely hotel and one that I would definitely recommend for a trip to this wonderful city 
329229,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Had to ask for coffee K cups and creamer each day Even for a junior suite the room was small Ventilation in the bathroom and shower were not very good The room was on the Club level but the advertised Nespresso bar was removed , The room was clean and comfortable Window looked out onto a wall Room temperature control was spotty Breakfast buffet was well prepared good variety and choices and tasty Location on the Gran via was close to main attractions and squares Easy access via taxi from the airport Staff was helpful Check in and out was quick Bill was ready complete and accurate 
329230,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Very expensive we booked comfort double and were told we booked a triple room Breakfast was not included thought we had booked it and it was very expensive for what was on offer Would get 5 star for the cost elsewhere Pool and pool bar small, location
329231,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Can t really fault this hotel my wife s only little gripe was that she d of liked a mirror on the desk dressing table to do her makeup rather than stood up by the wardrobes , Great location not to far away from the centre alltough we do like waking huge big bed with very nice bedding great roof terrace with pool 
329232,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The staff were a bit unresponsive on our arrival seemingly preferring to talk to one another than ourselves but they soon improved , We stayed here for our honeymoon and the hotel upgraded us and provided a free bottle of champagne The location was excellent and the rooftop bar was perfect for the sunset
329233,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Eating at the property was too costly Fixed rate per person should not apply to children up to a certain age, It was a great hotel Staff were friendly and accommodating Family suite was great in terms of size and comfort

329236,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, The beds were very comfortable The first room given to us was on the second floor at the front of the hotel so the noise from Gran Via was disturbing however the hotel graciously allowed us to change our room which was perfect

329240,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, There was nothing bad in this hotel , Quite a generic hotel With the adjective Gran in the hotel name I was expecting a bit more Staff were friendly Although at breakfast the rating of the staff is that of a Tourist resort 3 star hotel Rooms were fine nothing stood out Over all the place was clean close to where I needed to go 
329241,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Difficult to park downstairs as narrow spaces and strange angles Had a run in with a pole , Staff was very helpful and friendly Breakfast buffet was generous and room was quiet 
329242,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Had dinner in the restaurant two nights First night was faultless with amazing staff second was not so good and we were left waiting for a long time even without a menu Likely that the waitress was new , Amazing room with terrace Staff very friendly and polite booked the trip for a special birthday and my father was sent a complimentary bottle of cava which he was very happy about Breakfast was great hotel was just lovely and with an excellent location We were allowed to take the cava to the roof terrace which was beautiful with a lovely view of the city Will definitely be returning 
329243,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, IT S very hard to be picky on this hotel The only let down we had was the evening meals 1 Portion control up and down and served on different plates from the time before 2 Over cooked food I had duck 1 night then had the rolled chicken breast I didn t order crispy duck and pancakes and the chicken burnt on the bottom and dry People ordered the same dishes as us and the portions and presentation was totally different Just to Polish it of with a cherry I know it s a hotel in Barcelona but 3 70 for a little bottle of water is just a little to much to ask for 3 People are different where ever you go and to get all your staff to be the best you have to wave your wand but it s not to much to ask for A little smile or a good morning or afternoon Over all its a good hotel with little to be picky about I just expected more from the evening menu Quantity Quality And hot food , Our stay at the hotel was for days we arrived late but got a evening meal The breakfast buffet had all you could ask for a great choice Pool on the roof was small and cold but the boys had a great time in it the hotel was over all a very relaxing brake

329246,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Was not unhappy with anything at the Hotel , The bed was so comfortable We were right next to the town centre and near the Airport bus stop There was also a little supermarket across from the Hotel if you needed to buy any juice etc 
329247,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Smoke alarm going off at midnight in hotel detectors need to be local to room ahead of whole hotel , Adjoining room for family Secure keycard use for lifts to floors Modern style of hotel

329249,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Cheaper breakfasts if possible , Hotel was in a great location for all attractions It was all that we expected with a large adjoining room which was extremely comfortable Staff were quick to respond to a minor technical problem with the room We didn t have breakfast in the hotel as at 17 per head we felt it was too expensive Overall would recommend to future visitors 
329250,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The tea and coffee facilities in the room where not very good just enough to make one cup and that was it , The breakfast was very good beautiful hotel 
329251,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, As a frequent traveller there are small things one expects when arriving at a hotel This one was disappointing The front desk staff make you feel like you re interrupting them I arrived 3 hours before normal check in time of 14 00 and was given no option to check in early I arrived back at 14 10 and was left standing while the girl at the desk stared at her screen I asked if there was a problem and she said she was just checking on the room I eventually got my key and on arrival to my room found the cleaning staff working on it When they finally finished the room was left with a smell of stale cloth There was an aroma of alcohol from at least one of the front staff Their uniforms were worn and depressing colours brown and black and in need of sprucing up I travel all over the world every week I wouldn t stay here again based on this experience , The location is very good Within walking distance of city centre hot spots 
329252,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The chocolate donuts were gone so quick in the mornings I only got one , The staff were great Super friendly and so helpful the apples were dreamy Oh and the free choc donuts are brill 
329253,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The hotel has its own fragrance in the reception area the smell although nice was very over powering made us sneeze as we walked through , The bed was the comfiest bed ever very large The only down side was that we struggled to get up in the morning The hotel is beautiful in a really central location to explore the city Very close to all the main shops loads of places to eat drink nearby Also in walking distance to many sights including the Sagradia Familia We stayed in a superior double room which was lovely There were pastries fruit lollipops chocolates available to us free of charge in the hallway We had a wonderful stay would definitely recommend this fab hotel
329254,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, Complimentary bottle of champagne and anniversary card was a lovely touch Staff were friendly and went out of their way to help Food was excellent Location was great minutes walk from the tourist attractions We have a fabulous weekend and have already recommended this hotel to a few people 
329255,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, There was nothing I didn t like about this hotel I would highly recommend it and would return again, For 20 Euro extra per night I upgraded my room to have a terrace 
329256,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Additional service on executive floor such as tea cakes etc should be improved , The staff in the breakfast room were extraordinary Overall the hotel is very good value for money 
329257,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The comfort of the beds were not the best and the pool area on the roof was very much dead due to it being January Their was not a pianist on the piano at all in the lobby and it was a weekend , Hotel felt very clean and was to a high standard The staff were helpful of information and the breakfast that I unfortunately did not try looked amazing from afar 
329258,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Door didn t lock first time so always double check Curtains in room look like people from the outside can t see in but they definitely can be careful when getting dressed , Staff and customer service was excellent Lemon and mint water in reception Room was very comfy and well sized There was also an excellent array of toiletries in the bathroom including sponges and shaving kits You can walk to the centre in less than 10 minutes 
329259,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The thermostat didn t work properly room felt cold at night meaning interrupted sleep the blanket was not enough and the duvet I asked for was still too thin, The room was clean location was central staff were amazing
329260,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The housekeeping had winded up my personal stuff which I had left in the bed while cleaning up even though the hotel had promised to send it to me by post haven t received anything for 4 weeks ,No Positive
329261,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The rooms are smaller than we expected but still cosy Had to ask for tea and coffee supplies each time and once they did not even send any guess they got busy and forgot I m not sure , The location is good just 3 blocks away from Catalunya the centre of Barcelona Less than 10 minute walk to the beach Helpful staff 24 hour supermarkets nearby so won t run out of snacks 
329262,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The room service for tapas was closed one day when the hotel information said it would be open which disrupted our plans a little Otherwise everything worked very well and we had a memorable stay ,No Positive

329264,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, Stayed at this hotel for 4 days for my birthday Was promised a compliment bottle if cava but didn t get it Wanted ice bucket and glasses sent to the room but was told there was going to be a charge which was ridiculous They need to put irons in all the rooms as ordering via room service was a mission since they didn t speak English 
329265,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The restaurant lacked ambiance with very bright overhead lighting although the food was very good Staying on the first floor there was a problem with noise in the public areas which we looked out onto , Unique style of the building was stunning Cleverly designed small spaces 
329266,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, Extremly beautiful decorations little things like having little snacks in the hallways and opening the door for us when the receptionist saw us walking in 
329267,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, The hotel and staff were excellent The breakfast brought to my room a bit disappointing but I got a good price thru Booking and it was a v good deal I d stay there again definitely 
329268,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Half board isn t worth it Don t fall for it NO DRINKS not even WATER are included and the menu is VERY VERY limited You d be better off venturing off to the many nearby restaurants We never received our Welcome Drink Moved to a different room due to a sewer smell that was unfortunately smelled throughout the hotel , Breakfast was decent The family room was spacious and clean Near Supermarkets and various restaurants 
329269,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Awful sewer smell Do yourself a favor and look at the many TripAdvisor reviews regarding the sewer smells This hotel reeked Sadly not worth the 4 star price , We were moved from our original room and given complimentary breakfast due to a horrible sewer smell that unfortunately was throughout the hotel The Manager was attentive There were good breakfast choices 
329270,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Breakfast and evening meal it was very expensive and was not cooked very well also we had a double room with spare bed but the spare bed was not comfortable , Location
329271,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, We had a lovely room with a large terrace which looked over the city It was within walking distance to the gothic area and harbour The staff were very friendly we had just finished a cruise and stayed here for two nights which was the perfect end to a great vacation 
329272,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Coffee maker in the room No instructions though worked it out A kettle would have been better No spoons Plastic stirrer in a packet which wasn t replaced , Bed very comfy
329273,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The only small point is the very slow toaster for use at breakfast time , It s a lovely hotel which we ve stayed in before Great facilities though we generally spend most of the day and evening out Very helpful staff 
329274,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Provision for boiling the kettle we were asked to use it in the bathroom this would be a health and safety issue in UK, Spacious comfortable bed room well insulated against traffic noise lovely rooftop bar and pool friendly helpful staff
329275,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Care when purchasing goods from the supermarket across the road no prices tourists pay a premium No reflection on the Hotel stay which was magical , The hotel facilities were in line with expectations Wonderful roof top pool bar area Favourite hotel stay I would recommend this place 
329276,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Our TV did not work we did not get any channels Luckily we were only there for 1 5 days, I loved the rooftop area We had half board and the food and staff were amazing Did not try the pool maybe next time The beds and room were great and so was breakfast 
329277,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The booking process on this website led me to believe that parking and a breakfast were included I had carefully browsed all of the options for one I wanted for my honeymoon but according to the staff when I arrived I had just reserved the room and been alerted to the costs of each amenity I would be charged extra upon check out for parking and breakfast which we ended up skipping to avoid the extra fee , The bed and the room were great The hotel itself is in a nice location and very well maintained 
329278,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, I d have liked a double bed we had 2 singles pushed together BUT they were big and comfortable , Great location Big room with a door between the bedroom and main room door which meant you didn t hear hotel noise at all Great beds Lovely roof bar with pool 
329279,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Nothing, We had the Family Suite which was very comfortable It had separate bedrooms and bathrooms Perfect for a family of four Breakfast buffet was great 
329280,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, This is an excellent hotel The pool on the roof is great and it s got a really friendly atmosphere It s not cheap but if you want to splash out then it s worth it 
329281,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Only criticism is that the spaghetti main was rubbery and over cooked Desserts a bit too sweet Food other than this was fantastic , Location was so close to Las Ramblas sagarda familia arc de triomphf and gaudi houses Half hour walking distance to magic fountain and beach Taxi rank right outside hotel Supermarket right outside hotel too Roof terrace and pool was nice to chill out after site seeing All staff were very friendly Cleaner everyday with fresh towels Hotel easy to find as on a main road Right near two metro stations variety of tapas dishes was great and of the mains the fish and steak were good alongside the pizzas and handmade burger 
329282,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The room needs update specially the bathroom The window view was poor there was a wall of the other building , Pool area in the roof was very nice Pool was too small but you may have a sun and some drinks as well as some food there and enjoy the view over the city Bed was very good 
329283,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, May have been helpful to get more information about public transport eg metro buses as the hotel is quite a walk from beach and other tourist sites however we were able to reach most of them quite easily Only other aspect was our room window happened to be facing a concrete wall so we didn t have the best view from our room however the views from the pool and terrace made up for this as they were beautiful , Great breakfasts lovely staff and stunning roof top terrace would really recommend this to anyone wanting a luxury style city break 
329284,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, From the roof terrace bar and restaurant some tables gave a view down onto the private terraces , For a base to see Barcelona you ll not find any better Friendly helpful staff An amazingly comfortable room and our terrace was such a bonus Easy to find and garaging easier than many hotels Ten minutes walk from the Rambles what more could you want 
329285,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Personnel service elevator near our room was noisy and it annoyed a bit especially in early mornings when it was in heavy use and you could hear it too well inside the room , Clean hotel with good central location 
329286,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Sorry to say that when compared to previous stays in the hotel in 2013 and last year felt staff were not as willing to help or as friendly Check in and out desk was very robotic almost felt like i was interrupting them Very different to previous stays , Location Room Size Swimming Pool Cleanliness
329287,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Very noisy Walls thin and Windows do not block any traffic noise or people moving about outside Facilities are very nice but won t stay there again due to noise Could not sleep Hotel very stingy with soap One small bar for bath and sink , Good looking place 
329288,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, No explanation of Full board dinner menu sheet and resturant menu Had to ask on 4th day No price for food drinks in Fridge , Great hotel Loved the Roof Top Bar Food Pool with great views of Barcelona Excellent Chefs great food Great inter conecting rooms for our family Comforatble beds 
329289,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, I really can t say that any one issue stands out so negatively since the hotel is quite attractive and very well managed , We were especially impressed not just with the little swimming pool on the rooftop but also with the well heated Sauna next to it 
329290,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, We asked for a King and got a queen bed and we would have liked some hand towels in the bathroom , The staff was very helpful and nice The front desk staff answered many questions and Sen or Miller was very helpful handling our luggage 
329291,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Room was too hot Bed creaked so much that it made a good nights sleep impossible and cleaner decided to use my hairbrush and goodness knows what else Staff were unhelpful and simply stated that the cleaners were contracted via an agency and therefore they weren t responsible for them I won t be going back ,No Positive
329292,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, The room was lovely and modern very clean and beds very comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel its self was brilliant especially with the roof top bar and pool 
329293,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, I can t think of anything that would have improved the hotel , The location was excellent for getting around Barcelona and seeing the main highlights The bar and pool on the roof were lovely and the whole experience was very relaxing Staff friendly and helpful 
329294,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, We didn t receive room slippers or bath robes and I also thought that complimentary water should ve been as part of the deal since this hotel was very pricey and other hotels of comparable or cheaper prices had more anenities, I liked the fact that the staff was attentive to our needs and they understood English well
329295,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Safety box didn t work The access cards stop working after 2 days we had to active them again The electricity cut off for 2 hours , The Location Breakfast
329296,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Air conditioning will not go below 20degrees Celsius Internet speeds in the rooms is incredibly slow Prior to April rooftop bar is not open and pool sauna have restricted opening hours Breakfast option is very expensive and there are many caf s and restaurants within 1 block offering continental or cooked breakfasts at much lower rates , We were offered a street view or a room on the quiet side also an extra large bed not just two singles pushed together Location is excellent with metro station 2 blocks away buses outside and 10 minute walk to Pla a Catalunya 
329297,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Shame that the rooftop bar and pool area was closed for the duration of our stay , Good location with fantastic views over Barcelona from our 6th floor balcony Comfortable beds helpful staff and pleasant bar area 
329298,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, the hotel didn t look quiet like the pictures on the site the hotel was non smoking but our room smelt of it The roof top bar was closed for renovations and nothing was mentioned on the site , The location and we had a corner room with a beautiful street view 
329299,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The munue for half board was very limited Had we known we would have booked for breakfast only Others guests still ate evening meal in the resturant but ha a far greater choise,No Positive
329300,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, There were refurbishment works going on in the atrium and on the roof swimming pool neither caused any problem to us and work has to be done at some time , The staff were very friendly the rooms were comfortable and the hotel is well situated and only a 10 to 15 minute walk to the city centre We didn t get the opportunity to try the restaurant as we dined out with friends and family who live in Barcelona but the restaurant looked very nice Our room had a balcony with a small table two chairs and two sun beds it s just a pity it wasn t sunny enough to make full use of them 
329301,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The people in the next room played music all night and reception reluctant to act They did eventually use the house key to gain entry and switch it off as occupants had gone out , Very friendly and efficient staff and excellent clean room Housekeeping also first class The small bar area is very inviting and immaculate Location is unrivalled as it is close to all the central areas i e walking distance and plenty of restaurants nearby too 
329302,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Our initial room had a broken television and was not as clean as our second room I can t believe they didn t know my wife could not get settled as they had an hotel electrician handyman in the room and he couldn t fix it Also he spoke no English and we couldn t communicate , The second room we were given was excellent 
329303,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Noisy even the cleaners talk so loud while cleaning other rooms It s also a bit pricy given the overall quality, staff location and general cleanliness
329304,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The breakfast can do a little better with the hot section In saying so the breakfast wasn t bad just if something has to improve this could improve a little , The location of the hotel was nice It was close to La Rambla yet far enough to be away from the noise of the street The staff were very friendly and helpful The rooms were clean and big We were on the club havana level which meant 24 7 availability of Nespresso coffee and cookies The rooftop bar is also nice 
329305,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Wifi was over capacity and I couldn t work Even though they changed my room it still didn t work There was a bug in the bed too Hopefully not a bedbug but quite fast small and transparent Will not return , Location 
329306,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location just a short walk from La Rambla Rooms spacious and well equipped Reception staff very friendly and helpful Gave us recommendations for restaurants which were really good 
329307,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, The bar on the roof was getting renovated so we couldn t sit up there but think that was just the time of year March before the season starts so not bothered by this too much as we had our great balconies to sit on but would have been nice to sit and have a drink on the roof , The rooms were a good size the staff were very friendly and very helpful recommended a brilliant local restaurant which was fab 
329308,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Room was a little pokey but ok for just a long weekend, Well situated with easy walking access to Catalunya Square and Gothic District Excellent breakfast
329309,Silken Gran Hotel Havana, Nothing would use this hotel again and recommend , Bed and pillows extremely comfortable Food and room service excellent Best location very central Taxi service outside with cheap travel to airport saved time and hassle 
329310,Silken Gran Hotel Havana,No Negative, Loved the location and the staff were friendly and helpful The free croissants and coffee were excellent Clean and comfortable I would definitely stay here again My husband and I had one room with the kids in an adjoining room it was the perfect balance of being together but also having our own space
