335096,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The room especially the bathroom was very small The room wasnt exactly ready when we arrived and had to wait a while there was no usual upgrade despite being Marriott member , The breakfast buffet was excellent with a good choice The staff on the door and concierge were very helpful Because we had no upgrade and were not happy with such a small room the receptionist offered complimentary breakfast which had not been included in the rate 
335097,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The staff is talking too much as if they wish to become your friends European customers do not like it At the reception desk for the restaurant an employee approached me by saying that he will give me his best personal services He proposed to sit with me next to a table in the middle of the active kitchen When I said no he replied that he is disappointed I hate such situations ,No Positive
335098,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Shabbiness of rooms lack of colour or personality in rooms bland curtains faulty even after reporting hard to get fresh milk delivered to room for coffee staff unhelpful in booking an extra night said they were full but we went and booked online , beds and lounge comfortable Nespresso slippers and robes bulgari amenities in suites breakfast staff very helpful and friendly remembered our orders 
335099,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Room very small Not what we were expecting for the price Shower small husband had to go in sideways Water pressure very bad just dribbled out Had to wait till we got home to have decent shower Not impressed with hotel at all Would not stay again , Bed and linen excellent Location excellent Staff very friendly and helpful 
335100,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, we booked two non smoking executive club rooms without breakfast because you can have the breakfast in the club lounge when we checked out the reception told us that one of the room was booked with breakfast we didn t do it because we booked two similar rooms without any additional text the hotel was not willing to reimburse the extra 60 which we didn t use we didn t have any use for 12 breakfasts for 4 persons during two nights 8 included very disappointing , location and staff
335101,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Changed room after first night Second room larger but the bathroom is so small it s almost unusable expensive but the worst London hotel we have used , Location
335102,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, If here for business be warned Bloomberg doesn t work As per other reviews rooms are a bit old and have no feeling of luxury Unfortunately air con broke while I was there no ones fault but communication to exasperated guests was deplorable Suggest staying at the Hyatt Regency up the road for an all round good stay in the same location , Location is best for shopping Nice to have a the square out the front to sit in at nigh 
335103,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The water in the showers would change from hot to cold constantly making taking a shower an exciting experience at times But this is expected in older properties , The hotel staff was wonderful They made themselves like family Anything we needed their answer was always yes Especially Nadia Maria Damian and many others were so helpful The rooms were clean and up to date The beds very comfortable and sheets always felt clean There were plenty of towels and the other toilet items like shampoo soap conditioners Also two great restaurants in the hotel and a great variety of pubs and restaurants within walking distance I ve stayed in London hotels in the past and The London Grosvenor Square Marriott was by far was my best hotel experience ever I would recommend this place to anyone 
335104,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The hotel bar Locker Room is a bit dreadful with their 1920s music and low lighting and exceptional high prices for drinks GBP 14 50 for a standard G T Much better to go the pub across the road for a more cheerful atmosphere , Very good central location close to public transport and main shopping areas The staff are very friendly and helpful especially at the restaurants Food at Maze is of very high quality The rooms are a bit small but very well designed and appointed with classy bathroom toiletries 
335105,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The Lobby is non existence no ambiance to the Hotel Lobby The pillow was too soft that it gave my husband i neck ache Ask for better pillows , My executive room was very nice Perfect fit for 2 adults 2 kids The access to the lounge was great and one of the best i have seen in a Marriott Breakfast time was chaotic but the staff was great On my check out day we had to leave at 8am and the lounge was not open yet the reception staff made coffee to go for me I really appreciated that gesture Gordon Ramsay s restaurant Maze is the restaurant on site Great food Location was amazing 5mins walk to Selfridges walking distance to Hyde Park and tube stations Def will come back on my next trip 
335106,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Room looked a bit tired very bad TV reception and no parking even though it was advertised on booking com as having some, Location bar and restaurant within the hotel
335107,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Nothing I don t like only the size of the room it s OK for 1 to person or two Pearson maximum , It s very comfortable hotel it s very close to Oxford Street in heart of London the stuff it s very friendly and they are helpful really if I want to go back to London I will book through Booking com to this property
335108,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Rooms too small Other than that the stay was excellent , Hotel position is good for shopping sightseeing and transport Excellent staff Roms were small and requested move which we was given on the 2nd Night Better room but still on the small side Bars were very good as was the included breakfast Would certainly stay here again but would require a larger room 
335109,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square,No Negative, A few issues with getting the heating turned down the room was small for sure and the bathroom smaller However it was all you needed in excellent condition super clean and such a great central location Above all the staff were wonderful and could not have helped more 
335110,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, It would have been great if our prior request for two interconnecting rooms could have been accommodated as we are a family of two adults and two teenage children However we were located close by next door though not connecting on the last night and it didn t in any way pose a difficulty for us during our stay , It was comfortable staff were very helpful and it was ideally located We will definitely be back 
335111,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Noisy constructions near to the hotel which made my sleep miserable The walls were not insulated and I can hear the TV for the next room Water valves were scratchy Each time we use the valves we got scratched on our hands The important thing that I was suprised when I asked the reciptionist to extend my stay one more day and she said that there is no more rooms but when I checked online I found one , Amazing Location Free Wi Fi Provided by Booking team
335112,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Some extra shortcake biscuits would be lovely , The room was very comfortable The bedding was luxurious we had a fabulous night s sleep The facilities in the room were excellent The mobile phone for guests use is a great idea 
335113,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Very old rooms Staff in the restaurant for breakfast is not really helpful and does lots of mistakes, Front desk Service is very good Great location
335114,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Cannot think of any improvements One problem was quickly sorted out noisy air conditioning unit that kept us awake without any fuss Our room was upgraded by the night Concierge Romeo , All staff were excellent The cleaners always said hello the desk staff were professional and welcoming and the night concierge was particularly helpful in sorting out a problem in the room The restaurant staff were lovely too and nothing seemed too much trouble for them The Maze restaurant was an absolute delight 
335115,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Very cramped rooms and bathrooms Old fuzzy TV Speaker in room didn t work Very thin walls could hear the people next door having a conversation numerous times ,No Positive
335116,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Hotel lovely staff extremely helpful would have preferred a bigger bed It was my daughters birthday she has had a baby and I was treating her We came down from Glasgow and hope to do it again soon Had a fabulous time ,No Positive
335117,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, My room was above the ballroom this time and they had two parties during my stay and the music could be felt loudly in the room , It s not my first stay at this hotel however this time I took the executive room and enjoyed the lounge a lot 
335118,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Breakfast was a huge disappointment for a 5 star Hotel Expensive not worth its price due to the small variety and having to pay extra for basic items such as coffee or omelette Additionally inside the Hotel s elevators you could smell the smokes from the Maze Grill all day and night which makes it for a bad experience , The bed was amazing cleanliness was top notch and staff was very friendly and helpful Room service was great and delivered quickly to our Room 
335119,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The room standard we average The size of the room was small I think it is pretty priced compared to the size and furniture standards in the room , The location is great 2 min to bond street tube and oxford street The staff we friendly 
335120,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square,No Negative, Location is amazing in the center of the elegant Mayfair in front of a beautiful square Walking distance from Oxford and Regent St as well Excellent rooms and beds Amazing gym Helpful staff Clean Bathrooms Love it 
335121,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, We had made 2 special requests in our pre booking I e arrival time 9 10 00 hours and a quiet room with an extra large bed none of these requests were granted We were given a small room with a small bed and noisy air conditioning It took us 4 hours to be relocated to a decent room , Apart from the location nothing else appealed to us Your review rating of 5 4 does not reflect our views A rating of 3 would be much nearer our experience 
335122,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, How the team of customer service deal with the customer and how they didn t care of your satisfaction, With the bad service even the good things I can t like it
335123,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square,No Negative, The location was perfect for us as we needed to visit the US Embassy which is literally round the corner Oxford street is also 2 minutes away which was perfect 
335124,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Basic dull interior with no class Entrance and foyer not to my taste and long dull carpeted corridors with gloomy feel I feel the best rooms are not a available especially second and third floors as when I requested one I was told they were all taken After a long walk I looked over from the square and no lights on any aforementioned floors This hotel is cheap and the only recommendation is location which is ideal for Mount Street and Carlos place My upgraded room felt like a compromise based on my ability to confront and assert my protest at first accommodation offered The original rate of this is oom was 500 All I can say is to this corporate rip off is in your dreams and go to the Connaught round the corner and learn about style I paid 155 and would say it was worth 100 at best only for location Beware of special offers The prices are slashed as a honey trap No breakfast included and felt ripped off Next time I will check out a hotel a mile or so away as this hotel is playing on bygone reputation and ripping off decent people who expect to feel charmed and satisfied Will not return , Staff especially female staff very helpful and professional
335125,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The noise of the air conditioning meant we slept very badly there was mould in the bathroom We were moved to a different room but there was obviously an error there too as there were complimentary things there for someone else , Superb location and very friendly staff 
335126,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Even though we thought the Marriott was good there were a few items to raise The lighting in the room was dull it was often hard to see even with all the bed lamps on The hot water in the shower constantly went from hot to cold which is somewhat annoying A few more tea bags would have been appreciated It seemed that you were on rashions The breakfast each morning always seemed odd The first morning you had one of us scheduled upstairs and the other downstairs Even though the breakfast was good it seemed the overall operations of staff seemed out of service Eg One morning we had a pot of tea but the others it was by cup by cup It seem that some staff were there to serve but not clear and on our final morning there was no orange juice yogurt or fresh fruit available unless I wanted to wait Come on I think this area needs attention And forget about the executive lounge It s not a lounge that I have experienced before , We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in London and the Marriott was in a great location for all sightseeing and shopping Our room was a good size with a good size bathroom and with hot water 
335127,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Bathroom very small and only a shower On booking in we had asked if we could get a drink and were told our room was ready and it had tea and coffee facilities as the room was ready we took his offer up although at the time I thought it strange he hadn t mentioned a lounge area see further other than a few chairs in front of reception When we went to the bar on the Saturday we were asked if we had booked a table Not what you expect in a hotel On the Sunday evening we returned to hotel for a drink prior to leaving only to find the bar shut We then asked for a cup of tea only to be asked if we were members of the club lounge where we could get a drink or food We said we weren t and were told we could join but it would cost 85 if we weren t members We then learnt that the restaurant and bar are not owned by the hotel and that we could get a drink in the restaurant if we had a meal and that the bar was closed on Sundays Lady was very pleasant and made us a cup of tea in a paper cup and presented in a paper bag as that was all that was on offer I thought we were in Starbucks at that moment not a five star hotel in a prime location of London It transpires that normal offerings of a 5 star hotel or less of a lounge with the availability of drinks and snacks is not available at the Marriott unless you are a member of their Club Lounge or pay Also breakfast was ok but not a massive choice especially of fruit We were then billed for each individual item we had even though breakfast was included in the room rate and we then had to sort that out , Excellent location and staff extremely friendly and helpful 
335128,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Bad experience regarding the payment process they want to charge me the room service twice althogh i paid cash in the first time but the server denied that And they charged me by mistake the first nigth after i cancel it during the period of the free cancellation via one of the websits booking , Only The locaton
335129,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, There was a very small closet and no drawers to put things in so we never unpacked our suitcases , The breakfast was very good and the staff was very attentive to my family member s need for gluten free 
335130,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Hhmmm Our booking included breakfast However we opted out and on the recommendation of a friend we went to Dishoom on Kingly Street on the 1st morning FABULOUS The second morning we went down to breakfast in the hotel The selection of pastries and cereals etc was good the staff are polite and efficient but the cooked breakfast was a shocker We eat at Michelin restaurants and greasy spoons and we love both but this was awful I sent back my fried eggs because they were not cooked The second attempt was better but they were still a properly cooked yoke floating on a raft of slime The bacon wasn t much better sadly, A glass of bubbly on arrival was a lovely surprise We had a delux room with a view so we looked out over Grovesnor Square Turn down service was executed very well
335131,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The breakfast there is lack of variety of food for long period staying you get bord with the same breakfast Most of the days my family had there breakfast outside the hotel The service lack of services compared with other hotels with same level For example delay of dry cleaning service we received the laundry after following up for 3 days Quantity of Food served in rooms not enough for one person No activities for hotel guest during Christmas day compared by other hotels in the same group of hotels , Only the location
335132,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Humming fan noise at nighttime But they were very helpful and changed our room for us which helped , Big bed happy staff clean room nice hotel in general would go again 
335133,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square,No Negative, The staff were so helpful we got early check in on arrival and late check out on departure Loved everything about this hotel fabulous location lovely room delicious breakfast The staff were the best I had experienced 
335134,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Information as to where to eat and other facilities in the hotel It seemed as though the TV was a guide that told us very little , Staff were fantastic
335135,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The bed was quite small the first night, When we arrived the room size was quite small however the staff worked hard to accommodated us and upgraded the room the following evening it was wonderful Can t recommend them enough
335136,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Disappointing hot breakfast The tomatoes were a little dry and the poached eggs were luke warm at best I also don t see why I have to make my own toast and try and time it to be hot with the arrival of my cooked breakfast I got lucky with the timing and at least the hot toast counter balanced my luke warm eggs Coffee and fresh OJ were first class I did message the hotel via booking com to request an earlier check in but received no reply This was no great problem and we received a text message advising of availability a short while before the official check in time , Great room with a welcoming bottle of water as well as tea and coffee making facilities It s also nice to be able to open a window rather than rely on the aircon Very comfy bed and pillows and the android type portable hand set would be useful for any non tech savy travellers Good selection of toiletries sumptuous bath robe and nice hot shower if a little lacking in power On check out we did tell the hotel the bath outlet seemed partially blocked because the water drained away very slowly and if showering your feet were submerged Well appointed exec lounge although limited to just a few scones and cakes at tea time Coffee was excellent as was Maria who looked after us very well Literally only about 100 yards from Selfridges and a nice view onto Grosvenor Square from the breakfast room 
335137,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, As chairman of a Trade Association together with 5 CEOs we got back to the hotel after dinner at 11 15 and asked where we could have a drink We were shown to the hotel bar and then told all the tables a lot of which were empty were reserved and we were not allowed to stand The Duty Manager Thomas then confirmed that we could not have a drink in the hotel unless we used the minibars in our room and we had to go to the restaurant next door which at least allowed us one drink before they closed I have never known a large chain hotel refuse guests a drink and we were certainly not rowdy The end result is that six large companies will now be instructing their employees to avoid the Marriott Well done Thomas , Nice Hotel Friendly receptionist on check in out 
335138,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, On day of arrival bag handler had a bad attitude a short unfriendly gentleman , Everything was wonderful except the coffee station was a bit poor Loved the handy travel guide local phone Made things a lot easier 
335139,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, OK we arrived before the check in time we had 2 rooms booked and they gave us 1 and we had to wait 1 hour before the other was ready as it was being cleaned except that it wasnt and another guest was given a room while we waited When we did get in there were boards on the bed which surely should have been removed beforehand so we waited while someone came t remove them Apart from the dirty cup everything else wasd fine , The location was great for us The concierges were great one helping to find us a parking pace on the road and one was brilliant helping us pay the congestion charge 
335140,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Description stated midnight snacks etc which was non existent Staff at reception would huddle around to talk without acknowledging you Waited 15 mins plus each time with no other guests being served either Not much hot food variety for vegitarians at breakfast except potatos , Friendly staff and great location Requested an extra duvet as they had ran out they had one bought over from another Marriott hotel 
335141,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Very old hotel Standard things like free wi fi a comfortable breakfast room are sold as upgrade i e so called club lounge or complimentary to staying in a suit Staff is helpful but poor English for some of the reception staff The concierge is trying to arrange a gbp 120 black cab to Gatwick whereas it costs only gbp 90 if you call the same black cab from a web service etc All these small things are the factors that we will not prefer to stay here again , Location Close to the main shopping districts but that is all 
335142,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Reception was rather busy and small but more an issue for the staff than the guests Team worked well together is small working environment , Location staff facilities
335143,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The long waiting for one of the 2 elevators in rush hours for the hotel Definitely not enough only 2 elevators for the amount of people , The courtsey of the staff is definitely worth a mention Really professional and helpful at the same time Last but not least an hotel with 2 Gordon Ramsey restaurants inside is just great We experienced the maze and was an amazing food experience
335144,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, blooming lifts are always faulty at this hotel and no signs for the stairs come on Marriott sort it out, the handy device that s what its called is a great addition to the level of service you ll have to go to find out what it is 
335145,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, poor breakfast for the level of the Hotel expected much more efficient but not smiling personnel , Perfect room perfect location clean great bed and duvet smelling great throughout the hotel great handy with all you need in a cell phone free throughout the stay 
335146,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Although the great was good my room was in front of the elevators and it was extremely noisy Also there was a constant humming sound coming from one side of the room My guess is that this room 222 was right next to the air conditioning plant or some other kind of utility , Location of this Hotel was great and the staff was very friendly The over all hotel was nice and it always had a good vibe to it 
335147,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Deluxe room 327 wasn t really deluxe more like a standard Having to pay 10 per day for wifi Tiny single wardrobe No shaving mirror , Good location Lovely comfortable huge bed 
335148,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The hotel rooms were small for the price and another person commented on the same The hotel did not meet my expectations of a Marriott property The bar was poor and not up to your standards , The breakfast was good but extremely expensive if booked with the room 
335149,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, we didn t like only having one chair in the room It was cramped and for the price we paid it was poor, The staff were very pleasant and helpful the food was good 
335150,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The bathroom was very small and slightly awkward getting in the shower as the room was very tight 2 people would not fit in there I had some issues ringing down to reception and room service no answer after 20 mins got hold of concierge Also no free WIFI you have to pay which is not the norm now for hotels For the rate per night you would expect free WIFI , The location of the hotel is excellent you have everything on your doorstep Check in was very easy and staff very friendly I checked in a little early and a room was made available for me Rooms are lovely very comfortable
335151,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, There was a wedding event on one of the days and the lobby got very crouded and loud at times but this was not a real big problem , Amazing location close to everything Very friendly staff good concierge desk good restaurants in the area and excellent shopping all around We felt very comfortable and safe 
335152,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Do not ask them to park your car we had belongings stolen from ours while in their care They take no liability although its obvious they couldn t have locked my car In my correspondence with them they cc in their solicitors No customer care or empathy , Good Public Areas check in staff 
335153,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Housekeeping is very bad they dont change bedsheets daily they just fold it even if its dirty they day we checked out one of the housekeeping supervisors gave us a look because we left so many empty shopping bags it was very rude , Location
335154,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Staff in the reception were not cooperative at all I waited for 4 hours till i got my room Normal check in time is PM 2 and i checked they gave me my room around PM 3 30 During check out i requested for an extended checkout time of 2 hours only and my request was not granted although so many other people checked were allowed to checkout at least 2 hours later than the normal checkout time ,No Positive
335155,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Lifts one under repair were very slow The TV was old and with a poor quality picture Service at Maze was atrocious very slow and almost everything was wrong wrong size glass of wine wrong vegetables served steak too rare for medium rare not enough sauce This is a pretentious and expensive restaurant which needs to go back to the basics of good service , Comfortable bed and well designed bathroom with good facilities Aircon worked well on very hot and sticky days Doormen very helpful and friendly 
335156,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The staff tried to charge 10 for WIFI this seemed like an attempt to add a charge on a high priced room that they thought we wouldn t spot The staff just weren t up to scratch for a hotel in this price bracket they called me late and night and were really unhelpful they didn t show any initiative and our guest ended up without any breakfast as he had to leave early in spite of the fact we d paid for it I ve had better service in a Premiere Inn ,No Positive
335157,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Noisy aircon or bar fridge enough to wake is multiple time during the night and no way to turn off and after notifying reception no feedback and the 2nd night the same loss of sleep , Exec room was spacious bed comfortable bathroom was tiny
335158,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Lots of staff in and around lobby mostly uninterested That s OK if you don t mind putting your luggage in the cab yourself Room air con failed had to argue to get double glazed windows opened Poor breakfast selection no fresh fruit in summer , My room was smallish room but with a great outlook onto Grosvenor Square park When air con failed windows could be opened for a lovely breeze Room service is quick or there s no charge 
335159,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The rooms weren t what we expected they re too small for 2 people It also had thin walls and every activity happening in the hallaway can be heard as well as the noises in the rooms next door , Location
335160,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Furniture room Old consumer conditioner AC does not function for two nights room very hot atmosphere we were not comfortable in Stalamat contacted the hotel day and night without interest was not repaired until we left, Loction
335161,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square,No Negative, Breakfast very very poor and low quality and the room very noisy at night we don t know where the noise come from we have been suffering nightly of this noise we couldn t sleep
335162,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, My original booking was either a King or a Queen bed The upgrade was 2 double beds I don t think this was a very good upgrade Also the tv quality was terrible we thought it was snowing in Brazil , The fact that we were informed upon checking in that we had been upgraded 
335163,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Price Absolutely outrageous And when I said I needed to stay an extra night they added another 50 onto the rate As if 320 was not enough For a tiny room And a lift that was out of order And didn t include breakfast Gouging to the extreme when they knew I had no choice Felt like I was fodder to be fed on and spat out , Great location Very attentive door staff 
335164,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The travel cot offered to my 12 month old baby only had the thin hard base mattress it comes with Very very disappointing as expected a good quality mattress and asked for one in my booking request which was obviously ignored If the hotel had read it they should have got in touch with me to inform me that they did could not supply a decent travel cot mattress It is unforgivable that I had no choice but to let my baby sleep on this horrible base especially since we were in London for 1 night for HIS birthday AND he had not been well and had fever since the day before our arrival He tossed and turned all night not because he was unwell he is a good sleeper and actually sleeps better when he has fever and I should know as he has suffered from fever lots of times but because he is used to a luxury mattress at home Also baby food could not be warmed up in the restaurant so had to offer my baby his lunch at room temperature for the first time in his life which was too cold for him and he refused it This upset me enormously , Location great for shopping and restaurants as good walking distance for a Central London hotel Breakfast was excellent had English and everything was cooked to perfection and tasted great 
335165,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, It is very hard for me and my wife to find something in the hotel that not causes our satisfaction We would have had more chance to test those drinks or snacks in the mini bar if some of them would have been provided for free and could have been mixed with others that are not for free , People in the dining room always make really good conversation with me and my wife They even notice the foods we choose every day 
335166,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Our room was on the main road and right beside the staff lift which meant hardly any sleep We did nit feel we got value for money and this would not be a hotel we would choose to stay in again , The maze restaurant was lovely
335167,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Restaurants Maze grill good but not too special Maze I did not like and was informed by a waiter I did not understand fine dining I would never go back but go elsewhere for real fine dining which I m used to , Overall met my expectations except for catering arrangements 
335168,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, 1 the room was not ready till 5 30pm in the evening which is very sad 2 The receptionist was not very friendly and was not willing to show us round the hotel 3 the room was very small and was expecting a lot more from a Marriot 4 one lift was not working during our full stay of four days , the location was great 
335169,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The hotel is nothing special If you care about a great location it s a good hotel but if you are looking for a special hotel and services there are better hotels in London, Location is unbeatable just off Oxford street close to everything The room size was ok not especially spacious but not tight either
335170,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Bathroom was way too small for this price And I have an issue with hotels that charge for drinking water , Room was very comfortable and the location was amazing if you want to shop on Oxford Street Luxurious and simple nothing over the top Love the resteraunts as well 
335171,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, For what is meant to be a 5 star property the property is run down and in need of serious upgrade of the room decor Simple things like curtains on proper tracks that open close with ease would be a good start Hence I think the hotel is over priced when you take room quality into account I have often stayed at the Marriott Canary Wharf and that property is in much better shape Service was also limited I had an airport transfer booked through the hotel but had to juggle my own luggage through reception and out the doors no staff to be seen anywhere The driver came in from the street to assist , Location
335172,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Check it was very slow and staff were difficult to understand Building works meant it was very loud in the foyer Restaurant staff didn t provide a breakfast menu and waiter wasn t as slick as we would have thought The lifts were out of action which is fine but we had to locate the stairs ourselves etc , The room was clean and tidy 
335173,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, there was no room on my first night and the second night it took 6 hours to get the airco off Airco not functioning correctly and a freezing cold room ,No Positive
335174,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Air con in the room did not work properly so we were extremely hot Maintenance came up but didn t really do anything no one offered a room swap The lifts are awful as well extremely slow and you have to wait ages since our last stay however they are currently Under maintenance so the problem should be fixed , Room was a great size with a lovely view of Grosvenor square and breakfast very good Very comfy bed good value for money 
335175,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The hotel was set in so it was hard to find when we were walking around not knowing the area at all Didn t like the elevator down , I loved the service of the money exchange and the doorman 
335176,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, we were unable to access our room until 4 00 after long travel feel that is a little late , wonderful location Food excellent and concierge very helpful and sensitive to our needs in choosing really good restaurants and gicving directions
335177,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Noisy hotel there was some building work going on through the entire night did not get any sleep the duvet was really thin so felt cold Room was cold during the night Requested for early check in did not get it and no extra large bed despite booking 6 weeks in advance , The location and Gordon Ramsey s bar
335178,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Only enough tea making facilities to make one cup of tea English each As a minimum I would have thought 4 teabags and 4 pots of milk for two people is not too excessive , Great experience staff great room comfortable 
335179,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The cooked breakfast was poor the room was tiny and the reception space lifts and corridors to the rooms were very tired I stayed here for my 30th birthday treat It didn t feel like a treat The pictures of the rooms and the hotel were not a fair representation I wouldn t stay again The position is great Shame the same couldn t be said for the rest of it I felt disappointed , The bed was comfortable
335180,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The bed frames being dark wood on a dark carpet we constantly walked into them as they protruded beyond the mattress ouch , Room was spotless Courteous and attentive staff 
335181,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, A bit pricey but what is expected in this part of London , Breakfast was excellent but don t buy the included version There s a lot more to choose from on the menu We stayed here for convenience of dining in Maze and it is indeed very convenient for that with it s own entrance to Maze Grill

335183,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The hotel is tired Chipped paint worn rugs smell etc etc the hotel seems to be undergoing an upgrade which will be great for future guests but an unfortunate headache for current guests , Front desk staff were helpful and resolved a problem quickly and with a smile Good attitude and i commend them for working so well in spite of a mediocre product

335186,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square,No Negative, Staff were friendly and professional Clean rooms The Luggage Room cocktail bar in the basement is a nice addition to the hotel and the staff are always friendly and fun 
335187,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The room was a little bit disappointing Really small and with absolutely no decoration felt like a jail cell Heating was extreme and difficult to regulate , the location is great the hotel seems really good and top
335188,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Lifts not working light in room not working wardrobe light couldn t be switched off bathroom exhaust not working curtains dirty bedposts are a hazard I banged my head going to the bathroom at night corridors littered with room service trays and empty shopping bags , Location close to Oxford street
335189,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, I ve stayed here before for one night can t remember what kind of room was it but it was with wooden floor and large windows with garden view which was great However I booked last October for the king room which suppose to be the biggest out of their rooms and it was just bad on so many levels it was carpet rather than wooden floor but felt dusty bathroom felt so old and not a five star bathrooms at all asked for extra bedsheets and then got the bedsheets wrapped with someone jacket inside of it it was bad experience all together never staying here again ,No Positive
335190,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Room and bathroom are very small also the water in the bath room had very weak flow Also the thermostat needs to be adjusted ad the watrr suddenly shift from cold to hot amd vise versa , Service
335191,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, We requested a twin room on this website and this request had not filtered to the hotel Situation was remedied the next day but resulted in sharing a bed with my daughter Room and bathroom very small on our 1st night Breakfast facilities inadequate for the size of hotel , Location was great for our shopping needs 
335192,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Overall we didn t feel the same 5 service as we have come to expect from staying at other marriot hotels We were also very surprised be charged 10 pounds for one day on the wifi , The location was wonderful 
335193,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The public space and reception are limited and other than The Maze Grill look very tired and are in need of a refurbishment , Location is great and the bedrooms are nice The exterior of the hotel had beautiful lighting for christmas
335194,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Giving their worst rooms upon arrival After changing to a better room still not as was seen in pictures they have a room with ac engines on top of the room which is very noisy,No Positive
335195,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The lady who ignored me Guests poor manners in the business lounge not your fault , Front desk support Sebastien was very professional Noticed that I was being ignored by one of his female colleagues and immediately took care of my check in 
335196,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The lobby is very small and normally crowded Expensive, the location is great and the hotel rooms are very nice The breakfast was good admittedly somewhat limited 
335197,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Cleanliness of the room our first room had black hair on the bedsheets Lack of cleanliness for a 5 star hotel is unacceptable particular when we were paying 625 AUD per night The room was also incredibly dark the only lighting were lamps with no ceiling lights Even the larger rooms still had a very small bathroom with limited ventilation and none of the usual amenities like cotton wool I was also suprised that there was no complimentary bottled water in the room again this is unusual for a 5 star hotel The club room was on the lower ground floor which again seemed unusual as there was no view and it seemed quite claustrophobic We had breakfast included in our room rate the breakfast was quite basic cereal small bowl of fruit salad amd yoghurts cheese and some pastries and bread with limited hot food eggs A couple of the waitstaff at the Maze Restaurant where the breakfast is served were quite unfriendly and rude this included one of the junior Managers on duty young brunette lady I witnessed one of the waitstaff turn away guests for breakfast who arrived a couple of minutes after breakfast was to finish at 10 30am even though there was still all the food on the buffet table The 2 hotel lifts were incredibly slow and old sometimes stopping on each floor even when the floor number hadn t been pressed in the lift and there was no one waiting when you got to the floor One of the positives of the hotel was its manager on duty Pedro When we contacted the front desk in relation to the hair on the sheets Pedro was incredibly helpful and professional promptly relocating us to another room on a higher floor with a view of grosvenor square , Excellent location within walking distance to Oxford Street Regent Street and Bond Street Many restaurants and Cafes nearby The rooms overlooking Grosvenor Square had an amazing view as did the Maze restaurant where breakfast was served The hotel staff in particular the Manager on duty Pedro were very helpful when we had an issue with our original room Also the manager on duty at Maze Restuarant she had short blonde hair was very helpful and friendly when we went for breakfast 
335198,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Room far too small too close the the lifts and staff were not very friendly , Close to shopping room was comfortable and clean but very small I was asslo by the lift so disrupted sleep 
335199,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Arrived very late and tired was given a room with faulty air conditioning fan that was making very loud noise Was moved to another room not something I would consider 5 start room Middle of my sleep was woken up by big bang as someone tried to open the door luckily it was chained It turned out that new guests were checked into the same room After going back to sleep again I was woken up by front desk asking for my name reason system failed to update recorded Most likely staff failed to update system when I was moved from noisy room The day of my check out house keeper knocked and opened door while I was a sleep Luckily door was chained again An hour later house keeper came back knocking on door The most uncomfortable hotel stay ever On check out day rooms are not checked out until guests leave All they needed to do is access the hotel system without randomly disturbing guests , Location
335200,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Breakfast at the Maze Grill was not very nice The service was poor unfriendly staff food quality was below average and slow AND most important to me the Grill was very run down with old and dirty furniture I wanted to invite some friends over for a meal but changed my mind as i would be ashamed to invite them to such a place this is 2 star venue Don t understand why Gordon Ramsey lend his name to this restaurant , The location of the hotel is fantastic rooms are a good size and very clean Generally the reception staff were very helpful and friendly 
335201,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The breakfast buffet menu choice could be better No vegetables cereal beans and many other standard meals for 4 and 5 London hotels, Generally the hotel provides expected quality for that kind of money
335202,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Breakfast was awful poached eggs were hard missing items off the plate forgot coffee Charged me for the mini bar which I didn t use Had a room right next to the elevator which made noises all night noisy room neighbours including arguments and people facetiming outside our room Would expect this from a cheap b b but not a Marriott , Pillows
335203,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The fact that our essential request for twin beds was ignored but following my subsequent telephone conversation with a member of your staff yesterday it seems that you are not bothered either In fact the gentleman at Booking com I spoke to didn t seem to care whether you kept or lost our custom in future It s nice if you can afford to be so cavalier with your customers needs , Position of hotel food room comfort
335204,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, Incorrect room was given on arrival a shoe box upon my insistence alternative room made available the next day but no adjustment to rate for the first night , Location to what we want in London

335206,London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, The staff rushed us In At check in which meant they never gave us our complimentary breakfast vouchers which we had to sort out in the morning thus making us rush for breakfast I booked 1 double and 1 twin room When we arrived we were allocated two doubles They then could only put a put u up bed, The hotel and everything about it was excellent
