89130,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, Property is attached to the Gare De Lyon station which made it really easy for us since we were coming late night to Paris on TGV Moving around in the city was also very easy due to access to all the underground lines from Gare De Lyon Staff was very helpful and genuine 
89131,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, For a 4 star hotel considering the price the room was small When I put the towels on the floor they were not all replaced The shower faucet was broken and leaking water everywhere The room service was terrible half of the dishes on the menu were not available and the food was not very good , The location is right at one of the main stations They stored my luggage for free the day of departure 
89132,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Put the price down to 70euros which is the true value of the bed and breakfast experience I am an ex hotelier having worked in 4 5 star hotels for many years, Breakfast was appalling hotel is not a 4 but a 3 star deluxe Service at breakfast was terrible They put a lady at the door that greeted you like a police officer but could not even get the staff to bring a simple bottle of water when asked Food was the worst eaten chef must read this Sausage and bacon were swimming in fat egg looked like it had been mixed with porridge and mustard Earl Grey tea had finished and to ruin everything the hot water kettle poured cold water A disaster 
89133,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, We had a check in time of 3 pm we checked in at 10 am and left our bags in til 3 pm traveled back at 6pm and the room was still not ready we Didn t get our room till 7 15 pm we were given a free drink for waiting and I stayed there as I am a Acor member not good enough ,No Positive
89134,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Felt it was over priced for the room Booked a Privilege Room but it was not very big Pictures showed a room a lot bigger Just be aware that you can hear the announcements from the station next door didn t bother us though , This hotel was next to the train station so very convenient Some very good restaurants near by The staff where very friendly and helpful Good for a couple of nights stay 
89135,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, At Breakfast took 20 minutes to refill Bacon and Sausages This was the only negative part of the stay , Got upgrade at check in by very helpful staff member 
89136,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Had to swipe credit card to use safe , Great location if travelling by train Nice restaurants directly underneath hotel great set menus for dinner and breakfast 
89137,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The area around the station has restaurants and bars and we had a decent meal at one of these opposite the station It is a very busy and noisy area but you would probably expect that Did not feel unsafe walking around , Right next to train station so very handy for travel Asked for a low floor and got first level which I was pleased with as this does not often happen Staff on reception friendly and multi lingual Room was adequate but not large and it was clean Did not take breakfast as I thought it was a bit expensive I would stay here again 
89138,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Room a little cramped Signs of mould in the ceiling outside the bathroom , The location and facilities were great Staff for the most part very courteous and helpful Really good breakfast options

89140,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Bathroom too small and so water had no where to go when running over bath when showering So cabinetry also got wet this will perish in time Need extra bath mats liquid soap dispenser need 2 hands to push some out so no way to catch any that s just silly and thus a waste of liquid soap Lucky you had soap Bathroom could be a little bigger so door doesn t come so close to toilet but it would do A bit cheap providing pencil not a pen pencils always break and too light when it writing a note No hot water in breakfast room so could not make tea my daughter used coffee machine but had coffee in water still Waited for hit water to be filled but didn t occur for whole of our breakfast , Next to train station and not even 1 minute walk to Metro which was terrific for us but not noisy to hear in hotel Considerate staff and helpful with different matters and friendly with good sense of humour especially with my poor French wasn t a problem at all and staff English was good Reception staff and help with moving our luggage assistant were very good to deal with When we had unused leftover Metro tickets we were happy to give to helpful staff as they were helpful with us Even with misunderstanding with the room was solved so easily and quickly not a problem Random complimentary sweet jars in foyer were nice touch Room comfy Appreciate the water complimentary in room Breakfast was quite good nice wide selection of choices Bed was comfy and room quiet appreciated the curtains were heavy and kept room dark 
89141,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The room was small and the condition was average e g The carpet in the room and in the hallway was worn Most unsatisfactory was that the air conditioning only worked when turned to 5 degrees which it didn t actually get anywhere near and only with the fan speed going full blast all night The result was a warm and noisy and not very restful night , The lobby was a comfortable place to sit while waiting for our train
89142,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, We had to wait for breakfast places to be set one morning The air conditioning wasn t very efficient Other staff weren t as friendly , It was a good location for the purpose of our trip Reception staff were helpful and friendly Complimentary mini bar
89143,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Lady on reception very rude Room tiny 9x12 acc didn t work Horrible room Cleaner kept coming in on second day checking we left even tho check in was 12 Woke us up 3 times she came in , Next to train station
89144,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, There was nothing not to like , This is a big corporate hotel so can only be described as good not special I enjoyed my stay and would go again without hesitation if required but you do not get and neither do you expect the personal touch 
89145,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, No tea bags only herbal tea bags Basic drink facilities e g 1 sachet milk each per day no china cups only paper hotel deducted 50 per night per person additionally from a credit card and authorised it in the card even though they did not apply why is this their policy , Location right next to the station nice area safe
89146,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Even though the room was prepaid the staff asked for my credit card Fair enough as most hotels do this to guarantee payment for extras However Mecure took 100 euros from my account They said it was a preauthorisation and no money would be taken but it was Not sure when the money will be refunded but very disappointed as it was part of my holiday money and leaves me short Also be aware that you will pay bank commission charges Won t use the hotel again ever , Good location beds were comfortable 
89147,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Insulting procedure blocking 100 extra on my card This hasn t happened when staying at Mercure Gare de Lyon in Paris Presented as our practice by receptionist as if I was a criminal There was NO indication this would happen when I made my booking I was delayed leaving for an early train as the night Porter struggled to remove it yet not allowed to have this done the evening before when it was quite obvious I would not be having breakfast , Coffee making fridge in room 
89148,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Had to ask at reception for city map tourist information as couldn t see any leaflets Staff didn t appear very knowledgeable about some of the local attractions opening hours etc but did look them up on the computer for us , This was a 2 night stay en route to Italy Property was in a good location close to the railway station for our onward trip Staff were pleasant Didn t take the breakfast option so can t comment Able to walk to some attractions locally Good selection of cafes restaurants supermarket in locality 
89149,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Buffet breakfast good but not replenished on a timely basis when busy The bathroom more correctly shower toilet was tiny , A great location if arriving departing by train from Gare du Lyon but require immediate access to RER metro buses
89150,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, The hotel was next door to Gard de Lyon where we were catching the fast train to Barcelona the next day Would stay there again and also the breakfast was very good 
89151,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Hotel staff The hotel advertises that has luggage storage facilities When I ask the reception the lady she refused to keep my suitcase she said that they were expecting a large group the following day and they needed the storage and that the group takes preference to individuals staying at the hotel When the next shift come in I ask again for reception to keep my suitcase on storage and there was no problems the gentleman on duty kindly accepted my suitcase Some hotel staff does understand hospitality but others dont , The hotel location is perfect next to transport and beautiful sights
89152,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, added in paragraph above, The staff were very friendly and helpful The corridors and carpets leading to the room were very shabby and the paintwork poor The room itself was adequate and clean for the one night we stayed I would not have wanted to stay more than one night but as we had an early train to catch from the station next door the location was perfect Looks like it needs a revamp and a tidy up 
89153,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The surrounding of the hotel was not maintained well there was a weird smell when walking towards the building , Good location right next to the train station which was very convenient if you have a train ride early in the morning 
89154,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, I understand Patis expensive but felt the price of breakfast over the top so we ate in a local cafe, Staff most helpful and friendly Location perfect for trains
89155,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Nothing at all , Bed magic just very upset about the pickpocket on metro but your staff were extra helpful with emergency phone calls to banks etc very much appreciated heifer a lot 
89156,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Not given the room we booked Room very warm Air con not working No ventilation No room clean up one day Had to ask and re ask for towels and toilet paper and tissues running out of both was a problem Could not contact the desk on the phone Bad lighting Light switch behind pillow and light turned on when I moved at night Odd shower water went everywhere When requested a twin room as booked they moved us to another double room Had to again request a twin room as booked Front desk check out no one cared about the issues we faced No such thing as a quiet room construction on one side and train station on the other ,No Positive
89157,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The room was relatively small and very sparsely furnished The hairdryer was not working They couldn t replace it but moved us to a different room to circumvent the problem Last but not the least The hotel reception staff should learn to be a little more pleasant , We liked the breakfast The staff responded quickly when there was a problem 
89158,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Nothing , The hotel is in located in an excellent location if you are having an early morning train at Gare De Lyon It is so near just 2 minutes walk 
89159,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Bed was supposed to be a king unfortunately it was more like a large single Very hard to sleep on, Breakfast was amazing so much choice location was fantastic seconds to the station facilities were also good
89160,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The breakfast could be improved very low quality of foods and drinks , The position is convenient being next to the train station Staff very kind and helpful 
89161,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, We thought the room was stuffy I was also annoyed to be asked for a 100 guarantee it said nothing about that on the booking form and I was not asked for a fee at a cheaper and more comfortable hotel a hundred yards down the road at the beginning of the week, The staff at the desk were helpful 
89162,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The bar wouldnt serve us any food at 10pm We were send away to look for nearby restaurants to eat a small bite After all day at Diseyland it was a last thing I was hoping to hear but had no other choice but to walk again in search for anything to eat , Very clean and spacious room Super kind service at the reception Excellent location 
89163,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The room we were allocated smelt a bit damp when we got it Later in mid evening someone from housekeeping came to look at the plumbing on a complaint from a previous resident We should not have been disturbed like this and should not have been allocated to a room with outstanding work to be done on it , The breakfast was very nice and the staff were helpful and polite Appreciated the baggage storage facility on our final morning there 
89164,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, As we entered our room on the first day there was a used towel of the former guest left in the bathroom , Good location friendly and helpful staff 
89165,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Nothing everything was excellent and I didn t hear a single train The grumpy woman in the Metro ticket office who wouldn t accept a E50 note when I tried to buy two carnets , The location of this hotel is superb only metres away from the mainline train station Gare de Lyon and the TGV s heading west and south and the Metro Line 1 which is only a couple of stops away from exchange stations which take you anywhere in Paris Both stations can be reached without getting wet during February s drizzle The housekeeping staff are excellent they found my wife s lost earring and kept the room spotless The breakfast buffet has a wide variety of food available and everything I sampled was excellent Across from the station there are two fine restaurants I can t decide which was the better I will definitely stay there again 
89166,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Nothing, Everything Perfect kind and quick service Great position to take a train at 6am Well connected to every place in paris with taxy or metro right outside the hotel
89167,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, I was very unhappy happy with the shower and bathroom facilities as we had a privilege room and payed the extra money for that the shower was very disappointing and the the toilet flushed was broken and we had constant trickling from the toilet, The staff were very friendly and helpful and you are situated right next to gare de Lyon station so if your using the metro it s ideal also for the city tour buses there is a stop opposite the hotel which was great
89168,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, While there is a coffee machine in the room and tea bags there is no milk fresh or UHT and the cups are disposable paper cups This area is busy at night so if you are a light sleeper you might want to ask for a room away from the street , This hotel is well located if you are travelling by train from Gare de Nord or want easy access to the Metro Bus The hotel room is comfortable with modern bathroom good shower although the stall is quite narrow toiletries etc The front desk staff are welcoming and helpful The breakfast room is pleasant with a good selection of items 24 hour reception desk is a real plus when arriving late 
89169,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Not being able to sleep that s what I don t like It s 1 AM as I m writing this I thought it the room would cool down since I returned at 21 30 and have had the window open There is no way of controlling the temperature in the room The AC is off as its winter and outside the air temp is about 7 degrees C In the room its positively tropical still I can put up with noise coming from the street it a fusion of general road traffic people and train station related noise Cars passing close by and the odd truck backing up People wandering past shouting and general Saturday night drunks shouting If I could stop the hot air blowing into the room I could close the window and stop the noise I can t Though even with the window open its still too hot anyway I ve spent years in the tropics so I m used to the heat I ve just had a cold shower and that s helped The last time I did this was in a hut on an island in the Philippines I just rang the 24 24 service quality the phone in my room directed me to The nice man told me that I was winter and cold outside so of course there s no AC I told him that it wasn t AC i needed really just no forced hot air that I can t stop I asked him if there was anything he could do as I was going to write a review and hopefully inform people who might want to avoid being transported to the tropics He said no nothing I m seriously considering leaving the room and sleeping in the train station next door with the homeless people I probably won t because I ve paid for breakfast and may have trouble getting that money back I m sure when temperatures are locally controllable and the windows can be shut this will e okay but so far I can only say okay as without wanting to sound like moaner there are other issues that may bother other people , Location to the train station you ll be practically sleeping on the platform 
89170,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The WiFi wasn t brilliant the smart TV wasn t hooked up to the Internet Some staff not so keen to help External doors were locked at night and had to be opened by staff inside the building if you could find them in the rain this wasn t nice , Location was fantastic Rooms were great and most of the staff were brilliant and helpful 
89171,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Rooms small and dated pre payment on credit card was held for over a week Ok for one night but I m sure there are better places fir the money overall disappointed , Handy for the station 
89172,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, My room didn t have enough shampoo body wash for one person to shower which you only learn by being in the shower Uber s repeatedly had a hard time finding the location If coming to paris for a vacation or for leisure this might not be the hotel for you Pick one more centrally located , Staff was friendly 
89173,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The carpet and the noise you could hear the announcement in the train station just next to the hotel so bite noisy , The staff were very cooperative though on the phone they said they gonna charge extra for early arrival they didn t finaly so it was nice of them 
89174,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, Excellent hotel close to station which was very convenient Also the close proximity to restaurants was great and the area along the river and surrounding the hotel was lovely 
89175,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Nothing, The position above Gare de Lyon is great since I had the train at 6 00am The staff is great and I found the room ready at 11 00am as I asked From Gare de Lyon you can easily take the metro to everywhere
89176,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The rooms and bathrooms are a bit tired and on the smallish side but clean , Locality to Gare de Lyon station couldn t be better good breakfast offered 
89177,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, Comfortable big double bed clean and new bathroom spacious room very convenient location Great value for money especially comparing to hotel rate in Paris 
89178,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, bathroom splash screen can be improved to prevent water from spilling to other parts of the bathroom , convenience of location next to the train station food shops and convenience stores around 
89179,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Bar did not have some of the beer on offer also service a little slow but only one member of staff on duty who also had to prepare any food ordered thus away from the bar , Good selection at breakfast croissants were warm and fresh Unable to comment on wifi it is available for free but not used 
89180,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, For a 4 star hotel I expected to have the bad basic things like a shower cap Bedroom was too warm no airco only van At the site of booking com is not clear that the parking garage is not part of the hotel And it was expensive one ,No Positive
89181,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, 1 Even though the room was fully prepayed they charged me additional 100 euros at the arrival As it was explained it s in case I use anything additional during my stay and after my departure they will be returned to my bank account Be careful it s 50 euros for person for every night of your stay As of now it s been nearly three weeks and money still not returned to my bank account Personally I am never again staying in another Mercury hotel because of this policy and I honestly am scared to think what can happen if for example additional 500 euros are blocked on my card for more than three weeks you can be left without any money during your trip if you are on budget 2 The staff was very unhelpfull as money was blocked on the card without any normal explanation and even though I was talking before my stay via e mail with the hotel s reception aka do I need to pay anything else the asnwer was only breakfasts if you want them nowhere not on the booking com not on the hotel s website not anywhere is mentioned that they are blocking additional 50 euros for each person for every night of your stay Conclusion if you are a guest from out of France and on a budget trip do not stay here There are other hotels near this train station without any guarantee blockings It s more expensive than you think , 1 It s just few steps away from Gare de Lyon very comfy if you need to get on the train 2 Room very small classical France but comfy and quiet 3 A bit too expensive but wonderful breakfasts
89182,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Breakfast is overpriced Food selection lunch dinner is very limited and rather fast food type The hotel could be renovated visibly old items in the room , Location is perfect Staff helpful and friendly 
89183,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Probably not somewhere we would spend Abu considerable about of time in clean enough for somewhere to sleep shower for one night Can t comment on the staff food as we didn t come across any doe to the time we arrived at night Place sorta looked like a high rise veryong corridors not particularly well decorated , Place was clean Ok if you re just wanting a clean place to crash for the night We were only staying for one night and catching an early train from Paris Gare du Lyon the next morning The station was literally next door so was great location and perfect for what we needed 
89184,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Nothing, The position right on the top of Gare de Lyon where we had to take a train at 6am to go back to Italy is amazing With no effort we were on the train In addition the service at the arrival and after is of high level for example I asked for an early check in and I obtained it Every place of the city is easily reachable through a taxy or the subway right under the hotel 
89185,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The prices in the bar were quite outrageous needless to say we only had 1 drink there , The location was perfect for us as we were catching a train next morning
89186,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Just a little short staffed on reception, Comfortable bed well equipped room and bathroom facilities which was spotlessly clean Slippers and Dressing gowns supplied Excellent 
89187,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Cardboard takeaway cups and plastic cups for tea coffee is not what you would expect although it does cut down on their cleaning costs Not sure what the criteria is for room allocation but being friendly trying to carry out the conversation in French as best I could I m sure the hotel was far from full but we seemed to be in a room that felt it hadn t been used for months very moldy odour Poor quality pillows, Location Close to Gar de Lyon station Good cafe and restaurants opposite station 
89188,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Bedroom is on the small side compared with Mercure outside Paris , Proximity to the station could not be closer Excellent breakfast Great choice of restaurants nearby 
89189,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The room was very small as was the bath We thought the price of breakfast excessive and diet not partake We will not stay again or recommend to anyone, Proximity to Gare de Lyon
89190,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The lack of the advertised coffee maker in the room and the niggardly supply of coffee and tea sachets Paper cups are intolerable in a hotel of its supposed standard The cost of the breakfast which we chose not to have for that reason The staff were somewhat less than friendly and welcoming The fridge in the room smelt and was absurdly small , The location s convenience for catching our train 
89191,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Nothing , Perfect location right infront of the train station and a short walk from Notre Dame Plenty of bars and restaurants in easy walking distance Room comfy and clean would happily have stayed more than one night 
89192,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, There were no negative points to our accomodation , Convenience of Gare De Lyon Station The Hotel was very good but our visit was very short because of our Train timetable We would stay again and enjoy the other facilities which were comprehensive particularly the Restaurant 
89193,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, A couple minor fixes needed to the basic facilities Besides this really nothing , Right next door to the train station so it was perfect for our one night accommodation before transit to Rome About a 30minute walk along the water to some nice parks and the Bercy village 
89194,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Felt very insecure There was NO security in the hotel reception and anyone could have used the lifts up to the rooms Room was very small indeed Window to shower was quite unnecessary , Convenient location if travelling into or from Gare de Lyon Charming receptionist who put us in a privileged room 
89195,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The breakfast staff need to be retrained in manners as very rude and very unhelpful The desk staff especially a young man at the desk was very polite As it was a special occasion I was upgraded to a lovely room for free,No Positive
89196,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, I paid for an upgrade room with bar fridge and coffee tea facility Bar fridge had ONE soft drink and ONE bottle flat water in Small paper cups for coffee Just TWO Nespresso machine capsules NOT in line with the pictures on the brochure large ceramic mugs etc , staff friendly and professional even smiled at my French Late check out allowed
89197,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The rooms were clean but very basic for a 4 star hotel little things like no shower cap in the bathroom , The hotel was in a perfect situation for an overnight stay and travelling from the Gare de Lyon the following morning Quick and easy as no check out bill receipt emailed on after departure 
89198,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, We asked for a quiet room in the booking They gave us one on the street side very noisy Even more irritating was the poor air conditioning In the middle of our second night it failed completely We had to pack everything and move to another room at 1AM The desk offered no help in the move At least there was another room available where the AC worked ,No Positive
89199,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The air conditioning was working but it failed to cool the room and there was no air circulation making it very stuffy and humid , The privilege room had complimentary soft drinks in the fridge These were very welcome
89200,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Very pleasant check in staff but overall feel of the hotel was impersonal , Good location for train journey early next morning and for dinner at Le Train Bleu Short walk to the river
89201,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, only one free bottle of water and two very small milk pods for coffee tea But housekeeping were happy to deliver more to our room , It was the nearest hotel to the train station
89202,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Nothing , Position next to railway station Near Gare du Bercy after dropping our car off for the auto train and next morning catching train to Narbonne Near restaurants and bars Breakfast good hot and cold 
89203,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, My friend I each paid half of the tariff on check out I have now discovered that the hotel has taken a security amount from my credit card recorded on booking com and a second amount from my card when checking in the same card used to pay the account I now have to try to recover these two charges from the hotel I see that I am not the only customer to have been charge twice ,No Positive
89204,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Rooms are small but well appointed , Fantastic location next to the train station and so close to shops restaurants and the high line The staff were incredibly patient and helpful 
89205,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Didn t like the position because of the close proximity to the railway station and it brought about many people who were just hanging about drunk Not a good area ,No Positive
89206,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, This hotel is grossly overpriced In future I will look further afield i e The Holiday inn only 250 m from station , The location cannot be bettered to catch an early morning train The room was better than I had last year The staff were efficient 
89207,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Not much milk in rooms for tea coffee, Close to station Breakfast good choice We paid about 90 per room for twin rooms which was reasonable price other nights the advertised price was much higher and this would have not been particularly good value
89208,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The hotel did not feel secure and comfortable for the price I paid The room was a bit dark The hairdryer attached to the wall exploded there was a flame I called reception and it took some time for another hairdryer to be brought to my room I was shaken up after this experience yet the apology and managing of this situation was poor , The location was good because I had to take a train from Gare de Lyon 
89209,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Small room small window reasonable comfortable , Location next to station walking distance to rest and city attraction if you willing to exercise is quiet ok 
89210,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Smokers allowed to smoke by entrance Very European in this respect though , Very quiet and clean Next to the train station with buses out side as well Some nice food places close by 
89211,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Well for a hotel in France a few more choices on the wine list would be nice But not a deal breaker Otherwise it s good to go , The location at Gare de Lyon is the best You are right there at the train station if you need to take an early train because you come in late from the airport or whatever The rooms are great and the little bar offers nice light meals 
89212,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Bad staff at check in talking and greeting others and chatting to them whilst booking us in Answering the phone three times whilst booking us in no apologies very rude service , Clean 
89213,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Since it is right next to the train station there is a bit of noise from announcements according to my husband I didn t notice it while I was sleeping , What a pleasant surprise that a hotel next to a major train station is so affordable and pleasant The rooms are small but well planned Ours had a little minibar stocked with included beverages The staff spoke English well and were super helpful 
89214,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Aircon did not stay as cool as we would have liked but window opened to let in cool night air , A good location next to Gare Du Lyon Easy walk to the Seine and other areas Plenty of cafes to choose from Room pleasant though rather small Bed large and comfy 
89215,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Garderobe is small for 2 persons when staying 3 5 days But is not bad though, Room was clean Enough towels in the Room Good water supply in shower and toilet Got the LUCK in Privilege Room Just a few steps to Gare de Lyon if traveling by train A good place to stay Comfortable So generous with Soap Lotion and others Refill Bathroom is spacious Highly Recommendable and I will surely come back with friends and Family Friendly Personnel Thank you 
89216,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Though booking made through your agency and payment was taken in advance of our arrival the hotel made an unusual step of demanding a further guarantee of 100 to cover any other services such as breakfast We declined breakfast as it was quite expensive at 17 per person , The room was large and comfortable and we had spent there 3 days in all in Paris to contact friends before going to Annecy 
89217,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, I had trouble finding the hotel on arrival on the metro I asked for milk and it never arrived I asked for a wake up call and didn t receive one, Close to station for train to Provence early the next morning
89218,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Please supply china cups for coffee and tea paper cups are a no no , Friendly staff breakfast good selection available Location excellent for travelers on TGV and Metro 
89219,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, It was all good I was only there a short time late arrival and early departure so didn t try the breakfast or anything but it seemed to run well , It is at Gare de Lyon and when you have an early train it just doesn t get any better The room was very comfortable and quiet given the location The staff very friendly and helpful I got in late but was still able to get a nice bar meal in the lounge bar Although next to Gare de Lyon there are lots of places to eat near by But when you re on your own and it s late its great to just eat at the hotel And not expensive 
89220,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, Ideally located for a late arrival into the Gare de Lyon especially on those days when SNCF services are disrupted by strikes We have previously found this hotel very overheated on this visit it felt much more comfortable Chance or change 
89221,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, The closeness to the station on arrival but the rooms are so well soundproofed that it didn t seem like it was so close to a railway Very good breakfast including hot cooked food A very comfortable peaceful night 
89222,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, the room was very small so storing luggage was a bit difficult , The evening before our checkout we ate at Le Train Bleu next to the hotel and the meal was wonderful The breakfast at the hotel and its location were as we needed 
89223,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The decor in areas we saw needs upgrading It s a bit shabby , Beds were comfy it s a great central location The staff were friendly and welcoming 
89224,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, I really liked the idea of the coffee machine Nescafe but the paper cups and lack of milk were disappointing, Very conveniently located for the Gare de Lyon station virtually alongside the station so there is no problem with luggage transfer We didn t try the hotel breakfast as there are so many typical French cafe s just across the street The room was very adequate and comfortable for an overnight stay 
89225,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The rooms should at least have hotel slippers for visitors in the room, The breakfast was superb and the hotel was generally clean and most important is the strategic location which allowed ease of commuting 
89226,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Mattress was too hard, Excellent location ideal for metro trains bus and coach transport restaurants bars and cafes Close to the Seine Room was a good size for a Paris hotel The staff were welcoming polite and helpful 
89227,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, It s an impersonal hotel with very little to commend it except location Not cheap small austere rooms and evening reception staff inhospitable Morning receptionist was friendlier No other staff available in public areas to direct us to breakfast room which was poorly signposted and difficult to find at the end of a long grey corridor and when we got there a dreary lifeless space to eat Breakfast was a completely self service affair even though there were numerous staff on duty and the coffee was dire , good location for Gare de Lyon
89228,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Scrambled eggs at breakfast too sticky, Front desk staff very helpful guest internet PC very useful in room safe very clean comfortable excellent location to trains buses spacious bathroom good choices of breakfast teas
89229,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Our room was at the smoker floor and we are not smokers at all When I told that to the reception the guy told me yes normal because you did not mention in your booking reservation that you are not a smoker I find this simply amazing and I was completely not aware that this kind of practice reserving an entire floor for the smokers was still existing especially in Paris The service and the rooms are clearly not at the level of a 4 especially considering the price we pay 200 for 2 with the breakfast which was just ok , The only good point is the proximity with the train station really practical 
89230,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, They should pay more attention to hygiene cleanliness of the rooms especially bathroom The bed was extremely uncomfortable I could feel and hear the springs in the bed Very depressing atmosphere ,No Positive
89231,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, As it was a joint birthday celebration stayed at the Mecure instead of the nearby Ibis and upgraded to the Priveledge room at the Mecure We had paper cups in the room only one each no spares Why no extra cups We re we supposed to wash the paper cups We asked for decaf coffee and extra cups at Reception and left a note in the room it didn t happen Small details but we d paid for a 4 star hotel and didn t expect to drink out of cardboard cups, Location excellent 
89232,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, I love how the front reception welcoming us with smile and arrange immediately our room when we arrive in the middle of the night by train Its such a pleasure staying at the hotel
89233,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Everything this hotel should not be ranked as a 4star in the uk this wouldn t be ranked more than a 2 The bedrooms stank of smoke or chemicals covering up smoke We changed rooms 3 times before we could bare the smell level The beds were tiny The staff rude and unhelpful , The close proximity of the station but that is the only good thing 
89234,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, None , The front desk staff really helpful especially when i am having trouble connecting internet on my SFR simcard phone they tried as much as they can to really help me and i really appreciate with all their effort as for the room its nice though its abit small spaces and small toilet but its just perfect for me my husband since we only need it to stay one night so we can catch up our early train to Italy the next morning overall i must say i have no negative comments about them All excellent 
89235,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Rooms are small but is fine for short stay, Very close and convenient to Gare de Lyon if TGV metro travelling and carrying luggage Close to restaurants and shops Staff very helpful and friendly 
89236,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, The hotel s location is very nice the receptionists are very welcoming and very helpful to any problem or question To the Privilege type of room in which the minibar and cofee expresor were free were nice we had our tea and cofee in every morning in our room Everyone should know that for the room a 300 euro deposit will be blocked from your account during the stay amount which will be unlocked at the time of your check out but depending on the country where you are from or the bank that you are working with the unlocking of this amount can take up to 3 weeks this is a normal banking procedure 
89237,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Limited menu would have liked a good restaurant , Friendly helpful staff Good atmosphere Room was comfortable and clean and convenient for the railway station 
89238,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, Great location having arrived late in Paris by TGV from Marseilles Friendly helpful welcoming staff With only one full day in Paris we used one of the open tour buses that stops across the street and saw as many sights as we could possibly fit in Fantastic 
89239,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Wasn t told until we arrived that they was to take 50 per person per night deposit for breakfast room service and damages even though we told them we didn t want breakfast or room Service, Location excellent right next to a main train station
89240,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The total inflexibility after some genuine error made over a date of stay Resulting in being charged 2 3 more of original price A total disgrace I intend seeking legal advice , Leaving
89241,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, I chose a superior room and I didn t feel there was much value for money There was an espresso machine which was nice but there were still paper cups I think for 165 they could provide real cups Wifi was slow Ask for a room not overlooking the platform otherwise it ll be noisy but if it s the other side then the room is very quiet , Convenient location as I arrived into gare de lyon quite late Beds were comfortable in the room and had a nice comfortable duvet Bathroom was clean with a great walk in shower Rooms were clean and modern Staff were efficient 
89242,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Having received confirmation from Booking com that I had booked a Twin Room I discovered on arrival that the room we were allocated was made up as a Double When I asked for the beds to be split I was told we would have to move to another room this I did but I had to move my own bags despite by then being close to being late for a theatre matinee At no time was an apology offered for the nuisance and waste of time of this error or carelessness all I got was a bland multi purpose smile by the staff on reception , The relative inexpensiveness location functional room bathroom 
89243,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Heating ventilation system appears quite ineffective after several stays we have never found the building anything but overheated Bedding too heavy for the ambient temperature , Excellent location for rail travellers arriving late evening or with an early start Check in friendly and efficient Room well equipped 
89244,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The breakfast was high cost but poor i e come to Paris to get supermarket croissant Lot of noise until mid night and from 6am due to train station Maid knocking at the door and not waiting for an answer twice we found a maid in our room Overall personnel not very nice We enjoyed several stays there but this time with found it low cost for an increase in cost , This time not much
89245,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The very poor catering facilities in a hotel of this size and the complete lack of service and couldn t care less from the evening catering staff , The location is perfect The reception staff went out of their way to be helpful and welcoming 
89246,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, Staff are excellent very welcoming attentive and multilingual which is always helpful for people travelling from across Europe The hotel is clean tidy and the cleaning staff are very efficient Great selection at breakfast with fresh food being brought out promptly Even though centrally located surprisingly not that loud we stayed on 5th floor 
89247,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Room too small and a bit stuffy Not worth of what I paid , Right next to Gare de Lyon Good for one night stay in order to catch an early morning train next day 
89248,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, Great location by the gare de Lyon a stroll away from La Bastille The room was rather large for Paris Very quiet room All you expect from the Mercure brand Great breakfast 
89249,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, No dislikes, Superior room was excellent Valerio on reception was efficient friendly and requires special mention hotel was perfectly situated for station and breakfast was superb
89250,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Air conditioning not responsive whole hotel too warm for our comfort , Excellent location for rail travellers Staff on reception polite and helpful Room a decent size and well equipped 
89251,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV,No Negative, Good location We were going to a concert at Bercy Arena only took about 10 mins to walk there Easy to get trains as next door to the station Plenty of places to eat nearby 
89252,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Due to the unseasonably warm weather the room was hot but the air conditioning in Room 728 was out of order It was too noisy to keep the window open due to the noise of the trains in the station below Wi fi was very unstable even though I paid 9 euros for the premium wifi , Location of this hotel was excellent being adjacent to the Gare de Lyon and one stop on the metro from the Bercy sorry AccorHotels Arena for the BNP Paribas Masters Tennis Room was comfortable nothing more I didn t have breakfast in the hotel so cannot comment on that Was able to leave my suitcase in a secure room on departure day until it was time to take my train Staff on the front desk were all polite and helpful 
89253,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Room was a bit small but still comfortable for one person Other than that nothing, I really loved the breakfast Catered more to my taste but they had traditional French breakfast as well staff was very helpful as well The location is awesome too literally attached to the train station so it s easy to find if you go to gare de lyon
89254,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Cleanliness Personell availability Queue at check in Really not diverse breakfast No minibar products even though the hotel blocked money on my credit card , Good location near the trains station unfortunately this is the single asset
89255,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The rooms are too small Its basically a 3 star motel Initially when we arrived we were informed of the non availabilty of double beds inspite of the fact that we SPECIFICALLY booked for double beds on the upper floors ahead of time Imagine sleeping with a friend in a small bed after 6 hours of travelling on the train we begged of course and they relented afterwards The bedframes were moving and we had a view of a ledge littered with cigarette butts of the first floor roof The hallway smells musty Breakfast of 70 euros is not worth it Better take your breakfast someplace else , It s close proximity to the Gard De Lyon Station The fact that they close the main doors of the hotel after midnight The area of Gard De Lyon at midnight is full of arab and african migrants and some are really creepy or very furtive so this extra security measure is a plus 98 of the staff are very friendly 
89256,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, We have utilized Mercure and their services within various countries Our experience of this booking is that the tiny tiny size of the room was 1 that we could not recommend to anyone We would not stay again due to the room size and constant announcements from the train station Was a privilege room on the 6th floor , Staff and how they interacted was commendable 
89257,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, I didn t like that it was quit expensive for the dimension of the room and for not including breakfast in this amount of money Also quit expensive breakfast in case you wanted to taste it , I liked a lot the staff and its location 
89258,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The beds were the most uncomfortable ever worse than many cheaper hotels This needs to change and purchasing higher quality mattresses , Location perfect next to Gare de Lyon
89259,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Room small for a superior rating Long wait at reception reception staff also answer phone calls Damage to shower controls and window latch, Handy for Gare de Lyon Helpful barman
89260,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The reception staff were rude Our key cards did not seem to be working so we asked for help We were given another set and a patronising teach in on how to use them When these did not seem to work we asked the concierge who finally informed us that we should have been told that the door handle had to be pulled up not down due to safety reasons The reception staff had forgotten to tell us this , The concierge The only helpful member of staff in the hotel 
89261,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Was superb if room space be slightly bigger , Location comfort and other facilities were superb We stayed 4 nights with children in privilege room and we do recommend for family Happy stay 
89262,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The bedroom was very small in fact the smallest we have stayed in for a long time There were paper cups for coffee and a very basic bathroom even though this was said to be a Superior Room Strangely there was a huge flat screen TV and a Nespresso machine for coffee but we didn t use either of them There were insufficient staff at breakfast so tables were not cleared very fast and items on the breakfast bar not replaced quickly , The hotel was very convenient for our late arrival at the Gare de Lyon The staff were professional and friendly 
89263,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Ordinary facility Room very small and ac not responsive to adjustments , Great location right next to train station staff couldn t have been more helpful 
89264,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Many thing I did not like among them the following 1 They charged me 100 euro per day as a guarantee though the hotel policy as shown in Booking com says nothing about that the reception lady insisted to charge this ridicules amount 2 the hotel did not pay attention to our special request and we had to wait for more than 2 hrs to get our room the reception lady was so rude and informed us that the check in time is at 14 00 and not 12 00 as stated in Booking com she blamed Booking com for the inaccurate information 3 upon our arrival to the room we were shocked by the miserable doubled bed we got two single beds closed to each other with out any joint when you sleep on this doubled bed it is very likely to fall down in the middle of the gab which would be created and 4 the stuff has no respect to the guest privacy our room was crashed twice by the hotel stuff while we were resting there with out our permission The hotel does not look like a 4 stars hotel it lacked any facility of which qualifies this property to be ranked as a 4 stars hotel They have no porter , Near to the train station and metro They gave us a free late check out until 16 00 pm and store our luggages for free as well 
89265,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The two cards given to access room never worked A member of staff had to let us in Then the receptionist came up and said they d fix it It didn t work at all Each time we left room had to get assistance It became a bit of a nuisance that s all especially as we were on 5th floor , Ideal location Walked from Gare du Bercy after dropping our car off for the auto train to Narbonne to Gare du Lyon and the hotel So next morning after breakfast we were ready to catch our train down south as hotel is right on top of the station Plenty of nearby bars and restaurants nearby for the evening too 
89266,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Some of the corridors smelt a bit but it was hot so that might happen anywhere in Paris, Breakfast buffet was good Some unusual options like American pancakes with bacon and maple syrup The staff were really friendly and helpful 
89267,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, There were quite few hairs from previous customers in the bathroom when checked in A broken chair with nail sticking out was in the room upside down without any notes It would be nice to have a replacement chair then , The location was great at the middle of medieval village Our room was in the separate building from the reception but the room was huge Good security 
89268,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The room was small but we had expected that from other reviews The air conditioning was not working while we were there which was particularly unpleasant on one night when it was quite hot It was being fixed but was still to be rectified when we left we were there for 3 days No information on the problem was offered by staff , We were catching a train from Gare de Lyon so the location was excellent It was great having a big brand pod coffee maker in the room 
89269,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, AirCon totally ineffective on night of stay weather exceptionally hot humid Uncomfortable sweaty night No restaurant on premises Local eateries not particularly good , Location convenient for onward travel 
89270,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, No hotel restaurant for evening meals Some local restaurants are a bit rough General area around Gare de Lyon dirty noisy, Very helpful staff Location good for onward travel
89271,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, The room or if Im not mistaken all the standard double rooms are cramped in size barely enough for two humans to walk through Woth the third peace of luggage be prepared to rhink of innovative ideas to use the room either to get rid of tables and chairs or to jump accross points of interest inside the room, The wifi speed was very good compared to other hotels
89272,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, this is paris but this hotel is overpriced the room was very small the aircondition didn t work and there was a strange kind of smell in the room no catastrophe but i would expect more for the money, wifi
89273,Mercure Paris Gare De Lyon TGV, Air Con was all but hopeless in the very high temperatures when we were there so sleeping was a very uncomfortable Breakfast was expensive so we ate locally , Perfect location with access to all travel amenities Staff were a total joy to speak with and were more than helpful when we mistakenly destroyed our return Eurostar tickets they printed them off again with no fuss
