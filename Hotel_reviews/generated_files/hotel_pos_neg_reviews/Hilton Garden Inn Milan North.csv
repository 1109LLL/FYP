480614,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, At The reception during the three days only one person smiled at us the rest made us feel unwelcome to a high limit At bathroom The distance between the sink and the tap is really small you cant wash your hands in there ,No Positive
480615,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The nighbourhood is not that nice place but its also not veey bad Maybe at night its a bit unsafe to go out, Good hotel and clean There is a subway station nearby to go to Doumo and back
480616,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Unfortunately in of the room 235 kettle did not work at all and sink did not work properly Also was a bit disappointed that during check in reception operator asked me if I like to have a breakfast as it was not included in our room rate and I indicated that I need only for one day However at check out in automatically counted for two days so I had to prove that we did not have breakfast What is the point to ask if we like to have breakfast if it is counted anyway , Short distance to metro makes it accessible to all locations of the city Cleanliness was good AC ventilation works really well Good Parking available and easy access from parking to lifts 
480617,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, house keeper lady we put the sign of dont disturb and she knocked the door and came to the room woke us up in the morning and also in another day she entered the room without permission and cleaned while we already put do not disturb and when i called the staff to complain and report they didn t even apologize for that and were too calm and lazy , clean modern room size 2 minutes for metro station reception staff are good 
480618,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, No iron in room but there was a laundry room with good cleaning and ironing facilities , Exceptionally clean and comfortable all staff we met were helpful and polite Would recommend highly 
480619,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, much to expensive breakfast evacuation in the middle of the night with no recompensation spoiled very nice stay in the hotel I thought Hilton will do better, Modern hotel very close to subway good communication to duomo free wide parking o definitely a plus
480620,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, My bed was made up of two mattresses which while sleeping was a little uncomfortable , Good breakfast quite a good selection Very nice and friendly service especially the girl welcoming guests at breakfast The hotel is quiet close to the metro station which can quickly reach the Duomo Cathedral itself There is a store is also next to the corner 
480621,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Fire alarm rang at 4am and for an hour we were all guests on our own and receptionist was alone and on the phone the whole time scary and not professional ,No Positive
480622,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, I had some issues When I arrived at the hotel they couldn t find me on the system they asked me are sure you booked it I showed them my booking confirmation and one of the staff was quite arrogant , The bed was very comfortable 
480623,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, We had the same hotel last year Unfortunately this year we didn t feel the same comfort as last year we expected to have the room very cleaned in a perfect condition since it s a four star hotel In the bathroom we found hair and the toiletries were for one person even if the room was double The hotel is not so cheep so I think it should be more careful to details , The hotel is close to the metro station From the hotel you can easily get to the Milano Cardona railway station from here is very easy to get to Como and organize different trips The breakfast was very good with a lot of options to choose 
480624,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, front desk service could be improved shower head was mouldy and not working in the initial room we were placed in after a little confusion amongst the staff members as to whether or not it was functional we were promptly placed in a new room , located outside the city centre but very easy to get there in 15 20 minutes via the easy to use metro located a mere minute away 
480625,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, They put 2 singles bed together and said its a double bed You know there is a gap in between According to the brochure on the lobby there is a gym on the 6th floor but in reality the top floors are closed , They have a bigger space compared with the hotel in the center of Milan and the M2 metro is near the hotel within 200 meter I think And according to my experience to take the metro in Villa San Giovanni station there are always places to find on the metro 
480626,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Unfortunately the staff didn t seem happy on the day of our arrival Waited to check in for a while as only one staff member out of three was handling the front desk Over heard one say to another customer you ll just have to wait because I m not doing check ins In the evening asked a staff member what the name of their restaurant was called as there are multiple names of their website He told me he didn t know and that it s just a restaurant at Hilton We were put off and decided to go around the block and found some lovely local restaurants , Very modern and convenient to public transport 
480627,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, During my stay there vera a problem that at 4 o clock in night were alarm and all guest were go out from hotel Nobody from staff were not there and nobody can gave any directions All people were in unbelievable situation what happens what we shall do in that situation we were more than one hour absence of any security You can image the nervous situation and the main question was why i choose this hotel The main surprise was that nobody said after that nothing any explanation and there were any reaction or excuses for very bad memories from our stay ,No Positive

480630,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, There is no room service and the small shop is very limited in the choices they have , The rooms were nice the staff responsive and the parking covered and free 
480631,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, the shower design really bad water floods around the bathroom , localization for one who arrives in Milano with car and will take the Metro to the city and breakfast 
480632,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The WC was very tall Im average height and could not place my feet on the ground while using the toilet The room was not cleaned well every day mostly like a good clean every two days Im not referring to change the towels and bed covers as I understand most hotels don t change every day to save water Things like vacuum the carpets and empty the trash bin was not done every day , Very quiet at night Bed was very nice Air conditioning was silent and keep the room at nice temperature 
480633,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North,No Negative, The hotel is really nice it s new and modern It s located in a very residential part of Milan which worried me at first but traveling to the city center took about 15 20 so it wasn t too bad plus it was very safe I had the best breakfast every day at this local bakery 2 minutes away from the hotel I enjoyed seeing the locals interact with each other at the bakery instead of seeing a bunch of tourists It definitely makes the travel experience better because you get a taste of how it is to live there I was also very surprised by the size of the hotel room It was really spacious 
480634,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Slightly out of town Left the car and took a taxi downtown for dinner which came to 30 one way Should have used the metro , Comfortable hotel relatively new build great views from balcony large windows large comfy bed super clean lovely modern bathroom overall excellent value for money Super easy parking Easy to drive to from Linate airport 
480635,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The area immediately around the hotel is not great , Great location when travelling to Milan by car free car parking easy access to Metro to get to city centre without having to drive in Good facilities 
480636,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The restaurant was a bad experience Try to avoid it and go out for lunch dinner , The property is close to public transport and it allows you to get to the city center the Doumo in under 20 minutes The room was very clean and very nice Internet connection was good The hotel in general was great the breakfast offer was good and the staff members provided good information and support 
480637,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, you will find there is a missed room facility after each clean per day like kettle bath towels cups, Overlay the hotel was good and clean nice receptions and good welcoming
480638,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, It was a little difficult at first to find how to drive to the hotel following a GPS but I called the staff at the front desk and he helped me figure it out , Impeccably clean spacious and comfortable rooms with giant windows to the balcony The bathroom was so spacious and also really well designed Everything was so clean and comfortable to stay at and the entire hotel had such a great feeling to it Also the parking is great at this hotel which after a week of needing to find parking all the time was just such a relief and much appreciated The staff here is also really helpful Sometimes you need a perfect classic hotel and this definitely had that One of my favorite hotels I will definitely choose to come back here to enjoy a stay in Milan Oh it s also right next to Villa San Giovanni metropolitana so you can just take the red line into the city with complete ease 
480639,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Neighbourhood is a little run down and questionable at night from a personal safety point of view Breakfast was OK but non sugary cereals were in short supply and the two coffee machines were not always working so there was a longish wait for a simple cup of coffee , I was at the hotel for a conference on Thursday Friday and extended my stay to see Milan Location is close to the Metro with good connections to centre of Milan Fitness room had equipment that worked which is not always the case AC that worked WiFi 
480640,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Was charged for parking as it was to be secure parking undercover however there was no boomgates so anyone could have parked there We could have parked around the building for free ,No Positive
480641,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The toilet flush had to be fixed no green tea for 3 days at breakfast one of the 2 hot drinks machines in the breakfast room was out of order for my entire 5 day stay not even 1 bottle of water in the room everything has to be purchased from a little self service shop on the ground floor one lift was not marked out of order so people got blocked inside , The bed is super comfortable the staff is pleasant but not competent probably for lack of training the gym on the top floor with a view is definitely a plus 
480642,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The room and bathroom smelt of damp There was a kettle in the room but no tea coffe and no water , it was a nice room but the smell of damp was unbearable
480643,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, No slippers, Hotel location is not in the city center however its couple of minutes away from metro and takes 15 20 mins to reach the center Staff was also helpful Free onsite parking
480644,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The room smelt a little like a rag but I didn t date to claim Because I had bad experiences claiming to Italian peoples , It is a very efficient hotel if you are traveling by car because they offer free parking and the parking is very ok Then it solves you life in Milan because you can go to the center of the city by metro that is like 1 minute walk 
480645,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, For us the only negative was the location Facility was super but one had to walk through a somewhat industrial sketchy area to get there from the Metro which by the way was super convenient ,No Positive
480646,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Some rooms have a shower bathtub combination which for elders is difficult to handle Ask for a shower only bathroom Processing check in check out at the counter can be time consuming if only one employee is at hand Breakfast is overpriced There is a bakery with a few tables with modest prices near by at Viale Monza , I like the modern design of the hotel Rooms are nice Good value for money Reaching the city center by metro is easy Approx 20 minutes to the Milan Cathedral In general staff is friendly and helpful 
480647,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, When we arrived in Milan the taxi s were on strike We called the hotel to see if their was a shuttle that could pick us up We were told no We could have figured out the public transportation but we were a bit nervous having never traveled to Europe before We saw it was a few miles and thought we would just walk Took us about two hours hauling our luggage in the rain Stopped along with way for a bite and had great service even though we looked quite weathered , Loved the fact that they had a laundry machine on the property to use Kind of funny that the staff threw their items in with mine No harm done just a bit surprised to find aprons and hats Excellent spaghetti and bar service My husband ended up ordering three bowls of it 
480648,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Hotel should invest into softclose doors The lack of soundproof and lack of softclose woke me up several times a night thinking that someone just entered my room the closing of other rooms doors were heard so well That is the main reason why I will not stay in this hotel again I d like to sleep in peace and feel secure while doing it Also sercvice in reception could be improved If you want was the response when I asked whether I can settle the bill in the evening before leaving It was right decesion as when I left 04 00A M next morning there wasn t anyone at the reception other quests waited to check out and I was already in a hurry The cleaning lady never refilled inroom coffee facility only tea was available after first day On third day I called reception to ask them to provide more coffee which they then did but it would have been nice to arrive from the tireing day in the city to my room and make coffee right away without extra effort , Location near metro M1 General standard of the hotel Bathroom is nice and big Silky bedsheets comfortable pillows Free good quality wifi 
480649,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, room service did not keep milk in room we always had to call for milk for tea At one point we were even told there was no milk for days , Everything seemed alright 
480650,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Overall great breakfast with a lot of choice Omelette too runny boiled eggs not very fresh orange juice not natural , Great location great hotel good services staff always helpful 
480651,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Very thin walls you can hear everything Small rooms Tv didn t work Breakfast could be better , Nice and comfy bed Very clean hotel Close to the Metro station 
480652,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, A lot of calcar in bath room for Hilton you espect more first night was very cold so we could not sleap for this bed kingsize but its actualy two beds wich separate fast my girlfrend wich is pregnant had big difficulty , Perdonal wich try at least help a litle

480654,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North,No Negative, I like everything it was very good location friendly stuf number was very good clean and comfortable free wi fi free parking in the years
480655,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, A bit far from city center but I knew that Restaurant claims they are not allowed to serve tap water I believe them but its a JOKE if the tap water is safe in the room to drink and brush one s teeth why does the restaurant refuse to give some water for customers at 5 EUROS for a large bottle Italians may be used to it but that is just sad Really sad OR when you offer a bottle of water inform the guest at the table the cost and just watch the reaction , In the room everything was very comfortable including the bed shower pressure relaxation space and tv channels several of them It was rather easy getting from the subway to downtown or where ever I wanted to go 
480656,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The breakfast didn t have a lot of options not even Italian The staff could be more friendly , Beautiful quite new comfortable room 20 minutes distance by metro from the center Very convenient location and price 
480657,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Very unclear for which parking spaces you actually have to pay for Very few anemities i e no toothbrush , Very good clean Business Hotel Subway just around the corner Some good Restaurants near 
480658,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The cleaning in the bathroom There was dried on excrement on the toilet seat which thankfully I checked before my four year old sat on it a long hair inside the toilet The check in staff were very apologetic about it offered to send cleaning up but luckily I had A LOT of disinfecting wipes to sort it out as my 4 year old could not wait That was very disappointing in what was a lovely hotel , Easy great property We had a junior suite which was perfect for our family of four Well priced Great staff Great breakfast Beautifully appointed rooms 
480659,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Suburb location is at least mediocre in my opinion and a bit remote from the center Parking in underground parking costs 8 day if you do not find a parking in the free zone space very probable although i was lucky City tax in Milan is 5 night per person This cost is not included in booking price It is however clearly stated in booking com terms that this tax is not included in final quote and I think it applies to all hotels in Milan but pay attention when calculating the overall costs , Good Size Room Booking with King Size Bed Good Lighting in Room Clean Spacious Bathroom Boiler in Room for tea etc 2 minutes walk from metro station with direct line to Duomo 10 stops Booking com photos are 100 accurate hotels seems brand new Fast Free Wi Fi Parking Spots for free in the premises few in number Free 24hr Gym Nice looking Restaurant and Bar although empty during my stay Beautifull Lobby with Internet Corner Pc and Printer in case you forgot to print your flight check in for example Excellent value for money overall will definitely book again when in Milan
480660,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Our room was dirty Grounds especially bathroom and in the corners Unexeptable Our room was very cold and the heating system had no power to heat up our room The noise that came from this heating system was so loud that none of us could nt get any sleep And 12 per breakfast is too much I think Not worthy We got 1hour before closing and many things missing and when we asked is there any more to come they said noo sorry 1 hour before closing , Bathroom amentities were great 
480661,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The staff was rude We paid for breakfast when we checked in and it did not register in the system so when we went for breakfast a very unhelpful lady at the entrance of the restaurant would not let us in nor fix the problem This happened the second morning again We had to go to the front desk and complain and since they couldn t fix the issue they charged us twice All this trouble for quite an average breakfast that did not even offer proper coffee The hotel is very clean but the towels have a strong sour quemical smell , The hotel was clean and close to the metro station 
480662,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Some Asian staff in the reception are not really qualified to meet a customer, Great Italian Albania staff very fast check in check out very clean new hotel Fast arranging for transportation
480663,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, We was very tired and we was curing Bags and the first time we come to the Hilton I was choked open check in 00 service and no assistance recommended even no recite was given with the deposit we asked for Landry no assist they told me only morning I am front office assist Manger at Four Seasons Hotel really it was bad experience By the way I moved my boos from the Hilton , Nothing First impression was very bad 
480664,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Given the category of the hotel and the its rates the breakfast was the worst we could possibly have No variety and no quality in the products provided ,No Positive
480665,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Service was way below my expectation I originally planned to stay there only a night then I changed my plan to stay in Milan for 2 nights that I made another reservation I clearly informed the clerk who checked me in that I made two separate reservations then she gave me the key which works only for a night Next day I had troubles getting to my room without knowing this system I asked her how she didn t inform and that I was had trouble she just said that s how system goes and she just forgot to tell me same lady I asked for the direction to get in center of Milan without any consideration for someone who isn t so familiar with the area she said just go out side and turn left Asked her where I could park or if I am required to do anything to prove I m guest to park here she answered park anywhere NOT HELPFUL AT ALL or no intention to help The location was alright little distant from city center but if you are travling by car then I guess it s okay location Overall it was just alright experience nothing too shame or nothing to stand out Facility was up for 4 star hotel but I would give 2 start hotel for service mind , Facility itself was fine Something you can expect for Hilton Bed was comfortable room was in reasonable size for the price 
480666,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, verything is super , Perfect hotel Room cleanliness service breakfast service everything is great I m already regular customer of this hotel I congratulate the owners and managers of the hotel 
480667,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Noisy installation work during my stay Mini fridge in the room contained nothing not even water and it was tooo noisy as well , 1 min walk from the metro station Good value for money
480668,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Booked a double single bedded room Inserted 2 guests names But just by forgetting to click the number of guest even though I stated BOTH names Was still charged extra even though I inserted both guests name, Nothing particularly much I like Just a cleaner hotel
480669,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Very pure breakfast It s a big minus for us Another disappointment is a only one washing machine Ill tried to wash 3 times at evening different days but every time some one I mean stuff wash a tablecloth or something else I thought that this washing machine on a 1 floor is only for guests No welcome water in the room Common guys you are Hilton or not No bathrobe , New hotel Good stuff Good location I mean not so far from center Milano by the metro 
480670,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, breakfast coffee was cold and expected some different varieties of ham being in milan but just basic ham and cheese, room clean and comfortable nice shower helpful at the desk and in the bar
480671,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, It was our bad luck that There was a alarm rang at late midnight because of fault with the fire alarm , clean near to metro has a garage well furnitured 
480672,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, similar to 3 stars hotels as no laundry service all the time just a self service available and even we have to by the water bottle about 20 minutes to Duomo by metro, The price was lower compare to many other hotels Also I liked the breakfast 
480673,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, I reserved a room with double bed unfortunately they put two twin beds together as if they are one bed Indeed it was not comfortable because there was a gap in the middle , reasonable price close location to the train station and super clean
480674,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Breakfast 15 Euro per person Staff did not escort baggage to room or provided room overview Location of hotel is located in a dilapidated area but good metro access to town , Gym facilities excellent Clean and modern room that looked brand new Pavilion pantry on ground floor provided excellent price for ready made meals Bed very comfy and towels very fluffy 
480675,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Only one thing the products at the breakfast buffet where on the cheap side The juices for example were just super artificial , Excellent lication Milano Nord Great Value for Money spacy and quiet rooms free parking Metro M1 to Duomo just in front of the Hotel 
480676,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The location is very close to the Metro but there is no restaurants nearby except for the one in the hotel itself They have recommended a restaurant that picks up and bring you back to the hotel which is OK , The hotel is really new All the amenities are new and in good condition The staff are super helpful I lost my luggage and the front desk staff went beyond their duties to help me especially Flabio Gabrielle and Slfondo They called the airlines several times to check on my lost luggage The nite housekeeping guy Karim helped me so much with my laundry I will surely recommend your hotel to my friends and if I will to return to Milan I will stay in your hotel again I have very happy and satisfied with your services It s top notch 
480677,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North,No Negative, The staff were lovely and attentive Rooms were great value for money with comfy beds and gorgeous bathrooms Great that there is a computer room to allow guests to print out boarding passes 
480678,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, I have booked taxi service on the date I arrived at the hotel at the front desk and the lady told me everything was set But when I was about to leave the hotel other staff told me they don t have my reservation I complained about it and front desk told me they really couldn t find my reservation so I asked they to book another taxi service for me I really hope all staffs can do their jobs and communicate to each other so they won t miss customer s demand , The location was excellent just beside the Metro station 
480679,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Although the hotel is new some items in the room especially in the shower already started degrading There are issues with parking if you arrive late in the evening The district where the hotel is located has no restaurants or cafes working in the evening , Located conveniently for people travelling to Milano by car 3 min from a metro station The rooms are comfortable and quite clean 
480680,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North,No Negative, Breakfast was good The scrambled eggs hot and delicious great selection of bread The shower and of course the beds was so surprisingly comfortable Location less than 3 Mins from metro which runs as often and very much on time Highly recommend 
480681,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Few restaurants around but one very good and a nice place for cheap breakfast nearby The breakfast at the hotel was ridicously expensive , Comfortable including the bed well equiped easy access by car with safe parking large and clean room 20 minutes to the centre by metro 
480682,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Unfortunately I have very negative experiences from my stay at Hilton Garden Inn North Milan The first thing I faced was that although the policy of the hotel on it s booking page states that they won t charge any deposit the hotel will do a pre authorization As I asked this is their right to do by the law which would be fine if they would inform the customer in advance about it like all the other hotels did where I booked a room at booking com The pre authorization turned out to be the full price of our stay My card was not charged but the amount was blocked Meaning that this amount was not available for me for the next 4 weeks which I find unacceptable as when we checked out I had to pay the whole amount from my card Basically for a month I payed the double price until the block was released The hotel employees are very nice but speak only a very little English at least those to whom we talked The air conditioning in the room was extremely loud It was impossible to sleep when it was turned on what made our nights very uncomfortable Parking in front of the hotel is free but if you want to park there be prepared to never move once you manage to find a place as only a very limited amount of parking slots is available there I guess it s an Italian thing but you only receive one huge blanket for the bed I asked for a second one but it wasn t covered in anything and had some stains on it , The room was simple but okay The location of the hotel is near to a metro station that goes directly to the Duomo So great place for tourists They reacted in a timely manner for my emails 
480683,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Very confusing with breakfast payment if you booked for breakfast the night before it was 12 euros if paid at breakfast it was 15 euros We booked the night before but the breakfast staff insisted that we didn t After a lot of disagreement We got the feeling that there thought we were not going to pay we stayed for three nights but never had breakfast again After that a man on reception was very hostile towards us Parking very expensive , The bed was very comfortable room was lovely we were going to the Gran prix so very convenient to get to the track
480684,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Leaving , Friendly helpful staff easy parking room spacious and comfortable breakfast very good everything just right Within easy reach for milan Ask about mamma lina s Brilliant 
480685,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Breakfast was not included in the room and was offered for 15 euro per person on arrival which is quite steep , Room was good nice decor and very modern We only stayed for one night but we were comfortable The bar downstairs was nice and had a good choice of games to play Would like to have stayed longer 
480686,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Out of the centre but perfect link with metro and no parking hassles , Great clean modern well run hotel Metro 100m away into the Duomo Great air con for summer 
480687,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The towels smelt a bit as if there were no fabric softener used it smelled a bit acidic and the small bottles of soap for a room with 2 people we went to the market and bought our own , the breakfast was great
480688,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, in 3rd floor s corridor there was really bad smell bcuz of carpet , They have parking area in front of the hotel as free For the price its really good hotel and comfortable Staff was nice and smiling
480689,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The room had probably very thin walls so every time somebody was opening door of a room nearby it was so loud that we weren t sure whether we have an uninvited visitor or not it was very intimidating One night there also was a false alarm but we couldn t hear the instruction because they were played at the same time the alarm was ringing so we couldn t hear anything and we were pretty scared We learned it was false only after some people from our floor went to ask the receptionist downstairs, awesome and comfortable bed great bathroom and nice smelling toiletteries perfect bar service
480690,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Breakfast was a huge disappointment If you re into sweet breakfast you re probably fine fresh waffles The area around the hotel seems run down and shady , The bed was very comfortable with a good mattress Everything is quite new Staff members were friendly and helpful Although a bit outside of the inner city the place is easy to reach by bus or metro 
480691,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, No bathrobes kettle and iron We asked to bring an iron to the room but there is none in the whole hotel only laundry service , Concierge guys were very nice and helpfull The manager of the Circle restaurant has never smiled and doesn t seems that professional Housekeeping and reception team did a good job 
480692,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North,No Negative, This is the best hotel I have ever been Everything was perfect Very close to the metro station and only 10 min from the Duomo I have never seen such a great bed and pilow so I slept like a baby 
480693,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Scramble eggs in the breakfast are not well cooked, Room is clean and comfortable the breakfast is ok it is 5 minutes walking from the metro and I loved the view of the gym 
480694,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Nothing really , Great choice at breakfast comfortable bed excellent shower A C was welcome as it was very hot during our stay easy access to metro which has you in the centre in 15 minutes free covered parking was also a welcome bonus Nice Sushi restaurant 2 minutes walk away 
480695,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, There were some minor flaws and damaged areas in our room But that would have been no great deal if the employees whom I told this at the reception reacted in a professional manner They didn t notice and didn t want to hear anything about that No Sorry Sir only Aha ok And the rest was silence That is highly unprofessional and I never would have expected to be treated like this in an international Hotel I missed the service aproach of Hilton group If people at the reception would have been more responsive to my complaints Everything would be Ok , Nice big rooms Metro station is just across the street and you only need 15 20Min to the City Center 
480696,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North,No Negative, Comfortable well designed and clean rooms The breakfast was really good with a big variety of products Good wifi metro station just around the corner 
480697,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The location is very quite but the hotel is close to the subway to go the the busy and cool city center , Courtesy of the staff and willingness to solve my problems I asked for a late checkout and I receive it without charge and later on I used the restaurant and it was good 
480698,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, reakfast is not included in the price shown and quite expensive 12 or 15 euros if chosen on the spot day person But there is a cheap pizzeria near the metro station so no problem , New build hotel near metro station real value for money if no extras chosen 
480699,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The staff is not competent at least the guy who talked to us Told us to leave the car in the garage and then said it costs more than we already paid ,No Positive
480700,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Due to the luxurious nature of the hotel the city tax is very high i e 5 per person per night and should be explicitly mentioned in the description of the hotel so that guests can take it into account during the booking as well The quantity of shower gel and other commodities should be appropriate to the number of people which was not in our case Should this be the case just ask at the reception and you will be kindly given required quality of shower gel or shampoo , The hotel is very well connected with the city center in fact it is just 10 minutes from the Piazza Duomo with the metro The hotel is brand new and thus the rooms are clean and well furnished 
480701,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, No minibar not even a bottle of water And no glasses in room to drink from All channels on tv only in Italian Foreign movies dubbed so no entertainment And stay away from restaurant Surprisingly poor quality , Ok hotel located a bit offside but no worry about that Quiet neighbourhood and there are some restaurants and shops nearby Enough for a couple of days Room is clean and bed ok
480702,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Housekeeping was not very good They took the cups and instead of cleaning or putting new ones they took away since we wanted the new ones Same for the bathroom amenities they put very few or none Breakfast can be richer , First of all value for the money and the check in process was very good Free wifi and the comfort of the bed was nice 
480703,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The problem I faced in this hotel that they charged me twice through my debt arm card On arrival the rent was withdrawn and on departure the took the money again Despite I explained to them that the among already being taken and I I have to make international call to my country to make sure that the money was withdrawn but the reception people insisted on their view and refused to return my money back,No Positive

480719,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, the location was a bit far out for the nightlife South of the city centre at Navigli Tho near San Giovani metro it was a lot of stops from the good stuff and there was little of use nearby for tourists The hotel was nice enough and modern but the gym was ill equipped and there could have been a pool The cleaner came everyday but failed to ever replenish the tea coffee materials or the shower gel Also there was no sink hand soap When we arrived there was only one small 50ml shower gel in the bathroom for two adults in a kingside room I also rang down to reception for an iron when we arrived as there was no trouser press or iron in the room I was told I must use the laundry room on the 1st floor which meant when I needed to press clothes I had to go down 3 floors in the lift with clothes Also there were no general use stairs only lifts and fire stairwells , The reception staff were well presented friendly and helpful The king size bed was comfy and the bathroom was large and the shower was double sized

480726,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Location wasn t what I expected after reading reviews Directions to get there from train station were unclear so grabbed a taxi which ended up being more expensive than planned Location to subway was good for trips to city center but once at hotel pretty much limited to their restuarant which was again pretty pricey, Newness of the facilities Very modernistic 
480727,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, They did not clean our room while we were out In the morning we put do not disturb sign on the door however by the time we left the hotel before noon we removed it When we came back to the hotel we were surprised that the room was not clean We asked why to the front desk they answered if we put do not disturb sign even early morning the cleaning lady will not clean That is not right We were so disappointed Also wifi is super slow You have to pay extra money to have high speed , Room is nice and contemporary Bed was super comfortable

480729,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Some people may not like that breakfast is a little bit expensive but trust me it worth it It has so many different choices to eat so the breakfast kept me energized also during lunchtime So 12 euros for a rich brunch is fine , If you you re having holidays in Milan THIS IS THE HOTEL YOU MUST CHOOSE So luxurious hotel Clean beautiful and quiet rooms And right next to the metro station I t didn t bother me that is was far from town center 
480730,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Reception staff mostly and difficult location , Breakfast good restaurant staff friendly Room was clean bathroom good and bed comfortable The main problem is front of house staff and location Advertised as convenient for Teatro Arcimboldi not so but disinterested and unfriendly reception staff does not add to ones impression of this hotel Basic budget hotel off the beaten track with little atmosphere no desire to return Not what I expected of a Hilton

480740,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Upon selecting the hotel I read the reviews on Trip Advisor The most common review about the front desk service was lackluster however because everything else was rated good I decided to give it a try Well the reviews were dead on The front desk service was not bad it was just not memorable Hilton is known for outstanding all around service and services it is part of their brand This property does not have spa facilities or workout facility , The Hotel was spotless The location was outside of the city center however a block away is the M train line that connects you directly to the Duomo and other connecting lines The price was a great deal for what the hotel offers 
480741,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, When you book a Hilton Hotel for shure you are not expecting a verry small room with a empty minibar with no bathroom spippers only one set of bathroom products for 2 people and only with one person at the reception For sure far away from wath a Hilton should provide Far away from city , Tha bathroom and the bed are ok 
480742,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North,No Negative, Extremely clean room and cleaned to perfection every day very kind staff very comfortable bed and pillows location was very good relative to the subway station and with that you get everywhere in the city nearby supermarket in case you need stuff underground parking lot and parking space in the hotel open yard Even though the hotel blocked the amount of money necessary for our stay from our card the entire sum was returned back into my account after a while so don t worry about that 
480743,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, Bigger hotels tend to always exclude smth from the regular package you usually get from any other hotels even b bs and then ask for extra money This one did not have breakfast included which was not a problem but why would you not add it from the very beginning To make the price look less Stupid moves for a great chain Plus the breakfast for 12 euros per person had little difference from smaller hotels Finally what ruined it for me the hot water was barely warm cannot understand how thats possible in a hilton hotel Was a disappointment for me this time sorry , Good quality free parking 
480744,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, The hotel is in the very bad location rooms are very very small you can barely walk in the room the lifts are scary they seem like they r falling apart and the staff is very disapointing if you ask a question at the reception they will look you with the face Really and ignore you and somehow make you feel very bad that you asked them in the first place just rude the parking outside is very confusing undergorund parking is only 30 in use of the Hotel the other 70 is used by some companies 100 of the time is unusable i dont recommend this hotel, The Hotel is brand new

480807,Hilton Garden Inn Milan North, In between my room and the next room there was a kind of corridor or exactly it can be described as two door can be locked from each room to separate the rooms and it can be opened to access both rooms or to join them together Unfortunately while I was relaxing in my room at night some one tried to access my room through the doors in between the rooms and when I went to check it out it was one of the hotel staff trying to enter my room through the other room I spoke with the reception she was trying to cover up and she give me a silly reason In the morning I spoke to some one else in the reception he give me another reason that the bill boy was cleaning the other room as it was vacant Cleaning the room at 09 30 pm and by the bill boy ,No Positive
