242324,Hotel Cavendish, The bed was slightly hard for my tastes but I could still sleep on it The breakfast room is quite compact and there was people having to wait for tables at some times on the morning , The hotel is placed excellently as it is surrounded by 3 tube stations on different lines and is easily in walking distance of The British Museum and not far from Leicester Square either if you don t mind a stroll We even walked to King s Cross Station from the hotel The staff were really helpful and allowed us to leave our luggage in reception the day we arrived whilst we went exploring the city and offered to hold our luggage on the day we left as well Breakfast was pleasant and the staff were happy to assist Our room was situated at the back of the property and so there was little noise considering the road the hotel is on Overall a pleasant stay and I would recommend it to others who are going to London and want a central but budget friendly hotel 
242325,Hotel Cavendish, This property was not up to any standards Pillows were so old and should have been replaced long ago The tap on the bathroom sink barely ran water The room was supposed to be for three people and there was literally no room for luggage We had to open one case at a time as there was no room for us to manage all three pieces of luggage The chair opened up to a bed which was so uncomfortable that my grandson had the worst sleeps in the 21 days we were travelling When I went to pay I was told that my credit card had already been charged No where in the eight hotels I had booked for our trip did the hotel charge my credit card without telling me I would not recommend this hotel , This property was not up to any standards I did not like anything in this hotel 
242326,Hotel Cavendish, The room was the tiniest I have ever seen If fitted a comfortable bed barely That s it this is an accurate description of the room , The staff was extremely helpful and accommodating to my requests Excellent 
242327,Hotel Cavendish, The windows didn t close properly and the room wasn t thoroughly clean rubbish was left under the beds Breakfast was ok but basic , The staff were friendly and in a good location Despite being in the town centre it was relatively quiet in the room we were on the top floor 
242328,Hotel Cavendish, Room was in basement accessed through breakfast room next to kitchen so very noisy View from window was of small dirty broken courtyard pillows so flat may as well not had one Whole place needs an upgrade basement room should be sold as such at reduced rate Luckly only staying one night, Location
242329,Hotel Cavendish, Booked this room for just myself single room and it was ridiculously small There are no photos of the single rooms so I didn t know what I was getting into Very overpriced for what I got 100 contemplated moving hotel however no point in wasting all that money Pretty disappointed but oh well , Location Staff were very friendly Room was kept tidy 
242330,Hotel Cavendish, Very old building staff not having a clue about how to serve customers carpet cleanliness was apalling Doors furnitures bathroom were properly dirty The reception desk staff was robotic and made us unconfortable at the check in They are not interested in give a good impression to customers because the location is central and they can trap a lot of tourists The quality of the breakfast was poor and the table wasn t even completed with pots and cutleries Members of staff in the breakfast room were rude and not helping Outside of the window of the breakfast room there was a gas station with NO SMOKING sign and a builder contractor was smoking at no more than a meter away Also the smell of smoking was coming inside the breakfast room I wouldn t recommend this place to anyone at 115 per night for a triple room The night before a good size rat was calmly scouting the area outside the window , Very central
242331,Hotel Cavendish, It might be handy to have some umbrellas to help your clientele during rainy periods Not a deal breaker but it s a nice additional help to have An extra set of pillows would have been optimal , The bed was really comfortable 
242332,Hotel Cavendish, The room was not ready for us 3 sharing with the 2 singles with one quilt and the put up bed not made The room was very tight for 3 beds and they kept forgetting to provide a third cup for tea making and the equivalent supplies A mouse ran out from under the bed when they had separated the single beds It ran out under the door but we then had to check that it had not returned and put shoes along the gap under the door we did not bother to tell the management as were amused It may have come through the open window off the scaffolding as we were at the rear of the hotel and there was work being done to the old building , The staff were attentive and responded to our requests 
242333,Hotel Cavendish, Cooking smells and noise at 6 30 am Filthy window ledge and scaffold outside my ground level room No lock on the window Safe didn t work When I asked for hangers it was suggested I buy some myself Breakfast had no healthy options I would call it a 2 hotel NOT a 3 or 4 as it rates itself , Pleasant staff at desk
242334,Hotel Cavendish, The WIFI did not work in my room at all My 16 year old son was home alone and I wanted to be sure that he d got home safely after an evening out I was unable to message him from my room so I had to get up get dressed and go down to reception three times to connect to WIFI I stayed in this hotel for two reasons location close to my meetings and the certainty of having WIFI ,No Positive
242335,Hotel Cavendish, The room was a bit dowdy The wash basin tap only had a trickle of water and the wash basin plug was inoperable breakfast facilities very basic, it was close to Euston Station and easy to get to other areas
242336,Hotel Cavendish, the room is not quite clean dust cobweb on the floor not suitable for travelers with big suitcases no lift , the room is big close to train and tube station good full English breakfast 
242337,Hotel Cavendish, The kettle and the wifi Wifi kept crashing which was very annoying The kettle in my room had some sediment that was floating in it even if I thoroughly rinsed it and so I could not make myself a cuppa , I couldn t find a better location at that price I had the cabin the smallest room I could find and I loved it I didn t need anything more I wish all the hotels had that option The breakfast was ok although I would have liked porridge and they didn t have any The staff was very friendly and helpful I already knew they didn t have a lift so I was prepared with the kind of luggage to carry with me 
242338,Hotel Cavendish, The rooms I ve stayed in are very small this isn t such as issue for me staying for 1 night but if you were staying longer it could feel a touch claustrophobic The bathroom similarly has the toilet sink and shower cubicle packed in pretty close together , It is a very central location and therefore good for tourists or if like me you go to Camden on nights out it is a fairly affordable option for staying the night instead of a long night bus or night tube journey home Facilities are also pretty good and staff are friendly 
242339,Hotel Cavendish, No A C a bit noisy dark room with view of unmaintained garden kitchen boiler exhaust Location good but expensive in comparison with other hotels that I have preferred No breakfast until 07 30 so not really aiming at business travellers ,No Positive
242340,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, It was very convenient to two tube stops grocery bookstore British Museum British Library University of London and very walkable to areas around The double room was small but comfortable for one person It could have used a deep clean around the baseboards sill and doors but otherwise was well attended to daily The reception area could use some work as it doesn t leave a good impression but in the end it was fine and the staff were very friendly and helpful I would stay there again 
242341,Hotel Cavendish, This place is the most disgusting hotel I have ever seen in my life If I could have imagined that such places exist I would never have booked a room there Booking com was not explicit about the type of room I was being offered and the price did not indicate what I was going to find on arrival What I was offered was not a room but a cupboard with a tiny bed in a niche overlooking an overgrown dirty backyard with no light and no ventilation There was no space to open my suitcase even I would not call this a room or offer it for 85 This was a disgrace on the part of both the hotel and your website I did not sleep in the room and of course there was no refund This was the first time I used booking com and I think it will be the last Very poor quality hotel no value for money and no explicit information to customers about the disgraceful state of the so called room that was on offer , Nothing 
242342,Hotel Cavendish, Just a little tired, Bed very comfortable and laundry good Breakfast good Service overall very good Location very convenient and places from Regents Park to West End all within 20 mins walk 
242343,Hotel Cavendish, Room small Bathroom even smaller and not particularly clean No air conditioning Entrance needs a revamp in fact the hotel could do with a complete revamp , Breakfast 
242344,Hotel Cavendish, There was a water pump in our bathroom room 306 In the first night in only started when we turned on the hot water Second night was 3 seconds on 2 seconds off All night Couldn t sleep all night We informed the reception desk at about 8pm and asked to fix the problem or change our room We were promised the problem will be fixed When we returned there was another guy at the reception who said he did not work there and the problem was the same After a horrible night before our checking out we asked to talk to the manager but we were told he cannot be contacted because it s Saturday We want our money back 180 pounds night Can anybody help us ,No Positive
242345,Hotel Cavendish, Overall scruffy impression of entire property room extremely noisy close to busy street and windows not at all soundproof WiFi very poor , Wonderful location friendly staff 
242346,Hotel Cavendish, Cups washed up each day they stayed dirty all week in the end I left them in breakfast Room and took two clean ones also all week I don t think the room was hovered When my key didn t work to get in room I waited 20 mins in reception no one there I phoned the number twice no one came,No Positive
242347,Hotel Cavendish, Some of the furnishings were slightly tired and older The bathroom had an odour and I wondered if it was the drains which could easily be resolved with bleach or something similar , It was clean and tidy and the room was a nice size It was quiet and the breakfast was quite nice 
242348,Hotel Cavendish, Carpet is utterly dirty so is the rest of the hotel Unprofessional stuff , Clean sheet and bed Clean bathroom Good location But do not expect more 
242349,Hotel Cavendish, Room location G4 behind reception and next to main stairs noisy Room was grubby dull miserable Curtains didn t fit rail window shutters rotting at the top falling off the wall carpet dirty shower room toilet filthy hairs and dirt Looked like the room was an afterthought Complementary toiletries consisted of 3 bars of soap nothing else Room was a double but only one cup and saucer and no glasses Overall VERY POOR would not recommend to anyone, Location of hotel chosen by us 
242350,Hotel Cavendish, Access to the room wasn t good as I had to walk up 2 flights of stairs through 3 fire doors and down 2 flights of stairs to reach it It was a ground floor room with window wide open on arrival not very safe for a lone female traveller The room was not properly cleaned after the first night bed not made only one of the two bins emptied and dirty cup left The Breakfast was ok but staff got part of order wrong on first day For the price I was disappointed, The location was handy and the staff were quite pleasant The bed was comfortable 
242351,Hotel Cavendish, Ripp off even for London Small room under the roof sold as 4 star en suite bedroom for 3 people Stinky hot and loud tiny bath cabin rusty thin sofa bed which was not even prepared dirty sock of a prior guest under the bed Dirty entrance mediocre breakfast indifferent staff Don t go ,No Positive
242352,Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is really run down The room was not cleaned for a long time I am sure and the amount of dust on the floor and in the closet was unbelievable The fruits that were served in breakfast were picked two weeks ago or so When I had breakfast not a single guest touched them I could not flush the toilets so I reported and the guy said ah yes we know that there is such a problem from time to time when the fuse goes wrong Aha you knew but you charged for the room didn t you If this was not enough at night there was no hot water for a shower Luckily I did not stay more than two days , Only the location 
242353,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, I was in a cabin room small but had everything I needed Couldn t believe how quiet it was at the back overlooking a bit wild garden Quiet within the hotel too Didn t hear anyone getting up ridiculously early which seems to be my experience in the big chain hotels I had paid 85 for a night in central London including free wifi and decent fresh breakfast Fabulous value 
242354,Hotel Cavendish, There were a few areas of the room that were untidy ie the shower finishings and a little dusty in some areas , The location was great and the hotel staff were lovely The breakfast was also nice 
242355,Hotel Cavendish, Cleaningless they forgot to clean our room Breakfast hey have a very poor breakfast on the coffe was good , Except the location everything was poor 
242356,Hotel Cavendish, This definitely not a four star hotel We stayed on campsites that were cleaner and safer than this hotel Our room was tiny and had mould all over the wall the window was broken and open to a construction structure that is holding the building from collapsing The tiles in the room bathroom were broken with gaps in the floor We felt very itchy when we were in the room and had bad allergies very dusty and dirty room Staff were incredibly rude and are mainly backpackers or recent arrivals to the UK who completely miss the point of customer service We had an instance where we required assistance in our room and staff just hang up the phone on us 3 times for simply asking whether the hotel provides shampoo and body wash After multiple calls we were informed they forgot to order any usually I ll be ok with this but not sure why they hang up in our face We had to walk through the kitchen area to get to our room which feels like an worn out tiny attic Staff were very noise because of gaps in the kitchen ceiling we could hear them speak at random hours at night very loudly They also wake up early for their shift and have random chats outside our door I m shocked that Booking com doesn t verify descriptions and hotel ratings provided and allow a hotel like this to advertise a 4 5 star rating Highly upsetting and concerning , Central location
242357,Hotel Cavendish, Frankly the single en suite room was insulting for the price charged The window would not open the cords on the pulley system had been severed and the room was only as wide as the length of a single bed There was hardly room to swing a cat in it I complained to reception about the window and was moved to another single room where the window did open but only because toilet roll was wedged beneath the window to create an opening I was put in a different room for my final second night to compensate which was a much more spacious triple room , The breakfast was served efficiently and the location of the hotel was good 
242358,Hotel Cavendish, Very dirty the carpets stinks a holiday caravan have bigger toilets and shawers very noice imposible to sleep due to the noice smell and especially the bed was horrendous the patio which you can see from the bedroom window looks like a rubbish storage I travel very often around the world for business and pleasure this hotel is by far the worst hotel ever have the misfortune to visit I will never recommend to any one my night in this hotel was a TORTURE ,No Positive
242359,Hotel Cavendish, Bed was uncomfortable tiles on bathroom floor were loose and cracked this place definitely needs refurbishing no teaspoon in room and twice had to ask for milk in room , Staff friendly
242360,Hotel Cavendish, I had trouble with the t v When I alerted staff that the remote wasn t working they didn t fix it They said they would but didn t they left the remote sitting there without any batteries I was able to get one channel by using the knobs on the t v itself but had to stand on the bed to reach them Not very satisfactory I asked staff to book me a taxi but they booked a car service which was much more expensive I didn t realize it was a car service until it showed up They did get me to confirm the price and I knew I was paying far too much but I tend not to argue or negotiate I feel vulnerable when I have to catch a plane and need transportation to get to the airport or train station This is a small thing but I was in Paris prior to going to London and I was able to get ice from the staff in reception at two different hotels Ice at Hotel Cavendish was definitely not to be had It s very North American of me to want ice but there you go I do , The location is great it s an easy walk to both the Goodge and Warren tube stations I have no comment on the breakfast as I only had toast My room a single was extremely small but that s a warning more than a criticism It s not uncommon for British hotels to have very small rooms 
242361,Hotel Cavendish, The bathroom was very smelly No smoke detector Could do with a redecorate On check in and check out no staff in reception , We liked the location to central London 
242362,Hotel Cavendish, Unfortunately the weather was a little poor within our stay but there is not a lot that can be done about that , I visited the Cavendish with my wife last weekend we had a wonderful stay We where greeted by Omar who was very friendly and was always at hand to help and make our stay happy and relaxing and telling us the best places to go locally At breakfast the staff was ensuring we was well fed and comfortable and served a lovely English breakfast although there is a lovely choice if you prefer a choice The hotel is well placed and only a short walk from Euston Station It is within reach of all of London s famous areas to visit within a 20 minute walk or a short walk to an underground station We both found the hotel a comfortable place to stay and it was the the staff made it that way always asking are the rooms ok and comfortable I would recommend this place to stay in London it is ideal for weekend breaks Thank you Omar and the staff you do a great job at making sure our stay was a lovely one regards Ian
242363,Hotel Cavendish, Rooms The hotel is very small so they had to use up every space possible Our first night they put us at the LG1 bigger room but it was right next to the kitchen it was loud by 5am The bed was extremely firm The next day they moved us to a bigger room than what we would ve gotten originally G1 which was a lot quieter away from the kitchen n the streets But the bed was very small little bit smaller than double but better firm wise than the LG1 It worked out great for us because I like to snuggle to my husband anyway Our neighbors was loud in leaving in the morning slamming their door The rooms have no A C so we had to keep our windows open to let the cool air come in Fortunately enough the air does get cool enough at night but I can t imagine during the hot summer The window at our G1 room can t stay open on the bottom had to put a kettle to hold it open Stairs no elevator Our first night we stayed at LG that was only one floor down When we got moved to G floor supposedly the same floor as the reception room but you have to go down one floor go through the breakfast room n up one floor to get to our G room , Breakfast The breakfast was very good Full English breakfast eggs at our own likings beans bacon sausage tomato coffee tea toasts jams There s also options for cereals n some fruits n juices Location The location was very good Close distance to all the major tube stations Warren St Station Euston Sq Station and Euston Railway St It s also about 15min walk to this one intersection where there s a lot of good food we ate at Kanada Ya Ramen Bar highly recommended if you like asian noodle soup It s about 10 15min walk from British Museum The bus stop across the street also goes to Trafalgar Sq which we took to get amazing deal on the Lion King Show Staffs The staff made were nice we arrived around 10pm he saw that I was pregnant so he switched us into a bigger room Rooms They clean the room everyday make bed replace towels There s also kettle n tea coffee in the room n some crackers which I believe they were complimentary 
242364,Hotel Cavendish, For brakfast to wait z15 minutes for seating The room below ground level wit bars at the window Shower nowhere you could Hold Yourself and very slippery Needs in many places to be renovated Very dangerous stairs to the room and breakfast room The price of Pound 275 for two nights by far too high Page of booking com Shows four stars should be maximum three Due to the bad information on your side it partly spoiled our holiday , good location but otherwise not recommendable 
242365,Hotel Cavendish, You pay a lot for a hostel because I can not consider that a hotel The room is very small old no really clean The waitress are not good never hello bye can I help you I am not saying that I need that they smile or be friendly but you are working with customers you have to have a different attitude They don t have a room where you can keep your luggages so if you arrive before 14 00 you have to leave them in the middle of the reception I am very disappointed with Hotel Cavendish , The recepcionist are ok
242366,Hotel Cavendish, Room was a bit small and could use some updated painting lampshades etc , Staff were helpful The hotel has all the basics that are needed It is a bit worn looking so if you need updated this may not be for you The English Breakfast was wonderful eggs to order Location was convenient to British Museum and other attractions all within a 20 min walk 
242367,Hotel Cavendish, The room we were located in was next door to the breakfast room and so we had early wake ups everyday as the staff were setting up and from then on until breakfast had ended The breakfast room was small and couldn t always accommodate all those that were staying as it was always busy on one day us having to wait for an hour for a table to become available The room was also located near the staff entrance from the street and so again was always fairly noisy , Location of the property was good close to transport links Room was comfortable and just what was needed for our stay 
242368,Hotel Cavendish, This was a typical budget hotel in London a little drearier and mustier in its furniture and decor than some of the other Gower Street hotels The windows wouldn t stay open so it was impossible to get fresh air and even when the temperature was pleasant outside it was sweltering and stuffy in the room The rooms are very tiny and cramped so if you need to spend any time in your room or hotel to work or attend to business this hotel is not a good choice There is no place to sit besides on the bed itself The poor water pressure was to be expected in a London hotel in this price range The breakfast is pretty standard except for the instant coffee which I found disappointing even in comparison to other hotels in this price range While the bathroom and washable bedding seemed clean the carpets and curtains and decorative pillows badly need to be freshened up I don t think they re dirty exactly but they smell musty and look very worn , The location of this property is great It s convenient to St Pancras Station the British Library the British Museum and many other delights of Bloomsbury For a short stay in which you plan to be out sightseeing all day and evening and only need a place to sleep at night the Hotel Cavendish would be a good base One advantage it has over some of the other Gower Street hotels is that the windows are double paned so that the street noise was reduced There was also a fan in the room which was useful because the room was very close and stuffy The wireless was speedier and more reliable than some other budget hotels I ve stayed in There was very little noise audible through the walls which was a relief as this is sometimes a problem in these older hotels 
242369,Hotel Cavendish, The rooms are very small which would be ok if there was a place to put the suit case under the bed for example Coffee from fresh beans was only available on certain mornings the other days it was instant coffee that was served with breakfast , Good location English breakfast which was very nice Complimentary coffee tea and cookies in the room Friendly staff Wireless Lan was excellent there are routers on every floor and it was very stable 
242370,Hotel Cavendish, The room location on the ground floor my door opened onto the back garden i was woken up in the early hours most nights by numerous situations due to room location , No croissants available at breakfast
242371,Hotel Cavendish, no problem to offer to client stinky and overheated room under the roof with some pipes problems with explanation due to weather conditions very unprofessional,No Positive
242372,Hotel Cavendish, The worst value for money I ve had in London There is no way it s worth 130 per night In terrible need of redecoration Had the smallest room I ve ever stayed in Will never stay here again Terrible , Nothing
242373,Hotel Cavendish, No lift and we were on the 3rd floor No aircon so baking hot Decor very tired and some in poor condition Bathroom smelled musty Breakfast was rubbish everything microwaved Could not use garden as overgrown , Bed comfy and clean Great location 
242374,Hotel Cavendish, It suited us just fine, Very friendly staff and the girls at breakfast worked quickly and efficiently Good sized room with big bed and comfy sofa Shower room small but good powerful shower 
242375,Hotel Cavendish, I liked nothing , Please make yourself a favor and avoid The photos on booking com has nothing to do with this hotel Old building v small rooms shower not working properly phone in the room not working it was hot in London those days And you could not open the windows very noisy street and rooms are not isolated the TV is old as well On top of that it is not cheap I booked this hotel in a rush and it was a big mistake Never again I believe a lot of hotels in London should be reported They are advertised as 3 or 4 stars and they do not deserve even a star 
242376,Hotel Cavendish, Double room was so small that we could not walk with our bags at the floor Room was dusty and breakfast was bad Very old building Photos posted do not represent reality , Located near Oxford str 
242377,Hotel Cavendish, Public liability insurance went out if date 2009 Room exceedingly small No glasses no drinking water no hairdryer Breakfast was rushed and staff were task orientated Asking us how we want our eggs cooked whilst we are still choosing cereals Breakfast was cheap ingredients and tepid Wardrobe full of dust Loose wires everywhere No one asked us if we enjoyed our stay when we checked out , Location Close yo theatre land about a 10 minute walk Choose a different hotel in this area 
242378,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast was plain just adequate Most mornings serviced instant coffee and for over 120 UK pounds per night , location was good staff reasonably helpful 
242379,Hotel Cavendish, Extra sofa bed was very uncomfortable had to sleep on top of the duvet covered with sheets No possibility for an extra duvet Tights stairs and hallways but only annoying when carrying large bags Breakfast a bit boring small portions but you could get refills PS Short breakfast time 7 30 9 30 all days , Great location room okay size Nice double bed A little out dated but great value for money Room was very quiet and nice temperature Breakfast nothing special but filling Small english breakfast with your choice of eggs Breakfast room small but we never had to wait for than two minutes Just a short walk to Oxford Street and everything London has to offer 
242380,Hotel Cavendish, It was not the cleanest hotel I had hairs in the shower but it was great they cleaned my sheets and bathroom every day I also had no bin in my room which was not the best , Free wifi
242381,Hotel Cavendish, Cobwebs on the curtains and ceiling At 8am we were told the kitchen ran out of coffee at breakfast Other guests queried if it is possible to go buy some The staff ignored any voice of inconvenience People next door smoked Staff did not bother , Horrible place Sorry and ran down Really poor experience for a 3 star as advertised
242382,Hotel Cavendish, Not a 4 hotel Room was very adequate in need of refurbishment Room very hot and noisy as next to breakfast room Bathroom poor , Fantastic area very central Good tube links Polite staff 
242383,Hotel Cavendish, The room was tiny a cabin Booking com says it s a 4 star hotel but really it only deserves 2 5 stars No drinking glass soap dish or accessible mirror in the bathroom Poor shower Wifi mediocre No fridge Saw mice in the dining room one evening Poor management , Location Nice staff 
242384,Hotel Cavendish, Bathroom was very poor with visible damages on the walls and equipment No stands for soap or shampoo no wentilation often lackin towels , Only the position of the hotel 
242385,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, Great little place to stay at a fraction of the cost of other hotels we have used in london we stayed for 2 nights and have nothing bad to say comfy bed free wifi and a good little english breakfast Very happy and helpful staff 
242386,Hotel Cavendish, Decor in hotel was tired Narrow staircase which could possibly prove difficult for older people Ceiling in bedroom obviously had problems with dampness Breakfast was disappointing Full English breakfast consisted of 1 egg 1 rasher of bacon 1 sausage baked beans and 1 small cooked tomato However there was a choice of cereals and fruit and also toast Staff pleasant , Room was spacious and clean Beds comfortable Got a kingsize and a double bed which was better than expected We thought a double bed and a single Room was for myself my daughter and my niece Shower room toilet was clean although shower curtain a bit grubby looking Clean towels each day and top up of tea coffee Would stay again as nothing was very bad All in all a pleasant stay 
242387,Hotel Cavendish, Originally booked the cabin room then upgraded via you to a single room but on arrival told I had to have the cabin no upgrade from you he said Would not tell me if there was a single room available or not Spent dreadful sleepless night right up against a draughty old window with street noise etc so asked to be upgraded the next morning even to a double room told no upgrade from you but when I presented your print out was then moved later in the day to a single room which was fine and had secondary glazing re traffic noise Their www site which boasts a refurbishment is none sense a cushion and a useless short bed cover You really should consider de listing this place What use is a wardrobe with only one coat hanger ETC ETC ETC Its a tired distressed place in much need of the refurbishment they claim to have made Would have to think twice about using your site again sorry but just not good enough all round But they did not charge me for the upgrade on the second night Breakfast was good with a hardworking staff P S TV remote did not work on the second night, Being moved to the room I booked on the second night Breakfast very good 
242388,Hotel Cavendish, Our room was in the basement so wifi connection wasn t great There were bars on the windows which could be a fire hazard Breakfast was basic , The room was comfortable for our stay Clean and modern Reception staff were friendly and helpful 
242389,Hotel Cavendish, The size of the rooms is too small the bare wooden floors not welcoming the kettle in my room didn t quite work the breakfast staff wasn t particularly friendly , The hotel was located 5 minutes away from Euston station in a quiet and peaceful area quite close to a number of different amenities The breakfast was acceptable The receptionist Patel was exceptionally helpful and friendly 
242390,Hotel Cavendish, Pathetically small room MICE not cleaned properly cracked sink poor shower noisy computer says no staff refused to refund even breakfast I wasn t going to eat there I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and this ranks as one of the worst anywhere in the world , Nothing
242391,Hotel Cavendish, I booked a cabinn The room was very very small the windows was broken and room temperature was around 12 degrees The room was so small and dark that everything seemed dirty Cracks in the sealing with discoloring around them Bathroom floor was ice cold I booked it for two days left after one with no refund of the second day but would not stay there a day more for obvious reasons So Please think twice before booking a cabinn and don t do it if the quality of the room matters to you , Breakfast was way above the low standard of the hotel 
242392,Hotel Cavendish, Nothing really The single room was very small but comfortable and ideal for what I needed There are no complaints at all , The staff were polite The breakfast excellent for the start of the day The hotel was central and reasonably priced for what we wanted Would definitely use this hotel again Hoping to go bk in November its not luxury but it is clean and comfortable 
242393,Hotel Cavendish, Mice running around in pairs towards the dinning room When the staff were informed they seemed unbothered by the news and certainly didn t leap into action No refund for the breakfast which was included in the price despite protestations that I was certainly NOT going to vie with rodents for my breakfast Three blind mice has been playing in my head since my stay I never did find the third and I m not sure if I m glad about that or not The description kept stating it was in Camden I m not sure if this is a ploy to attract tourists but this place is nowhere near Camden town unless they moved the British Museum while I wasn t looking It is central London but that s about the only thing going for it imo , I needed accommodation at very short notice and they had a room available It was described as a cabin and that is a fair description of the smallest room I ve had since a school trip ferry to Gothenburg 
242394,Hotel Cavendish, The room was the smallest I have ever slept in There was no lift The room telephone did not work It took one and a half hours and 3 requests to receive 1 drinking glass for the bathroom It was cold in the night ,No Positive
242395,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, Good freshly cooked breakfast with choice of items Perfect location for British Museum public transport including Piccadilly Line direct from Heathrow and both West End and City East End 
242396,Hotel Cavendish, unfortunately the bed was very uncomfortable the hotel is in much need of an overhaul and renovation The hall light shines into the bedrooms all through the night and the busy main road makes sleeping hard The outside noise isn t the hotels fault , The breakfast at the hotel was fine The location was great as your not far from a lot of attractions and links around London The hotel staff were very nice and extremely helpful 
242397,Hotel Cavendish, Room was cramped and sofa bed not good mold and missing tiles in bathroom and a half hour queue for toast cereals excepted so much more for the money paid, Nice area
242398,Hotel Cavendish, No noise isolation at all , Comfortable beds Friendly staff Small rooms and bathroom Not a WOW factor Close to the british museum OK breakfast 
242399,Hotel Cavendish, Room was dirty and extremly small Double bed means you can sleep with your partner only in 69 what we reported immediately after checking in they said the room will be changed to a bigger one in the morning but they didn t do it , Location was good they changed the towels everyday 
242400,Hotel Cavendish, The room size would be better described as a large cupboard with the suitcases on the floor there was literally no access to the en suite, Location was good near to Euston station Good breakfast served promptly and with a smile
242401,Hotel Cavendish, Bed was not even double size Mattress was with mountain in the middle we was sliding of it Water stains on the ceiling Shower head not fitting the handle Breakfast very poor We had view of a building site Stairs was so wonky we was afraid to step on it When my husband asks for water for the kettle he was sent to the kitchen with the finger point colect his on watter Very unpleasant experience, No bad location 
242402,Hotel Cavendish, Worst hotel I have ever been The single room was so small that I could touch the walls with my open arms No forniture whatsoever no chair closet table In three days I was there the room was never tied up or cleaned towel never changed Breakfast was pretty bad just English breakfast and cereal with cold milk, The location was quite convenient
242403,Hotel Cavendish, Water pressure from taps was very low Wifi kept dropping off Basement room could hear water pipes draining from all floors above day and night , Great location Breakfast was tasty
242404,Hotel Cavendish, With Shower head stuck up 2m high and no shower cups available it is impossible for a woman to have a shower Heating in the hotel was not working for 2 out our 4 nights,No Positive
242405,Hotel Cavendish, very uncomfortable room smallest I have ever been to Not clean the sheets were stained Room service did not clean the room Very cold the heater did not work at all Wifi was not available at all times I do not recommend Better conditions are offered in other hotels on the same street , very close to the city walking distance
242406,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, I had a tiny cabin room but the layout was great it was very clean and despite size very comfortable I thought it d be windowless but it had a window The bed is single size Great value for money The location is amazing 
242407,Hotel Cavendish, The bed is a little narrow and next to the single glazed window in 110 so I was a bit chilly A spare blanket would have solved this , My first experience of a cabin bedroom in London that actually worked Well laid out with everything you need including a decent hairdryer Reception and breakfast room staff were pleasant and helpful Good freshly cooked breakfast items A good location for my meeting and British Museum exhibition Lovely hot shower 
242408,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast room was very small Had to queue and wait for tables Service was quick but didn t have time to finish cereal before main breakfast bought out Bed linen was clean but other furnishings such as ripped net curtains need replacing Sink blocked in bathroom , The location was ideal for us The beds were comfortable 
242409,Hotel Cavendish, Asked for quiet room when booking but were given a room immediately next to breakfast room Awoken at 6am to sound of clanking pots and plates Also no milk for morning tea in room Asked receptionist for some and was told there wasn t anything available Never stayed anywhere that didn t have pots of uht milk or even coffee mate for tea coffee in room Also breakfast had no orange juice available asked waitress 3 times but kept forgetting to bring it out Will not stay here again , Bed comfortable Shower good and hot 
242410,Hotel Cavendish, There were cobwebs on the ceiling and the net curtains were grey and stained with paint but apart from that the room and bathroom seemed clean Our bedroom was on the lower ground floor adjacent to the breakfast room and the window of our bedroom faced out towards the kitchen Essentially then our room was between the kitchen and the breakfast room Therefore we were woken at 5am by the sounds coming from the kitchen and breakfast room as the catering staff were preparing This was not the fault of the staff it was just due to where the room was located The stairs are winding and carpeted unevenly so climbing them felt a little unsafe , The bed and sofa were very comfortable and the location was super 
242411,Hotel Cavendish, Drafty sash windows Couldn t close bathroom door once inside due to lack of space but ok as it was a single room , Very light scrambled eggs Friendly staff Good location
242412,Hotel Cavendish, The cleaners the hotel was non existent the shower had mould and dirt all over the tiles when having a wash in the sink the water is not going down the hole and raw sewage was coming up from the pipes not nice dust and dirt all over, Bed was good
242413,Hotel Cavendish, 7 30 start to breakfast too late when working in London Room tiny Couldn t even sit on toilet as wall in front No light switch near bed Room scruffy, Breakfast good
242414,Hotel Cavendish, Though the toilet shower was clean the tiles on the floor were damaged and loose Not good to walk on barefoot They could easily be repaired but looked to have been this way for quite sometime The additional single sofa bed made the room cramped when opened Could have done with a little more thought in the layout of furniture I was tempted to move things around myself The double bed was comfortable but my daughter had difficulty sleeping on the overly hard sofa bed , The room was adequate and clean for a one night stay 
242415,Hotel Cavendish, Bathroom smelled of stale pipes, Room was nice and big for a London hotel friendly and helpful staff location was very handy for access to town centre by foot or tube 
242416,Hotel Cavendish, I had booked a cabin bedroom due to it being cheap The room was extremely small and as such felt like an in fill BUT this was what I had booked so if you want an inexpensive room clean and ensuite near major rail connections this was adequate The soundproofing from above however was poor and it was not a smart hotel , It was near my venue for the next day The bed was very comfortable The staff exceptionally pleasant and helpful Breakfast ample and good choice My room was clean and I had a good TV 
242417,Hotel Cavendish, Bed was too small room too small no chair to sit on shower leaked into bathroom floor as door didn t seal Basement room meAnt no view for the 3 days we were there, Friendly staff lovely breakfast perfect location 
242418,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast worst i have ever had they didnt understand english we came 5mins before the closure and they didnt give us breakfast Noise in the room Fire Alarm early morning woke up us and we didnt get any compensation , I liked the location and staff on the reception 
242419,Hotel Cavendish, The room was tiny I had a single bed duvet on a double bed The water pressure volume flow was very little in the bathroom sink and shower No veggie English breakfast options No pastries for breakfast , Reception desk staff were lovely polite and credit to the hotel Good location
242420,Hotel Cavendish, The whole section of the hotel we were in smelt of the bacon from breakfast permanently The ensuite had loose tiles on the floor the fan was so full of fluff it didn t work the shower was tiny We had to wait 20 minutes for a table for breakfast as there was no where near enough tables or staff , Good location
242421,Hotel Cavendish, Stale smell throughout property Very dated and tired throughout Dirty lack of cleanliness Tiny bathroom Toilet was in the way of standing at the basin Shower curtain as old as me Basin so small you couldn t fill the kettle under the taps Windows dirty and paint peeling off Lovely view of scaffolding outside the window to our room Went down for breakfast the first morning no seats available Were told we had to wait until somebody finished their breakfast before we could have ours A lady in the kitchen was plating up breakfast using her fingers Picking up sausages and bacon with her bare hands We did not have the breakfast on the sat or sun of our stay for obvious reasons When we asked to see the management we were told he only works mon fri , NOTHING
242422,Hotel Cavendish, Towels could do with being bigger and water in the room would be a good idea , good location reasonably priced The staff were friendly Breakfast was very good Really liked that if you are a coffee drinker you got a pot of coffee and not just a mug like some places Room was small but what do you expect when you book a cabin room 
242423,Hotel Cavendish, Wi fi was temperamental we just avoided it in the end and used our 4G Full English breakfast consisted of 1 bacon 1 sausage very good though 1 egg half a tomato and some beans Not quite full and not exactly hearty There was cereal and toast plenty to eat but if you are hoping for plenty of pastries or a full English you need to manage your expectations Still fabulous for the price given the location , Short walk to tube buses and boris bikes Great location though we walked from hotel to London eye and going the other way as far as Camden Market Only 35mins walk Room was a decent size considering the price and location Expected a box room but was more than comfortable size 
242424,Hotel Cavendish, Ants in the room it had a door to the garden and I can only assume they were crawling in under it , Location and small and intimate other than the ants was clean and comfortable
242425,Hotel Cavendish, Room felt very dated and a bit old The sofa bed very very uncomfortable could do with a different matteress could feel springs Bathroom had mould on celing dirty in there , The breakfast was lovely love the scrambled eggs
242426,Hotel Cavendish, See previous comment, With a little bit of upkeep of the property example whitewash of walls doors of rooms need to be looked into safe in room in wardrobe but on the floor so it is difficult to operate these little things that matter and they could easily be done Otherwise we a very good time Rooms clean staff helpful b fast good 
242427,Hotel Cavendish, Gower St can be noisy so possibly a problem if you have a room at the front of the hotel , All good room clean and comfortable I might make this my London base Close to Goodge St on Northern line 
242428,Hotel Cavendish, Outside Downstairs room looks up to pavement and out onto rotten boards and mop bucket was described double bed was 2 singles of different sizes pushed together kitchen other side of wall woken up during the night as staff had break and at 6 30 each morning room not well cleaned bed linen was clean Take care when using electrics as sockets are not in good condition , The location is perfect for attractions Underground is close Staff are very friendly and helpful 
242429,Hotel Cavendish, Fewer stairs but not a problem, Quiet house cheerful friendly staff very good breakfast very reasonable price convenient for the University and British Museum 
242430,Hotel Cavendish, The room we stayed in was a family room however the extra bed was a very uncomfortable sofa bed which when it was pulled out left NO ROOM in the bedroom the shower was less than adequate and the bathroom could do with a deep clean the towels were not changed nor beds made for the two days we stayed there Our room was in the basement which looked out onto a rather dirty back yard this room should not be used for paying guests , The breakfast was good good choice for continental if not a bit basic the cooked breakfast was fresh and very tasty 
242431,Hotel Cavendish, Dirty furnishings loose toilet seat very poor customer service the staff were terrible Breakfast room in the basement with not enough seating Would not recommend to anyone, The location close to the theatre we were visiting
242432,Hotel Cavendish, Dim light in room drab worn out decor Very very noisy thin walls such that you can hear everything going on in rooms next door and in the corridor Stains on walls and carpets cleaning standards dubious Very small room All in all if you need somewhere to just crash for the night but can afford not to sleep very well as a result of the noise then it s ok I think if you don t have many expectations then you probably won t have any complaints but I think the hotel has been advertised as something that it isn t It s not a 3 or 4 star hotel as shown on some websites At best it s a 1 5 star guesthouse If that s made clear when advertising then it ll probably get better reviews I went in expecting something of slightly higher standard will make sure I do my research better next time , Location
242433,Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is filthy the bedding absolutely stunk of cigarette smoke The windows are broken 72 steps down then back up again to breakfast Would not recommend or return , Nothing
242434,Hotel Cavendish, This is NOT a 4 stars hotel please review your classification Wooden floor under carpet just a bit noisy No good sofa bed for third person but we found the way to sleep First time in my life I have to pay when checking in, Friendly staff very good location just a few minutes walking of the British museum good English breakfast At the end of February and no need for heating but was cold outside No traffic sounds at the back of the building WiFi Ok
242435,Hotel Cavendish, 3rd floor room no lift stairs narrow and sloppy not at all advisable to customer with luggage These information should be clear before booking Non complimetary whater available we had to ask Bathroom noisy every time you open tap or flush water a pump starts with noisy Room too small Bagage needed to be piled up Third bed not ready we asked to prepare it with some disconfort room too narrow Garbage bin not empty from previous customer I would not recomed this hotel ,No Positive
242436,Hotel Cavendish, Sofa bed was uncomfortable , It was reasonably priced in a good location Quieter than expected Clean and comfortable but not luxurious Ideal just to sleep and breakfast before more sightseeing 
242437,Hotel Cavendish, The hotel was way to hot Made sleeping very difficult also there was an old smoke smell to the room We had a triple room and the fold out bed was very uncomfortable , The hotel was very central and area was good would recommend for ease of walking around the city centre Great that there was cover on reception 24 hours 
242438,Hotel Cavendish, This was not a 4 hotel and we were put in a basement room right by the breakfast room It was therefore dark small very basic and noisy in the morning , The breakfast was ordered from us and served very quickly 
242439,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast was awful greasy undercooked and burnt How Really run down in d cor Fire alarm went off at 4 30am and no apology from staff and no visible marshalls Had to clean bathroom before use , The curtains were nice 
242440,Hotel Cavendish, The rooms looked tired but clean During the night we could hear what sounded like a washing machine or water tank filling above us for most of the night , Location to Euston station is good and breakfast selection was ok 
242441,Hotel Cavendish, The breakfast was a disappointment First morning we had to wait to get a table And in two days we never got the right things that we orderd One morning at 8 00 the beans was not ready the breakfast starts at 7 30 The other days we went out to eat our breakfast , The Staff was very friendly The room was warm and Nice The location is very good In just a few minutes you ll be in Oxford Street or the brittish museum And there is a lot of restaurants very near the hotel They let us keep the luggage in the reception our last day that was very good 
242442,Hotel Cavendish, There was a fire alarm from 5 am to 7 am on two consecutive mornings No one checked whether I was alive or dead and when I asked to speak to a manager on checking out to sort out a refund I was told to be quiet by an insensitive and unprofessional young man whilst his colleague laughed and agreed with me that he was not in a position to tell me to be quiet 4 days later I have still heard nothing from them about any recompense and I am disgusted with their customer service ,No Positive
242443,Hotel Cavendish, Our room was roasting hot You couldn t turn the radiators down and it s noisy to open the window There were hairs in the bed Linen didn t appear very clean Bathroom smelt like a sewer Tv remote didn t work , We were allowed to leave our things before checking in however this felt unsafe Not locked away or marked with our names or anything 
242444,Hotel Cavendish, Room was cold as the windows are big but single glazed bed is right next to them and radiator is small and far from bed Bathroom needed some cleaning and shower isntt good , Staff is helpful and very friendly Location is excellent Breakfast is good 
242445,Hotel Cavendish, Stayed here for 1 night away with work and moved rooms 3 times Tiny rooms unclean unhelpful staff and the much needed free Wi Fi kept cutting out Luckily only stayed 1 night couldn t wait to get out the next morning , Breakfast okay everything else very poor 
242446,Hotel Cavendish, we booked Triple room but there are a big double bed and a sofa which is uncomfortable so much so we had to sleep all togather in double bed also hotel was crazy extremly hot , hotel workers were good and helpfull location is definatelyy perfect 
242447,Hotel Cavendish, The wifi was really slow didn t work properly The room was tiny but served my overnight business stay perfectly the bed would have been too small for a tall person , The room was clean and no smell at all I really appreciated the free water bottle waiting for me Full English breakfast was included and is was very quick and lovely
242448,Hotel Cavendish, The bathroom was disgusting and smelt of damp the door squeked and the floor tiles were cracked and harbouring all sorts of I don t know what , the location and the price
242449,Hotel Cavendish, If you are travelling alone the single rooms will fall short of your expectation The rooms are very small and claustrophobic Beds are pushed up against windows with terrible drafts I had to use my clothes to seal window and a suitcase to protect myself from draft Very uncomfortable When asked to change to another room the same situation , Very friendly staff 
242450,Hotel Cavendish, Shower in cabin room tad small No soap holder Overall maybe a little updated decorating , Breakfast ready before first sip of coffee Friendly staff Clean tidy 
242451,Hotel Cavendish, The cabin room truly was a cabin room Very comfortable but very small, Bed was ridiculously comfortable and the shower was fantastic Breakfast facilities were excellent with prompt and attentive service

242454,Hotel Cavendish, The kettle didn t work properly and the tea coffee facilities lacked milk Bed was a bit hard , Good breakfast freshly cooked Staff very friendly 
242455,Hotel Cavendish, I was in a room at the front of the hotel which was a bit noisy cars from the main road but it s the heart of London so I can t say I was too surprised , Perfect location I had to travel around London for meetings in different places the perfect location of the hotel allowed me to easily commute with the tube and on foot 
242456,Hotel Cavendish, Room is very dated This is definaltly not a 4star hotel Although you simply sleep as you re out and about all day it would be nice if your room was clean and tidied I e Beds made bins emptied This does not happen , Location is superbly central and allows easy access to all attractions 
242457,Hotel Cavendish, I can t really fault anything though a cup of Earl Grey would have earned an extra point for breakfast , The hotel was warm with good Wifi close enough to Euston and close to a tube station Very good value for money 
242458,Hotel Cavendish, The late shift guys at the desk had no clue about anything Could not even show me how to operate the safe in my room as there were no instructions , There was one particular guy at the desk during the day who was very helpful and patient
242459,Hotel Cavendish, The shower has some grime in it however I could still wash , The room and the bed were really nice Had a little TV It was lovely that I could walk to Camden market or to the city centre from the hotel as you were so close I everything I managed to walk 15k when I stayed here Brilliant
242460,Hotel Cavendish, The hair in the tea cup wasn t pleasant The shower had practically no water pressure, For 75 b b can t really complain although room was little more than a cupboard Room was warm enough and generally clean The staff were friendly The breakfast was perfectly adequate 
242461,Hotel Cavendish, The cleaning in the shower room was disgusting The windows in the room are single glass so you eart the noise outside , The staff in the restaurant are really kind 
242462,Hotel Cavendish, I can t think of anything that could improve For the price you pay I think it is a very good deal, The staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was very good plenty of choices The bed was very comfy The bathroom was small but had everything you needed and was clean It was in a good area for the underground and quite a few of the tourist attractions I would definitely go and stay there again 
242463,Hotel Cavendish, I was under the impression that this was a 4 hotel as this is how it appeared on the site It is not I could have booked another hotel which would have suited us better with very little extra outlay The pictures are deceiving to say the least ,No Positive
242464,Hotel Cavendish, When we arrived and got our room it was a big chunk of hair in the shower I went to the reception and told them this and they said they would arrange it It was in the shower during out whole stay Room wasnt very clean either and we found hair basicly everywhere They could use a vacuumcleaner During our stay they only cleaned the room once Wifi really bad to Sometimes it worked and sometimes not and when it worked it was very slow ,No Positive
242465,Hotel Cavendish, It is listed as a 4 star hotel which it isn t There is no lift which isn t mention and there is noone to help drag the cases up one or two flights of stairs Bathroom facilities ridiculous room small and squashed, The staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was good 
242466,Hotel Cavendish, The double bed it was really really tiny for a couple The blanket almost cover us The small was really small The pictures don t reflect reality Bit dissapointed with the room for a 85 room I was expecting a much better quality , The breakfast it was ok 
242467,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast room not big enough to cater for all quests so had to share a table , Not a 4 Star Hotel 3 at best But a good price for a great location so would recommend as bed was comfy 
242468,Hotel Cavendish, No lift And no lactose free milk for lactose infolerant people , Very clean room Very central few mins walk from oxford street Very good for the money paid 
242469,Hotel Cavendish, Everything check out the photos , Nothing Dirty Rude staff No customer service I rate this as a one star NOT a four star Don t waste your money awful 
242470,Hotel Cavendish, Rooms a bit small and only showers no bath, Very easy travelling from kings cross and well situated close to the underground but easy to get a taxi also staff very helpful 
242471,Hotel Cavendish, Avoid front rooms due to noise on Gower street WiFi stopped working , Friendly staff Good breakfast Very clean and good bathroom for size of the room 
242472,Hotel Cavendish, It looked like there was no hot water in the shower when I arrived day time Single room was tiny I couldn t open my suitcase properly It was quite cold in the room due to the windows being badly sealed radiators were quite warm there was a lot of dust under the furniture, Reception staff was friendly Very close to UCL Kings Cross Oxford street and Covent Garden Bed was quite comfy I could leave my luggage after checking out Good that breakfast was included
242473,Hotel Cavendish, There was a water tank above our bedroom LG4 which had running water all night long It only stopped every so often as it seemed to be emptying and refilling As soon as the water was being used in the morning it stopped running the water It did keep us awake quite a bit , The room was good and comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful 
242474,Hotel Cavendish, I booked a single cabin room and what I got were two tiny closets one the bathroom one the bedroom connected by a tiny entry hall Smaller than expected but manageable However The bathroom had no heat source and direct access through the ventilation fan to the outside The radiator in the bedroom couldn t compete with the cold air coming in through the poorly sealed window Because of these things the bathroom was absolutely freezing and the bedroom was quite cold The sink in the bathroom was clogged it would fill almost completely every time I used it and then take several minutes to drain I complained about it twice to no avail although I was told the second time that the man looked at it and found a small cap from toothpaste or similar inside It continued to be a problem I gave up on complaining The bathroom walls and ceiling had visible mold and the ceiling was covered in droplets of condensation that would occasionally unexpectedly fall as little icy surprises The lamp in the bedroom though unnecessary was visibly broken There was only one outlet in the whole of the room behind the door and I had to move the table to it in order to plug in and use the kettle which was filthy when I arrived The wardrobe contained only two hangers making unpacking impossible Living out of a suitcase in such a tiny space was difficult to say the least The wifi connection was terrible or non existent throughout my stay When I asked about the poor quality of the connection it was suggested that I try connecting to the password free wifi of the hotel next door , The location was great walking distance to Goodge Street tube station under 5 minutes Russell Square tube station about 10 minutes and the heart of the theatre district 15 minutes Breakfast was nice full English breakfast available and made to order as well as a selection of cereals yogurt and fruit The room was incredibly quiet I heard no noise from the stairway other rooms or the garden 
242475,Hotel Cavendish, well the room was not very clean bed was not comfortable the room didnt have glasses for a drink one bin which was in toilet very small the tv wouldnt turn off was locked out of room cos the batteries on the door didnt work for 2 days was not worth the money wouldnt stay there again , well the hotel was close to everything 
242476,Hotel Cavendish, shower walls could do with a bit more cleaning a refridgerator in room would be an improvement , friendly staff room size for a city centre hotel of this size was larger than expected staff happy to look after bags before and after use of room 
242477,Hotel Cavendish, Absolutely terrible rooms and cleanliness is so bad Please don t be like me booking based on the picture the room space and the picture promoted is fraud please just dont book here there are elsewhere better worth for money , Nothing 
242478,Hotel Cavendish, No lift no one to pick or bring down the luggage breakfast was average toilet was small carpets were dirty, Bed was good staff and location was good
242479,Hotel Cavendish, 1 The extra bed was not very comfortable 2 The breakfast room was too small we have to wait for a table 3 Nothing in the bedroom to put our stuff on same thing on the bathroom, 1 The location is very central Oxford St British museum lots of buses to go elsewhere 2 It is possible to leave the luggages at the frontdesk on the day of departure without any fee 3 Calm bedroom we were on the 2nd floor view on the garden and warm room
242480,Hotel Cavendish, The fact that there is no lift and to find the room we had to walk like through a maze A lot of stairs and with luggages is a hessle, We booked a double room hiwever bed was a little bit bigger than songle Room very small
242481,Hotel Cavendish, Bed was terribly uncomfortable it was stated as a double but was two singles pushed together each with very saggy mattresses It felt like you were sleeping down a slope The room could also do with a refurb and a few bodges sorting out , The staff were helpful particularly on arrival Breakfasts were good and freshly cooked In terms of London prices it was fairly good vfm 
242482,Hotel Cavendish, For some reason on the second day the time of the breakfast changed without anybody letting us know Not ideal for our planning , Excellent location close to all public transport the British Museum and the shopping area Good breakfast it was good but not big 
242483,Hotel Cavendish, a bit cold in the bed due to old windows but the sheets were thick enough could be cleaner doesn t refill shampoo unless asked, great english breakfast nice hot water absolutely perfect location for sightseeing
242484,Hotel Cavendish, wifi was unacceptably bad Couldn t really use it Moved rooms but it did not help For someone here on business staying for over a week this is a major issue Would stay again if this was sorted, Great location clean rooms
242485,Hotel Cavendish, Door facing towards outside had a gap so it was quite drafty through the hole It was ground floor si the room had two doors one on the hall and the other one with the gap , Breakfast was ok 
242486,Hotel Cavendish, The room was so small like a prison cell which overlooked anunmainfained back garden The shows was dirty and the hotel decor was off poor quality The hotel smelt like stale cigarettes too, The location And the staff were friendly
242487,Hotel Cavendish, The room is not really clean i can see the dust everywhere on the floor Too much prize for that short stay and With that quality , This hotel is located in a cozy and quiet place Breakfast was just ok 
242488,Hotel Cavendish, The shower head was broken no toiletries amd had to wait for a table at breakfast, Location perfect and having paid 75 for a night it was very good value
242489,Hotel Cavendish, Room was a bit smelly and very small but we didn t really spend a lot of time in the room so wasn t a big issue , Excellent location and breakfast every morning 
242490,Hotel Cavendish, Luggage deposited was not locked away could have been taken away by anyone Breakfast is too plain and simple for such a pricey hotel Room is too small and not at all 4 star quality No aircon only one dusty fan There s really better hotels like Park Plaza Westminister offered at similar rate , If there s anything good its probably the receptionist Tough to be working in such a strenous condition and still greet people with a smile 
242491,Hotel Cavendish, The room was in need of some modernisation and was very small the hall carpets had holes in it the bathroom had mould on the tiles this was not a four star hotel moor like a cheap b b very disappointing we will not be going back , Very small 
242492,Hotel Cavendish, We were a group of 20 colleagues We had booked a few single rooms and a few double rooms but unfortunately we didn t notice that those double rooms also had double beds I noticed one week before arrival and so I immediately called the hotel The receptionist was very relaxed and told me to call back one day before arrival he would sort everything out I arrived one day before arrival of the group and headed straight to the hotel Nothing was arranged the same guy told me to check on arrival the next day When we arrived the next day it was another receptionist who wasn t informed at all I explained everything again and gave him our rooming list so he could prepare everything for when we would check in late in the evening Finally when we arrived another receptionist was not informed So I had to explain everything again for the 4th time We spent 30 minutes after a very long day to sort out all the rooms Not professional at all The breakfast was not that great either It was very dark in the room as the lights were broken I ordered scrambled eggs and had fried eggs luckily this was replaced immediately Not much bread available only toast The shower was verrry cold and then semi hot and then freezing cold again , The rooms were ok
242493,Hotel Cavendish, Drafty window, Great freshly cooked breakfast great location in central London Cabin rooms are what they say small rooms Only downside is the window is not double glazed so bit drafty ok in these warmer days 
242494,Hotel Cavendish, Very old fixed shower unit needs upgrading Two single beds to make a double very uncomfortable No rubbish bin in room No glasses provided in room , Good room size on quiet side of hotel Excellent breakfast 
242495,Hotel Cavendish, Plates were not clean enough during the breakfast Also I was staying in a small room which was fine but the only place where I could hang my jacket was the bathroom or put on the floor ,No Positive
242496,Hotel Cavendish, Dirty needs repair breakfast room was a poorly decorated greasy spoon affair with plastic table cloth , Plus point it s in London with friendly staff 
242497,Hotel Cavendish, Service at breakfast was incredibly poor Completely ignored for 10 minutes whilst other people were acknowledged and had drinks made for them We got our own tea in the end and waited to try and order breakfast Again other people who arrived after us managed to be served and order their breakfast Finally our invisibility seemed to go and we ordered our food which unfortunately was then wrong even after repeating it to two separate people One spoke better English but seemingly scrambled egg on toast is a difficult request I d recommend skipping breakfast and going somewhere with staff who know about customer service , Location was really good The man on arrival was really friendly and helpful The room was basic but comfortable It was a different man when we left who was just ok barely glanced our way Praise goes to the check in man the comfort of the bed and the location 
242498,Hotel Cavendish, Bedroom was above the breakfast area the stench of egg for the whole 3x days ruined the experience I booked the room on booking com but emailed the hotel as instructed by the front desk to request that they charge the credit card given to take my email as authorisation This was ignored and resulted in the guests paying out of their own pocket which was not my request ,No Positive
242499,Hotel Cavendish, Photos in no way relate to the quality of the room Some of the staff spoke very little English Bathroom smelt disgusting Window failed to stay open Room had a double bed shoe horned in Not worth the money paid for this room , Leaving 
242500,Hotel Cavendish, Coldest tiniest room I ve ever stayed in my life No extra blanket was given , Room was extremely cold asked for blanket and was given a bed sheet that wasn t helpful Wifi never worked in room and both rooms they did change me to an equally cold room were not properly cleaned 
242501,Hotel Cavendish, Room The tiniest room ever Could easily hear sounds from the room s upstairs Breakfast Absolutely nothing healthy for breakfast no veggies no natural yogurt no ham All products of low value and poor quality those who love Kellog s cereal will be happy though as hotel has huge selection of them Internet sometimes works sometimes not , Staff The receptionist was extremely nice and helpful Location Descent location close to underground and basically in the heart of London with many youngsters around university nearby 
242502,Hotel Cavendish, Single rooms are tiny Bathrooms are very small, Very nice staff both at the reception and in the kitchen Very good localisation in the heart of London Decent internet speed in WiFi
242503,Hotel Cavendish, The building contents are a bit shabby worn , Basic accommodation but in an excellent location Clean Staff were friendly helpful Facilities were adequate for needs on this occasion 
242504,Hotel Cavendish, Too small room the room was like a closet And untidy The carpet was full of ingrained dirt Layers of dust in the gap between the bed and the window did not want to drop anything there ,No Positive
242505,Hotel Cavendish, such a costly and apparently a 4 star hotel worst hotel I have ever stayed narrow room no facilities breakfast was also not good should not cost that much for such a service and type of rooms in this hotel will never go there photos in booking com for this hotel are really misleading , nothing
242506,Hotel Cavendish, Tired rooms and the breakfast was very small but very tasty We were in the lower ground rooms and there was loads of road noise due to no double glazing plus the actual windows rattled in the frames when anything went by Shower was little more than a trickle in one room the TVs were ancient and the remotes didn t work very well In my opinion it s a 50 room not the 125 we spent each It would have loads of potential they need to invest It was OK for a quick overnight stay but one poor nights sleep was enough for us ,No Positive
242507,Hotel Cavendish, The rooms were not safe The windows had a very unsecured lock and their is scaffolding outside I was shown three rooms before i found one that I felt safe in top floor The bathroom was very smelly they helpfully left a bottle of febreze to help with the problem , The staff were very pleasant and the hotel is nicely decorated 
242508,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast room was small and we had to wait a while for a table Hotel layout was odd confusing , Location was excellent Breakfast and staff were very good Room was spacious and warm Bed was comfortable 
242509,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, I really loved this hotel the staff were incredibly welcoming helpful and kind I had a tiny but perfectly formed room the location was amazing and breakfast was really very good All in all it was excellent value and I will be returning 
242510,Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is very dated and common areas including stairways require attention Layout of hotel made it difficult to navigate , Staff were friendly and wifi was efficient 
242511,Hotel Cavendish, Bedroom was like a single room bed was tiny Breakfast was not at 6 30 but 7 30 so we missed out altogether Staff were not interested when we questioned both , Close to Euston and UCL hospital which was the reason for our visit 
242512,Hotel Cavendish, The hotel was more of a guest house Room was small and decor a little dull tired , Good location Easy short walk to Euston Station Oxford St British Museum Covent Gardens Madamme Tussauds etc 
242513,Hotel Cavendish, TV didn t work 1st day told the engineer would come the next day Told the same again the following day 1st night the window wouldn t close And as we faced the street was noisy Second night it was closed and couldn t be opened The shower was grubby Coffee in the room was foul, The hotel was convenient for Euston The room and the bed were nice The biscuits were nice The tea was fine Good WIFI
242514,Hotel Cavendish, Incompetent porter unavailable to supply a 3 duve for the 3rd bed in a booked 3 bed room one guest had to use a sheet Also the third bed was the worst bed ever with springs sticking up your bag And finally the room was very small in the basement and next to the kitchen with the noise and smells you would expect And as we were forced to pay for two nights over weekend even we only needed one it was not because it was cheap One hotel I need not to see again , Location 
242515,Hotel Cavendish, Entrance to rooms is going into stairs then opening doors while holding the luggage needed a health and safety risk assessment single room is too small no housekeeper after 6 pm ,No Positive
242516,Hotel Cavendish, The room was not nice at all it had nothing to do with the photos the floor on the bathroom was broken there were doing constructions outside the window and it was noisy we had booked a three bed room and they gave us a room with one double bed and a couch where 3 people could hardly fit in The staff was ignorant seemed very bored with their work We thanked them in the end for the accommodation and they were too busy with their papers to say at least thank you for staying with us such a disappointment , only the location and the breakfast
242517,Hotel Cavendish, Of course the room was very tiny I couldn t afford a larger one That makes it difficult to stay for an extended period of time , Great breakfasts Location was fantastic for me 
242518,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, For 95 I expected at least a wardrobe It was detailed as a cabin room but small size not stated Got upgrade ok but others need to be aware of this in room description
242519,Hotel Cavendish, Don t think there should be a room behind reception which I found uncomfortable and had to change rooms After changing rooms the bed leaning had blood on it wasn t happy with that at all which put me off , It was in a good locations braskfast was fine 
242520,Hotel Cavendish, No cups or glasses in room although plenty of coffee and teas and biscuits No iron , Really friendly staff who gave a very warm welcome and were really helpful 
242521,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast looked like it would be good excellent range of cereals and fresh fruit It all went downhill on the cooked I was offered bacon and sausage as part of a vegetarian breakfast I opted for baked beans which were cold asked for them to be warmed up a little and got them back incinerated , Tiny room which I expected I was very impressed by the facilities in it and the layout Clean and comfortable Nice hot shower Nice welcome from reception 
242522,Hotel Cavendish, The hotel didn t provide a shower cap but I brought my own The housekeeping threw away my shower cap the first day she cleaned the room and I couldn t get my stuff back and there was no apologize or assistance on that The house keeping always forget to refill soap and toilet kits I was travelling alone and my flight back was on Sunday and I need to leave hotel early morning I had checked with the hotel reception about the tube opening hours and he said it opened from 5 am but it turned out that on Sunday the tube would open around 6 30 7 00 I need to walk to another line of tube and the time was very tight to get to the airport , Breakfast is quite nice Location is easy for getting around Some of hotel staff are nice however some are not 
242523,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, the staff were very friendly and the reception staff were so helpful with everything the room was clean and we had maid service which we weren t expecting but she had tidied all our stuff breakfast was good and plenty of choice to fill up ready for our day we will defo return 
242524,Hotel Cavendish, Very small and old room Poor facilities in the room TV hardly worked remote hardly worked also and they insisted on leaving it as is No where in the world this is s 4 stars hotel would give it 2 3 stars, location
242525,Hotel Cavendish, It was very expensive for what was at best a two star hotel The room smelt and wasn t very clean , The location was excellent the breakfast was good and the staff were very friendly 
242526,Hotel Cavendish, Traffic noise Not much choice at breakfast D cor fixtures and fittings looking rather old No soap dish in shower , Good value for money Friendly staff 
242527,Hotel Cavendish, Could maybe do with some refurbishment but considering it is in central London you get what you pay for and was of an acceptable standard for the price, Great location very central for theatre or sightseeing
242528,Hotel Cavendish, The shower could have been slightly more powerful , Room was really tidy and bright and being provided with a lot of towels was helpful Staff were quick to serve us at breakfast 
242529,Hotel Cavendish, My double bed was made up as two singles so I kept rolling over into the crack inbetween Shower has what only can be described as having mould all over the walls Not much selection for breakfast, Location was close to underground
242530,Hotel Cavendish, Hotel is in need of renovation there were cracks on the walls for example Cleaning wasn t very good No fridge Builders right outside our window Water pressure was terrible Breakfast was boring and quite small, Location was great Checking in and out worked perfectly 
242531,Hotel Cavendish, The shower sprinkler head was in bad shape so we didn t have a nice flow of water to our bath We are from Portugal where the electric sockets are different from those of U K We forgot to take a socket adapter so we ask the guys from the hotel if they could borough us some since every hotel we have been usually has this They just told us to go out and buy one not a good service Also when we got there our daughter s bed wasn t ready yet they told us it would be ready later that afternoon When we got back it wasn t ready still so we had to wait again In the end of our stay they didn t asked us about the quality of our stay they just said bye , Nice bed nice room in general Also they let us leave our bags there after checkout until it was our flight time We left our bags there for an entire afternoon after checkout 
242532,Hotel Cavendish, Never keen on hotels which are converted houses Transmission of noise between rooms Cramped public spaces Poor value given its limited facilities , Location
242533,Hotel Cavendish, for the price charging a 4 star price for 2 star at most The rooms ridiculously small everything was of the cheepest quality towels toileteries etc old furniture carpets bedding need I go on , the location
242534,Hotel Cavendish, Wifi in the basement room where I was did not work but it did elsewhere in the hotel , Nice staff Good location I have read the negative comments of others and think that many are unfair It is a reasonably priced central London hotel The room was not huge but it was clean comfortable and well furnished The breakfast was quick and tasty 
242535,Hotel Cavendish, Really bad service We have got a room in a basement without heater the man in the reception told us in the middle of the night that he doesn t have nothing to do The day after also they didn t want to listen to the problem we had and they just doesn t care about the guests It was really disappointing , Location 
242536,Hotel Cavendish, Room to small could hardly move and the shower room the walls are all marked puts you off going in the shower, At 205 00 per night I would want something a big bigger and better
242537,Hotel Cavendish, I had stated on Booking com that i was vegetarian no eggs or onion when i booked the room which was around 6 weeks ahead of the travel date despite this the cooked option i was given for breakfast was 1 cooked tomato and a small helping of baked beans , Room was adequate Location was superb for British Museum 
242538,Hotel Cavendish, WiFi is quite flakey with intermittent speed problems The bathroom was clean but absolutely tiny no room to stand anywhere In general single rooms are very small though I suppose if you just use the room to sleep in that doesn t matter so much NB no elevators so if you have heavy luggage and your room is on the 3rd floor you ll be carrying that up the stairs , The location is pretty brilliant if you have reason to be around the Bloomsbury Tottenham Court Road area also Euston King s Cross are close as is Oxford Circus Breakfast was fine if not extraordinary I haven t tried the cooked full English one though Staff were all friendly 
242539,Hotel Cavendish, No lift asked for 3 singles got a double and pull out No air conditioning far too hot On top floor and had difficulties getting up all the stairs too many flights And breakfast was in basement 5 flights of stairsback to room Breakfast small but ok,No Positive
242540,Hotel Cavendish, The original room I was put in was awful dirty and couldn t sit on the toilet because my legs were jammed against the wall Had to sit side saddle and I m not joking , Not a lot frankly
242541,Hotel Cavendish, A slightly larger cooked breakfast would be good , We were given a map of the city by the reception It saved us 20 on all the meals that we ate in the city The same off the entry to Kew gardens 
242542,Hotel Cavendish, 1 The first room offered was tiny little bigger than a broom cupboard with a shower in it Not even enough space to open my large suitcase 2 The second room offered below basement level was noisy as it was on street level and the window couldn t close so the sounds were disturbing Trying to work the window left my hands greasy with dark grime Due to the noise I had to move in the early hours of the morning 3 The 3rd room was larger and quiet room 208 I think but had a damaged carpet and water damage near on the ceiling near the window It smelt musty The bathroom ceiling was mouldy above the shower I could not sit on the toilet no leg room Had to sit sideways The telephones did not work for 2 days could not dial out No instructions in the room on how to operate the phone dialing out codes reception number etc The pillows were flat hard rendering them uncomfortable to use The light shines underneath the door at night the gap is too big and needs a strip put at the bottom of the door 4 My own fault I overslept and came 15 min late for breakfast on day 1 Staff were unfriendly and I was clearly a nuisance and inconvenience to them No offer of even a piece of toast butter or jam Overall this hotel does not deserve the appellation of 4 Stars It simple misrepresentation , There is nothing to like about this hotel except for its proximity to the British Museum 
242543,Hotel Cavendish, Waited a good 15 minutes before anyone appeared at reception A total disgrace and no apology for me having to wait I was tired and just wanted to get to my room Room full of hairs grime and pieces of food on the floor I needed a shower desperately but couldn t bring myself to go in there It was just completely grotty and they clearly don t have any standards when it comes to cleanliness I had to use my elbows to flick light switches because I couldn t bear to touch anything ,No Positive
242544,Hotel Cavendish, the ground floor room 1 was a dark room which was mainly due to a filthy net curtain and scaffolding but bed and very small bathroom was clean Bed was quite comfortable , Breakfast was limited if you didn t want a cooked breakfast no pastries 
242545,Hotel Cavendish, The wifi was awful got better reception from the free wifi across the road at Waterstones , Although on the small side the room was sufficient for my needs Can t comment on the breakfast as I did not partake 
242546,Hotel Cavendish, The room was very small I ve never been in such a small room , The location is great near Oxford Street that s why the quality price ratio is good 
242547,Hotel Cavendish, To be honest I didn t like it as soon as I walked in I wanted to turn around and walk out Not very clean dated uncomfortable bed Garden scruffy overgrown Would not stay there again , Breakfast good
242548,Hotel Cavendish, Sausages small and breakfast not substantial One tiny sausage with one piece of bacon Half a tomato and a spoonful of beans with an egg Nothing brilliant but cooked well , Quick service and staff very pleasant
242549,Hotel Cavendish, There s scaffolding outside the building which means anybody can climb up to any window but the cleaning staff insist on leaving the windows open Probably because there s no ventilation in the room and when you ask for a fan they keep telling you they ll get it to you later then they don t The throw pillow also smelled really mouldy but the regular pillows were fine , The new guy on staff started September 2016 was super friendly and really helpful 
242550,Hotel Cavendish, Our room wasn t ready when we arrived despite saying on booking com our time of arrival We left our bags in reception under chairs or in the corner which I was worried about them going missing as it was a communal area The breakfast wasn t the best Small portions and tables were not ready when we went down , The room was a good size and reception staff very friendly
242551,Hotel Cavendish, Room a bit small Fan supplied not sufficient as London temperature rose to 31degrees, excellent staff Rooms very tidy Breakfast room staff very pleasant and accomodating Hotel in good position for transport and sightseeing certainly value for money 
242552,Hotel Cavendish, Small single room bonus of queen size bed though Room over noisy street meant window kept shut this kept traffic noise out altho room v hot I, Nice staff Handy location for theatre and tube stations Good price I didn t expect the Ritz so that was ok Budget room was handy floor didn t look too clean Bathroom v cramped Ok fir solo tho 
242553,Hotel Cavendish, Definitely not a four star hotel Small rooms broken tiles in the bath room not lift so it was hard to walk the steps with a stroller Poor breakfast , Location was good 
242554,Hotel Cavendish, Member of staff when we arrived was rude and not interested in our questions the window in our room would not shut fully so we had all the noise from outside, The location was well situated for The Theatre It was near a tube stop and the breakfast was delicious
242555,Hotel Cavendish, Horrible stained mattress with no mattress cover and flat stained smelly pillows Unusable sofa bed hard springs with 2 thick mattress on top ridiculously hard , Nice breakfast
242556,Hotel Cavendish, All good bar room size but i understand given price, Location is superb but room is cramped That suited me as I needed somewhere to sleep Price is very competitive and fair
242557,Hotel Cavendish, Room next to the kitchen and dining room so woke by the noise Shower a tad cramped and in all needs an upgrade but for the money and short stay cant grumble , Excellant location right on top of Russell Sq and Tott Court Rd and tube stations with loads of pubs near by Bed was comfy and the room was spacous 
242558,Hotel Cavendish, This is not a 4 star hotel it is a 2 star guest house No tissues 1 bottle of water between 2 on request sink plug didn t seal difficult to shave old sticker on mirror window ledge outside thick with rubbish a 2 minute cleaning job breakfast had some fresh produce but all else tinned very average no assistance to get cases up tight stairs Room was very small and very hot , Staff were very obliging and the location is excellent 
242559,Hotel Cavendish, TV remote batteries were dead windows didn t seem very secure and took a long while to figure out how to close The shower would have been fine if you were six feet tall but as it was you couldn t alter the position it was right in my five foot six face and the flow was torrential washing my hair was very tricky , Tea and coffee making facilities and a complimentary bottle of water in room Safe available Iron available 
242560,Hotel Cavendish, The fact that I cannot to this day collect the invoice been over a month No email fax response totally ignored once you finish your stay, The location
242561,Hotel Cavendish, The size and layout of 1st room More a single than a double Really wasnt worth the money we spent , First room allocated was very small with small double bed pushed against wall We put up with it 1 night but asked for another room for 2nd which they gave us Breakfast was good and staff friendly 
242562,Hotel Cavendish, The room was incredibly small and to use the toilet you had to put your feet outside the toilet door It was impossible to get a wi fi connection , The location was great and staff were helpful 
242563,Hotel Cavendish, First night was a very very narrow bed for 2 in a tiny room No lift for our 2 x 20 kg suitcases Depressing place to be avoided Great need for maintenance in bathrooms , What croissants However breakfast and breakfast staff were fine 
242564,Hotel Cavendish, The cost of the room was too high for the size offered Room layout was cramped Couldn t use the toilet without hitting legs against sink Couldn t shower without bumping into sink and toilet Bathroom mirror is above toilet instead of above sink Made it hard to shave Wifi was slow to nonexistent I found myself trying to stay away from the room as much as possible to avoid the uncomfortability , Location near two underground stations Breakfast staff was nice and attentive to requests and needs Hotel staff were accommodating to the best of their ability Complementary water bottles offered each day 
242565,Hotel Cavendish, The iron was the worst one I have ever used Cracked base plate and leaked everywhere The WiFi was also intermittent , The Location was truly excellent for the price and the view out the window was so green it was easy to forget you were in the heart of London 
242566,Hotel Cavendish, the only room left was advised as being very small this was correct however was clean could have done with something to hang some clothes up though as nothing provided in room even a hanger in the small bathroom on towel rail holder or wall tv stand would have done the trick , location was great as needed overnight between Euston and Portland Place Breakfast great full English plus good choice of fruits etc Nice student I assume breakfast staff
242567,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, Nothing The hotel was awful and not what was advertised The family room was tiny and disgusting damp patches and paint peeling off walls and ceiling the furniture was falling apart and all marked As for the bathroom Well it badly needed upgrading I would seriously look at your 4 rating for this hotel because in our opinion a 2 is being generous
242568,Hotel Cavendish, Really really unstable and slow wifi No aircon A fox in the backyard were howling all night keeping us all awake and with the no aircon we couldn t close the window No supply of shower gel and shampoo tp water bottles at the room , Location Welcoming staff Good english breakfast Beds were comfy 
242569,Hotel Cavendish, Room and bed were tiny should have been a single room not sold as a double with a queen size bed jammed into it Bathroom also tiny but to be expected Had 2 terrible nights sleep due to size of bed and traffic noise , Location was brilliant
242570,Hotel Cavendish, Nothing about this overpriced parody of a hotel Overpriced neglected tired cold Tiny shower no pressure No toilette paper TV broker Bad breakfast, Nothing about this overpriced parody of a hotel Overpriced neglected tired cold Availability at the last moment But felt like the last chance saloon
242571,Hotel Cavendish, Limited choice of food for breakfast no vegetarian option for cooked breakfast room on road so being hot ideally needed windows open but couldn t with traffic noise Improvement to in room facilities better tea coffee refreshments , Good location great price and rooms were small but comfortable quick and easy check in out friendly staff Suitable for short stays would stay there again 
242572,Hotel Cavendish, Everything except the kind receptionist Of course just 7 minutes to Russel square tube , Nil Actually this hotel set me thinking why we need so much space in our rooms
242573,Hotel Cavendish, Our room was at the top of the hotel One small window The room was very warm but they gave us a fan And they had someone to take our cases to the room which we were greatful for , Great selection 
242574,Hotel Cavendish, No power cable for TV I didn t need the TV but strange how it wasn t there Was given phone number for front desk but no phone cable was provided for the phone Room had an outside door which was very strange but a big curtain over it thankfully and I presume it was secure Room could ve been cleaner lots of cracks in the walls etc , Nice bed it was made very tight though so when I pulled the duvet off almost everything came with it Bathroom was ok Short walk to Euston train station and shorter one to Euston Square underground Breakfast was more than adequate and the breakfast staff staff were lovely 
242575,Hotel Cavendish, The window in the room opened from the bottom upwards From the floor level to ceiling It was fully open when we arrived and with no safety barrier only a sheer curtain covering it this was very dangerous as you could not see the window was open we were on the 1st floor so it would have been a bad fall if someone didn t realise or tripped on the curtain there was no a c so the window was the only source of air After closing it up well down the window also dropped down from the top so I kept it open from that On return from our day trip the next day though it was fully open from the bottom again I forgot to mention it to reception but really it shouldn t need to be it s a very fundamental safety point for both adults children staying in the room , staff were pleasant and helpful we arrived early so left our bags for the day before returning to check in on day of departure we kept our bags at reception after check out whilst sight seeing again returning later in the evening to collect that was not a problem so was very appreciated room was clean tidy for 1 adult and 2 children it was small but it was adequate for our 2 night stay I would say it would have been better for just a single or couple though Breakfast was nice just the basics the girls working were friendly and attentive to guests coming into the b fast room 
242576,Hotel Cavendish, The rooms we were given the first day were extremely small however we were moved to bigger and better rooms the next day This is certainly not a four star hotel , Good breakfast central location 
242577,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast good but could have more choices The bed was good but a little small for two persons The Wi Fi should be better , The staff was very friendly The room was nice and clean Very good location with several metro stations nearby 
242578,Hotel Cavendish, The staff were not very welcoming and barley made eye contact Had to cary cases up 4 flights of stairs to top floor as there was no lift or help from staff The room itself was ok until we noticed CUM STAINS on one of the cushions Yes I m not kidding It was disgusting Breakfast room was very small and had to table share to get seated They served up a child portion of an English breakfast 1 tiny sausage 1 slice of bacon 1 egg and a teaspoon of beans Not worth waiting for Will not be staying again when visiting London , We were allowed to leave our cases in the lobby before check in and after check out Bathroom was very good in terms of function cleanliness and supplies
242579,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, A pleasant and comfortable room even though it was in the basement and on the noisy road side Convenient to be right next to the breakfast room The staff at Reception and for the two breakfasts we had in the hotel were friendly and obliging The best thing about this hotel was its location walking distance from British Museum London University buildings and 2 tube stations with an excellent branch of Waterstones just across the road 
242580,Hotel Cavendish, When we checked in the 1st night we have been allocated into a single room But we are 2 persons room 207 Can you imagine it We went to the room and it was very small We complained and the receptionist said yes we will changed you into a bigger room tomorrow room G1 When we checked out we asked the receptionist to give us discount only for the first night Because we thought that it was not fair for us to paid double room but we got a single room The person at the receptionist said NO discount We just simply want to be fair ,No Positive
242581,Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is supposed to have a 24 hour reception when we arrived at 1 30am after a late arrival of our flight there was no one on reception It was clear someone was around as the computer was on the bag was there but no one in sight We rung the phone the bell I wandered all through the hotel trying to find somebody Eventually almost half an hour later the person who was supposed to be on reception arrived coming down the stairs tucking in his shirt It was clear he must have been having a nap Given I had to get up for work at 7am I was less than thrilled Additionally the sheets on the pull out bed were very stained to the point that they looked dirty The bathroom doesn t have very good ventilation so starts to smell quite quickly The wifi works infrequently The steps to the rooms are very steep and narrow not ideal when you re carrying heavy suitcases The hotel overall is old worn and creaky , The hotel was in a great location right near both Goodge Street and Russell Square station The breakfast was good at the girls at breakfast were very helpful The rooms were made up daily 
242582,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast was too rushed cooked breakfasts were thrust into the table before any fruit or cereal had even been started , Great location approx 30 mins walk slowly from all the theatres and Trafalgar Square 5 mins walk from Goodge Street tube station 
242583,Hotel Cavendish, We got a single and a double room instead of the double and triple that we ve booked No alternative options and a plain sorry is all we got Receptionist was not in a good mood except for the moment when we left ,No Positive
242584,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, Gentleman on reception when we arrived was so helpful He rearranged rooms so that the least mobile in our party were on the ground floor he helped us with places we wanted to visit and even walked halfway doen the street to hail us a cab The rooms were lovely and a great breakfast 
242585,Hotel Cavendish, Reception lounge Reception was left unoccupied with the door open Suitcases left luggage littered the reception lounge should ve been held more securely We didn t leave ours as felt uncomfortable due to the unsecure nature of the room , Bedroom was a reasonable size not sure it was big enough for a triple room though a very tight squeeze 
242586,Hotel Cavendish, Our bed sheets had coffee stains on it and the staff didn t change the sheets for two days by the way it was already dirty when we arrived at the room , The staff was so helpful 
242587,Hotel Cavendish, Everything they couldn t even provide me with a taxi to the airport Will not book again ever, The Service was horrible Service desk seemed upset when you asked questions Wifi was slow and Bering was horrible I had to purchase pillows at a local department store just to manage my stay 
242588,Hotel Cavendish, There was a raisin on our rug that remained there for the entire duration of our visit despite the room being cleaned every day There was the sound of water dripping all the time , The breakfast was generous and good The location is excellent 
242589,Hotel Cavendish, WiFi didn t work which was very frustrating since that is how you communicate and find information as a tourist from another country A smell coming from the bathroom , Ideal location within walking distance to tube stations shopping streets and many major museums Decent breakfast some plain yoghurt would have been nice with the cereal on offer but the full English breakfast and or bacon eggs are good Easy to leave and collect luggage 
242590,Hotel Cavendish, We had booked a triple room but this was a double room with sofabed This would have been fine had we been able to use the bathroom when the bed was out Warning about this would have been good , Nice selection at breakfast Very good location Clean Room only made up for two teacups etc but gentleman on front desk who checked us in was very obliging with this 
242591,Hotel Cavendish, The decor is tired there was a queue for breakfast Don t expect anything fancy, This is a good basic hotel in a great location and a good price The staff are lovely
242592,Hotel Cavendish, Booked a triple room with double bed Came with two singles Boiling hot temperature in London sun with Windows opening onto scaffolding with no fan or air con The only air con in the hotel was at reception for the staff member , The location is great Central London on your doorstep Fabulous
242593,Hotel Cavendish, Bigger television Better water pressure Triple room had double bed fold out sofa which made room very cramped when folded out, Lovely breakfast Bed comfortable Close to stations
242594,Hotel Cavendish, Definitely NOT 4 star Rooms small but typical of London cleanliness could definitely improve Drains smelled and rooms in need of refurbishment NO LIFT Some reception staff constantly in mobile phone and not helpful Would not stay here again , Quite close to London st Pancras and not too fat to walk to Covent Garden and Westminster Breakfast OK but portions small
242595,Hotel Cavendish, Overcrowded breakfast room tiny room bathroom has seen better days On the continent this would be a two star hotel Friendly staff , It s London You ll overpay for crappy hotels But you can do a little better than this if you take the time to look 
242596,Hotel Cavendish, Very tatty and poor standard Broken electrical socket Net curtains filthy Door into room didn t fit properly Broken tiles in bathroom Windows dirty Wooden shutters all broken inside the Windows Wouldn t stay here again , Breakfast was good but a bit rushed
242597,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, Good location clean and lovely staff but nothing fancy at all we had a lovely sleep but I was surprises when we arrived how modest it was Photos are too good 
242598,Hotel Cavendish, There were too many people lining up for breakfast had to go elsewhere on certain mornings Some of the front desk staff were less than welcoming , The location a perfect central point for getting around to many museums and to the underground 
242599,Hotel Cavendish, No where to place soap shampoo etc in the shower I personally didn t mind but I had a very small room Lot s of stairs , Good price Nice free daily breakfast Very helpful friendly staff 
242600,Hotel Cavendish, Single room Only space to stand No room for chair Smaller than prison cell Had to sit sideway on toilet because the sink was in the way , Breakfast and location
242601,Hotel Cavendish, Noisy road for front bedrooms Locked out of bedroom on the first night and had to sleep in a spare room until joiner called in the morning Unfortunate , Good position Polite staff 
242602,Hotel Cavendish, Actually saw a waitress blow crumbs off a side plate and leave it there for another diner Not impressed Hygeine standards anyone Had to wait for breakfast as room is v small TV in room was also broken shower tiny and opened directly to toilet so no room to dry yourself without hitting said toilet This hotel is adequate for an overnight stay but not exactly the height of luxury, Good location is the only plus point
242603,Hotel Cavendish, The room was very small but that is what you get these days for a convenient inner city location The windows were very hard to open and close , All very good The breakfast ladies were terrific and served up a superb English breakfast 
242604,Hotel Cavendish, I know this sounds strange but the only thing we didn t like was the shampoo it had a bad smell We had brought our own so it wasn t a real issue And the wardrobe s top shelf isn t flush with the wall so if you drop something down there you can t retrieve it because the wardrobe is built in the hotel is a bit shabby but not to the point of it mattering The Polish girls were very nice but you have to be very clear when ordering your breakfast be specific or they will bring you whatever they think you want , When we first got there we were put in a room facing the street when I had requested a garden facing room and the bed was not a double just a bit larger than a twin And the window wouldn t open and it was warm and w o AC or Fan which I had also requested and was stated to have However when we complained about the window the day manager was great He moved us to a larger room on the garden side and a fan and the window would open The room was very comfortable as was the bed The staff was friendly helpful and gracious The full English breakfast was very good and they had yogurt and fruit and cereal too The location is wonderful 5 minute walk to the British museum and not far from the West End for theatre and close to many other museums and good restaurants 
242605,Hotel Cavendish, The room is really small There was no hot water in the shower e just little cold water The wifi didn t work well , The hotel location was closed to my business The breakfast is served by a very polite staff and it is ok 
242606,Hotel Cavendish, Our room was very tiered and worn out could of done with a revamp also the window sill outside had lots of stubbed out cigarettes on it because the weather was hot we had the window open all we could smell was ashtray description said there was a fan but there wasn t one and no air con, In a good position and cheep
242607,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, This is our third time to stay at Hotel Cavendish We love the location in the university area The breakfast is nice The rooms are comfortable and the staff are helpful and kind The cost is very reasonable all quite comfortable A very good value 
242608,Hotel Cavendish, room was no bigger than a wardrobe seriously couldnt open a suitcase anywhere except on the bed mould in bathroom thin towels back yard of hotel was overgrown jungle could have been a nice spot to sit if any care had of put into the property no lift,No Positive
242609,Hotel Cavendish, Shame the garden the hotel looks out on was out of use it would be a real bonus to have some outside space, Good breakfast Ideal location for Euston and facilities available in the evening in the area My room at the back was quiet
242610,Hotel Cavendish, A lift would have been good Maybe just a bit too warm in the bedroom but nothing major , Location was very good Bedroom very clean Breakfast fab mixed fruit salad cereal small cooked breakfast Orange juice tea toast Dining room spotless and staff there very attentive as were Reception staff Thanks to all for such an enjoyable stay 
242611,Hotel Cavendish, The aggressive guests outside that kept us awake for several hours in the early early morning by yelling death threats at another guest and attempting to break his door down ,No Positive
242612,Hotel Cavendish, Apaulling Liquid possibly sewerage started leaking from the ceiling on to our bed from an upstairs room We padded across wet carpets at midnight to an alternative room The shower in the new room was broken We staggered down two flights of stairs stepped across damp carpets to shower in the original room We were begrudgingly offered 25 off the bill for the inconvenience ,No Positive
242613,Hotel Cavendish, There is water leaking from the ceiling in the room on the last day Besides the staff at the front door is not that friendly and a little biased in certain perspectives , The location is good 
242614,Hotel Cavendish, The property is really labyrinthine with a lots of narrow corridors and doors and stairs so if you do have weak legs I won t recommend this hotel There wasn t iron in the room we had to carry it from the aisle to the room WiFi worked sometimes and sometimes it didn t worked at all , We had a bright triple room in the uppermost floor for 2 guests and that room type was enough for 2 with 3 guests it would have been really tight The staff was really friendly and the breakfast was good The location is ideal if you want to visit British Museum which is free 
242615,Hotel Cavendish, The room was minuscule There was no wardrobe or anyway at all to hang clothes You had to plan your movements within the room and constantly step over things Access to the room was difficult and quite dangerous there were steep curving stairs going down immediately behind a door , It was clean
242616,Hotel Cavendish, This could be a good place if they got friendlier people on reception When we turned up reception was open we walked into the room and a man was stood there silently with no shoes on took me a minute to work out he was the receptionist and was about to pray Ok I thought and left the room for a minute but I do think he could have just closed reception for a few minutes to avoid a slightly bizarre arrival Then later on my dad arrived separately he had another booking when he got to his room somebody else s luggage was there in the room The same receptionist at first told my dad to move rooms then said he couldn t because the hotel was full so my dad stayed in the original room the luggage was removed but we were left wondering whether some other people would be joining my dad in the room seeing as they would think their luggage was there All just a bit odd rude and unorganised No apology or any explanation as to why luggage was in somebody s room , Good location rooms were fairly modern breakfast was fine 
242617,Hotel Cavendish, For 95 a night not that cheap even if central London I was given a tiny cabin room which was basically a single bed with 4 walls around it No space no comfort nowhere to put a suitcase or even a book Possibly larger rooms would have been OK but more expensive again Not well insulated at night could feel the cold draft yet found no extra blanket Wifi didn t work as advertised , Reasonably well located Quiet enough on the non street side of the hotel Clean enough Price included breakfast 
242618,Hotel Cavendish, the room was extremely small and cramped the bed was very uncomfortable the room was noisy with no noise isolation from the street internet did not work in the room however hard the front desk staff tried to reset the router , Location was good
242619,Hotel Cavendish, Hotel a bit dingy and in need of an upgrade wifi hit and miss bed not the most comfortable TV remote didn t work safety deposit box didn t work room at the front a bit noisy , Staff at reception location breakfast and cost 
242620,Hotel Cavendish, The walls are thin there is no air conditioning the windows are single glazed there is no way of holding the window open there was scaffolding just outside so I wouldn t want to leave the window open anyway, Breakfast was really good I also got upgraded free of charge and was able to choose what floor I wanted to stay on
242621,Hotel Cavendish, It was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in I could not fit my suitcase in the room The small single bed was the room There was no desk there More or less impossible to climb all the stairs with a suitcase to get to the room I am surprised and disappointed that booking com even has this hotel as a recommended hotel , Nothing 
242622,Hotel Cavendish, Having booked paid several weeks in advance I wasn t able to get an invoice until I booked out which caused problems with submitting and reclaiming expenses ,No Positive
242623,Hotel Cavendish, We had a room at the same level with the kitchen and it smelled like a friteuse Tiny bed for a couple it s not a problem for friends it s really little privacy , Staff was really helpful friendly Location was super Building was in a typical style for this area English charm 
242624,Hotel Cavendish, The mattress was very saggy but pillows were good and it was all clean The window was really decayed and coming away from the wall but it had double glazing for the noise and worked but window not to open and close , Good location was what I was expecting for the price and some rooms in other hotels for that price have shared bathrooms so this en suit was good Plenty of towels Friendly check in man Fan and hair dryer in room 
242625,Hotel Cavendish, Facilities in room were not working no lift to rooms lots of stairs Room key would not work and was not fixed for two nights we were there Telephone in room not working and no bulbs in bedside lights Very inconvenient having no working key Had to get staff to open door with master key every time we moved out of room , Room was nice and bed comfy tea coffee etc very good
242626,Hotel Cavendish, Room was small old which I could live with but shower was so slow we couldn t use it Staff didn t seem that bothered couldn t wait to leave , Location was only good factor
242627,Hotel Cavendish, Cleanliness in rooms can only get 2 out of 10 points The shower sink was connected with the one used by toilet resulting in a very bad smell had to manually cover the sink with a tea cup and spray up The rooms are very small not more than 2meters in width when on bed my feet were touching the side wall and my head was close to the other wall I am 185cm tall The vent in the bathroom was loud , The bed was fine so was the breakfast 
242628,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast could have started a little earlier 7 30 fairly late for working people , Great location within 5 minutes of 3 different tube lines Friendly staff 
242629,Hotel Cavendish, The room was really cold the draft through the window was dreadful The radiator took over 2 hours on max to start to get warm I had to wrap my pyjamas around the kettle to get warm and use it to warm my hands too Slept with a jumper and socks on over nightwear , The location as a single female the hotel felt safe the room was nice and quiet slept well 
242630,Hotel Cavendish, when asked for more toast at breakfast told kitchen closed, staff great helpful have stayed there before no complaints only the toast at breakfast
242631,Hotel Cavendish, No lift my room was at 3rd floor Then room card didn t work and had to call the receptionist to issue another one Mosquitos in room , Room and bath room were clean Breakfast was good although better if could make our own tea coffee 
242632,Hotel Cavendish, One tiny thing was the shower was weak and underpowered which meant showering was tricky But this was a minor inconvenience , Everything about the hotel was lovely The location was perfect close to the sights of London but quiet enough to be relaxing The staff were friendly and accommodating the room was big clean and nice and the breakfast was good Overall a very nice and affordable place to stay 
242633,Hotel Cavendish, Old building in urgent need of redecoration Smelly bathroom though looking new and clean dusty curtains everything needs a coat of paint as a minimum Not suitable for people with luggage tiny room no lift A bit noisy Poor breakfast , The staff were friendly and helpful 
242634,Hotel Cavendish, I don t know how this hotel is called a four stars hotel There is no car park then there s no elevator the furniture is very old and uncomfortable at all and when it comes to the breakfast it s very cold with no much of choices It was really very bad experience for us especially with our one month baby and when we had to carry him and our luggage to the third floor There are a lot of negative things to talk about but the only thing I m going to say is that I m not going back here again ,No Positive
242635,Hotel Cavendish, reception area to small to relax in with a book etc, friendly staff and very helpfull good breakfast nice location for the west end also handy for bus services to other parts of london buses very frequent
242636,Hotel Cavendish, The stairs could have been a little longer in length for the footing , I booked this hotel because of the good ratings On the day we were to arrive I saw some a few bad ratings So I didn t know what to expect We arrived early and left our bags while we explored High Street Hours later we returned to check in When I opened the room door I was happily surprised It looked just like the photos The room was clean and comfortable The breakfast was terrific We had tea service with shortbread in our room Our room was near the dining hall which was good Everything was GREAT 
242637,Hotel Cavendish, The rating for this hotel is hugely misleading My room was small and supposed to be a double bed My idea of a double is not two singles pushed together with one higher than the other The mattresses were cheap and uncomfortable The sheets didn t exactly smell fresh The bedside light didn t work Light poured into the room from the hallway through large gaps in the door If the hotel was 50 a night then I wouldn t mind so much but 100 is a complete rip off My email of complaint and follow up were duly ignored Very unprofessional , The location being a 10 minute walk from Euston is the only positive about this hotel 
242638,Hotel Cavendish, It would be hard to say what we didn t like in only 2 3 sentences This hotel is definitely not a 3 and a half to 4 star as listed Awful , Absolutely nothing 
242639,Hotel Cavendish, The rooms are advertised as having double beds when in fact the bed was a little more than a single bed what in certain terms would be classified as a superior single room There was no room at all around the bed and it would have been impossible for two people to move around The actual pictures of the room and the physical descriptions have no resemblance to the actual room The room was a single room and highly claustrophobic It s mis selling products to unsuspecting customers who trust your word about the facilities you offer The window had a direct view of Gower Street and it was impossible to open the window due to heavy traffic throughout the night including buses and taxis The shower itself is no bigger than a coffin and I didn t even have a shower The reception staff didn t even bother saying thank you and or asking me how my stay was because he was on the phone when I went down to breakfast and when I came up to leave A grossly exaggerated 2 Hotel masquerading as a 4 facility The only consolation was breakfast and the polite staff in the restaurant and kitchen Overall don t expect a room with a view ,No Positive
242640,Hotel Cavendish, No lounge facilities or bar Room that we had VERY SMALL Room floor on a slant No chairs to sit on due to the size of the room cracked window which caused a draft Due to the volume of traffic on the street very noisy during the night Overpriced for what you get Would not recommend this hotel , Breakfast and staff satisfactory
242641,Hotel Cavendish, Wifi is not good small single room just about 6m2 including tiny shower room , Location is perfect staff service for breakfast tea coffee at room 
242642,Hotel Cavendish, Bathroom was cold , Excellent location good value I stayed in a room facing the yard so it was very peaceful Standard breakfast good choice of cereals and fruit Friendly staff Very neat and clean room The cabin was probably the smallest hotel room I have ever been but the size of the room was mentioned in the booking so it was not a surprise 
242643,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, I have been at the Cavendish hotel before and it was amazing as always We called before and they ve taken care of our wishes as good as they could 
242644,Hotel Cavendish, My bed was next to a single glazed window meaning a constant cold draft was on my back all night Also the WiFi was patchy at best and I couldn t even read my emails efficiently , The staff were nice and the breakfast was good The location was perfect for what I needed 
242645,Hotel Cavendish, Stayed at this hotel 19 03 for one night My Eurostar was delayed so rescheduled for the following day so needed a hotel room for the night On booking com it rates 4star So i trusted and booked 4 stars i would struggle to give it 2 stars On arrival around 8 30 9pm one lady on the reception and man Very unfriendly people and basically felt i was more of a nuisance wanting to have a room than a guest I asked if they had a double room he just said no this is the only room left A lie i know as rooms available on Booking com but offered no discount for single traveler So i thought ok nice attitude Then breakfast is only from 7 30 9 30 really especially on a Sunday another let down I asked the checkout time and he told me 10 30 but later when checking my confirmation in my room it says 11 00 so another lie he told me I really felt uncomfortable and like i was more of a pain to him than a guest customer On arrival to the room it was so small it was unbelievable i had to have my suitcase in front of the door when i was in the room and then put it on the bed so i could leave the room The whole room was just horrible Shower moldy and hardly worked and im sure they turn the hot water off after a certain time went to have a shower about 9 30 and it was just warm to say the least The breakfast is ok in the morning its free so you cant complain Overall i would never ever stay at this hotel again unless like this time i was desperate but even then i would rather look for something else And as for the man in reception he should either learn to give good service or find a new job your doing the hotel no favors in guest ratings , Nothing
242646,Hotel Cavendish, Nothing I can think of , Very comfortable bed Clean room at the back of the hotel which was very quiet Near enough the centre of the city to come back for an hour or two before going out again at night Breakfasts were excellent with quick and friendly service Will definitely come back 
242647,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, It was a nice hotel near to Euston train stations The breakfast was very good The staff was kind and very helpfoul especially Mr Sam I would like to thank him 
242648,Hotel Cavendish, Wifi was useless My room opened onto the courtyard at the back which was pretty but the chubb lock felt insecure Needs a bolt or similar , Staff especially at breakfast were really pleasant and efficient I booked the smallest cheapest room but it was fine Warm and the shower was good 
242649,Hotel Cavendish, Rooms basic and tired Safe didn t work Over charged 10 , Good location Handy for Euston Road and a short walk to Covent Garden Breakfast was excellent 
242650,Hotel Cavendish, Room minute and I mean minute shower didn t get hot safe didn t work and the sockets hag arc marks on them which made you very nervous when using them Narrow corridor and fairly noisy, Well situated
242651,Hotel Cavendish, No Wi Fi as our teeny tiny room was in the basement between the kitchen and the breakfast room We were awaken each morning at 6 30 as the breakfast crewe started unpacking the kitchen for breakfast and they continued until 11 00 It was the worst location for a room possible , Good breakfast
242652,Hotel Cavendish, The room was very small there was no real room to sit and eat One could only watch TV from the bed There was no glass not even a plastic beaker in the room though the receptionist obligingly fetched one , The room was just about adequate for a one night stay The bed was clean and comfortable The breakfast was good and politely and quickly served The timing of breakfast was good for those needing an early start
242653,Hotel Cavendish, For the price it wasn t great rooms small with a very small bathroom Walls thin could hear next door talking around 6 in the morning plug hole in shower making very loud noises Have stayed in alot better Offered to keep bags at hotel on day of departure but not in a safe room just in reception so we declined this offer , Staff very helpful great reception
242654,Hotel Cavendish, Upon arrival someone was smoking in the next room The smell was awful along the corridor The reception dealt with the problem immediately and spoke to the guest breaking the rules The smell took a while to disappear which spoiled things a little for me as I hate the smell of cigarettes However the Hotel dealt with the matter swiftly and effectively and for that I m thankful Not really the hotels fault that some guests break the rules, Good location
242655,Hotel Cavendish, Not clean very dusty Not proper star rating It was rated 4 stars but actually it is 2 star hotel Very bad wi fi Almost impossible to connect, Staff at the reception was very kind and helpful location is good not noisy
242656,Hotel Cavendish, The bed was a little bit narrow however it s understable in such a tiny room , The location was excellent The tube and shops and many amenities are very close The room was tiny but clean and really very calm There are thick carpets on the corridor so the other visitors don t disturb you 
242657,Hotel Cavendish, Tiny room water doesn t heat up very well for shower Oddly decorated looks a bit like an Indian restaurant and it s a bit shabbily done and could do with repainting Also it s single glazed near a train track and poorly insulated between rooms ear plugs are a must but the trains will still wake you up quite a lot , Great value for money despite shabby decorating everything was clean and not unhygienic great location close to conference centres transport shops Room was nice and warm bed was very comfortable Staff were very polite 
242658,Hotel Cavendish, Even though the room was double glazed the sound of traffic was bad as hotel on a very busy road there was also a not so nice smell from the bathroom I also asked how to get to the garden as im a smoker but was told the only way to get to it was through a room which was occupied at the time , Location good staff Friendly Room basic but clean 
242659,Hotel Cavendish, draughty windows bed so close to windows I was cold in bed Bedding inadequate I was in a cabin room alias broom cupboard Curtains non hemmed rags , location
242660,Hotel Cavendish, The curtains were torn the breakfast was only English other choices were very limited the bathroom was extremely small The whole hotel looked like two houses put together with as many rooms as possible to make maximum profit , The English breakfast was really good We slept on the street side There was an extra window made to keep most of the noise out 
242661,Hotel Cavendish, I should like to see the garden made into a pleasant place, Every thing I needed in a small area Close to Senate House Very good breakfast Smiling staff
242662,Hotel Cavendish, The double bed looked a bit like two single beds pushed together Oh well that meant the wife got a good nights sleep , Location perfect Staff so friendly
242663,Hotel Cavendish, No wheelchair access A ramp should be purchased by the owners This is really bad in this day and age I was visiting my daughter who is in a wheelchair and she had to wait outside in the rain while I checked in No excuse for this , The breakfast was excellent The room was very nice and very affordable 
242664,Hotel Cavendish, the rooms on street side are noisy at night breakfast was limited , the location was very convenient as close to Euston station and not too far to walk to theatreland 
242665,Hotel Cavendish, Room very noisey could hear people walking about above constantly dreadful view from window tasteless cheap cups of tea and small breakfast, Clean room friendly staff good location
242666,Hotel Cavendish, Decoration is a little tired and in general the hotel could be cleaner although not really dirty Breakfast was good but dinning room fairly small had to queue on busy day for table when food arrived not as much as the day before when less busy , Location is good easy walk from Euston station not far from Goodge Street tube Big airy room friendly staff Breakfast was good 
242667,Hotel Cavendish, Felt slightly shabby and the creaking doors floors meant it was quite noisy when other guests came in late The toilet had a bad smell , The bed was very comfortable the room was clean and the full English breakfast was excellent
242668,Hotel Cavendish, nothing at the Hotel but Boris Johnson the Mayor has a real problem with London itself what s it like A dysfunctional building site with no idea on how to treat visitors , At Cavendish Hotel you meet a happy welcoming attentive to requests staff the line up helps you to feel at home Breakfast is super 
242669,Hotel Cavendish, The room was freezing cold it is still only February not very clean e g someone s hair in the cup on bedroom tea tray very thin duvet no spare blanket and male night receptionist s appearance was grubby wearing a filthy shirt Not welcoming at all Felt very very unsafe ,No Positive
242670,Hotel Cavendish, Room was small Would have preferred a bath tub instead of a shower , Great location close to Senate House and Russell Square Nice and helpful staff Excellent breakfast 
242671,Hotel Cavendish, Tv never worked fan in toilet never worked shower poor too small windows dont close windows leaking water bed too small for two people Taxi service they use tried to screw us Will not be back there , Location
242672,Hotel Cavendish, they should landscape the little garden behind the hotel for a pretty view through the windows , Front desk people were very helpful and friendly The breakfasts were delicious 
242673,Hotel Cavendish, stayed in room 305 and in heavy rain the roof leaked onto carpet and items on the floor got wet, Breakfast Was Good location to various underground stations
242674,Hotel Cavendish, I did not receive daily free bottled water while my colleague does , The location and the look of the hotel Also the cleanliness as I always get to have new towels every day 
242675,Hotel Cavendish, The overall hotel is a little tired and perhaps in need of modernisation Certainly the en suite facilities in our room needed updating , For the price you can t argue Perfect for an overnight stay clean and relatively comfortable 
242676,Hotel Cavendish, Nothing, Really impressed that reception staff remembered me from a previous visit Had read my request for a garden facing room and were able to upgrade me to a double room
242677,Hotel Cavendish, Room smelled of stale cigarette smoke Was allocated a quiet room at the top of the building which was great until next room used the water which was so noisy it woke me at 11 30pm and 6am , Staff convenience shower Felt safe as a single female travelling alone
242678,Hotel Cavendish, We had a dirty towel sewage smell coming from the toilet which then entered the room we were then moved into 2 single rooms even though we had booked a double the breakfast was disgusting me and my mum came down with sickness and diarrhoea from our stay there tried to get a refund for the first evening and was met by very rude and obnoxious receptionists and the manager is yet to phone me to sort it out as now I would like a complete refund as it ruined our trip for my mum s birthday Worst hotel experience of my life , Its location and that is it 
242679,Hotel Cavendish, Whilst I appreciate that the hotel was making the most of the space it had I didn t appreciate the awful service at breakfast when the dining room was full We weren t even acknowledged as we stood unsure of where to wait while a table became available There was no good morning no apology for the wait nothing When we finally got a table we were told there was no sausage or mushroom left Again there was no apology Shockingly poor customer service and the reason that I would not recommend this hotel It certainly wasn t the start I wanted to my birthday , The location was great and meant we were able to walk to most places rather than get the tube
242680,Hotel Cavendish, THE ROOMS ARE WAY TOO SMALL AND UNCOMFORTABLE Increase size of rooms an of breakfast room facilities , The people working their were great The location is very central and good als o given the price of the room
242681,Hotel Cavendish, Didn t feel comfortable as a woman staying on her own Couldn t lock the door from the inside so felt vulnerable Dirty and room not nice for the standard the hotel was advertised to be ,No Positive
242682,Hotel Cavendish, Hated the fact that the backdoor of the building was in my room and could not be locked It was closed but not locked which was a security risk in my opinion Would never stay here again despite it s good location ,No Positive
242683,Hotel Cavendish, Bit of a draft in room but it was ok as fresh air but meant noise from street was quite distracting and difficult to sleep , The receptionist when I arrived could not have been more helpful or friendly Very informative I was attending a conference in Bedford Way so location was great and lovely places to eat close by 
242684,Hotel Cavendish, Cold room smelly bathroom bad shower could have a sign at the breakfast table to tell what they DO serve as it is hard to understand the fast waitress There as no milk at the breakfast and the bacon came raw Complete the opossite to confortable , Close to the british museum
242685,Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast starting at 7am would have been better as 7 30am was too late to allow me to catch my train Still appreciated some breakfast items so not too much of an issue , Last minute availability and easy booking was great 
242686,Hotel Cavendish, Nothing, Big room very clean Basic but nice Breakfast was lovely Staff were friendly and efficient after checking out allowed us to leave bags whilst round London Very close to Euston and underground Would use again 
242687,Hotel Cavendish, There are no lifts so it is ver difficult to manage baggage and only one room is on the ground floor not that accessible if you have mobility issues , The location is ver convenient to shopping and access to the northern line Very homey accommodation and comfortable bed Adequate and clean bathroom and good breakfast provided 
242688,Hotel Cavendish, I had some issues with the internet connection which tended not to be that great at night , Very convenient small clean hotel Near the Eurostar station and lots of buses and restaurants Basic breakfast as well as freshly made hot english breakfast each morning Good value for the money I stayed on the ground floor small room but clean calm and convenient for my travel needs 
242689,Hotel Cavendish, None Everything just fine , Location is excellent Very central Accessible to anywhere Warm staff from those at the reception counter to the ladies in charge of breakfast Especially Mr Sallahudin he is fantastic very helpful very warm Always welcoming guests with his smile kind words Gave good advice tips Answered our queries patiently clearly Pleasant room Very comfortable Kept clean every morning 
242690,Hotel Cavendish, To small bedroom and bed for a couple no lift and we was in the 302 last room to tired everyday up and down , It was very warm all the hotel nice breakfast exellent staff 
242691,Hotel Cavendish, Lack of space some noise from stairs thin walls , Excellent location Three tube stations 5min away amixum 10 min on foot to Br Museum and xford str and 15 20min to Covent Garden and Soho Descent two beds room and clean bathroom Nice breakfast friendly staff quiet area warm room good internet access Reasonably price for a central London hotel 
242692,Hotel Cavendish, The Place is the dirtiest I ever seen the carpet is the oldest dusty everywhere and dirty left from the previous people Bathroom disgusting and the bed not comfortable at all Never again I Left one day before an I only stay because I didn t have way to leave Not recommend to anyone , The location only 
242693,Hotel Cavendish, There was not even enough space on the floor to open my suitcase Only narrow stairs I have watched overweight people bumping into the walls me myself did carrying the luggage it was impossible to sit on the toilet you need to sit sideways there is furniture covering a pipe where your leg should be you can hardly move in what they call room it is a cage and definetley not a good offer , The Staff was friendly and the room quiet good sleep The breakfast really nice It was clean 
242694,Hotel Cavendish, there is no lift and I was on the third floor Breakfast very basic We had a cracked milk jug on the table at breakfast The staff did not understand most of what we said,No Positive
242695,Hotel Cavendish, Shower and water stopped working no one let us know So I was halfway through a shower and it cut out Also no iron and ironing board available , Clean quiet friendly staff 
242696,Hotel Cavendish, It was like a house in multioccupation Could hear everything through thin walls Shower was just a dribble Worn and dirty poor quality furnishings, Staff were welcoming It was warm ie central heating
242697,Hotel Cavendish, The room was tiny with terrible mildew on the walls The wifi router was on the floor next to my bed The water ran out half way through my shower no water at all Had booked for 4 nights but after the first night checked out in the morning and will never go back ,No Positive
242698,Hotel Cavendish, drapes carpet etc not as clean as they could be Street facing rooms are quite noisy windows have little insulation , great location helpful and friendly staff good price nice breakfast
242699,Hotel Cavendish, If you book a single room check that it is not cabin This means that the room is just wider than outstretched arms The mirror in the bathroom is not over the sink but over the toilet I never got the free wifi to work Although the sheets appeared to be ok the covering over the bed was stained To charge that price for a room like that is shameful , The breakfast was ok 
242700,Hotel Cavendish, Cabin room was really small its not more then just a bed I m not the longest person but i could not sit on the toilet too small Overal cleanliness could be better mold in the shower loads of dust everywhere Bed was clean though, Good location
242701,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, The location was very good and easy walking into the west end and Kings Cross Station Room was a bit small but comfortable and had everything I needed Breakfast was excellent and very enjoyable with good service 
242702,Hotel Cavendish, First night shower was unacceptably cold Changed room next day Mattress was too firm Felt like sleeping on the floor and I had to leave hotel a day early due to back pain My room was cancelled by mistake and I had to wait until late morning for reinstatement , Changed room to ground floor Close proximity to office location 
242703,Hotel Cavendish, Apathetic staff smallest room in the world Bed is against walls on 3 sides smell of intoxicating fresh paint parts falling off walls and furniture and finally expensive for what it is , Location
242704,Hotel Cavendish, My shoe box at home is larger than this room and much better looked after The so called curtain was falling down and dirty The wiring of the bed side light was like an NVQ electrical project The shower head has not been cleaned since the hotel opened Luke warm water is being polite disused fans stored on top of the cupboard decoration shocking or lack there of So noisy it was like a night playing in the traffic , Like a school exam you get a mark by writing your name or in this case having a door and a reception desk A positive clean sheets
242705,Hotel Cavendish, The rooms are small and the fabric of the building and its interior is a little tatty The internet is weak emails only , Good location friendly staff value for money full cooked breakfast This is a no thrills hotel ideal for north London 
242706,Hotel Cavendish, The room was run down need painting There was a lot of dust on top of wardrobe , The location was good The bed was made daily and fresh towels daily Breakfast was fine 
242707,Hotel Cavendish, Rooms need maintenance Light bulb not working electronic door lock gave trouble on three occasions requiring staff intervention Reception somewhat surly with no interest in guests, Excellent location Room rather small with very small en suite but OK Breakfast good
242708,Hotel Cavendish, Horrible room located in the basement Very different from the photos in Booking com Labyrinth to find the room and no phone to call reception desk , Excellent location Walking distance from British Museum 10 min 
242709,Hotel Cavendish, Room too close to breakfast room door do could hear people passing , The location and very comfortable bed and external door in room leading to open garden
242710,Hotel Cavendish, More like a 3 B B in overall standard Cabin Room was like it said on the tin very small but reasonably comfortable , Central location near tube buses with the marvellous British Museum buzzy Tottenham Court Road just round the corner Staff are friendly helpful and the inclusive cooked breakfast made it better value 
242711,Hotel Cavendish, room was very small although to be fair it was a cabin room but was tiny It had all I needed though , welcoming staff clean room and very nice breakfast
242712,Hotel Cavendish, My biggest issue was the back garden was shut off so you couldnt sit outside which i like to do when i stay in a hotel Cavendish Hotels neighbour hotels may have been slightly more expensive but did offer nice gardens Also our heating wasnt on in our room so it was a bit cold , Cavendish Hotel is in a very good location and is only a 5 minute walk to the British Museum and Grants and Petrie museums Tottenham court Rd is a 3 minute walk with lots of shops and bars and restaurants plus the BT Tower is very close by and so is Regents Park 
242713,Hotel Cavendish, Grubby bathroom Flickering light bulb Very thin walls , Big bed Well not really s it turned out It was two shoved together so there was a gap in the middle Not even a double sheet two singles 
242714,Hotel Cavendish, The double bed was 2 singles pushed together and not particularly comfortable The room needed decorating it was shabby The curtain pelmet was covered in dust the windows were filthy and the inner part of the windows didn t shut properly The lamp shades had stains on them I wouldn t put anything in the drawers as they were stained I ve stayed here once before and gave a good review But based on this experience I won t stay again, Breakfast was good and check in and check out was quick and simple
242715,Hotel Cavendish, Spider web in the room corners stained carpet dirty bathroom very uncomfortable bed no heating central heating wasn t working at all Single glazed window really noisy constant knocking noise all night from central heating pipes from other floors Damp smell moths in the corner of the carpets in the room power sockets are all damaged hot water only comes after running the taps for 3 4 minutes half used shampoo bottle left behind in the bathroom bedside lamp stands broken woken up by breakfast team noise than other guest noises at 7 30am Basement room lg2 should not be sold for money This was definitely a worth 85 a night hotel Next time I will spend that money to get a taxi home Very disappointing Felt ripped off , Towels clean and nice quality
242716,Hotel Cavendish, Shower nowhere to rest the shower gels Very Very small english breakfast unsuitable for a man with no extra helpings Small tv , The room and bed
242717,Hotel Cavendish, not enough seats at breakfast had to wait both mornings sofa bed for child was poor springs sticking up very lumpy no matress protector on bed just a sheet dirty walls black marks on them expensive for the standard it was room was cold no heating on thin bedding scaffolding outside room with sheer drop down no safety bar, the location was fair
242718,Hotel Cavendish, Bit busy at breakfast so a wait for a table one morning , Lovely staff good breakfast and great location Very pleased with room nice and quiet and comfy bed 
242719,Hotel Cavendish, Everything The room smelt of damp and sewage The decor was dirty and tired The window almost fell out when i tried to close it as the frame was so rotten The net curtains were black with mold The TV was so small it was difficult to see from the bed Although breakfast was included I was not going to risk eating in such a disgusting place , Nothing this is the most digusting hotel I have stayed in in London
242720,Hotel Cavendish, musty smell on arrival everywhere from the entrance to our room on the third floor walls ceilings needed painting dirty carpet dark dingy room dirty shower no matress cover bed matress stained dirty windows and the curtains had seen better days the bedroom carpet was really dirty and there were damp stains on the celing and walls by the windows we didnt feel like stayning at all but it was late and we had an appointment the pictures on booking com looked clean and bright but it was far from it The breakfast foom was very small and we had to wait so long for breakfast on the first morning we went without We did have a light breakfast on the second morning where the very young waitresses were helpful The man on reception on the sunday morning was not interested in my complaints and told us we had to leave by 10 30am when it clearly said 11am on the booking details When i went to pay he told me he had already taken payment by using my card details i didnt think this was usual as it had never happened before My advice would be to not stay here and its not good enough that people see a different view on the booking site we would have thought there should be inspections done on a regular basis to ensure patrons get a fair deal , We didnt like anything as our first impressions were not good 
242721,Hotel Cavendish, The rooms are very close to each other and not all guests are considerate and let their doors bang wich can be noisy , Clean and comfortable Good sized room Plenty of plucg sockets and a nice work station Great shower Breakfast was excellent and very quickly served 
242722,Hotel Cavendish, Some staff were more friendly helpful than others I do feel 115 per night was far too expensive for bed breakfast Being in the room by reception did mean it was a bit noisy as you heard everything , The small cooked breakfast was nice Some staff were very welcoming and helpful My room and bathroom were clean 
242723,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, Depends on the room you are getting We got first a room for 2 in second floor that was not worth writing about A dumpster Later we insisted to move to another room a triple room in the ground floor that was fine Beware 
242724,Hotel Cavendish, Hotel is advertising as 4 star However two or even one star is more appropriate The room is so bad that I was thinking about leaving the hotel even it was midnight Decided to stay and have spent a sleepless night in what definitely was the worst hotel I ever visited All this was charged at 100 a night , Location only
242725,Hotel Cavendish, Staff had poor level of English Thin walls TV didn t work properly Internet didn t work properly Price didn t match quality, Convenient location Free breakfast
242726,Hotel Cavendish, No heat during my trip and no Hot water on my second day The staff did not managed to find a solution despite my request The stairs and the building s fa ade were under renovation and the smell of fresh paint was sadly unpleasant I do not recommend this place, the size of the room
242727,Hotel Cavendish, Tiniest room I have ever stayed in had to lug my heavy luggage up 3 flights of stairs without any assistance , Great location close to the underground and restaurants 
242728,Hotel Cavendish, An incidence of sewer stench occurred while I understand it was coming from the adjacent property it made us feel sick The television fell off the wall The stairway to the below levels could be an incident waiting to happen , Mr Oma was very courteous handling phone calls and visitors The kitchen staff were very pleasant at breakfast managed well with their limited space 
242729,Hotel Cavendish, It s a little small but considering it s central London that s not really a game changer , Lovely clean room Great shower Friendly helpful staff Nice breakfast
242730,Hotel Cavendish, Run down No heating in room En suite smelled and extractor not working Maintenance guy only free after 4 hours Changed rooms and slightly better Probably living off the 5 Cavendish Hotel name , Location central London
242731,Hotel Cavendish, The reception guys were very unfriendly the check in started with the payment first every other question the guests should ask after TV was disaster small old didn t work proper because of broken remote control No WI FI on the second floor where our room was The location is not good at all faraway from everything close only to British Museum The room is very small for 3 person There was one king size bed and for the third person sofa with the size of a child definitely not for adult person When the sofa is open no more space for moving inside the room The shower in the bathroom was fixed on the wall but they don t offer shower capes I asked the reception if they can find solution for bigger bed for the third person because we are all adults and one of us should sleep with hanging outside of the bed legs but with smile the reception guys answered to me to search for another hotel , The breakfast was very very good as well the girls who are working during breakfast are very friendly The room was clean they change the towels every day It was hot inside the hotel while outside was very cold The king size bed was awesome 
242732,Hotel Cavendish, The extractor fan in the bathroom was not working and there was a smell There was no heating in the room Staff came but did not rectify the problem we were not offered any alternative or refund, The breakfast was excellent with good choice and good quality The location was good for where we wanted to be 
242733,Hotel Cavendish, Premises unrefurbished since Victorian times Reception room in very poor condition EXTREMELY small rooms NO LIFT and many many narrow stairs where you need to drag your heavy luggage In all ridiculusly overpriced and overrated in stars A 2 star max is more likely , Good location polite and helpful staff good breakfast quiet rooms
242734,Hotel Cavendish, 4 star is probably incorrect rating No bar restaurant on premises , Location is superb Close to British Museum and great bus and tube links nearby Breakfast freshly cooked to order 
242735,Hotel Cavendish, Rooms tired and need redecorating repair moved room 3 times due to drain smell leak when raining and noise by breakfast room during breakfast hours Our best room had no view , Good location clean room and bathroom kind and helpful reception staff Freshly cooked breakfast

242739,Hotel Cavendish, No shelving so there was limited space to put our things perhaps the telephone coffee table could be replaced by a chest of drawers , Located close to Goodge St station and the shops and restaurants of Tottenham Court road Nice roomy bright quiet room overlooking garden Breakfast OK Friendly helpful staff Kettle coffee tea provided Sufficient hanging space in the wardrobe Nice to have a sofa in the room 
242740,Hotel Cavendish, The roman blind fell on me in the middle of the night and the room had a big problem with bathroom ceiling no lift cabin single room is exactly as the name suggests , Reception staff great location for parents visiting university students

242742,Hotel Cavendish, No secure bag deposit An ensuite bedroom that is smaller than my bathroom at home A dangerous bedside lamp that was hidden in the wardrobe and its electrical certificate was out of date No recpetion staff when I left , My greeting on arrival
242743,Hotel Cavendish, I think the breakfast room is a bit small I didn t get to have breakfast at the first day because the room was full of guests there weren t enough tables to sit in , The staff in the front desk is very helpful The room is clean and comfortable with complimentary tea milk and biscuits everyday The free breakfast comes with a good variety of cereal fruits and yoghurts and don t forget the tasty full English breakfast as well 
242744,Hotel Cavendish, Unhelpful staff 3rd floor room with no lift horrible smell of damp leaking ceiling WiFi not working on path of emergency ambulances from nearby hospital 2 facilities , Checking out

242746,Hotel Cavendish, There is no way this hotel is worth the money I paid for it The room was tiny the decor faded the bed on a tilt In summary a hole I couldn t recommend to anybody It would need to be half the price for this to be value for money , Location
242747,Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is very shabby the is a smell of damp everywhere and a decided stink of sewage from the bathroom The bed is mediocre the pillows very flat and hard and the floors are dirty , The location is very good close to 2 tube stations Tottenham Court Road many shops and cafees The room is a fair size 
242748,Hotel Cavendish, Room condition Water marks on room s ceiling and it looked horrible wasn t the kind of room one would expect for a special occasion Breakfast service We ordered white bread and we were told that they ran out of white bread as if it was our fault After that the breakfast service was so slow that we sat there after ordering the food and didn t get our order in time Then there were people queuing up for breakfast so we had to leave without having proper breakfast Housekeeping service When we checked in the room there were 3 bath towels for 3 people but the next day we were only provided with 2 bath towels Housekeeping department never replaced the toiletries for us the next day Reception When I was checking out on 31 08 15 I asked your reception that what is the complain feedback procedure he never asked me what was wrong or if he could help me in anyway I emailed at the address that was given to me but after 2 weeks and I haven t received any response from the hotel or a courtesy call apologising for this horrific experience ,No Positive
242749,Hotel Cavendish, There was mould and damp all over my bathroom ceiling The shower head was broken And the shower door was broken , Where it was It was close to a business course I was on 
242750,Hotel Cavendish, Mold in the celing in the bathroom Heard rats in the eating area , Great location Shorts walk from oxford street This hotel fits for Just sleeping and spending the day outside the hotel 
242751,Hotel Cavendish, Second night a noise kept going off like a bell until 2am then it stopped then started again at just after 6 am was not happy about that, Location and friendly staff
242752,Hotel Cavendish, The room was tiny it had cracks all over the wall the sofa bed was rock hard so our daughter had to sleep with us the shower and tap was a trickle so it took a while to have a decent shower there was no internet as stated and the TV didn t work , Nothing about the hotel it was shocking 
242753,Hotel Cavendish, A plughole of shower was so bad that overspill water wetted my luggage which was placed in the bedroom There had been no notice about it from the staffs What s more wifi of the bedroom does not work , Nothing
242754,Hotel Cavendish, Wifi was horrible tiny single room barely enough room for my suitcase one receptionist didnt give me the time of day other was very nice Very polite breakfast and cleaning staff, Location good breakfast
242755,Hotel Cavendish,No Negative, The accommodation met our requirements Near Euston with ensuite bathroom full English breakfast tea and coffee making facility all for a budget price The room was serviced every day and the towels were new and clean 
242756,Hotel Cavendish, The room was a tiny box with a bed jammed in under the window next to some sort of blind contraption that could not be raised and a window that was jammed open next to the 24 hour racetrack that is Gower Street the traffic isn t the fault of the hotel so did not affect my score The bathroom is tiny and not only was it generally in a dirty condition the previous occupant had thoughtfully left a used feminine hygiene item in the lavatory This proves to me that bathrooms are not cleaned in between occupants There was no water pressure even at 5 am when I decided I couldn t stand it all any longer and got up , There isn t a lot to like about this place I didn t have breakfast so it might have been nice Reception was open when I arrived at 2300 and when I left at 0600 and the person on duty was obviously very busy as it took him 15 minutes to check me in of which 13 minutes he spent on his mobile phone 
242757,Hotel Cavendish, Wifi was not good tv remote was not working we reported it but it was not sorted Our bedroom window was open when we entered the room my sister went over to look outside and put her hand out to touch the window and there was a sheetrock so she could have fallen out a young child running into the room towards the window would not have been so lucky it was really dangerous We did report it , It was central
242758,Hotel Cavendish, It was really hot and the window wouldn t stay open TV didn t work and when I ask someone to get it looked at they just didn t bother , Location
242759,Hotel Cavendish, The general condition was poor and outdated Discovering some items not where we left them only to find that they had been placed in our suitcase by the cleaning staff defiantly not happy with this , The location was ideal for us as we were near our daughter and reception staff were polite enough Although it was a bob standard english breakfast
242760,Hotel Cavendish, Very small room not suitable for 3 persons Window opened in dangerous way There were scaffolds at the window The room was not clean and had bad smell Not worth the money we paid , Location Close to Underground station 
242761,Hotel Cavendish, My error but I forgot to ensure there was a lift We were placed on the third floor six flights of stairs with two pieces of luggage each to pull up the stairs If this does not worry you it is not a problem but for us it was the main disappointment The first staff member who greeted us was very welcoming The other reception guy was not welcoming or helpful Our safe was never unlocked as we requested on the first day Long walk to station so plan to get cab , Location was good for sight seeing
242762,Hotel Cavendish, Noise from traffic on Gower Street is constant can disrupt sleep even with the windows closed The single rooms are very small , Reasonably priced conveniently located close to Euston station If you need somewhere to bed down for a night or two and can do without any frilly extras this place is ok 
242763,Hotel Cavendish, The room needed decorating large cracks in the walls The shower had no pressure The staff in the breakfast area had problems understanding when you wanted something well done When you check in you are given a card which we ticked to pay by cash not card but when check out they had taken the money out of the back on the card we had used to book it with which had no money Which we got charged for, The location
242764,Hotel Cavendish, I booked a single room It said there is wifi access at the room but I totally couldn t access on the second day it had very weak signal you only could access a few minutes then gone the room is so small if you need to upgrade a better single room you need to pay 40 not worth to do so , Only the location is good and the room is clean 
242765,Hotel Cavendish, Except location this hotel is not a good place to stay breakfast was poor staff was unprofessional rooms are very narrow and not very clean internet was very weak all equipment bedclothes etc are very old The floors are very weak and make a lot of noise when walk and you can hear any moves of your neighbors ,No Positive
242766,Hotel Cavendish, Not worth the money of staying here Even though the location on a map seems close it is at least a 15 20 minute walk to anything that is worth seeing or eating There is no elevator and no assistance carrying up luggage The first night the tv froze That morning management said they would switch us to another room to pack our bags and bring them to the lobby When we returned our next room would be available We we returned later that evening our bags were still in the lobby It would have be a decent thing for them to have put our bags in our new room but that didn t happen This room was smaller and on the third night the tv froze again WiFi was if Y Sometimes it would work and others you d have to hold your phone in a particular direction for connection If you are requesting a pull out bed don t It is very uncomfortable If you are going to stay here you might as well book another room so that person doesn t have to sleep on the pull out This place was definitely not worth the stay , The breakfast was good Only serves classic english breakfast or a limited continental style
