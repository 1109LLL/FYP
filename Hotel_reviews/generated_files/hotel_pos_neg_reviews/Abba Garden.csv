440520,Abba Garden, Location is a little far out of the centre but can be walked Please note that the hotel is on a steep hill but the location is great to look out over Barcelona ,No Positive
440521,Abba Garden, not enough people at reception mostly because you have to put a deposit for towel at the reception Too far away from the metro No coffee tea in the room No slippers in the room if you don t have your own it will be difficult to go to the spa swimming pool No real restaurant for the moment , breakfast room people were nice Easy to go to downtown bus 
440522,Abba Garden, The hotel is a 15 minute uphill walk from the metro station If you have lots of heavy bags it would be best to get a taxi , Great sized rooms and superb selection for breakfast 
440523,Abba Garden, The receptionist was very rude and very disrespectful towards myself and my partner We enquiried a few times and the female receptionist was difficult to interact with and very threatening towards us She had charged us for facilities that was already in our room we paid for already and tried to get money out of us I felt she was taken advantage of us because we are from England and speak very little Spanish She authorised money to be taken out my account for these facilities which we had paid for on booking com once confronted at reception when we was checking out she said not to worry about the extra charges she alleged had I find this hotel a con And would stay away compket jmmmmm, The staff in the restaurant was very friendly The outside pool was a good size and opened at reasonable times 
440524,Abba Garden, The pool was clear but unfortunately it wasn t completely clean but it is situated right by trees so this is bound to happen For a four star hotel I expect a little bit more attention to certain things but it is all minor detail , Very nice welcome and they changed our room without any problems when I mentioned we d requested a double and not twin Overall it was a good welcome and a nice stay The pool was a nice temperature The room was clean and we had booked at last minute deal so it was great value for money The rooms are air conditioned and we had control over it 
440525,Abba Garden, Everything was perfect , The very obliging staff who were always willing to go the extra mile to help out with everything No requests were too small or trivial People matter at this hotel Staff totally professional in a relaxed atmosphere The shuttle was an added bonus Thank you 
440526,Abba Garden, Not much you can do about location now ha but it s a bit far out from the main part of town however very accessible and quiter just certain people certain preferences I guess , Very nice hotel with quality pool Very friendly staff and great help 
440527,Abba Garden, Restaurant Had to wait a lot for the food when it was not busy at all however they compensated us generously without us mentioning it all s forgiven , Parking was a breeze with plenty of room Rooms are clean with really comfy beds and the staff clearly goes the extra mile Speaking of which the nearest metro is 1 5km away but feels closer as you walk across a lovely park on the way All in all highly recommended 
440528,Abba Garden, Our bedsheets and cushion covers were not changed for 5 days we had to ask for it the personnel was not that polite they even took our yogurt before we ate it because the breakfast area was closing there were not informed that we had prepaid our accommodation as well as our breakfast and we had to show the e mail exchanges we had The swimming pool area as well as the restaurant area could be open especially during summer at least until 00 00am since there is nothing around to have a drink or dinner The kitchen of the restaurant was closed at 23 00pm Can understand though above issues due to a high season period b that the same people preparing the breakfast they had reception duties and c cleaning duties etc , The room is very comfortable very clean the breakfast is fabulous the swimming pool very clean the location is very nice despite the fact that it s far away from the city center there is a bus stop in 50 meters from the hotel that drives you downtown in 20 minutes or you can walk around 15 minutes through a beautiful park and get the metro Ms Amaia helped us a lot and assisted us immediately with our payments emails that needed to be printed etc The food at the restaurant was really very nice very nice sangria and cocktails 
440529,Abba Garden, The hotel is quite far from any shops The hotel takes advantage of this by charging a slightly higher price for snacks in the minibar bottled water 500 ml a kit Kat and small pringles were 3 50 euro each which is quite excessive , The hotel breakfast was good The location of the hotel was a little far out however easily commutable into central Barcelona by metro Rooms were nice 
440530,Abba Garden, The location of the hotel Is not close to the metro station you have to walk for 20 minutes and is far from the center Is good if you want to be in a quiet place but not a good idea if you are going for tourism When we arrived the sink was broken and the bath got flooded as soon as we opened it The good think is that they fixed it in few minutes , The Hotel was clean and the beds were confortable The swimming pool was good 
440531,Abba Garden, The walk up the hill to the hotel was not always welcome We missed having tea coffee making facilities in the room If you did not want to eat at the hotel it was a 30 walk to the nearest restaurant The local cafes were about 15mins walk and did not open in the evening , The hotel is situated close to the end of the bus and metro line which made it easy to get around on public transport The room was comfortable and very quiet The air conditioning was very welcome I used the swimming pool every day 
440532,Abba Garden, It wiuld be great if omelettes could be added to hot breakfast but wasn t an issue for me as scrambled eggs were good , It is located on a hil We had room with city view Also the park that you need to cross to get to the metro is really beautiful A 15 min walk to metro station but still a pleasure Overall location of property far from city but still nice Really nice breakfast Good variety good staff 
440533,Abba Garden, I feel the staff were very slow and somewhat lazy Numerous times both my partner and I either visited reception or the bar and asked for help ordered a drink and each time is took more than 10 15 mins At one point I asked for one beer and the bar staff chose to answer her mobile instead I didn t like that there was a mini fridge in the room which was fully stocked but was never informed that we would be charged for anything we took this should be communicated stronger either when you check in or clearly stated on the fridge Your rooms should also have iron ironing board facilities rather than 1950 trouser presses and a modern hairdryer rather than a tube that blows out air from the wall , The bed was super comfy The pool was lovely and relaxing 
440534,Abba Garden, Location poor Required a long trip by public transport to major Barcelona attractions Poor service by bar and restaurant staff Uncoordinated long waits to be served and to obtain bill No urgency at all , Good modern facility Good surroundings 
440535,Abba Garden, No tea coffee facilities in the room Bar restaurant staff are quite slow and sat with empty drinks having to go to the bar to chase food and drinks at times , The bed was super comfortable Room big and no noise Great location Great view from our room 
440536,Abba Garden, On the way back from the Metro to the hotel it s quite steep to get back to the hotel so wouldn t recommend for someone who s physical condition is not that great But you could always get a taxi from the city centre to the hotel for about 15 , The property had a really good location not too far from the Metro line to the city centre L3 and connection to the airport L9 the walk to the metro was really nice through the park The swimming pool was nice and quite breakfast was really nice not too expensive and enough of everything and good variety Staff was extremely friendly 
440537,Abba Garden, No kettle in the room Only one chair in the room for two persons , Very comfortable and clean room with big beds and perfect views from the window Swimming pool is near to the hotel where water is very clean and warm Very tasty dishes in local restaurant Big and clean restroom with everything you need inside
440538,Abba Garden, The safe wasn t big enough for my laptop Pretty minor so all in all no problems An ATM on the premises would be good , Speed of service and quality of food in restaurant in evening used once 
440539,Abba Garden, See above , With all big chain hotels facilities and room were excellent Staff were pleasant but I felt could have been more attentive They took a long time to process things at the reception and there was some confusion with orders Price was a bit expensive but this is the going rate for everything in Barcelona Overall a great place to stay though 
440540,Abba Garden, Sometimes after a shower the roof dripped a Little Some hotels have a small Air vent which could provider a good solution, Rooms always clean and well kept Breakfast was yummy delicious
440541,Abba Garden, Food in the restaurant was very expensive for what it was breakfast was extortionate parking expensive and one evening the electric went off so our car was stuck in the car park We complained and the hotel only paid one way for us to get to la ramblas so we had to pay 20 euros to get home which we had not budgeted for through no fault of ours No lounge area to relax indoors with comfy seating Our room was supposed to be a no smoking room but the bathroom smelled of smoke slightly when we arrived , Comfy bed and air conditioning heating good Bathroom freebies great and shower hot and powerful 
440542,Abba Garden, No issues at all, Excellent hotel clean modern and well maintained Lovely friendly helpful staff Great facilities Had a fabulous lunch Great access to the city via the metro walk through the rose garden it s lovely
440543,Abba Garden, Smoke kept coming into the room I did not know who was smoking and how it went into the room I told the receptionist twice with no use , Nice hotel nice area but not near the city centre Metro is 15 min walk anyway View from the room was good 
440544,Abba Garden, When booking it it never said the pool opened in May thet was the whole reason i booked this hotel for the pool Rooms could be cleaner there was a sweetie under the bed when we arrived and still there when left , Staff were nice and very helpfull 
440545,Abba Garden,No Negative, The location of the hotel is quite far out but it s a lovely walk through a pretty park to get to the metro 15 mins and the hotel itself has good amenities although the pool wasn t open on our visit 
440546,Abba Garden, No airport shuttle and the breakfast menu was same on all days , The front office staff were very helpful and cordial in arranging conveyance as well as conveying necessary info regarding transport 
440547,Abba Garden, Wifi is very slow and inconsistent Would love to have a treadmill in the gym and a heated pool would be great Breakfast menu is good but a bit of daily variation may make it better, Great staff as always and that is the key to a good hotel stay experience
440548,Abba Garden, The small bottles of water are not complimentary I don t remember in the past 2 years finding a 4 star hotel where you pay for the water it is always complimentary But they were kind enough and understood our argument and we did not pay for 2 small water of bottles that we had to drink in the night considering we arrived at the hotel at 10 30 PM , The position From the window we could see only vegetation it was lovely The staff were not warm at all Not something bad but they could work more on making you feel more comfortable 
440549,Abba Garden, Staff during night shift were not friendly Was unable to get even a bottle of water at 11 in the night No shuttle to nearest metro on Saturday Sunday or any other public holiday was a disappointment as the location of the hotel was a little remote and requires long walk or getting a taxi for every time you step out Services around some basic necessities were not available, Cleanliness and room cleaning was good
440550,Abba Garden, I stay at Abba Garden quite often and always make the same comment I wish they had feather down pillows , The staff They were all very friendly and helpful Great view of the city from the balcony Near to buses Out of the city which is my preference Less noise and less pollution Near to a nice park which leads down to Diagonal the main route through Barcelona Also a nice walk down to Nou Camp for football aficionados There is a great Catalan restaurant less than 100 metres up the hill in front of hotel 
440551,Abba Garden, perhaps tea coffee in the room, the room was large and comfortable and very clean no problem for the location as i needed to get to the polo club walking distance through the park
440552,Abba Garden, The driver of the Abba hotelbus didn t drop us of at the entrance of IESE which is rude He let us walk a few hundred meters uphill which was quite a thing with the luggage and especially for a colleague with walking frames Pool was closed the day I arrived october 24th for winter season ,No Positive
440553,Abba Garden, Room was very tired looking and the carpet was stained a lot Bathroom fittings ready for an overhaul , Usually stay here as it is much quieter than being in the city Also nearer to airport and within walking distance to FCB Nice views to city etc 
440554,Abba Garden, Bad english very far out to travel in everyday Very hard to eat during the day as the times of the restaraunt and bar are terrible I had to get them to fix the room key 5 times as we went to the room and could not get in on the 6th time i had to demand new key cards The breakfast is 14 each and not worth it at all The hill it is on is a monster hill Got the shuttle every time we could, The hotel itself was lovely
440555,Abba Garden, Location is right at the edge of the city in a fairly hilly area away from bars shops restaurants etc although this could be a positive for many people The nearest shop and metro stop are relatively close 10 min walk , Friendly staff comfortable room great bar patio area and swimming pool relatively close to metro allowing easy access to city centre and a direct route to the airport 
440556,Abba Garden, Didn t like finding female swimwear or underwear in the press in room male staff were a little blunt and not too friendly especially on check in and when enquiring about the area etc didn t like two beds together to make a double bed tea coffee in room Wud Uve been a nice touch, Female staff were very friendly and also room cleaners etc all very friendly and accommodating arora and two other female co workers all informative and helpful great pool area and outdoor area
440557,Abba Garden, The cleaning personnel opened the door on us a few times but we did forget to put the do not disturb sign on the door partially our fault The location of the hotel is fine if you want to stay around UPC or the football stadium however to go back after a late night city visit you are restricted to a bus at least it runs all night and to a steep walk up the hill It did not bother me that much but prepare to be needing a cab from time to time , The personnel at the reception is really kind and helpful The swimming pool and facilities make the hotel an appealing option to stay The room was always kept clean 
440558,Abba Garden,No Negative, I appreciated very much the hotel It is clean and the attention for the details is good I recommend it The 20 minuts walk to from the metro is across a very nice park maybe a little bit tiring uphill but alternatively there is the bus 
440559,Abba Garden, Restaurant menu was a little limited Would have been good if the shuttle bus service was available on weekends , Very good access to bus and metro less than 5 min walk to the bus stop and less than 15 to Metro Tram Room was a nice size and clean On arrival the receptionist was fantastic and gave us a map and circled all the best sights to go and visit 
440560,Abba Garden, 20 minute walk from metro station up large hills is the only downfall esp with young children coming home at night time but apart from that hotel is perfect for a family break , Lovely hotel nice pool good food friendly staff 
440561,Abba Garden, Location far from metro I thout that my booking enclud breakfast but wasnt I have to pay mor than 110 for breakfasts only , It was quiet and clean the stuf friendly breakfast tusty 
440562,Abba Garden, The WiFi kept turning off Parking was available but expensive, We selected a hotel outside of the city for easy access by car The staff was extremely helpful regarding travel to and from the city 
440563,Abba Garden, The night duty staff on our check out at 4am was absolutely horrible Tried to make us pay again for our room even though I had a receipt and proof I had already paid Made our taxi to the airport wait outside for 20 minutes with the Meter running Called the booking company after being told I was wrong and treated so badly never once got an apology and after half an hour on the phone of the conversation going in circles he finally realised he was wrong and we were free to leave this made us late to the airport and nearly miss our flight His mannerisms were appalling and never once said he was sorry or showed a bit of empathy Terrible customer service from this one man which is a shame as the rest of the staff were lovely , The pool was lovely 
440564,Abba Garden, The facilities are very poorly maintained and the promotional photos do not match what is really in place The hotel is understaffed and poorly managed , I did not like any thing in particular
440565,Abba Garden, Poor choices at the bar Dirty cups left in room from day 1 of our visit , This hotel had great views and a fabulous pool Breakfast was pretty good too 
440566,Abba Garden, The location is not good Its is quite far from the metro system and you have to climb the hill on the way back The area has no amenities no super markets drug stores etc The hotel is also located next to a big hospital which means that there is noise from air conditioning systems etc Finally for some reason the hotel decided to have a truck pick up the laundry in the middle of the night 02 15 They made such a huge racket they even managed to wake me up and I consider myself a heavy sleeper , the hotel is located up on a hill which provides excellent view from higher floors The breakfast was very good with a rich buffet 
440567,Abba Garden, No services very close by Internet was non existent in our room for 4 out of 5 days Also had troubles with electrical breakers , Hotel was very clean and staff were friendly 
440568,Abba Garden, 1 Room AC broken couldn t sleep next day had to complain twice before I was moved rooms 2 Room service got order wrong twice and the guy seemed quite disinterested the lady was very apologetic and lovely 3 No restaurant for dinner cafe snack bar only 4 No shops or restaurants locally that I could see 5 Heavy traffic and dual carriageways to negotiate on walk to from Metro so need to be very careful where cross roads, 1 Right on the outskirts of Barcelona some may not like this but it suited me 2 Only 10 minutes walk approx to metro station though uphill on way back so might be a struggle if unfit or infirm etc 3 Rooms very clean and fresh 4 Toiletries provided 5 Good value
440569,Abba Garden, Didn t answer my email when I was still in England , Very good location through the park direct connection to the underground either to the airport or the city Center or the beach anywhere 
440570,Abba Garden, Location of the hotel isn t great unless you come by car or part of a tour party Its past the end of the metro line and tram line There are no cafes restaurants or food stores anywhere nearby so only option is eating at hotel No tea coffee facilities in the room , Room and hotel facilities were all clean and absolutely fine A nice park down the hill a bit 
440571,Abba Garden, The Hotel ensures that there is controlled air condition and safe in every room Unfortunately air condition did not work and there was intolerably hot room from eastern side Only because we stayed at hotel in March we were able to cool the room by opening the window Moreover safe was out of order and when we complained about it the staff simly did nothing I have also one minor remark regarding bed namely the mattress was concave , Very clean rooms tasty breakfasts but repetitive great free Wi Fi connection
440572,Abba Garden, Not so great location for la ramblas city centre Staff in this hotel are very very bad Arrogant and rude One evening we ordered food at the restaurant burgers and chips basically there was 4 of us and the food took an hour to arrive My drink didn t arrive and I had to ask for it No apologies or anything from staff Breakfast is not so great not worth the price they charge There are some great restaurants in Barcelona I would recommend to go to those instead , Hotel was clean and tidy Poor location but we knew this before arriving so this was ok also we were there to watch the football and for this it was a good location 
440573,Abba Garden, The location is a little bit of a problem if you are not used to walking But the metro station L3 is on a 10 15 minutes walk The only problem is when you are going back to the hotel you have to climb up a little bit because the hotel is on little hill , The bed was extra large and we had a very good sleep Our room was big enough to fulfill our needs Toilet was new and very clean Good value for the money The staff is very kind and polite They showed us the metro stations and gave us map from the city We left our baggage in the morning at the reception for almost all day because our flight was at 09 45 p m They didn t made any problem from it 
440574,Abba Garden, Some problems with the door key had to return several times to reception in order to learn how to unlock it Very loud disco Saturday night able to hear on third floor finished at 3 15am Small range of room service food, Clean comfortable room Friendly staff who wanted to help Good breakfast Good wifi
440575,Abba Garden, Only let down unwelcoming unhelpful and generally miserable staff Breakfast a bit overpriced for what was on offer , Great hotel ideally situated Big comfortable beds 
440576,Abba Garden, Dated decor no good for tourists to Barna too big to be personal too expensive for what it is it a an 80 90 euro a night place not a 120 euro a night needs more lifts, Staff nice and friendly location quiet big rooms with a double door so cuts noise
440577,Abba Garden, Quite a long way from the centre of town and difficult to find somewhere to withdraw money No shops nearby , Clean and comfortable hotel Helpful staff and a good breakfast Fast free internet Fairly close to airport 
440578,Abba Garden, Staff not friendly at all maybe could be due to lack of English Poor customer service Not allowed to take anything from the dining area to your room No hot refreshments supplied in the rooms ie tea bags milk and kettle , Breakfast wide selection sauna steam room pool and wifi
440579,Abba Garden, The location isn t good even though we were going to the university which is close it was still a long way up a hill and all the transport options were down the hill , Nice enough standard hotel 
440580,Abba Garden, Waiters in the bar are polite but almost everyday we waited for them at least 10 minutes sometimes over half an hour The restaurant there is opened only during lunchtime which is a pity since the menu was excellent , Location was calm and there was a nice view from the room to the hills Swimming pool is in perfect condition with no time regulations great quality of beds There is a superb restaurant nearby El Caliu
