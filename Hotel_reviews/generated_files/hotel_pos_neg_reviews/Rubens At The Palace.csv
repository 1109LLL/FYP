170437,Rubens At The Palace, That we couldn t stay longer , The room was very comfortable quiet and spacious The location was fabulous the Royal Mews were directly across the street from the front doorway of the hotel The staff was very warm and welcoming in particular the Director of Bars Silviu The Rubens was simply wonderful 
170438,Rubens At The Palace, The property was dated room was extremely small Adequate but for the rate paid not a good value Many of the guests met were finishing Cruises and I suspect the rate paid was much lower than the rate on booking Room was not available on arrival and it was apparent that was a result of at least one cruise arriving at the same time One of two rooms was upgraded but alas it would seem the party that guaranteed the reservation would have gotten an upgrade reception desk was indifferent to request for an upgrade for the second room booked , Location was very good for a leisure trip to Londons tourist areas and fast access to metro
170439,Rubens At The Palace, Could have been a little more drawer space and a fridge also food in the hotel was like all of London expensive, Location was excellent Room was clean and bathroom extras were good Staff were very friendly and helpfull 
170440,Rubens At The Palace, Kettle didnt work in room next morning and sockets not well positioned for moirror or bedside, The staff were uniformly excellent and the service ethic was obvious throughout
170441,Rubens At The Palace, Could not have been any better, The location is perfect the hotel gorgeous the staff couldn t do enough for us Have been twice and have 2 more trips planned 
170442,Rubens At The Palace, We had no problems , Very helpful and friendly staff and excellent location of hotel for our purposes Also love the valet parking and the breakfast was very good 
170443,Rubens At The Palace, I ordered room service for both dinner and breakfast Dinner was really lovely though it took over an hour to turn up which wasn t what I was advised when I ordered it Never mind though it really was nice Breakfast however was not Eggs benedict with toasted muffins that were so hard I couldn t cut them Coffee was really good though , The hotel is impressive clean and very opulent Really lovely welcoming staff and the location is fantastic 
170444,Rubens At The Palace, I could not get Wifi in my room 122 The air conditioning was a little fierce even on a low fan I felt as if I was in a gale, Whilst the room was not large it was very wel appointed quiet and the bed was Erycomforts le
170445,Rubens At The Palace, Our room was tiny and not the easiest to navigate with steps up just inside the door and a tight squeeze to the furthest side of the bed I would be make sure I checked out my room spec with the hotel before booking in future, The location is excellent A short walk from Victoria station makes all of London s sites and attractions easily accessible and who wouldn t want to be staying over the road from Buckingham Palace The public rooms are lovely and we had full English breakfasts served thankfully not buffet so hot and to our own taste 
170446,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing, Very friendly and service minded staff Very central particularly if you travel to Gatwick and Victoria Station Nice interior and rooms a very good experience 
170447,Rubens At The Palace, Absolutely nothing, Fantastic friendly staff stunning inside and out a night of sheer luxury breakfast was delicious Our room overlooked the palace news double glazing kept out the noise of any traffic and I have never seen such thick curtains we slept so well with room blacked out added bonus of great air conditioning
170448,Rubens At The Palace, everything, The door man when we arrived did not help us at all with our cases i have a weak right arm and my wife suffers from arthritis The door of our room 427 could only just be opened as the bed was across the room blocking our overall entry There was about 12 inches to get passed the bed so our suitcases had to be lifted over the bed to get them into the room The kettle for hot water was broken and would not work and although our checkout was 1200 hrs the next day builders started work at 0745 hours just outside our room so we were woken up by loud voices and building work going on We were given a 30 percent reduction on our bill when i complained and an offer of an upgrade if we book again which i think is derisory for what we put up with Also they offered a bottle of champagne we don t drink I am a very unhappy customer 
170449,Rubens At The Palace, Good small room chosen for what we needed but a general sense of the room being tired e g very old duvet furniture scratched chipped I suppose just not what was expected of a hotel of this reputation and expected quality , Very helpful staff great location for us as so near to garden party 
170450,Rubens At The Palace, They were remodelling the dinning room The tables in bar and tea room were a bit small I m 6 5 and my legs wouldn t fit under the tables Not a real big deal ,No Positive
170451,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Travelling on a wedding birthday trip we had a very warm welcoming Thanks to the hotel staff for all their kindness Perfect choice for Victoria area 
170452,Rubens At The Palace, Renovations outside original room We re Moved without fuss but then heard a lot of noise from above even though asked for quiet room, Traditional hotel friendly staff
170453,Rubens At The Palace, Breakfast is quite expensive and the chairs do not fit beneath the tables in the dinning room restaurant so need to sit back from table and stretch over when eating Rooms a bit small , I have stayed at The Rubens several times now It is very handy for Victoria Station The staff have always been very friendly and helpful The rooms I find are a bit small but they are clean I travelled to London when it was very warm but the air con in the room worked beautifully and kept the room cool Great location Little in the way of noise at night 
170454,Rubens At The Palace, Room size was extremely small for the room price it should have been a bigger room Not much room to walk around the full size bed very small , The location and staff were great Very close to Victoria station so we had easy access to The Tube and plenty of places to get a meal 
170455,Rubens At The Palace, I suffer with my back and there were no options on soft pillows to sleep with only one type available that I found too high , Lovely warm and friendly hotel in a fabulous location The staff are without exception helpful professional and courteous
170456,Rubens At The Palace, we liked everything about it, Loved the location and the staff Staff is so welcoming and helpful throughout our entire stay It is nicely located to the tube and key sites It has such a charm We will be back 
170457,Rubens At The Palace, Bedrooms a little small lights failed in our room on last night we got given 2 x small camping lights for the bathroom , Very handy to central London staff very friendly
170458,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The location is great 5 mins walk from victoria tube and train station where u can take hammersmith line straight to paddington train station The service was beyong expectation staffs are all very polite and smiley I feel very welcome as soon as I step into the hotel they are friendly and helping me with my lugguge without me having to say any word about it I will definitely coming back to this hotel next time when I visit london Super recommend
170459,Rubens At The Palace, Room configuration means the adjacent rooms bathroom cuts into your room The noises were so clear from the next rooms bathroom I could follow the guest next door around the bathroom from the noises Needs MUCH better sound insulation proofing ,No Positive
170460,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, We are just back from a wonderful stay at the Rubens It was a treat for my 14 year old son s birthday We had the lovely surprise of birthday cake in our room when we arrived I can t say enough about the staff The gentlemen on the concierge desk were so helpful and kind to my son in particular and the lovely waitress at breakfast Julia and Guadeloupe even organised for a happy birthday cake for my son at breakfast I can t thanks everyone at the Rubens enough Our first of many trips to the Rubens I don t think I d stay anywhere else 
170461,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Fantastic staff Ritz Carlton quality treatment ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen All challenges I had during my trip for which I had quite a busy and demanding schedule had been sorted out by Congierge Viktor a real hero for my father and son weekend Also reception delighted my 11 year old son with attentive surprises in our room thus making the weekend as was organized by me a great success for him Live music in a beautiful bar and a comfy hotel make it complete Thanks all 
170462,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing Everything was excellent, Very comfortable bed Room and bathroom was beautifully decorated Staff were so professional and attentive Their attention to detail was impeccable I am certain to return to rubens on my next visit to London The gift for my baby was Such a special gift and so so thoughtful Many thanks
170463,Rubens At The Palace, I am 1 72m tall and the bed room 340 was barely ok in terms of length I guess a taller person would have a serious problem to sleep , The atmosphere and the position of the hotel
170464,Rubens At The Palace, The kettle in the room looked old with grime over the joints and seals of it I suspect a good clean would work but that would need to be done every day The inside door of the bath from my first room looked like it needed some TLC with the varnish being off in strips Finally the bath robes I had hoped they would be lovely and soft like the towels were but they were rough and not as luxurious as I hoped , Bed was amazing staff were friendly and helpful and with it being a few minutes from Victoria station it was very convenient Managed to get a room swap was expecting a bath but got a shower and the next day not only was my room swapped but they moved my luggage too Also people opening the door for you at the main doors was lovely A main bin and a recycling bin were excellent additions 
170465,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing it was beautiful , It is a truly beautiful hotel The staff were lovely and even gave my husband and I a present after we completed the London Marathon protein drink and chocolates If I could afford it I would stay there every time I visited London 
170466,Rubens At The Palace, we had to leave , the bed was so comfortable the staff all helpfull and kind The best possible location for a hotel right next to Buckingham palace nice style hotel
170467,Rubens At The Palace, How close the bed was to the hotel room door but other than that I cannot fault anything else , Liked every single bit of the holiday Hotel and staff were amazing very polite and always welcoming 
170468,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, My daughter and I travelled down on the Caledonian Sleeper train artived at the hotel at 0830 in the morning looking to drop off luggage but they had a room ready and let us check in this is amazing service as we have done this before at other hotels and they don t ever offer this service
170469,Rubens At The Palace, Having to leave , The staff were so pleasant and extremely helpful and happy all had lovely smiles so important to make you feel special many thanks to them all 
170470,Rubens At The Palace, Only a small thing really the blue night light in the bathroom I couldn t work out how to turn it off Lol, Antentive staff who were more than happy to help The extra touches that Jenny arranged made it special with a personal note attached which was very much appreciated 
170471,Rubens At The Palace, Main observation to report the chairs in the library restaurant were not compatible with the tables There was a difference of appropriate nine inches deficit in the chair seat to the top of the table this was a very unnatural way to sit and enjoy the meal The seating in the breakfast area was perfect Although I did point out that the arm of my seat was loose and required some attention the food and ambiance in the library were what I was expecting as I have dined there in the past And another reason I changed hotels for my last night Birthday celebration in London hopefully on my next visit to the RUBENS my feedback to you will have been noted and possibly resolved , Staff very efficient friendly food very good hotel position ideal for walkable sightseeing 
170472,Rubens At The Palace, The double room I booked was not what I expected They checked my wife and I into one which is smaller that most other single rooms in other hotels of the same catergory There was hardly any space to move in and I kept banging into the TV and the furniture and the window which looked out into some place that resembled a construction site It was a struggle just to open our luggage and I nearly fell of the tiny double bed one morning when I awoke The hot water from the shower came at an intermitten pace so I shivered when I showered I wished I could indicate a COMFORT level lower that unsatisfactory I could not check out earlier as I have prepaid The reception staff were nonchalent and confirmed it was a double room when I notified them and werereluctant to assist in changing my room , The doormen and the porter were very helpful It was the only positive point 
170473,Rubens At The Palace, The only down side was that the corridors as they needed a little sprucing up as they were very tired and dated compared to the other areas of the hotel , The staff were all really friendly and made you feel special Great location for Buckingham Palace Large breakfast selection Nice gesture of a cake and note in our room to celebrate husband s birthday 
170474,Rubens At The Palace, The restaurants were closed due renovations Sad but what can one do , Excellent location walking distance to most of the sites Welcoming staff very friendly and helpful Room was very clean and was upgraded to a king room bonus 
170475,Rubens At The Palace, Breakfast was very expensive, Staff were excellent Friendly and accommodating The location is excellent too We were there for a visit to Buckingham Palace which is a very short walk away 
170476,Rubens At The Palace, We asked for a quiet room but there where a lot of noise from the street I am sure that hotel staff can t do anything about it Also some noise did come from the hotel because there where renovations on progress at the time Also some of the smells during the renovations gave me a quite bad headache , Friendly staff comfortable room and bed Very good breakfast I had a request for a bigger bed than i booked and we got a kingsize bed instead of a queensize that i booked so that was a very nice gesture from the hotel All and all excellence service We enjoyed our stay 
170477,Rubens At The Palace, We couldn t book a twin room online and had to pay a supplement of 30 on arrival to change to a twin Would have been good to know this prior to arrival , Duvet was a little too thick Bathroom had slight smell of Mould or damp Quite small room but perfectly comfortable 
170478,Rubens At The Palace, Too much dilapidation and repairs going on Breakfast served in bar was not great Tables too small and seating not comfortable to have breakfast Quality and choice of food could have been a lot better Where was the black pudding , Convenient location Friendly staff Traditional and smart hotel 
170479,Rubens At The Palace, We ordered 1 vegan breakfast This was more a dinner without meat rather than a breakfast It could have had beans mushrooms and vegan sausages Newspaper not delivered to room , Courteous staff opulent d cor comfortable bed clean Breakfast was copious granola and compote delicious But 
170480,Rubens At The Palace, Small rooms but think that s typical of London Very comfy and well appointed though , I got great rate by booking early Rooms are on small side but very well equipped and very comfortable I booked a superior king room which I was a little disappointed with at first but when I said that to the receptionist who had called to ask if everything was ok with the room she offered to let me see two others instead and happily moved us At breakfast there is a hot buffet but no a la carte but when I asked if they could do salmon and poached eggs for my daughter who doesn t eat meat they very happily did Staff couldn t be more helpful also doorman and concierge Great nights sleep fantastic bedding and pillows great location for Victoria Wicked We would stay here again 
170481,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay over New Year The hotel was very modern and the rooms was very clean and comfortable Also the hotel was in a brilliant location Would love to stay again in the future 
170482,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing, From when we entered the hotel we were made to feel really welcome The staff were friendly and couldn t do enough for us We intend to use this hotel in the future 
170483,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, I really liked the location and how old fashioned it was The staff were absolutely lovely The room was fabulous with a big bed and really decorated beautifully The bathroom was a good size with a great shower that come out the ceiling A big television and tea and coffee making facilities Really loved it you could imagine how glamourous and elegant it was years ago Definitely worth tourists staying as a real English charm about the place Loved it 
170484,Rubens At The Palace, The only issue with the excellent breakfast was that the cooked choices could have been hotter , Everything about Ruben s is first rate Will most certainly stay again 
170485,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Can not thank the staff enough for all the little extras they did for my mothers birthday Certainly made her first trip to London a memorial one Great location great service five stars 
170486,Rubens At The Palace, We knew the room was small but it was really small and the bed did not feel like a double The electronic blinds did not work in the room so the first night we had to sleep with them open as it was late when we got in the room They were sorted the next day and were closed but the following morning we could not open the blinds Breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice but not worth the money , The room was quirky it looked inviting and was snuggly warm The bed was really comfy The bathroom was a good size and the water was always hot It was spotless clean plus the staff were helpful and polite It was perfect for exploring and underground networks The afternoon tea and dining area was lovely but expensive 
170487,Rubens At The Palace, The light switches were very confusing think they d been wired wrong That s about the only complaint , Breakfast choice was excellent staff very friendly and courteous 
170488,Rubens At The Palace, This is a nice hotel but we were maybe unlucky My wife was in the bath and I was in a dressing robe and all of a sudden there was a man in our room He said he was stocking the fridge Scared us both Phoned reception to check he was with Rubens and they confirmed and said they would talk to him The room should have been prepared properly and staff should wait for a reply before walking in I put the bolt across after that but we had gone from relaxed to oh my god there s a man in our room Then we had a smell of burning we checked phone chargers hair dryers etc Eventually realised the light for the picture was stuck on the top of the door and heating up There were burn marks on top of the door Reported to reception who said it was newly refurbished and they would check The only other thing that might have been a problem was at breakfast our toast and coffee didn t turn up until after we d finished eating This was solved by a free glass of champagne though turned the situation into a positive We only stayed one night so having a man in our room and then trying to locate a smell of burning wrote the whole thing off I did mention these things at the time but didn t make a big deal of it as I didn t want to waste even more of our own time , Good location for us Very comfortable Looks lovely at Christmas Booking in was very smooth even though they were busy 
170489,Rubens At The Palace, An Air Convector heating system was surprising As it was a small room It was far too hot and drying to leave on for any length of time Our electric blinds turned themselves on and opened at 3am Asides from that it was well equipped and very comfortable for a double room , We loved the Location The Staff were fantastic and the Xmas Decor was very beautiful Nice touches like soup on offer after the NYE celebrations Recommended 
170490,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was great Staff were very pleasant from the moment we arrived to moment we left They made sure we were settled and enjoying our stay Facilities were top notch and very comfortable they did mention that they were going to have a refurbishment in following weeks Location was amazing short walks away from the main attractions underground close enough if you don t want to walk I would recommend this hotel to anyone very impressed 
170491,Rubens At The Palace, The unexpected fire alarm in the middle of the night , the location was superb staff was also really helpfull The hairdryer was broken but within 30 min we received a new one 
170492,Rubens At The Palace, Hard to criticise as this place is the best Shower above bath came from the ceiling My preference is from the wall with a hose Room was one of the smallest in the place Although luxurious a little cramped , Luxurious throughout The staff make this place Professional courteous and extremely helpful Some very nice personal touches too a hand written welcome note from the manager and some handmade cookies in the room Location is ideal Buckingham Palace just over the road Westminster Big Ben etc just a short walk away Surrounded by traditional English pubs in side streets Shopping areas within walking distance 
170493,Rubens At The Palace, The room was rather cold central heating did nothing and despite calling the front desk and asking for assistance it still did nothing The view from the rooms is rather bad if you get a room in the back of the hotel , Very friendly staff wonderful reception and lobby area with live piano music Outstanding location as you can get to the Buckingham guard change in 5 minute and to the horse parade in 15 while still being very quiet and discrete 
170494,Rubens At The Palace, Price of the bar, The Christmas theme and excellent customer service especially the concierge the old gentleman who got us taxis etc was such a cockney gentleman
170495,Rubens At The Palace, There seemed to be a lack of waiting staff at breakfast I had to go and look for someone to enquire about tea and coffee , Hotel was warm cosy and relaxing 
170496,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The room size and facilities were excellent the Hotel was well placed for our visit to the Palace to meet the Queen and Duke the staff were very friendly and helpful 
170497,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The entire staff team were excellent Great location very good room extremely comfortable bed Great bar and lounge area Superb food and drinks Top class 
170498,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Concierge and doormen were very friendly and helpful Hotel room was a bit small but beautifully furnished and equipped Stayed one night with my daughter and we both enjoyed very much 
170499,Rubens At The Palace, After a shower the bathroom turned into a swimming pool due to the leakage of the shower , Nice room in old English style in an traditional old English Hotel with wooden floors
170500,Rubens At The Palace, The room was very dark which was a little problematic as we were getting ready for a wedding The TV was very small the volume restricted to such a level that we couldn t watch it Initial reception at the hotel was welcoming but thereafter little interest shown in us we were not asked how our daughter s wedding went or wished well for the day , We were upgraded to a royal room which was very sumptuous lovely bathroom comfortable bed 
170501,Rubens At The Palace, food in the bar was disappointing Mushroom ravioli was very very salty the mushrooms sauce and the pasta was bland also disappointed with the festive cocktail cosmopolitan with gingerbread too much cranberry juice no gingerbread I suspect ground ginger I feel it was over priced for what it was , staff were professional and courteous down to the doorman and concierge Excellent location Lovely old style hotel beautiful d cor loved the red bar velvet walls and seats The room was an adequate size great shower and the bed was very comfortable Enough space to move around and plenty of storage too Very clean Beautiful Christmas decorations tree Stayed for 2 nights for my birthday staff were aware would have been nice to have been acknowledged even with a chocolate on the pillow just a small gesture maybe to make me feel important 
170502,Rubens At The Palace, The room we were allocated was very small and needed renovation However after l complained we were moved to a much nicer room , Location is excellent very close to Victoria Station Customer service was great Breakfast was excellent Room was very nice and the bed was very comfy 
170503,Rubens At The Palace, Seriously overrated and as a consequence overpriced Tiny rooms offered as double Impossible to pass to one side of the small bed because the television was in the way Toilet seat dangerously loose Door lock only worked occasionally , Location though getting there from Victoria station is a real obstacle course Staff were pretty nice and obliging When I was checking out two other guests were complaining about room size Generally handled with equanimity 
170504,Rubens At The Palace, Room was very small and the bath was discoloured , The breakfast was great staff were too Free wi fi bedding prime quality and very comfy as were the towels etc Did not have time to eat there in the PM but menu looked very nice Christmas decorations were lovely whole place was very opulent
170505,Rubens At The Palace, Can t think of anything i disliked and would certainly recommend the Rubens to my friends , Breakfast very good staff very helpful and friendly Overall excellent location for our visit to the Palace 
170506,Rubens At The Palace, Night before Asked for for a taxi for 6 45am as had to be at hospital for 7 15am Taxi was not there no one appeared to be trying to get us one so I had to go out of the front entrance to hail a taxi down Only then did the conceage react Had lunch at the hotel 2 teas and a prawn and crayfish brioche roll 30 00 Was then charged 3 75 service charge I object to being automatically charged as I always leave a tip Plus as a guest staying at the hotel I thought this was unnecessary When eating in the carvery in the evening lots of staff chatting at entrance and waiter placed my bread onto my plate across me rather than walk round Not good Didn t appear to be any disapline or leadership around the staff and from my own personal experience not well organised No biscuits in room Had a very early start in the morning would of liked to have ordered breakfast in our room Was advised breakfast didn t start till 6 30am Only 1 toilet on ground floor , Bed was very comfortable Carvery was very good Lovely heavy curtains in room which was very good as building opposite had their lights on all night Water in room Lovely furnishing 
170507,Rubens At The Palace, Slow service at breakfast Hotel needs a spruce up Staff were unaware we had been at hotel on two previous occasions Price of food and drink , Close to Buckingham Palace 
170508,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing, We have stayed at the Rubens on many occasions and found the staff very friendly and helpful it is one of our favourite London hotels in a very good location only a short walk to Victoria station and bus stop The London tour bus stops outside the hotel We have read comments about difficulty parking we find it easy to park behind the hotel and let the concierge take the car to a secure car park 
170509,Rubens At The Palace, The Classic room was a little small but very well equipped it would have benefitted from a lighter decor , We enjoyed the best ever hotel breakfast at Rubens The quality of the food and the service in the dining room was exceptional The hotel has beautiful traditional decor throughout All staff were particularly friendly 
170510,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, We were upgraded to a suite a nice surprise Staff were very considerate to guests The quality of the carvery meal and breakfast were very good 
170511,Rubens At The Palace, Room was barely a double had to duck underneath TV to reach one side of bed High London price for small room, Staff throughout public rooms were good and bed comfortable Location excellent for Buckingham Palace Victoria area 
170512,Rubens At The Palace, OUGHT TO HAVE BOOKED ROOM WITH KING SIZEBED AND FRIDGE , Exceptional service from all staff All comforts cared for Nothing too much trouble Excellent food Both Old Masters and library Resturants full of atmosphere Great experiences
170513,Rubens At The Palace, Would prefer better quality bread for toast I asked one member of the waiting staff for a spoon and she made me feel I was being difficult She didn t return with a spoon so I had to find someone else to ask This was a minor issue as the rest of the stay was superb , The staff were very attentive and friendly especially Martha on the front desk She made sure our stay was special for my birthday celebration The room was superb A luxury treat Sumptuous bed and very quiet The room was spotlessly clean I was impressed that even the remote controls were sanitised I loved the pillow spray and little extra thoughts The carvery food was delicious Good choice at breakfast Easy access to bus and train routes 
170514,Rubens At The Palace, The basic single room is small Next time I would upgrade to a little larger room but otherwise it was perfectly fine for sleeping , Very comfortable bed lovely decor 
170515,Rubens At The Palace, My single room felt a little cramped, The taff were exceptionally attentive helpful nothing was too much trouble The hotel itself was beautiful 
170516,Rubens At The Palace, Room was quite small and double bed was more like an oversized single Kettle leaked though we didn t find this out until day of departure , Lovely luxury hotel in great location Warm and friendly welcome from staff They accommodated us by providing a low floor as far as they could do The service provided by the staff was excellent Would highly recommend this hotel 
170517,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Bed was extremely comfortable that I did not want to get up next morning Piping hot water in the bathroom Reception staff very polite When I got home from work after checking out there was an email to thank me for my visit and they had taken details of my next visit and hoped that I enjoyed my next time in London So taken with their hospitality I have booked another stay for when I next go out in London 
170518,Rubens At The Palace, The room was a little bijou , Lots of great examples of customer service including the phone call 10 mins into our room to check that everything was fine swift answers to questions and a seemingly genuine smile on everyone s faces communicating a wish that they wanted to be of service 
170519,Rubens At The Palace, Only thing I can think of to mention and of no great consequence and did not detract from our enjoyable stay at the Rubens is that floorboards in Room 328 are rather noisy , Staff on arrival were very welcoming and helpful I think Matilda was the name Patrick on leaving hotel dealt with our closing of final account was excellent as were staff in lounge and bar 
170520,Rubens At The Palace, Room required some detailed maintenance faulty window blind curtain hanging off track Smallish room but typical for London Pricey, Great location near Victoria and Buckingham Palace Good Breakfast Comfy bed
170521,Rubens At The Palace, We booked a Superior King room and when we checked in were advised we were being upgraded sounds good however the first floor room 123 were were allocated had no view being one small window looking at a wall only a meter away Bathroom also very small however Bedroom a good size , The Staff Service was very good all round Restaurant food and presentation also good Air Conditioning the quietest we have experienced in a Hotel Bedroom 
170522,Rubens At The Palace, Each night housekeeping forgot something either two washcloths or bath mat soap or bath gel in the bathroom , Staff were very nice nice drinks in the bar 
170523,Rubens At The Palace, My small double was stylish with nice touches but I would not have wanted to share as it was small for two , Really comfortable traditional hotel Staff were superb professional but friendly and very helpful I would stay again 
170524,Rubens At The Palace, At afternoon tea the dishes and silverware were all dirty from what looked like several previous uses , Best bathtub and most comfortable bed I ve ever had the pleasure of enjoying Excellent location with quick access to Victoria train tube coach stations as well as a straight shot to St Pancras International The Bag O Nails pub on the corner had excellent service yummy food Within walking minutes of Buckingham Palace The Mall and Westminster Borough 
170525,Rubens At The Palace, Bar meals drinks expensive and somewhat slow service on the Thursday night, Full English Breakfasts very good value for money Wide selection with freshly cooked eggs Very good service from all staff
170526,Rubens At The Palace, Rooms are very different from each other so don t have one single style in mind if you don t request a specific room number Make sure you book breakfast included , Very warm and welcoming staff My children felt so welcome They even had small Harry Potter letters and surprises since we had told the hotel that we were on a Harry Potter inspired weekend The hotel is british in the most positive sense and location is perfect just jump on a double decker bus and discover London 
170527,Rubens At The Palace, Being told that our room wasn t ready and when I had asked for a low floor we were given one on the 4th floor We were disappointed this time , It was very nice except when we arrived our room wasn t ready so we were told to go and have a drink which cost us over 11 00 for a cup of tea this I feel should have been complimentary as our room should have been ready We were then told by reception that we couldn t t have an evening meal between 5 and 7 as it was fully booked I then went and saw the restaurant manager who booked us a table without any problem When we sat down for our evening meal there were several tables unoccupied so why were we told that the restaurant was full 
170528,Rubens At The Palace, Elevator small old and slow Rooms very small Location excellent for Buckingham Palace but at least five blocks from tube , Classy staff Good buffet both breakfast and dinner 
170529,Rubens At The Palace, My first room was inside with little to natural light After they moved me it was great The building is old so keep that in mind , The staff location and breakfast were great It s a quick walk to bukingham palace A little longer walk to Westminster abbey Big Ben and so much more 
170530,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, great location great breakfast to start off the day and then relaxing with the Times in the comfortable lounge before beginning our daily tour of the city
170531,Rubens At The Palace, NA, Extremely friendly and very helpful staff Traveling from the US and exhausted we were able to check in earlier and a room was available for us We were always greeted in the lobby Exceptionally clean Willing to call for taxi make dinner reservations if we needed 
170532,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The fact that I can t think of anything that I we didn t like From the time you walk through the front doors the doorman the reception staff concierge dining room our room the view from the room road works aside proximity for most things touristy you are made to feel special and cost becomes irrelevant 
170533,Rubens At The Palace, Was offered complimentary copy of Times during our stay which we accepted but it never transpired Took our own luggage upto our room upon arrival Decor is tired and faded and rooms quite small Also there was some renovation work ongoing during our stay leading to reduced facilities eg lifts , Location was key as its a few mins walk to Victoria train station and Buckingham Palace to the other side central to everything we needed Rooms were adequate Also concierge was good in allowing us to leave our luggage after check out until we were ready to leave London 
170534,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The public areas of the hotel are lovely but the rooms are getting a little tired and could probably do with a bit of attention The staff were great and very helpful I would stay here again no problem 
170535,Rubens At The Palace, The fact that we could only stay one night , We stayed in a beautifully appointed Royal Suite room on the 3rd floor overlooking a side entrance to Buckingham Palace Breakfast was delicious well presented and the staff so courteous which made a lovely start to the day We were greeted by friendly professional and smiling staff throughout the hotel and made to feel so welcome from the moment we checked in until our all too soon departure

170538,Rubens At The Palace, I have no complaints but would have liked a larger TV, On arrival the staff member was very friendly and welcoming We were unable to have our room on arrival as we were too early so we stored our cases as we were going to a show When we got back at 10ish the same delightful lady was on duty She remembered my name which I thought was amazing and she upgraded us to a suite opposite the mews as we told her that we I loved the Royal family The room was wonderful and the lady rang us to ask if we were happy with the room I am sorry I don t remember her name but she is a credit to the hotel The bed was really comfortable and the breakfast and lunch were great too I would highly recommend the hotel great location near to Victoria coach and rail stations and Buckingham Palace One of the best hotels I have stayed in for customer service
170539,Rubens At The Palace, While I was in my room staff on TWO occasions let themselves in I m not sure if they thought no one was in my room but seriously no knock first It was super annoying and I wasn t able to relax fully since I was never sure if someone was just going to invite themselves in , A great location Great breakfast

170547,Rubens At The Palace, Royal Mews room was slightly on the small side with a huge TV cabinet which if taken out would have provided more room TV could only be seen from one side of the bed Apart from that a very pleasant room with a comfortable bed , Carvery was amazing So tasty and served between 5 7pm so if going to the theatre was ideal Very quiet within the Royal Mews section of the hotel with private corridor off main walkway I shall definitely book that again Staff very friendly and helpful 
170548,Rubens At The Palace, It took quite a long time to get me checked in 20 30 min and before entering the hotel the front door was locked In the morning some of the personnel entered my room without my permission I don t even know what the purpose was of the entering They also did not have a hair dryer and there we re some stains in the wall and on the chair probably because of intensive use not fresh stains At midnight they didn t have all the foods that were mentioned in the roomservice folder , I loved the food breakfast in the morning and the people served with a smile

170553,Rubens At The Palace, The room was extremely hot With the air conditioner set as low as it could possibly be the room still remained so hot You could feel the cold air coming out of the vent but for some reason it was not remaining in the room It was so uncomfortable that we called for a fan and they brought one up to us immediately It made a very big difference and helped the room become enjoyable If the fan were not available we would not have been able to remain in the same room , The location is amazing so close to Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Station Great staff very attentive and helpful Excellent staff at the concierge desk 
170554,Rubens At The Palace, By bathroom floor was very wet at 6 PM when I arrived I had to mop it with the bath mat, I am a coeliac your arrNgements for gluten free food at the evening dinner I attended were e cel lent as was the food I will certainly come again if I can afford it

170560,Rubens At The Palace, Room needs MORE lighting and drawer space Shower controls difficult to reach and figure out Somewhat expensive , Location VERY convenient to Victoria Station and Buckingham Palace and major bus routes and Friendly helpful staff 
170561,Rubens At The Palace, food in the bar was poor and expensive 2 meal both served cold although breakfast was lovely, great location to Victoria station and underground worth having front bedroom as view of the mews was interesting
170562,Rubens At The Palace, Slightly more modern decor maybe All lovely and clean and tidy just a little old fashioned Our room was beautiful with walls covered in fabric and a great view over the Royal Mews , Staff seriously friendly Felt very personal they even had a cake with Happy Birthday written in chocolate ready for my daughter in our room

170564,Rubens At The Palace, The first room we were given didn t live up to the reviews or the photos on the website for the same standard of room We were initially very disappointed However after speaking to reception we were shown three alternative rooms all of which were exactly what we were expecting and we selected from those Can t say fairer than that , The staff were all very friendly and the coffee in the bar comes with very large home made cookies Location excellent

170566,Rubens At The Palace, All the pictures on the website show grand suites not what you get Could almost touch the walls from the bed literally not enough room to swing the proverbial cat More of a small double than a double Shower set the firealarm off apparently my fault for leaving the bedroom bathroom door open Dated looking room, Lovely old style hotel great service in the bar at reception 
170567,Rubens At The Palace, Wouldn t allow me to charge the company credit card initially provided I had to pay out off pocket upon checkout despite being told earlier by a different member of staff that I would be able to Really ruined my stay at the hotel Will not return , Location

170572,Rubens At The Palace, Cleanliness in the bathroom around the edges of the bath needed bleach the overflow needed a scrub around the outside twas black with mould there were marks on the tiles We hung up all the towels and when serviced the following morning they took a large one away and didn t replace it Cocktails were expensive and not to the standard you would expect for the price , We were upgraded as it was our anniversary and when we got to the room there was a beautiful cake hand written card The bed was truly scrumptious and so comfortable Location was great too very easy to get around The room was very red with plastic red shiny chairs which made us laugh The staff were lovely friendly

170576,Rubens At The Palace, Seeing that I was paying more than the average hotel prices a few more teabags on the hospitality tray would have been appreciated along with a couple of biscuits I also thought the meal in the Carvery Restaurant was very overpriced The desk unit and desk chair in the room need an update , The location is excellent a few minutes walk to Buckingham Palace The Reception Staff were very welcoming and the Doormen were especially helpful and very pleasant Our room had a great view of the Royal Mews The bed and pillows were clean and very comfortable The clean bathroom had a good shower The buffet breakfast was excellent and I loved that the eggs were cooked to order I would certainly stay here again

170587,Rubens At The Palace, The pictures shown online of the rooms are inaccurate My room did not look anything like the photos I paid a lot of money for this room and wish it would ve been advertised appropriately The service was also not what you d expect for the money I called one day asking for turn down service for my 7 day trip and they only did it that one evening They also woke me up one morning very early around 6am to tell me the ginger ale I ordered was on its way up when I didn t order any It was a decent hotel but I would ve never spent the amount of money I did on a hotel like that If it had been like they advertised and had better service then I would have I wish I had stayed somewhere else , Breakfast was great and the location of the hotel was wonderful being right next to Buckingham palace

170613,Rubens At The Palace, Room was a bit dated and could have done with some modernising Lacked a personal touch something as simple as a free drink in the bar for anyone with a marathon medal would have pulled us in and probably ended up with us buying food and more drinks , Really good location handy for Victoria station and an easy walk to Buckingham Palace and Green Park Ideal for the marathon which was the main purpose of our visit

170636,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing It s the first time I cannot fault a hotel or its staff, Amazing if you have children Upon check in the extremely friendly staff swept my daughter away to check her in with special questions We were upgraded to a suite as it was my daughters first time in London and they wanted to make her feel like a princess We were given lots of information about London even the kind doorman was extremely knowledgable When returning to our room we discovered a child s dressing gown slippers milk and cookieS had all been left and our bed turned down The staff called and checked everything was in order After an amazing nights sleep we had breakfast which had everything you could wish for Every member of staff was so friendly and ensured we had a great stay Wouldn t stay anywhere else Great views of Buckingham palace too

170638,Rubens At The Palace, My room had been double booked and another guest was in my room when I arrived back at the hotel My case was also still in the room We were shown alternative rooms that were not comparable with the first room I had been given We were supposed to be going out for dinner before going to a show at the theatre that evening but our time to dine was reduced due to the mix up and viewing other rooms I was made to feel as if I was a problem by one particular member of staff behind the front desk Unexpected events spoilt what should have been a really memorable visit to London and a celebration of my sons achievements , When I arrived at 11 30am my room was ready and available fantastic I was meeting my son at the theatre to watch his showcase as a final year student at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland I dropped my case off at the room and left immediately The room appeared to meet all my expectations We returned at 4pm to find that another guest was settled in my room At the exact time I arrived back and tried to enter the room the other guest was just leaving After our initial shock and dismay one member of staff was particularly helpful and apologetic After viewing rooms that were unsuitable we were given a room upgrade We were also given a complimentary box of biscuits and a voucher for a drink in the bar The alternative room was splendid

170651,Rubens At The Palace, I was on 4th floor and had a busy schedule found the lifts were slow at peak times I had an inside room that was very small with hardly any room around the bed and it looked out on a dull central courtyard, Breakfast was very good the staff were helpful and friendly The location was excellent for Victoria and surrounding area 
170652,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Hotel was clean full of character and in a great position for sight seeing The staff were friendly and helpful especially the door staff and concierge

170654,Rubens At The Palace, We did have a poor view from our room however the staff did offer to upgrade to an executive room for 30 we didn t bother as we were only staying for one night , The staff were very helpful and courteous The Hotel was well appointed and clean and in a good location The room was of average size but nicely decorated and very quiet and the bed was comfortable There was a good choice of food for breakfast 
170655,Rubens At The Palace, the room smelled like mold unfortunately no wi fi and tv not due to the Hotel as it was an outside road accident still I think the hotel should have offered something back for the trouble occured, bed confortable not in a big room but nice fluffy towels and many nice details and care restaurant staff so kind and caring nice view 
170656,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The overall comfort was excellent we love the breakfast choices are so good and very relaxed nothing is too much trouble for these people even given directions to bus stops and tube stations as we like to see the city by public transport and there advice was invaluable thankyou so much yet again for a wonderful stay at your lovely hotel x

170665,Rubens At The Palace, Bedroom was far too warm and we were unable to successfully lower the temperature, The friendliness of the staff remembered our names and greeted us personally nothing was too much bother 
170666,Rubens At The Palace, Nada, Lovely stay at the Rubens Staff were super friendly room was nice and comfortable Great location to explore London as there is a great train and bus network

170668,Rubens At The Palace, Room was a bit small but this was nothing compared to the comfort in the room , Super friendly staff Ideal location close to buckingham palace and other great places 
170669,Rubens At The Palace, When you choose an expensive hotel the one thing you expect is flexibility I mean check out time even an hour beyond 12 noon was denied whereas the general check in time being 1400 hrs Rooms were freely available so the hotel was not going full either , The location was prime the corridors rooms are small but tastefully decorated brings back the royal charm touch The staffs very professional and to the point 
170670,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Beautiful hotel with a lovely staff During my stay there was a water main break in front of the hotel not the hotel s fault which forced the hotel to shut down internet for a day They immediately added extra staff who were very apologetic and helpful The handwritten notes from managers of the hotel upon my arrival and during the water main problem were a lovely touch Great location close to Victoria Station Buckingham Palace I will return 
170671,Rubens At The Palace, No refrigerator in the room, Excellent breakfast Welcoming staff Nice building The wall of plants on the side of the hotel Near Victoria tube station
170672,Rubens At The Palace, Executive bed room was noticeably smaller than cheaper rooms that had provision for twin beds which was disappointing , Staff were extremely helpful throughout the stay
170673,Rubens At The Palace, The room was comfortable but a bit oldish the curtains could be more modern and more clean , Service breakfast were exelent Helpful and polite staff Elegant hotel 
170674,Rubens At The Palace, Old furniture not so clean everything Bad smell in corridors Shower sink and lights in the room are not working properly I wasn t able to completely switch off all light in the night And couldn t use the shower because of random water temp I m very surprised that this hotel has so high ratings It s good only for 2 stars and 3 4 times less cost , Quite good location close to Victoria station But the station is very loud and crowded around 
170675,Rubens At The Palace, Only thing what could be better was that the milk by the ceral was warm and in my opinion I prefer ice cold milk, Had an amazing experience at this hotel staff couldn t be any more helpful 
170676,Rubens At The Palace, There is quite a bit of construction in the area and most of the rooms face construction which is not only unpleasant but noisy Our room was a standard room a nice one that looked as if it had been kept up and bathroom was recently updated but faced construction right outside the window When pointing this out and asking for a quiet room we were first offered an old dated smaller room in a corner of the hotel which only had space for the bed and 1 chair When seeing that we were upset about this the concierge moved us to a Mews Views room which was nice and views were delightful but the room itself was dated and old The toilet ran for 10 minutes after flushing and made noise The carpet and walls had stains We kept the room as it was better than the original and they basically told us this is the best they can do for us The views were great and room was calm and had enough space but bathroom and overall room was old and dated Wireless Internet was spotty for 2 days and on the 3rd day it went out for 4 hours I needed to work and they are not equipped for hard wire cable Not sure if it was my room or all rooms but they were confused by the entire concept of it I sat in their hallway on the hotel computer by the elevator for 1 5 hours In turn they provided dinner and drinks at their restaurant to compensate Overall the hotel is old and dated It has some charm and the hotel staff goes above and beyond which makes up for the negative features , Nice location and nice views if you are facing Buckingham Palace Staff is very friendly and accommodating At every instance they were understanding and did all they could to help 
170677,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, We were upgraded to a lovely suite in the hotel we had a very long flight back to the UK and it was such a nice surprise to be in such comfortable surroundings we have stayed at this hotel before and it has been excellent in every aspect thankyou 
170678,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Warm approach by staff members We were given a complimentary upgrade on arrival and a good deal on the quality breakfast The room was both comfortable and well equipped with Free Wi Fi The location is perfectly placed in central London 5 mins walk from the palace gates 
170679,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Loved the hotel minutes away from Buckingham palace the room we were in which was over looking the Royal mews you could see the horses getting walked in the morning it was amazing staff were so attentive and couldn t do more to help the room was amazing the bed was so comfy it was great Also the shower in the room was fantastic I loved staying at this hotel 
170680,Rubens At The Palace, Room was rather warm could not open windows and air con seemed to have no effect , Excellent staff Thoughtfully equipped spotless comfortable rooms Will definitely use this hotel again 
170681,Rubens At The Palace, I felt the breakfast waiting staff were disorganised with one or two exceptions Curtains although lovely were so heavy I could only just close them , The Staff were excellent in the whole reception conciege and door areas A beautifully designed and functional room Excellent In room book on how to use everything 
170682,Rubens At The Palace, room was very hot and air con made no difference to temp, although small the room was comfortable and exactly what I needed for one night good choice of social areas 
170683,Rubens At The Palace, Breakfast a bit too expensive Rooms too tiny difficult to move around the bed , Wonderful people always trying to satisfy us Great location Everything was great 
170684,Rubens At The Palace, The bath needs to be regrouted and i think the hotel s interior is a little dull it is a lovely interior and could be stunning if the colours were a bit lighter All else was good no complaints , The room was cosy and the breakfast was good
170685,Rubens At The Palace, Rooms are quite antiquated and very badly need an update Sheets in my room were dirty Noisy construction next door , Great location Prompt service by staff 
170686,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, I have stayed here a few time before This time I was upgraded which was fantastic nice big room Staff always friendly helpful Handy for Victoria station
170687,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Perfect location Close to everything and very quiet at night Staff is absolutely wonderful 2nd time we have stayed here and we will be back again 
170688,Rubens At The Palace, The size of the room surprised that they can look you in the eye and charge you 186 per night for a room where you cannot pass each other at the end of the bed Decor throughout is all rather jaded and tired looking Stain on the carpet outside the bathroom door , Staff are all super friendly and helpful Breakfast was lovely eggs cooked freshly to order and a large choice of hot cold food They called to ask us if the room was OK and were willing to look into moving us however we were delayed arriving and would have been late for the theatre had we accepted the offer 
170689,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing really a little off the beaten track as far as the main shopping areas are concerned Having said that Victoria bus railway station is five minutes walk away And you are opposite Buckingham Palace which was brilliant , The whole experience we were spoilt from the moment we walked in through the front door 
170690,Rubens At The Palace, We had a lot of luggage after 3 weeks travelling which the rooms struggled to accomodate Regardless the rooms were cosy and charming , Everything Staff atmosphere location 
170691,Rubens At The Palace, The floor in the bathroom could do with a good scrub probably not so easy with marble but there were quite a few noticeable drops , Check in was an absolute dream we were early and the staff accommodated us with a smile which was most appreciated Quiet location The bed was lovely and comfy The staff were excellent and only too happy to help a great team The breakfast deal was great value for money Thank you we had a most enjoyable stay 
170692,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing We should have asked for smaller pillows but didn t sleep much so it did not matter I m sure these would have been provided on request , Staff was wonderful Breakfast was amazing and room was lovely The concierge made this a special occasion and the desk staff were also helpful and kind We used this hotel as a base for visits to the theatre and the Royal Academy of Arts Couldn t praise this hotel enough The room was upgraded when the concierge spotted the surprise flowers I had bought Nice comfortable bed 
170693,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The hotel is exquisite throughout full of elegant charm The rooms are very comfortable laid out for you every need and furnished to a high standard Breakfast was a daily delight But its the fabulous staff that make Rubens the best place to stay in London From the second you arrive outside the door you are greeted by the most friendly front of house team who all go the extra mile to welcome you take the time to chat to you and if there is absolutely anything they can do consider it done We were also very impressed with the make your own hot chocolate bar with every topping you could imaging to indulge in With first rate customer service ensuring we all felt special and welcome coupled with great food great surroundings great location Rubens is SIMPLY THE BEST 
170694,Rubens At The Palace, The lift didn t feel safe our room queen of Wales was the size of a shoe box which had a hard bed It was very dull and had the smallest TV I ve seen in years The room view was of another part of the building and we could see straight into their rooms Shower cubicle couldn t be used as the drain was blocked I almost flooded the bathroom The climb into the bath for a shower is a little dangerous and there was black all around the seal of the bath and some tiles I also got locked in the bathroom Luckily my partner was there to open the door from the outside When asked online if we could pay to check out an hour later we were told it would cost us 100 , The staff were so friendly and couldn t do enough for us Booking com stated breakfast was 21PP yet upon arrival it was only 10PP the food was absolutely lovely The style of the hotel is gorgeous and the location was fabulous for what we needed a trip to the NY fireworks 
170695,Rubens At The Palace, The quality of our sleep was pretty poor our room was next door to a housekeeping cabinet and whenever anything was put in there or a trolley banged on the wall our bed moved The floorboards were so creaky that anyone that walked past our room it felt like they were walking through it The bed was two single mattresses pushed together and it was very hard in the middle The pillows were also massive and rock hard Our friends stayed in an extremely modern hotel very close to us for a lot less , Staff were superb and very attentive concierge to the breakfast staff Breakfast was very nice 
170696,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The staff were absolutely fantastic from the moment we arrived to when we left They were friendly helpful and extremely welcoming The room we stayed in was fantastic and I couldn t recommend the hotel highly enough I will certainly be returning at some point in the near future 
170697,Rubens At The Palace, Thin walls and creaky floors meant we could hear a lot of noise from our neighbours especially unpleasant when they decide to play loud music at 2 30am , Wonderful helpful staff Great location practically everything was within a 20min walking distance worth it to take in the majesty of London also close to Victoria station and underground Clean well serviced rooms 
170698,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, The staff are amazing The room was very very small 140 and very hot There was only just room to walk around the bed We paid a lot of money for the two night stay and expected a bigger room with a bigger bed 
170699,Rubens At The Palace, We had booked a suite very cramped extremely hot with no temperature adjustment shower which didn t drain was cold At the end of my stay the preauthorisation was not removed after payment for a week , Location good
170700,Rubens At The Palace, Drinks in the bar slightly over priced , Excellent location breakfast was really good Lovely afternoon tea Rooms comfortable and all staff were pleasant 
170701,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Nothing was to much trouble for the staff They are the best advertisement for the Hotel Their local knowledge was only exceeded by their friendly approach 
170702,Rubens At The Palace, I wish they had easier to access gym facilities Also the bar restaurant is VERY pricey Head across the street for a pint if you can you ll save a few quid , Staff are always fantastic and the location is perfect for my business and some good eats Clean and comfortable
170703,Rubens At The Palace, The view over the adjacent building site and the difficulty in negotiating the way from Victoria Station owing to endless construction works neither of which was the hotel s fault , We were given an upgraded room which was beautifully comfortable The staff were so helpful they made us feel they were really interested in doing their best for us 
170704,Rubens At The Palace, The lounge area for guests is very small however there are other lounges dining areas in the hotel As guests after a long day of shopping we wanted a cup of tea in the bar and found one member of staff very unaccommodating There was no space in the lounge and despite there being so many free tables in the afternoon tea room we were left standing until a table came free We also found the drinks very expensive , Staff on arrival were friendly and waiting staff in lounge were good also the doormen were fantastic and great at getting us a taxi We had a clean spacious bathroom Bed was comfortable and had a good sleep The location is fantastic and so close to Buckingham palace and Victoria It s perfect for getting to any area of London We went in December and liked the festive decorations 
170705,Rubens At The Palace, The decor was a little dated but it added character to the hotel so I wouldn t say it was a bad thing , The staff were fantastic always so friendly and helpful The door staff remembered us every time we walked back into the hotel and made conversation with us Any time we met a member of staff in the corridor or in any other part of the hotel they always gave us a big smile and said hello Little things like this made us feel like valued customers I had emailed to say it was my husbands 30th birthday and when we arrived in the room they had make him a cake and left a message It was a lovely surprise The hotel is very well located It is less than a 5 minute walk to Victoria station and Buckingham Palace Breakfast was delicious Was a bit unsure what to expect when I heard it was buffet style but the quality was amazing so fresh and tasty And fantastic eggs made fresh Definitely worth paying extra for 
170706,Rubens At The Palace, Bedroom a little small i hate showers over baths in this day and age, Late sunday checkout very polite efficent staff daily carvery Very comfortable bed Able to book half board
170707,Rubens At The Palace, The beds are a bit dated bumpy center but still comfortable, The staff was super friendly and helpful The English breakfast is worth EVERY PENNY WOW the decor is different from room to room you almost want to change rooms every day to see what you get Extremely close to buckinham palace front yard for changing of the guard 5 minute walk only a block from a major tube station their national mall and lots of gift stores BEST WATER PRESSURE EVER regretted coming home to our shitty shower after this TBH we are talking under 5 minutes to draw a bath and enough Hot water to boil a heard of elephants we are talking endless hot water 
170708,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing , It s nice to see old style values are still available in some hotels Additionally our evening meal in the library restaurant was excellent 
170709,Rubens At The Palace, Slightly small sized room , Very nice room very nice bar very friendly and helpful staff very generous Sunday late check out thank you so much great location 
170710,Rubens At The Palace, Tired and dated bathroom furniture grouting needs freshening up and a difficult to operate shower , The welcome when the door was opened for us was good the concierge staff were very helpful and Friendly as were the staff throughout the hotel Breakfast timing was good 0730 to 1200 and it was a good buffet Close roximity to Victoria station and theatres 
170711,Rubens At The Palace, With the exception of creaky floorboards in the hallways obviously because its an old building there is absolutely nothing we would change about the hotel , It was hard to fault this wonderfully located and nostalgic hotel Right on the doorstep of Buckingham Palace and less than a 2 minute walk from Victoria Station The staff were exceptional and the room was one of the most comfortable we have ever stayed in 
170712,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Great location able to walk to many of the sites also big bus tour stop outside hotel Rooms compact but spotless Beautiful breakfast and all staff extremely helpful Would definitely stay here again

170716,Rubens At The Palace, The bar is not so good the ale they served was old, very traditional english style hospitality Very regal indeed it is more than a 4 stars experience compare with elsewhere
170717,Rubens At The Palace, 174 on a basic room only basis is quite expensive given the length of time you actually spend in the room Room looked out onto construction site but then again we did only have a basic room , The staff were excellent very friendly and helpful Great location and easy access to Buckingham Palace swell as being a 2 minute walk from Victoria station 
170718,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Staff are so friendly and helpful and made our stay all more special cake for anniversary in our room on arrival superb service highly recommend anyone to stay at Rubens excellent
170719,Rubens At The Palace, I have nothing negative to say at all , The warm hospitality and special thoughtfulness alongside a real attention to detail and willingness to help and ensure we were happy and had everything we needed for our special stay which was a rare holiday with my 2 grown up children for the special occasion of my investiture at Buckingham Palace 
170720,Rubens At The Palace, Some of the rooms look like something out of a cheap motel decor wise You do have to check and specify what room you are getting allocated on booking , The staff are superb 
170721,Rubens At The Palace, Nothing at all It was a perfect stay , Staff are extremely attentive Had a phone call from reception shortly after we arrived in our room to check we were happy with everything and then when we got back to the room on our first night there was a hotel postcard put through the door asking was everything ok Lovely touches The hotel is stunning and we had fab views onto Buckingham Palace Mews It was a great location for getting around everywhere Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again tomorrow The Red carnations everywhere were a beautiful touch 
170722,Rubens At The Palace, Housekeeping banging on the door at 8 20am is never good Staff were a little indifferent receptionist was a robot , Great location Doorman was very welcoming
170723,Rubens At The Palace, Comfortable cleans and quite old school hotel but too expensive for the quality offered Location has lots of construction works going on which is also a negative point , Fairly friendly staff Good breakfast but pricey
170724,Rubens At The Palace, Couldn t find a fault , The staff were outstanding Everyone was helpful professional and friendly I will definitely recommend this hotel and return to it 
170725,Rubens At The Palace, Although the rooms have just about every facility and comfort feature boy oh boy are they small Would i stay there again Yes as a single traveler but i would want something larger as a couple, Staff friendliness and efficiency Food and ambiance 
170726,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, surprisingly my room was already ready for check in at 12 30 pm the very friendly doorman who calls a taxi for you and opens the door it s the little things The fast and friendly room service yummy drinks at the hotel bar Super friendly staff a very lovely british room very clean and very close to Westminster Cathedral Jamie Oliver Gordon Ramsay Westminster Abbey London Eye Buckingham Palace and walking distance to Victoria Station I would recommend this to everyone who s looking for a typical british experience I will definitely go back i loved it 
170727,Rubens At The Palace, Small rooms but say acceptable Could had been at least a little larger The hotel is smaller than one thinks when looking at the pictures , Breakfast and the Breakfast area were great The location was excellent 
170728,Rubens At The Palace, The floors are a bit too squeaky It came to the point where I avoided having to walk over the floors late at night as I might be disturbing guests situated on the floor below me I could definitely hear the squeak from the floor above me , The staff were very friendly and helpful They really made you feel welcome and at home The room and bathroom are clean and comfortable Location was good quite near to the sights and Victoria station 
170729,Rubens At The Palace, The bed was worn out My side was over firm and my wife s side was sagging The view of the courtyard was indeed stunning but in the worst way , Location was excellent staff were excellent room was tidy and clean Dinning options were very convenient 
170730,Rubens At The Palace, Deluxe room next to the lift resulted in noise vibration This room should be classed as a standard room Feel that the rooms should be made up before 3 30pm,No Positive
170731,Rubens At The Palace,No Negative, Stayed in an executive suite for a very good price The room was really nicely decorated very traditional and the sheets were beautiful quality The breakfast was excellent and booked via reception was 10 which I thought was really good value Staff were all very attentive and very cheerful I would definitely stay here again
