495470,Best Western Hotel Major, The bed was ok but not a great hotel if you don t like firm , Staff were very helpfull with great restaurant recommendations brought to my room a kettle and tea set and iron board to use no charge They called us lots of taxis at different time all came in 3 to 8 min Air conditioner good and window opened if preferred Great location felt very safe and just steps to metro lots of restaurants and supermarket very close 
495471,Best Western Hotel Major, The bed was a little firmer than I prefer The price was higher than other similar places in Italy Milan is pricey , The place was close to Metro and if you are a bit of an adventurer like I you can walk to the Duomo from this location along tree lined streets There were a couple of restaurants near enough to walk to also so that was nice We did not rent a car while in Italy so the proximity to the Metro and being able to walk to sights was the main appeal for this hotel It was far enough from the town center to not be as pricey or crowded with tourists and yet convenient to metro transportation 
495472,Best Western Hotel Major, Private parking not available as advertised on internet Staff was kind to help us out find an appropriate slot Cleanliness can be improved , Good location right next to the Tube station and quite conveniently located to the highway Breakfast was good could do with a slightly wider choice Staff was helpful helped with the parking as my car wouldn t fit their standard parking space
