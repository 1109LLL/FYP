159365,Eiffel Trocad ro, False advertising Parking is not on sight It is close by but u have to go 3 floors underground and are working with centimeters to get in Don t even try unless u have a tiny smart car , William was the best part of the trip He made our stay much more pleasant Walking distance to Effiel Tower The bed was comfortable other then that is a regular Paris hotel Tiny hall ways Old facility Not 4 star More like 2 
159366,Eiffel Trocad ro, Creepy small and expensive parking lot inside the garage it cost 30 day You don t have much choice of the breakfast but it taste good it s all organic foods and there s no rice Just some cereals bread eggs and jam The toilet and the bathroom is separate the toilet will smell good at first but will smell bad once you use once , I love the shower it s kind of a very unique shower that I ve ever been The room was clean and smell good The bathroom has big mirror The service is good and the receptionists were very friendly The place is close to the metro 
159367,Eiffel Trocad ro, Tiny toilet cubicle separate from room beware tall people My 6ft 3 partner struggled to sit down on it , Rooms comfortable location and communication from staff was excellent particularly in the lead up The staff sent out a survey asking details about our trip and if there was anything specific that they could prepare for us and by email ahead of time provided public transport instructions and presented us with the requested city map on arrival Location was excellent with good access to public transport 
159368,Eiffel Trocad ro, The toiletries were not in the room but you had to request at reception, Location building and views comfortable and quite and 5 minutes away from the best views of Eiffel Tower 
159369,Eiffel Trocad ro, There was no view as indicated at the time of booking , The staff were lovely gorgeous quaint hotel with lots of charm in quiet area Clean comfortable accessible Only 200m to picturesque Eiffel Tower view Great access to hpp on hpp off bus stops Easy access to airport Metro and Gare du Nord Loved it 
159370,Eiffel Trocad ro,No Negative, The staff members were simply amazing here They went out of their way to assist us in every way When we asked if holding our luggage after checkout would be a problem I loved the reply we were given No problems here only solutions Our bags were held all day without hesitation 
159371,Eiffel Trocad ro, The older grey guy on the desk was exceptionally rude and seemed to really dislike me I was told an ice bucket was available for free but aparently midnight was too late to bring one up and i wasnt told there was a time limit on this So that ruined my plans The room was tiny and looked nothing like the photos There wasnt any heating in my room what so ever Me and my Fianc slept with coats on Would not stay here again Met two other members of staff on my stay They were friendly and helpful I dont understand why ice could not be taken to my room as o was told I was happy to tip for it but he was just a very miserable unhelpful man Not happy with this place at all , The location was great The building was nice overall
159372,Eiffel Trocad ro, Maybe a plate with vegetables was missing from breakfast , Location rooms very clean nice bathroom The family rooms were very nice The hotel is small nicely decorated rooms The metro around the corner and the Tour Eiffel as well Also lots of restaurants around at walking distance 
159373,Eiffel Trocad ro, The room was very small On the booking info it is written the superior room has 14 m2 That was so not true The room had 10 5 m2 bathroom included When I have raised the issue with the hotel personnel and I said I want to speak to the manager they said they can offer another room but was basically the same size The manager never showed up and they never answered to the email I sent them The room was not clean I found hair in the bed and the floor was super dirty as well as the closet There are 3 rooms on a very small corridor You can hear everything from the other rooms Definetely I will not go there ever Based on my own experience I don t recommend this hotel The hotel is close to the metro trocadero but it is not a nice neighbourhood to walk in the evenings Very dirty street vendors all over the area In clonclusion not a good experience ,No Positive
159374,Eiffel Trocad ro,No Negative, Beautiful hotel excellent location and very comfy beds Slept great every night Staff were so accomodating and very friendly Couldn t fault it 
159375,Eiffel Trocad ro, The space very tiny rooms for a 4 star hotel , The staff was very kind and helpful However the room we first checked in had a horrible smell in the bathroom the sewerage or something stank like a swamp We told about it to a night receptionist He kindly gave us another room but forgot to tell at the reception that we moved Next day our room was not cleaned at all which we then resolved at the reception again I do think the hotel is nice but with so many problems and room conditions no daily change of tea coffee shampoo toothpaste but it is definitely not 4 stars I don t know who gives the stars in France but it just doesn t reach the level according to basic criteria For 3 Stars it is quite a nice and cute place to stay 
159376,Eiffel Trocad ro, And BTW When I check out the room the money I paid is not the number as the Booking com shows I printed it out and give it to the counter staff I paid much more than what I reserved Anyway , The room is clean and beautiful The bathroom is amazing Breakfast is also nice for early bird 
159377,Eiffel Trocad ro, It was unclear that the breakfast was not included in the price Bad Wifi Sometimes I heard that water was dripping from the tubs , nice breakfast good staff good location
159378,Eiffel Trocad ro, View is only a Partial View when advertised as a View room There is no physical way due to the location of the hotel to have a full view of the Eiffel Tower The physical location of the hotel sits behind the Musee de l Homme which blocks most of the tower You only get a small view of the top of the tower , clean and good price
159379,Eiffel Trocad ro, Larger shower that is all We both found the shower to be a little on the small side but it wasnt too much of a problem, Although breakfast was included We didn t get to try it since we just didn t have the time to do so Everything about the hotel was amazing though The view was spectacular Definitely will return here again 
159380,Eiffel Trocad ro, Getting a cup of tea or refreshment in the late afternoon was a challenge, It s location as we have not been to Paris before and it is close to the Eiffel Tower
159381,Eiffel Trocad ro, The rooms were quite small and at least the one which we had was shabby I have attached a picture of the curtains of our room There was also a clear smell of tobacco although the whole hotel was expected to be non smoking After days of complaint to the receptionists and manager one of the cleaners revealed that one of the other hotel guests kept smoking in his her room What annoyed the most was the attitude of the manager who did not even respond to our e mails , The location is excellent close to everything I also liked the design and interior of the hotel 
159382,Eiffel Trocad ro, Extremely disappointed This hotel is a 2 stars level totally overpriced I booked this hotel s Lux Double Room with View to enjoy the view on the Eiffel tower for the New Year but the truth is that you can see only 1 4 top of the tower as there is a building just in front of it Beside this no toothbrush hand soap etc NOTHING in the bathroom except a cheap Hair Body gel dispenser 4 stars hotel you said And the breakfast I ve stay in many different kind of hotels but this one is really a 2 stars level buffet breakfast for 18 euros A total joke even if we got it for free as I complained about the view from the bedroom ,No Positive
159383,Eiffel Trocad ro, The sheets could of been softer The towels looked and felt old and rough , We had an amazing time We were here for our honeymoon and the attentions facilitated by the staff were impecable 
159384,Eiffel Trocad ro, The blinds in the bathroom fell down 3 times The quality of the coffee was average , Location Very Close to bus and metro Great atmospheric viewing platform for Eiffel Tower souvenirs and snacks 
159385,Eiffel Trocad ro, My room was freezing Especially at night Also found it annoying that I could hear the people above me I also heard the cleaning lady cleaning above me and I really wanted to sleep in but couldn t bc of the noise , Great location clean rooms and hotel 
159386,Eiffel Trocad ro, Hotel not as advertised as on Booking com mote like 3 stars Hotel tried to give me a room other than what I had booked smoking shower vs non smoking superior with spa bath Also NO hallway or stairway lighting making it impossible even during the day to find keyholes or steps A huge lawsuit coming from a guest accident is going to happen at some point , Location to the Eiffel Tower other central Paris sites
159387,Eiffel Trocad ro, beetles or black ladybirds and spiders crawling on the walls and inside the curtains I went to reception and spoke to the night manager telling him about the problem he immediately handed me a tin of insect spray When I went back up to the room to spray I saw just how many insects there were There were many insects I went back again to the front desk to complain and inform the night manager He could clearly not care less He refused to help me not wanting to do anything to solve the problem He didn t even want to come and look at the room There was no other staff member available to help I felt very belittled and frustrated as he refused to listen or even acknowledge the problem Finally and after shouting at me that I didn t care about the other hotel guests and being generally abusive he begrudgingly went to have a look Once in the room he continued to be rude aggressive dismissive even accusing my teenage daughter of lying I told him we couldn t sleep in a room with an insects and asked for a new room or a cancellation of the booking He said he wouldn t do either wouldn t and couldn t speak to his boss and we shouldn t worry as these particular insects are not carnivores Obviously we had no choice but to leave and felt aggressed and unwelcome by the night manager On leaving the hotel I paid for the room by credit card The night manager then refused to give give me any kind of receipt of payment He started screaming and shouting at me in French something along the lines of I have no right to use the informal way to speak I would like to point out I am English and don t speak fluent French I was trying to communicate the best I could He then closed the sliding doors of the hotel entrance from behind the counter locking us inside the hotel holding us hostage so we couldn t leave He refused to open them My teenage daughter was very distressed It was a horrific situation ,No Positive
159388,Eiffel Trocad ro, I wish they would have left me space in the mini fridge for my water rather than trying to sell me stuff , It was only a block away from a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower and a metro station They have A C They are eco friendly and really nice 
159389,Eiffel Trocad ro, Rooms are a little on the small side but it is to be expected with the type of building , The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout my stay The location is fantastic 
159390,Eiffel Trocad ro, We were no t given the room with the best Eiffel Tower view even though that is what was booked but they did move us higher on our last night after further request from us , Very comfortable Could even ask for eggs to be done to my liking at breakfast great hospitality Very friendly and helpful staff esp Mr Kamal TQ
159391,Eiffel Trocad ro, We were on the 3rd floor there was was not much of a view other than the building across the street , Very comfy stay room was very spacious bathroom with bathtub was fantastic and also quite spacious Location was very central 
159392,Eiffel Trocad ro,No Negative, The staff were friendly and more than helpful At hand at any time to help us in any way they could They printed tickets off for us and even on our last day when we were no longer staying they allowed us to leave our bags and use the facilities all day until our journey home 
159393,Eiffel Trocad ro, My only negative would be the coffee at breakfast For the price I would have expected a choice but this is a green hotel and I m sure the coffee was selected for that reason Staff were wonderful and attentive , We stayed 2 nights here The room was spacious the bed was huge and very comfortable We were upgraded free of charge to the suite which was decorated in such a way that it made our stay feel extra special 
159394,Eiffel Trocad ro,No Negative, Located close to Eiffel tower but within walking distance to notra dame some rooms have a view of the tower the hotel is small and friendly and being set back from the trocadero it is quiet at night Beds are comfy and rooms have air con 
159395,Eiffel Trocad ro, Breakfast wasnt great scrambled eggs were very dry and wasnt much variety for the 18 each we paid , Only a stone throw away from eiffel tower which was superb 
159396,Eiffel Trocad ro, Nothing , Location View of Eifel Tower from bedroom Family room was actually two connecting rooms so the kids had their own room bathroom and so did we Nice touch Very close to subway so easy to get anywhere 
159397,Eiffel Trocad ro, Parking not suitable for mid class german cars Butter at breakfast 2 months over expiry date but hotel provided new fresh butter and offered me the breakfast Great reaction much appreciated, Friendliness of stuff Wooden floors Location Cleanliness
159398,Eiffel Trocad ro, The deluxe view consisted of just the very top of the Eiffel Tower with a building covering the rest of it Would have been better for a standard room since there was not a clear view , The location was great everything was walkable Really appreciated that the hotel was a green hotel 
159399,Eiffel Trocad ro, The bed stunk of cigarettes Hand wash and shower gel only choice of toiletries in the bathroom , Good size room superior double no 22 Bathtub with a built in jacuzzi Quiet and well decorated room Trocadero tube station 5 minute walk from the hotel Very pleasant staff
159400,Eiffel Trocad ro, I found the decoration in the room could be updated but it was clean and very comfortable just the style was not up to date , The location of the hotel is awesome and I paid a good price for a 4 star hotel in Paris The staff was very nice and pleasant especially the person whom I believe was the manager who drove me to the airport The room include conveniences like ironing board and coffee which you usually do not find in Paris hotel I would go again assuming I can get the same price
159401,Eiffel Trocad ro, No reply to special request messages and room not as advertised Night staff not very friendly or approachable Towels scratchy and only one bathrobe for two people Eiffel tower view is laughable Very expensive for what you get , comfortable bed 
159402,Eiffel Trocad ro, Very small rooms almost no space for our suitcases , Wonderful staff Quiet area no noise from the streets We ate breakfast at the hotel on our busiest day and we were alone in the very romantic hotel restaurant The breakfast was like most hotel breakfasts Nice with a jacuzzi in our bathroom Many cafes and restaurants in the area Metro stop 100 metres away A two minute walk to watch the Eiffel Tower and maybe ten minutes if you want to walk all the way to the tower 
159403,Eiffel Trocad ro, We booked this hotel to have a view of the Eiffel Tower but they had no more rooms with a view There was no parking available so we had to spend a fortune on public parking , It s easy to reach by car and it s very close to the Eiffel Tower There is a Velib bike station close by so you can reach other landmarks quickly 
159404,Eiffel Trocad ro,No Negative, Fantastic location close to the metro and sights of Paris Really friendly and helpful staff who recommended some great off the tourist trail places to eat Great find will be staying here again if we return to Paris 
159405,Eiffel Trocad ro, On arrival the reception tried to change our room to a lower floor even though I d paid for our room upgrade and emailed prior to our stay to confirm the view room The breakfast was shockingly awful Nothing but stale bread and an empty egg pan left It was 9 30am Inedible actually 36 euros was a disgrace for that I am so glad we didn t eat anything else there No reaction at all when I expressed this to the staff Literally a shrug of the shoulders and still charged me Awkward and embarrassing Not impressed Won t be returning for a few reasons which is shame as the location was excellent , The location was excellent
159406,Eiffel Trocad ro, Nothing all was great, Great location and friendly staff We asked them to give us some tips on good locations outside of the big tourist areas They were happy to oblige 
159407,Eiffel Trocad ro, Overrated location I would expect a view at least at half of the Eiffel Tower if I pay 400 EUR for 2 nights I thought it might be pricy because of the whirlpool bath tub I noted my preference for bath tub it has not been taken into consideration I got a hydromassage shower instead which did not make any sense Can be cheap if you go for simple rooms but just because of the view and the jacuzzi it s not worth to pay 200 EUR night , Location is good Eiffel Tower can be seen from the room 
159408,Eiffel Trocad ro, The stuff was a bit strange but all in all friendly The bathtub is facing the wall if you have an Eiffel tower view way is the bathtub facing the wall it makes no sense , Very good location view to the Eiffel tower but you can only see half of the tower from the window
159409,Eiffel Trocad ro, nothing, Friendly helpfull Staff Good size Well decorated rooms Perfect Location They tried thier best to fullfil all my needs and offers thier help as no other hotels in Paris Did
159410,Eiffel Trocad ro, The only area for improvement was the bath shower Low pressure and difficult to arrange on the overhead attachment it is really a bath hand held unit, Bed fantastic excellent location nice decor high definition tv fabulous but shower
159411,Eiffel Trocad ro, Pipes clang all night and the housekeeper and other staff had loud conversations and phone calls in the hallway in the morning cleaning the other rooms right outside my door The hallway is small so that was really inconsiderate , Great view of the eiffel and nice looking rooms
159412,Eiffel Trocad ro, Room with view of Eiffel Tower was a bit obstructed as you could only see the top half of the tower , Location very close to the Eiffel Tower very convenient to train and to tour buses in Trocadero 
159413,Eiffel Trocad ro, The only take away I had was that the in room menu for room service did not reflect actual times of operation I didn t find out until I tried calling for room service , The Eiffel Suite was absolutely beautiful I d highly recommend it to anyone going The room design and view is amazing with outstanding room service as well I ll definitely be returning I advise to go in the low traffic months as you may or may not get quite the discount Kamal one of the receptionists was so helpful and gave excellent service All the staff were very helpful and extremely polite Great location 
159414,Eiffel Trocad ro, Room was small but very comfortable and extremely clean If you plan to spend a lot of time in the room then this could be a problem but if it s just for sleeping then it s not a problem , Location was excellent Eiffel Tower right next door Bar was very reasonable prices compared to the local establishments G T was 12 00 hotel compared to 23 00 local bar restaurant
159415,Eiffel Trocad ro, Everything great, Superbe location super view Warner welcome on arrival nice staff would recommend this hotel for everybody who is looking for a little good located hotel
159416,Eiffel Trocad ro, The reception room is very small and the lift is shaking when it s going up down and stops at the first time we re a little bit shocking , The staffs were very helpful when we asked about several places that we want to visit they were also helpful to handle our bagage and to transport us to the station The location is very strategic 
159417,Eiffel Trocad ro, No complaints Rooms are small but it is a small boutique like hotel, You pay for the view Eiffel Tower just around the corner metro station right there good restaurantrs Leisurely walk to the Champs lys es maybe 30 min 
159418,Eiffel Trocad ro, The room we were in had water leaking from the bathroom light socket which wet all of our bathroom stuff however we were moved to another room quickly and easily, The location is perfect right next to the eiffel tower with a view of it from the window The decor is quirky and very boutique styled with spacious rooms and iron safety box and shower bath included
159419,Eiffel Trocad ro, Size of the room especially the toilet was on the small side The standard of d cor is starting to get tired some of the tiles and basin in the bathroom were chipped and some of the furniture had broken handles , The staff are great the Hotel is very quirky and the bed was very comfortable We very much enjoyed our stay at this Hotel 
159420,Eiffel Trocad ro, Dinner in the restaurant was below average The kettle in the room could not be plugged in to a power point unless placed on the floor as the cord was too short Placement of power points were not practical Only one bath robe for two guests , Colours in bedroom Comfortable bed and design of bar area as well as lobby 
159421,Eiffel Trocad ro, WiFi didn t work and caused us a great deal of trouble because we were unable to confirm our flight and book our seats We had to go to the airport early , Friendly helpful staff and location
159422,Eiffel Trocad ro,No Negative, The beds were the most comfortable anyone in our family had slept in Everyone commented without prompting including the children Beautiful clean rooms and a lovely location Also we had a booking issue through no fault of the hotel and the hotel resolved it without hesitation Could not be happier about staying here and will do so again 
159423,Eiffel Trocad ro, The night staff was not as nice The elevator was a bit small for 2 people 2 large suitcases This is not for the hotel but for the area the Tocadero square is full of men in groups trying to sell you all kind of souvenirs Little tip walk through the metro tunnels to skip this hassle , Our visit started with an incredible friendly receptionist We had requested two twin beds and a view so they offered us the option of looking at both rooms and deciding In addition the help of navigating the city translations and and requests were answered with ease and honestly Every night we received 3 chocolates on our pillows In addition the location was perfect full of cafes and close to the metro 
159424,Eiffel Trocad ro, Poorly staffed Even in the breakfast time you had to ask for food to be refilled including glasses and cutlery Room cleaning for a 4 star was pathetic I had to take my previous days waste downstairs Not at all a 4 star experience , The location was great walking distance to Eiffel tower The upper storey family room had an amazing view of Eiffel tower 
159425,Eiffel Trocad ro, Shame that our car was too big for the parking we booked so we had to park in a secure public car park close by , Great location so close to Metro Very friendly staff Quirky decor
