13426,Novotel London West, No sweetener only sugar for hot drinks in my room Hairdryer was hard to use as you had to constantly hold the button down for it to work , Bed really comfy room was perfect temperature Great selection at breakfast 
13427,Novotel London West, A room with a bath would ve been nice but we didn t put in a specific request so that was something on us , The staff were very friendly the room clean and the bar restaurant was lovely The underground parking was secure convenient and reasonably priced 
13428,Novotel London West, Our room had a dodgy toilet flush and the evening menu in the hotel had nothing we liked but there were plenty of places to eat close by, This hotel was perfectly situated for the Olympia as we were going to Comicon and Hammersmith tube station was close by Great staff buffet breakfast had loads of choice and was very nice 
13429,Novotel London West, ice machine is not working in the corridor staff refused to bring to our room We requested for 2 beds and was given a room with 1 bed Coffee machine and safety box were broken Housekeeping should have checked the amenities before letting traveler to enter the room , Size of the room
13430,Novotel London West, For a 5 nights booking we got one single soap in the bathroom Breakfast is too expensive In the morning starting at 7 30am the house keeping crew starts knocking in the doors very laud waking uo all the guests around Its so easy to improve in my dislikes lists that its even strange that its not fixed yet , The location is very good A standard hotel for a fair price in London
13431,Novotel London West, We were upgraded to a executive room which was very nice but the room was for 3 originally we booked a double bed a pull out bed so not much room in the bed, We always stay at this hotel great location to visit our son
13432,Novotel London West,No Negative, Lovely facilities Very comfortable Staff very attentive gave the impression nothing was too much trouble Location also very convenient for the Eventim Apollo the reason for our trip 
13433,Novotel London West, Dirty carpet and cobwebs on the ceiling the electricity cut out in the room for a bit we asked housekeeping to clean the cobwebs and nobody came, The beds housekeeping cleaning the rooms
13434,Novotel London West, Breakfasts and tea could have been hotter , Reception staff pleasant and helpful Great location for transport facilities overall just a great hotel
13435,Novotel London West, bar staff were extremely slow food took over an hour to arrive with no apology bedding was not changed until 22 15 after calling housekeeping 3 times , reception staff were friendly breakfast was good
13436,Novotel London West, On arrival the male member of the reception team didn t seem to want to check us in and was only available to help after the female member of the reception team had welcomed us and call us over to check in , Hotel was clean the room size was good 
13437,Novotel London West, I appreciate that they manage to achieve the high price point hence it remains at sometimes eye watering levels but in a market where the offering doesn t vary from Novotel location to location in fact this one doesn t even have parking it really does apply a very high premium , The location is superb for anyone with business in Paddington Basin where a reliable brand is providing a consistent product which is supported by really polite and helpful staff 
13438,Novotel London West, Staff in bar ignored me even though 3 of them were doing nothing Food in buffet very oily Room had seen better days not what I was expecting of a superior twin , Very close to the Apollo 
13439,Novotel London West, Poor signs for main reception near the main entrance maybe should be a notice on the ground floor near the other reception that is only for package holidays saying main reception to hotel is on the 1st floor The room was a little shabby not as advertised on the website , The reception area upstairs was nice when we eventually realised that s where we had to go after queuing downstairs near the main entrance for 10 minutes The bar area was nice 
13440,Novotel London West, We had booked for a one night stay to attend a concert in the area and the receptionist that checked us in rather than say that the booking had come through with my surname as my christian name and that I was male he proceeded to imply that I was not the person who had made the booking despite the fact that they had all my details just round the wrong way This attitude was unsettling and angered my partner who tried to contact the hotel group that Novotel belong to only to be told that because the booking was done through booking com there wasn t anything they could do which was surprising and indicates that their system for receiving bookings from other agents needs reviewing and their staff trained better to deal with potential errors To make matters worse when we had lunch in the bar and tried to put this on our room bill we were told that the same receptionist had not authorised my card for this facility and had only taken payment for the room Authorising cards on check in is standard practice in my experience therefore I m not sure why this was not done as it meant all additional purchases had to be paid for separately Although this situation was not resolved we were at least offered two free drinks by way of an apology after making a complaint The contemporary decor seems to disappear in the rooms The bath was actually just a shower as it had no actual taps and was small The water ran hot and cold intermittently For some reason having upgraded to a superior room the sofa bed was made up as two single beds and when we tried to restore it back to a sofa we were only able to retract half of the sofa The aircon was poor to almost non existent however the weather had been exceptionally hot but would have expected the aircon to be able to cope , Reception area restaurant and bar very contemporary the wifi was very good as was the breakfast The staff in the bar area were excellent especially the mixologist and waiter who were very friendly helpful and informative 
13441,Novotel London West, We stayed overnight to visit Wimbledon and asked in the morning before we left for Wimbledon if me may leave our car in the car park until we returned at night The very friendly girl at reception said yes no problem just come in at night to validate the ticket When we returned a very hapless young man took ages to validate the ticket moving from computer to computer and finally telling us we would be charged 37 50 We found this very steep and frankly were very surprised to be charged at all If we had parked in a parking garage off site we would have paid around 20 If the parking garage had been full we would gladly have paid extra for our parking but it was virtually deserted Paying just under a 130 for the night for a basic twin room we would have thought parking would be included or at a very reduced rate The breakfast in the morning was excellent with very friendly efficient staff , The two single beds were nice and roomy more like dubbles than singles 
13442,Novotel London West, The entrance is designed for coaches and while it is not far to walk to the tube station it is not a pedestrian friendly walk due to the entrance design being at the furthest away from the most direct path to the Hammersmith tube and some construction poorly designed pathway and coach parking at the entrance level Also the hotel is so large that you may need to walk a long distance to your room this was okay for me but if you have a lot of luggage or trouble walking long distances you might want to know this , The room was a lot bigger for the price than hotels in Paddington It was easy enough to go a few stops further on the tube to Hammersmith I felt comfortable walking from the tube station which is in a handy shopping centre to the hotel 5 minute walk and it was easy to find Also it is on the direct underground line for Heathrow so really easy to get to and from the airport 
13443,Novotel London West, Whilst the room was very comfortable and all the amenities that I required were there the poor condition of the carpet was quite apparent It was tired and worn out , I liked most of the staff and their cheery manner once you broke through their training programmed attitudes As most of therm are from the continent it took them a little while to become accustomed to the Australian humour They Loosened Up and they look better with a smile on their faces An observation Not every customer would like that but Having been in the customer relations business for 32 years of my working life A friendly smile goes a long way 9 10 for the staff There was one younger female of the front line staff who definitely could do with with a little training in relaxing and that all important smile instead of just doing the business 
13444,Novotel London West, Staff could be more attentive and friendly Overall the stay was nowhere near value for the amount paid Toilet paper in bathrooms was poor Room dining choice was poor Expected more in provided room facilities considering the room price paid such as caffeinated coffee only decaffeinated provided a few more biscuits etc Ultimately the room was not much better than a Travelodge but at least double the price , Great location for my purposes nicely air conditioned good choice for breakfast Nice size room a twin 
13445,Novotel London West, The cost of parking was ridiculous at 36 per day No information prior to going on this cost They say they don t run parking but it s under there hotel It would have been cheaper to take the train I only took our car as I may have needed to go somewhere further afield , Nice room size
13446,Novotel London West, The rooms and hallways indicate that the hotel is not so new , Helpful staff I wanted to change a room and the receptionist did find one despite the hotel being quite booked he offered me a complimentary drink initially but I did not need it The gym is really great new well equipped The reception area is modern and gives a good vibe 
13447,Novotel London West, Staff, Staff very serious on checkout Staff kept checking I was a resident when we arrived back late from Hyde Park concert asked for food it was brought to us but it was like we had walked on off the street kept hovering and asking for room number Didn t feel comfortable the breakfast whilst plentiful was cold 
13448,Novotel London West, Breakfast was expensive for 2 37 , Great size room great location for us Lovely public bar restaurant and modern feel to the whole building 
13449,Novotel London West, Our room overlooked a building site The Scrambled egg was under cooked Had to pay full price for breakfast even if we only wanted cereal and toast Would be nice to have a choice between a full cooked breakfast at the full price or a lighter breakfast at a lower price , Staff were very friendly and helpful Our room was very comfortable The decor throughout was pleasant Both breakfast and dinner were very good apart from the scrambled egg 
13450,Novotel London West, I booked a Superior Room I think this just means it has a sofa Minimal bathroom toiletries minibar not stocked although it came in handy for keeping water and snacks cool no hotel information provided in the room It was just a bit underwhelming And it wasn t cheap , Comfortable bed air con was adequate on the hottest day since 1976 perfectly located 3 minutes walk from the Underground Station
13451,Novotel London West, Air con broke and we had to ask twice for someone to look at it and never really got fixed Standard of room was very average for executive whatever it was We asked for a room away from building works and they put us in a room right next to it ,No Positive
13452,Novotel London West, Poor response from reception re cancelling breakfast They wouldn t allow it as booked through booking com I e mailed booking com who responded by advising me they had communicated my request directly with hotel To date I ve had no response as from hotel Very very weak , Very little
13453,Novotel London West, Rooms outdated and noisy No air con only fan so room very hot and stuffy in summer and no sheets thick quilt only Pillows were terrible flat Expected more for the money, Close to the Hammersmith tube station
13454,Novotel London West, Umm I have stayed a few times now over the last 18 months I stay there because it s close to my elderley fathers flat and I go to see him The superior rooms are a little tired Bathrooms have mould on the fittings Carpets tend to need a bit of a clean This time the door into the room looked like it had been kicked hard at the bottom and the lock was loose I did tell the reception staff when I checked out Executive rooms tend to be nicer but are a lot more expensive I don t tend to eat there as the breakfast is so expensive , It s in a good place very close to Hammersmith tube station 
13455,Novotel London West, Staff at reception cold when checking out no greetings or courtesy Bathroom below average Not worth the expensive rates, Large bed Close to Hammersmith station
13456,Novotel London West, Lady who checked us in was rather rude and unwelcoming not the best first impression to give Breakfast was a bit hit and miss hard pancakes very runny scrambled egg and tea pots could do with a serious scrub Also the tea and sugar supply in room was a bit stingy only 2 teabags and 4 sugars which is fine if you drink coffee too as there was plenty of that but sadly I only drink tea , Rooms were modern and we were selected for a free room upgrade Was nice and quiet in our room no traffic or general hotel noise Bar is lovely to sit in and food from there was yummy Location is great if your staying to see a show at the Hammersmith eventum 
13457,Novotel London West, One of the other reasons we choose this hotel was it stated in the details that the hotel had air conditioning it does not its rooms are air cooled We stayed on one of the hottest nights of the year and had an extremely uncomfortable night We complained in the night and the next morning when we were told the rooms are air cooled The hotel gave us two complimentary breakfasts and took our bar bill off the final bill as compensation for our unpleasant night Thank you Novotel It would be worth checking with the hotel and altering the incorrect details on your website , Lovely hotel perfect location for the Appollo 
13458,Novotel London West,No Negative, Really nice smart hotel Everything was spotless The staff were lovely The room was perfect We got a free upgrade on arrival The restaurants they have were amazing Will definately be returning 
13459,Novotel London West, No air conditioning in room Fried eggs greasy Only one toaster working and it took x4 goes to brown the bread properly , Location to Queens club Friendly helpful staff Good shower Good selection breakfast 
13460,Novotel London West, The fact that was told the mini bar was free due to the upgrade but it was in fact completely empty Housekeeping service extremely slow to take calls and to respond I also reported to main Reception that someone had vomitted on the carpet in the corridor near my room An hour and a half later I had to report it was still there I walked past it 3 times to and from breakfast which was very off putting to the appetite and on departure , Rooms nice but had a Guest of the Day free upgrade so even better
13461,Novotel London West, The smoking terrace was woefully neglected the morning after a Friday night of drinkers and smokers I know that s not a higher priority as most people don t smoke but we do , The fast efficient friendly service with a smile Excellent food bar and overall atmosphere My wife normally doesn t like big hotels but she would come again happily 
13462,Novotel London West, The booking was messed up and the staff and managers could not have cared less At midnight they were still arguing about our needs To top it none of the staff in the breakfast room understand plain English Want oats Forget it they have no clue The food generally was poor but I asked for fresh fried eggs and got rubber eggs that reminded me of army food 30 years ago disgusting Oh did I say the staff are shocking I hate the staff at the this hotel with a passion when we arrived I said to my wife I will be staying here in future when I visit London After staying there I will never go back Did I say how bad the staff are Shocking , Location
13463,Novotel London West, The room I stayed in was very tired it needed a through deep clean and everything updated I have stayed in much better hotels for half the price There weren t any other rooms left in the hotel so I could be moved but I checked in at 1am and just wanted to go to sleep as I needed to be out of the hotel by 7 30 Also 27 for a cooked breakfast get in the real world , Very pleasant and friendly staff
13464,Novotel London West, Didn t think it was worth the money but it is in London , It was close to the venue 5 minute walk and also the breakfast was lovely all staff was great and so polite too 
13465,Novotel London West, The shower dropped hot and cold during use but nothing major, Staff very friendly at reception there are also lots of facilities available if you wish to use them
13466,Novotel London West, There was strange smell in room especially when the bathroom was open 2 out of 4 lifts were out of order all the time Our key to room was blocked before the time we should leave the room This hotel needs total renovation ,No Positive
13467,Novotel London West, In the first room we were allocated there was a distinct smell of vomit near the bed We told reception and got moved In the next room only one plug socket worked and the air conditioning was broken which made the room like a sauna and meant neither of us could sleep We were headed to a wedding so hwd to dash else we would ve asked to be moved again Beds were not to taste too hard When we got up we were bitten to death by a flea it wasn tthe best , Lovely welcoming staff Great location Windows that could open Clean bathroom Two hairdryers one in bathroom one under dressing table 
13468,Novotel London West, Bedside tables a little too small to be practicable , The location was perfect in a quiet street close to a busy transport hub On the line to Heathrow and an easy tube ride to there or the City Also everything so very spacious Good restaurant Loved the view towards the City from our ninth floor executive suite free upgrade See picture 
13469,Novotel London West, The bedroom had not been cleaned smelt and someone had laid on top of beds Our room was changed so there were no twin bedded rooms one of us had to sleep on a sofa bed At 8 30 a m someone opened our bedroom door believing it was empty The tap pushing in the plug was broken and came away The bath was narrow The sheets and duvet cover was of poor quality , The entrance and reception area 
13470,Novotel London West, The fact that our room was on the third floor and so far away from the lifts The carpet makes it hard to pull our trolley bags and the distance to the lifts which was on the other side of the building as mentioned was too far The windows looked out onto a roof I did ask for a nice view However I was told that the twin rooms were all on the third floor and that was the only view , Excellent breakfast and service from all of the staff
13471,Novotel London West, Not even bottled water in the room bit sparce although the kind receptionist did say next time to ask and she will make sure it s provided, Location
13472,Novotel London West, The room was awful It looked like an nhs room it was awful and for the amount it cost i would expect a lot more I would also expect things like a shower hat in the bathroom , The breakfast was good and the look of communal areas was of a good standard
13473,Novotel London West, Bathtub size too high for short people to step over no face washers supplied only one small soap for two people for shower and hand basin, Convenient location obliging staff good sized room excellent restaurant and coffee shop
13474,Novotel London West, Breakfast was awful and over priced They need a better chef and more choice in pastries etc, The hotel is clean and fresh and of a good standard The breakfast left a lot to be desired and was really expensive 
13475,Novotel London West, Bad smell room from elevator elevator very slow with long que waiting two days without make up for the room no one bottle water at leat served as complimentary or chargeable In addition staff was bot flexible to cancel one night ahead of time and insisting that booking should request so Underground to center of London requires train changes , Space
13476,Novotel London West, The only downside was in the bathroom this whilst showering the water as one would expect you placed at a setting comfortable for the user during showering the water temperature did alter from the original setting to being very hot to cold not what I was expecting However once you got used to this you could manage the changes in the water temperature, Location very good as Tube station a very short walk away the underground car park was a plus point The price was acceptable as a guest this considering London car parking charges in general 
13477,Novotel London West, Smell from sink of sewage air con wasnt very good Outdated ipod dock that fits old style the coffee machine pump seems to be on its way out as very very slow Very noisy people slamming doors all the time Bedside plug did not work so to find my phone fully flat in the morning, Room was clean and bed was comfy Great location Good breakfast selection Nice style room
13478,Novotel London West, This remark is made in the certainty that finding a pleasant outlook from every room of a large hotel is far from easy that said I found the view from 802 interesting only because I was able to carry out a quite unscientific census of the numbers of A C units that had sprouted on London roofs since my last visit , The surprise was that reception was on the 2nd floor but the greeting I received was warm intelligent and most helpful I did eat in the hotel one evening but I found the food acceptable but more expensive than I had expected The bar was no less expensive although the staff were of high quality 
13479,Novotel London West, The bed the broken air con the fact that there was no extract in the bathroom, It was hot and the air con didn t work the mattress was limp and saggy not great to be honest
13480,Novotel London West, Staff gave out a key to my room to a complete stranger who then moved in and hung his clothes next to mine in wardrobe and put his toiletries next to mine in the bathroom I returned to my room late evening to find all his bags and stuff intermingled with mine and I was horrified No one at reception answered my calls and I had to get a very kind man in room service to go to reception and make them call me Had to move rooms in case weirdo came back Horrendous experience hotel system failure , comfy bed and great bathroom
13481,Novotel London West, Even though we cranked up the AC 5C in our room and maintenance checked it twice the room was hot Apparently their system was not ready for AC to be ran yet as it was not summer Maintanance guy was crabby when he showed up Their mini bar refrigerator did not chill drinks enough It only contained 2 bottles of water and they were barely colder than room temperature , The Grill Restaurant was really really good and the staff was super attentive and friendly The hotel is less than a block away from the Tube Station There s a Starbucks less than a block away and a grocery store by the Tube 
13482,Novotel London West, Ventilation in the rooom was very poor We had no sleep down to malfunctioning aircondition and one cannot open windows properly to ventilate , Staff was friendly and professional 
13483,Novotel London West, Bathroom was in a poor state of repair unable to empty bath as plug device came off in my hand Poor state of grouting in places leaving opportunities for dirt bugs to lurk ,No Positive
13484,Novotel London West, When I arrived I was informed that I had been upgraded to a premium room and so was looking forward to seeing my room The room decor is dated and certainly not luxurious Could do with refurbishing the bedrooms or ones similar to the one I stayed in in keeping with the rest of the hotel , The main areas of the hotel are modern and new Breakfast was good and staff friendly 
13485,Novotel London West, The hotel is old and in need of a major renovation Non of the electricity sockets were working The soap was not replaced , The location close to Olympia
13486,Novotel London West, Nothing to dislike I d happily stay here again , I like the location for me getting to work at my client s office and for access to central London 
13487,Novotel London West,No Negative, Loved the service the breakfast variety plenty of seating and spotless and the staff were always so very helpful and extremely pleasant Everything you could have wanted was here at this hotel Superb 
13488,Novotel London West, Our room was over looking the flyover and close to the railway which operated all night , The choices were as expected and served by attentive staff As the hotel was only minutes away from Olympia breakfast was not rushed before a busy day 
13489,Novotel London West,No Negative, A great stay Warm welcome at 10pm This was my third stay The room was comfortable Breakfast as usual was a sizeable spread and the service efficient The left luggage facility is a great boon Will come back again next year 
13490,Novotel London West, Silly thing only 2 teabags in the room that s it , Free upgrade including breakfast was great but would have been great value anyway Restaurant staff very knowledgeable about food allergens which is rare as well 
13491,Novotel London West, TV could have been upgraded to a smart TV in this day and age , Friendly helpful staff Got upgraded room as guest of the day and complimentary breakfast which we opted to have as room service with no extra charge Would have preferred firmer bed but my husband found it very comfortable Nespresso coffee machine nice little touch 
13492,Novotel London West, the water for tea and coffee was cold I asked 3 different members of staff for a hot cup of tea and coffee All that happened was they came and topped up the urn with a jug of hot water pouring on to the cold water in the urn the staff member then kept trying to light the small pot under the urn Myself and my sister in law where taking our 95 year old mum for a follow up appointment after having heart surgery a month ago I requested a accessible room for mum as she can not walk far we were given one room with a double bed when we requested a twin room and the other room over looking the flyover We were then moved to a twin room which was as far as could be from the lift this was a real struggle for mum to walk to the lift The only helpful person was a young man in the restaurant who got us a wheelchair for mum as we did not want to make her move rooms again the checking in took for ages and the young girl who did this only gave us one room although i gave her the booking form sorry to say she also had a body odour problem some one took over from her after about 25mins this was quite stressful as we had been travelling for 3 hours to get to the hotel very disappointing for a large chain hotel , the selection was very good
13493,Novotel London West, The staff very rude girl squeezing lemons at bar looked at me like a peace of dirt while being served at he bar the boss stopped the barman to tell him instructions of jobs needed doing and I was waiting to pay for my drinks milk in room was out of date curdled my tea disgusted at the charge of water in the room and the breakfast was over cooked food and they shut the second buffet early to prepare for lunch so everyone using one buffet so big ques and scraps of food left waiting to check out poor system people wer jumping ahead of us then staff on iPads serving people behind us took 25 mins for us to be served poor service poor hotel and I ve been to a few and never felt the need to write a bad review, I liked the lifts
13494,Novotel London West, Parking is very expensive even when you are a resident in the hotel Lifts were a little slow , staff were very attentive felt really looked after as we were chosen as guest of the day free room upgrade and drinks Room was clean and spacious 
13495,Novotel London West, Nothing, Had a lovely time spent at the hotel got to check in early and when I went to check we were told that we had been selected as guest of the day and got a free upgrade on the room and breakfast in the morning really made the stay a pleasure
13496,Novotel London West,No Negative, A nice modern hotel great location for Olympia Restaurants were excellent Rooms clean modern and comfortable Car park a real bonus particularly as it was underground and very secure 
13497,Novotel London West, Car parking charges were unexceptable we stayed there for 3 days and were charged 1 50 per hour which totalled 108 I think a day rate should be set up for hotel guests not an hourly one , The service and atmosphere was lovely
13498,Novotel London West, Temperature in the room to stuffy bed ok only 1 pillow each television sound didn t work properly bathroom old fashioned not a good selection of toiletries no shower cap room not cleaned first night so no tea coffee milk , Not a lot
13499,Novotel London West, Eating in the hotel was expensive we didn t have breakfast there for that reason and the buffet we had one evening was ok but pricey for what we got We would have preferred to eat in the bar that evening but the bar area is very small for a hotel of its size and we couldn t get seats , We loved the hotel the Room was great and the view from it on the 9th floor was fabulous The staff were all were helpful and everywhere looked lovely About a 5 min walk to the Tube station which is serviced by 4 lines as well as the bus station The amazing westfield shopping centre is 2 stops away on the tube 
13500,Novotel London West, Staff doesn t respond quickly The room lacked cleanliness Water system not working properly Tap water smelled like sewage We requested changing the room but no response The shower was bad also Too expensive for what they offer , Location bed
13501,Novotel London West, rooms are in need of some tlc, very efficient check in and check out by friendly helpful staff hotel has excellent location especially for Hammersmith Appollo
13502,Novotel London West, Very dissapointed with our room although location was good as had some skyline views we were next door to the ice machine and until early hours of the morning we could hear people talking whilst using the machine Our room temp was uncomfortably hot the shower in our room was varying from cold to scolding hot making our morning shower far from pleasurable I had to leave washing my hair not at all pleasant I did report this to the reception but little was offered in compensation I feel for the price of our one night stay the whole visit was displeasing and not worthy of a higher rating than a premier inn , Although only got to enjoy one cup at breakfast as staff particularly busy I my request for more was forgotten Coffee in the room was also enjoyable 
13503,Novotel London West, The view from the room wasn t perfect but it s hard to see how that can be improved Also we were only there for 1 night so it didn t really matter, The location was excellent staff very friendly and I love that they do their bit for the environment by not bleaching the sheets Great choice at breakfast 
13504,Novotel London West, The extortionate parking cost at weekend given that there is no charge for on street parking at weekend across from hotel The appalling amount of litter directly outside entrance to reception, Room was very comfortable
13505,Novotel London West, Rooms are NOT air conditioned It is a cooling system that did not work Day 1 Complained and they said a technician would have a look 6hrs later on return to room had to complain again before technician came who clearly knew it wasn t working said he would have a look at it the next day and brought a fan Fan didn t help it was so warm in room Complained again and they moved us room It was cooler Day 3 Returned to room early evening after a busy weekend only to hear extremely loud music Complained 9 30pm to be told it was a wedding in function room and they couldn t do anything about it It would end 11pm but we could move room Advised I had already moved room but if finished at 11pm I would put up with it 11 15 complained again music even louder Was told they would go have a word with organiser 11 35 complained again Was told I would get a call back 11 45 a different member of staff called back saying the event was on until 12am I like music but I don t pay to stay in a hotel room and go to bed to listen to two and a half hours of loud banging music On leaving in the morning staff were very good at apologising but that s just not good enough ,No Positive
13506,Novotel London West, Returned from Sting concert to bar Toilets female x2 one without loo paper and other its handle wouldn t flush at approximately 22 00 hours on 09 11 2017 The staff were woefully slow waited 20 minutes to be served 3 behind bar and 6 patrons waiting to be served and no bottled water behind bar to take to room , Breakfast was very good Variety great Service at breakfast very good Thoroughly enjoyed breakfast 
13507,Novotel London West, The room was superior and the hotel is 4 star I was expecting a better quality more spacious more commodities and newer in comparison with the reception entrance area and outside , The restaurants of the hotel are very good one more expensive and the other with reasonable prices and quality The location is also good especially to catch the tube 
13508,Novotel London West, Carpets throughout the hotel had a funny smell and seemed to be in need of a very deep clean or replacement , Better vegetarian options would be good Staff were terrific 
13509,Novotel London West, Maybe to be offered a top sheet as well as a duvet , Lovely hotel Staff very welcoming We had a room upgrade as we were customers of the day Nice surprise We were visiting family in Hammersmith so location good 
13510,Novotel London West, Second stay here and if I d have had this same experience the last time I stayed I honestly would have stayed in a premier inn and paid far less Room was dated in need of a major revamp the room was filthy with tea stains up the wall The bed was rock solid and uncomfortable and the pillows were awful worst nights sleep ever I requested to pay for an upgrade but the hotel was packed and Given that last time the room was lovely and I had no trouble I suspect they were at maximum capacity and using rooms they wouldn t normally All in all I wouldn t recommend this place and never intend to stay again ,No Positive
13511,Novotel London West, The only downside to our stay was the price of parking at the hotel considering we were guests of the hotel and paid a significant amount to stay the one night I would of thought we would of had a better rate on the parking Our car was parked in the underground car park for under 24 hours and cost us 36 I just thought this was very expensive and if I had previously known the price I would of considered parking elsewhere , The breakfast was lovely and staff were really friendly and helpful with directions 
13512,Novotel London West, Parking charges We had two rooms and when we checked in we set off to our rooms to find one occupied and one unmade After return to reception and room swap we had an uncomfortable night down to poor aircon A complimentary breakfast was provided with an apology but this doesn t make up for our experience The hotel above L1 needs a good refurb in my opinion , The day we had before we checked in 
13513,Novotel London West, The bathroom was disappointing for a 4 star hotel shower didn t drain well possibly not as hot as it could have been looked a bit tired The tea and coffee in the room could have been better , The bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet 
13514,Novotel London West, Hotel is very crowded so expect delays to be serviced for any activity check in out breakfast lift hotels in London use to be very expensive this one exceeds many of them , Staff is very efficient
13515,Novotel London West, The REALLY noisy building works which started over the road at 8am in the morning and are going to be there for a LONG time I mentioned it as I checked out when they asked if everything was OK Oh yes the receptionist said we know all about that shame they hadn t bothered to tell me before I booked in , The bed was big and comfortable
13516,Novotel London West, No minibar Lights in room couldn t be dimmed either on or off , The Nespresso machine and free coffee pods in the room were great Shower was amazing Buffet dinner was excellent Great views of London Eye and Shard from top floors 
13517,Novotel London West, when I booked online I requested a room with a view when I arrived I was offer a upgrade with breakfast inclueded my upgrade was over looking a building site great view wanted a lay in after a concert but 8am was woken by the noise so I shower with only 1 complementary shower gel to share between 2 went down for breakfast to be told I hadn t been upgraded and breakfast wasn t include wanted 17 50 for a breakfast disgraceful as with the cost of room smaller then expect for a superior double and with food and drinks at the bar I spent 275 reception wasn t helpful and I wont be returning anytime soon, bar staff were great but then they was taking my money
13518,Novotel London West, Our room was not cleaned once during our stay Also kettle was faulty and ended up blowing a fuse so the Tv and fridge stopped working , The scrambled egg at breakfast was fantastic 
13519,Novotel London West, Floor so slippery in the shower I took a nasty fall Had to ring down fo bathrobes Brekfast while adequate too much walking around with plates drinks nd toast etc Fried eggs as hard as charity , cleanliness IT Stuff
13520,Novotel London West, Room was very small Mini fridge in room but can t be used even for your own goods without paying TV volume limited to VERY low Rooms look re done so lots of weird stuff like latches on doors that can t actually be used walls seem very thin in that you can hear a LOT of neighbouring noise , Location staff optional facilities I didn t use any of these Check in and out was easy 
13521,Novotel London West, We could clearly hear every conversation from the adjoining rooms Both days we woke up because of our neighbors discussions , Amazing breakfast comfortable bed The room was clean and well equipped
13522,Novotel London West, price food couldnt find correct light switch toiletries provided minimal despite having an exp room, The room waa standard bht i thought the price per night was high
13523,Novotel London West, Room would need sound proofing top to bottom We could hear guests in the next room using the toilet Kids running round in room above ours from 6 13am in morning until 12 00pm at night Kids also running up and down corridor and in and out of their rooms which every time loud bangs from door closing I understand families with young kids who probably really excited too and have every right as others when in hotels my kids weren t always teenagers but respect and consideration for others is something I was taught as a youngster and passed onto my kids too I had been looking forward to a break away from home Just my teenage daughter and I on this break to see a gig The Apollo a bit of normality after my daughter has been seriously ill for some time but to be honest we came home more tired than when we arrived I did bring to managements attention and the best that was offered was another room but was a room with an access door to another room where other guests would be To me that wouldn t have solved a problem We weren t given any details of facilities available to us either A few minor problems when we checking in as my dad was paying for us and no physical card with us after an hour or so management did sort everything but no info of times or where go if we wanted to get breakfast Just left to get on with it We ordered a Continental Breakfast to the room 13 95 per person which honestly that bad didn t order again next day While checking out we got told by staff about the buffet style breakfast we should have opted for in the restaurant same price Info not shared by anyone House keeping need to double check their cleaning methods Our table still had wet ring from cup I was drinking and biscuit crumbs from that morning still there when returned early evening The container cleaning powder was left in the bathroom though where it was used I couldn t tell , Staff were pleasant Room warm Power Shower excellent plenty hot water though if I was larger hips I couldn t have a bath as very narrow Location brilliant for Eventim HammerSmith Apollo gig Basically just round corner Transport bus train close by 
13524,Novotel London West,No Negative, Staff were friendly welcoming and attentive For a large hotel the service felt very personal Good breakfast and general facilities including fitness suite Room and bathroom were very clean Close to public transport links 
13525,Novotel London West, Hair in the bathroom which again confirm me the UK standards 4 hotel are way below v other countries This hotel in Italy for example would be considered a low 3 hotel Also the hotel way out is at a lower ground floor leading to a parking in a dodgy area Not very cool for a Novotel , Location Staff Bar Main Reception 
13526,Novotel London West, Only got one pillow bit uncomfortable The key didn t work one of the nights so had to go get it redone , Easy check in Friendly staff The room was spacious and well presented
13527,Novotel London West, difficult to get taxi when going out in the evening reception called and was informed it would be 30 40 minutes We walked up to the high street and hailed a taxi, friendly and attentive staff
13528,Novotel London West, Well to be honest it was all very good But spa and sauna facilities would be amazing , great room great bathroom fantastic breakfast staff friendly attentive but also totally professional Especially happy to discover my window could open did someone read my previous review 
13529,Novotel London West, the bathroom looked lovely but the shower was very weak, great location for a concert at the Hammersmith Apollo and easily accessible for the underground
13530,Novotel London West, The fact that there wasn t a designated smoking area closer to the room and I had to go all the way outside from my room which was a long way And I got woken up at 9am when check out was at midday , The fridge in the room
13531,Novotel London West, I think their could be more options on the room service menu not a very wide range in food or drinks , the staff were really friendly and the breakfast in the morning was the best i ve ever had 
13532,Novotel London West,No Negative, Very comfortable bed Offered an upgrade without asking with lovely coffee machine Very friendly helpful staff Clean and felt safe travelling alone 
13533,Novotel London West, One Lift out of order so had to wait a little longer for other one but not a major problem , Clean fresh room Nice friendly housekeeping staff came to set up sofa bed Reception staff very helpful and cheerful Enjoyed our stay 
13534,Novotel London West, Bar service for drinks was slow There was a conference and one feels that better planning by the hotel would ensure adequate number of bar staff working , Good location to the tube good restaurant breakfast and bar meals good gym facilities checking in and out was easy 
13535,Novotel London West, Trying to get a lift you were waiting for ages we took the stairs a lot but was only on the 3rd floor I imagine any higher this could be an issue , Amazing location staff were friendly room was lovely and breakfast is amazing just booked again 
13536,Novotel London West,No Negative, Upon arrival to the hotel we were informed that we had been selected as guests of the day which comes with a free room upgrade and complementary drink vouchers 
13537,Novotel London West, The carpet and sofa was a little tied looking so definitely take slippers , the room was a good size and a comfy bed with an excellent view over London and the Wembley Arch in the distance from my 8th floor window 
13538,Novotel London West, Rooms are tired need upgrading Extractor fan in bathroom didn t work neither did the hairdryer and speaker Awful smell in room probably from filters in central heating aircon They need to up their game on maintenance , Good location Staff friendly and efficient
13539,Novotel London West, Breakfast was additional to our booking we thought it expensive and found somewhere more reasonable We had to ask for our complimentary coffee and tea in the room to be replenished The kettle still had water in it from previous occupants , Great location nice size clean comfortable rooms Very quiet during the night so we were able to sleep Helpful and pleasant staff made us feel very welcome 
13540,Novotel London West, I expected more for the money The executive room was pretty basic one bathrobe and slippers between two of us Difficult to communicate with some of the staff as their English was so poor Bar area not big enough for the capacity , Very clean and the breakfast was amazing
13541,Novotel London West, The only thing we had a problem with was there not being enough milk in our room for drinks and the restaurant was a bit too expensive for out tastes, The value they have for their customers every member of staff went out of their way to make sure our start was perfect
13542,Novotel London West, It was a little further away from the Olympia than I thought but was a nice walk Lifts were a bit slow at times , Great bed Huge and very comfortable The food was excellent Especially the breakfast Burgers in the bar area were amazing too Staff very friendly and helpful
13543,Novotel London West, The room was shabby and drab the carpet was stained and grubby and the furnishings were not comfortable Also there was only one socket in the room to use for any electrical items I expected a much higher standard from the Novotel brand , The staff and food were great and the public areas like reception fitness centre and bars were lovely 
13544,Novotel London West, Had a long wait for the porter to collect baggage out of the luggage room then he couldn t find out case, Room was lovely staff pleasant and efficient
13545,Novotel London West,No Negative, The beds and pillows were really comfortable lovely the short walk to dinner which the receptionist booked for us on arrival great location to the venue
13546,Novotel London West, No faults at all, Room clean and beds made every day a fantastic breakfast lots of options hot and cold loved the scrambled eggs All staff are very friendly and polite Will stay again 
13547,Novotel London West,No Negative, We stayed at the novotel because we was attending an event at olympia this hotel is in the perfect place easy to get to from the train and a 5 minute walk to olympia there is a huge selection of places to eat on the high street if you choose not to eat in the hotel we had breakfast included with our stay which was lovel and the beds are so comfy Would highly reccomend this hotel 
13548,Novotel London West, I stayed two weeks in the hotel LIFTS WERE A HORROR Only few of them working Always crowded and you never know whether they take you up or down I was taking stairs instead living on the fourth floor but I can t imagine those staying on the ninth floor to do it A hotel is a bit worn out some refreshment of furniture and renovation would be welcomed Horrible toilettes that were splashing out water even with the closed cover I had problems with getting hot water few times There was only cold water running down the shower , The service was really good Nice and helpful staff I could even weight my luggage before leaving the hotel and re arrange it The hotel is clean Good location for my professional needs Many restaurants pubs and shops around Good connection with the center Gym a bit small but with the necessary equipment When I used it it was not crowded so just what you need 
13549,Novotel London West, Breakfast is overpriced better to use nearby facilities at the underground station if on a budget Could give a better free biscuit with the tea and coffee , Only 10ish mins walk from Olympia and Hammersmith station room was large clean and surprisingly quiet Luggage storage very useful Good value for money in Central London given the room size and location 
13550,Novotel London West,No Negative, Taxi service was bad They did not have a free shuttle to the airport like most major hotels in major cities They had their own private taxis that you had to pay extra for Every time I see this I think there is an under the table bribe somewhere I had to walk about 200 meters to get a real local taxi 
13551,Novotel London West, The rooms being so small The dark alley that you have to walk down at night to enter the hotel a little pricey to not have breakfast included and small cold rooms , I ate at the bar restaurant food was overly priced and horrible Skip the fish chips all together The staff was very friendly and helpful and always eager to assist The rooms were small and cold Only thing they had were sheets and no comforters to keep us warm throughout the night The heat barely worked and the rooms are really small for the price I chose to rent an apartment for our last night in London just so we could spread out and have some room 
13552,Novotel London West, Would have liked poached eggs No mirror in the bedroom to sit at the desk dressing table to dry your hair , The option of crispy bacon was good Upgraded to a superior room and given a free drinks voucher a welcome surprise 
13553,Novotel London West, Shower wasn t fab just the type of shower not powerful enough The lifts stopped on every floor in the morning when I went down for breakfast and returned and on most floors there was no one waiting for lift , Bed was very comfy Rooms clean with coffee tea making facilities and ironing board iron 
13554,Novotel London West, Chairs in the room could be a bit more comfortable Entry on ground floor no sky sports No shower mat in room No biscuits in room, Nice and quite room was spacious with iron and ironing board Bose Bluetooth speaker very comfortable bed a proper bed
13555,Novotel London West, There was absolutely nothing I didn t dislike about this hotel, Friendly and helpful staff modern and clean hotel and a great breakfast Would recommend this hotel and most definitely stay again 
13556,Novotel London West, Nothing all really nice, We were the guests of the day which was a lovely surprise and got breakfast included as well as a room on 9th floor The bed was very comfy Fantastic hotel in every way 
13557,Novotel London West, No bath bathrobes or slippers in the room as was stated on my booking This had to be requested told housekeeping closed then one bath robe brought to room at midnight Not even two or any slippers Only explanation given was that we were upgraded however did not meet the basic standard facilities as posted on the booking page Disappointed facilities were not all in there for such a big price of 149 for one night ,No Positive
13558,Novotel London West, it was full both nights we were there and so everywhere was crowded Checkin took a while The restaurants wre heaving Had to go early to beakfast otherwise wouldn t have got a table quickly We just really didn t like how crowded and busy it felt, Location Parking Choice at breakfast Quick checkout
13559,Novotel London West, Late night early morning noise from other guests Room adequate but a little bit tired , Short notice stay Convenient for businesses in Hammersmith 
13560,Novotel London West,No Negative, Exceptional reception staff at ground and second floor they satisfied every special request I made The room was sparkle clean and fully equipped very good breakfast and the bartenders were very friendly and charming Located at 1 minute from Hammersmith tube station The perfect stay 
13561,Novotel London West, Shower head couldn t adjust Very slow WiFi and electricity when charging Lack of wall sockets near bedside , Very cleanly Hairdryer and iron included in the room Great location near the Hammersmith Apollo and Hammersmith tube station 
13562,Novotel London West, Fairly basic and room was very hot Air conditioning was broken so temperature couldn t be adjusted , Clean relatively comfortable and good value for money 
13563,Novotel London West,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfy staff were also very friendly Had a slight problem as we first got to the room and this was fixed within 10 minutes of me reporting to reception 
13564,Novotel London West, Terrible sleepless night due to other guests partying Woken up at 3am still people walking halls talking loudly at 4 30am YOU NEED SECURITY WALKing THE HALLS SATURDAY NIGHTS ,No Positive
13565,Novotel London West, Smoke alarm in room went off at 11 50pm for 5sec just enough wake in blind panic but no actual Alarm Man next door coughing non stop in the morning it was from about 6am both days started to feel sorry for him , We didn t book breakfast but was told at check in we were guest of the day upgraded to executive room and free breakfast result Rooms on 9th floor are good with decently coffee machine with pods Hotel easy walk to Olympia where we had a exhibition also easy walk to Shepard Bush 
13566,Novotel London West, Staff were helpful but as English wasn t their first language this was a bit of a problem The hotel looks tired and needs a refit The layout is strange reception on the first floor not ground floor Rooms are small and feel like a budget hotel We wouldn t stay there again , The event I attended at the Novotel was excellently organised however I think this was more down to the actual event organisers rather then the Novotel staff 
13567,Novotel London West, Only one thing to mention Please check your electric watter kettles in rooms when watter is boiled and you fill up te cup each time boiled water leaks on to the surface They probably should be changed to new ones Thanks , Great breakfast comfortable room great location 
13568,Novotel London West,No Negative, I stay every year sometimes twice a year when I exhibit at Olympia It is really convenient Was very impressed that i got an upgrade to breakfast on this occassion It was a nice touch I don t eat enough breakfast to warrant paying over 10 but being offered a free breakfast meant I could enjoy some fresh fruit and tea before heading off 
13569,Novotel London West,No Negative, Definitely geared up for business travellers and I would consider staying here for business in the future This trip was for pleasure The staff were very friendly and helpful We had booked a standard room but on arrival were advised that we had been upgraded to an executive room which was a great surprise The review is therefore based on this but if we were to go back again we d be more than tempted to go for the upgrade anyway Location was perfect for visiting nearby family Central London and theatre land is a decent tube journey away but completely do able from here and allowed for a relaxed stay without being in the middle of the madness the whole time 
13570,Novotel London West, My only issues were breakfast was a set price of 17 50 regardless of how much you had As someone who eats very little in the morning this was not good value Also the bar stopped serving food around 10pm despite it being advertised as up to 11pm,No Positive
13571,Novotel London West,No Negative, This hotel was fabulous we were their guests of the day when we checked in and so we got upgraded to an executive suite and free breakfast each morning of our stay Room was fab and breakfast was so nice Located a few mins walk from Hammersmith Station so this was great for getting around 
13572,Novotel London West,No Negative, Loved it here The convention I was attending was at the same hotel and upon arrival I was made up to hear that I d been picked as Guest of the day upgrading my room with free breakfast Very welcoming and lovely hotel Had a great weekend 
13573,Novotel London West, Th room was fairly basic for what was billed as a 4 star hotel The bathroom certainly didnt meet 4 star standards Hammersmith is practically the end of the line so there was an awful lot of travelling on the tube but it was easy enough Parking shgould be free even with the discount it was far too expensive , If we had time the bar restaurant facilities and the gym all looked very good
13574,Novotel London West, Superb hotel fantastic staff really enjoyed our upgrade and the complimentary drink fantastic view lovely room will definitely return thank you so much Novotel,No Positive
13575,Novotel London West, Shabby decor rooms are painted white on what looks like 70 s woodchip wallpaper The tacky plastic flowers planted at the main entrance should of been our 1st clue Poor quality of bedding with wafer thin pillows Possibly the cheapest toilet paper I ve ever experienced in a hotel of this price range Very noisy even for London We were woken at 7 30am on a Sunday morning by staff wheeling trolleys full of what sounded like glassware we were on the 4th floor followed soon after by regular chambermaid trolleys rolling up and down the corridor with clunky wheels The sound between rooms is also easily audible Staff look bored and the Bar Staff give you the feeling that they re waiting for a better job to come along to whisk them away When I did comment about the issues I had at the front desk it was met with an oh well shrug of the shoulders and hasty preparation of my bill I ve had better stays in Premier Inns and for 200 a night I would seriously look elsewhere , Local to what we needed
13576,Novotel London West, Nothing it was all great, Staff always fantastic and helpful Wonderful receptionists We had a problem with roadworks noise and reception did everything they could to make us happy immediately offered room switch It was late in evening and we were too tired to pack everything up The hotel gave us complimentary breakfast next morning Very attentive and friendly staff Modern beautifully decorated great lighting Macs and printers available in reception area handy for printing out flight tickets etc We love staying at this hotel and it s always our go to Tube is 4 minute walk to Hammersmith and buses into the city centre are opposite hotel Plenty of restaurants shops just 4 mins away 
13577,Novotel London West, The carpets was clean but think it could do with a change as lots of marks stains , Staff were amazing very helpful and always smiling excellent customer service Bed was Comfy room was huge and very clean
13578,Novotel London West, Internet was a bit hard to log on to issues with shower the water pressure was too low and sinks were clogged , Place was clean and the staff was friendly
13579,Novotel London West, Only one small issue with sockets not working in room but was very quickly resolved by staff popping up to our room with a replacement key for an alternative room Great service , Breakfast was great and hotel was way nicer than photographs depicted especially public areas Very pleasantly surprised 
13580,Novotel London West, Slightly confusing entrance system on 2 levels , Comfortable hotel very good breakfast buffet style with plenty of choice Good views from our room with a small but well equipped gym Friendly and helpful staff 
13581,Novotel London West, Not at all sound proof so didn t sleep well Rarely saw any staff , Lovely bathroom great bath nice room layout good room a luxury for London proximity to travel options space in hotel great bed 
13582,Novotel London West, As we are all big tea drinkers would have liked more tea bags , I came to meet up with my two sisters We had a great time finding the rooms very comfortable even just to sit around to chat in We ate in the hotel food was good service great It was all we expected it to be great couple of days 
13583,Novotel London West, The surcharge for the mini fridge for a 300ml bottle of water of 2 75 is VERY EXCESSIVE How about two free bottles of water , The room and bathroom were impeccable clean and the free Wi Fi was stable 
13584,Novotel London West, The only minor thing I would say which isn t really a criticism just a side note the breakfast food wasn t labelled so it was tricky to determine of the sausages were non vegetarian or not and you couldn t be sure of the flavour of the pastries but it all tasted lovely anyway , The breakfast was great so much to choose from and plenty to have to fill you up The room was perfect size and very clean no noise disturbance from other guest or the outside world the location for the Hammersmith Apollo was excellent a 5 minute walk at most 
13585,Novotel London West, Construction just outside window vibrated entire room stating at 7 45 each morning Bed wasn t great as far as comfort , Breakfast was good desk staff super friendly
13586,Novotel London West, Bed was too close to the wall so knocked knees feet on the wall when getting up during the night, Helpfulness of reception staff Lovely bar food before we went to a concert at the Apollo Easy check out
13587,Novotel London West, Booked a double room Was given a twin and had to complain So called Superior room very basic and hence overpriced for what it is Staff great Restaurants good ,No Positive
13588,Novotel London West, Construction work outside hotel was very noisy but I guess this only temporary AC not working in room so very cold night but staff very helpful and moved us to another room , Couldn t fault the price for the quality and location of this hotel 
13589,Novotel London West, There was a very long queue at Reception to check in although the staff remained cheerful and did the best they could with the resources they had Loo roll was in short supply , The room was clean and comfortable Facilities in the room were very good Two hairdryers 
13590,Novotel London West, I appreciate most of the reception staff are international but sometimes my ol ears just cant understand them But they are very polite perfectly attired and smile genuinely so Thank you , We decided to have an evening meal in the Aroma restaurant a set price buffet including three course We tried it and it was superb We will definately eat there again Plus it was my wifes birthday and they upgraded our room to an executive wow Very much appreciated 
13591,Novotel London West, We were charged for twice as many rooms as we booked and are now left chasing around for documentation to prove that this occurred 20 minutes on the phone only to be told that I have to prove that I have overpaid The hotel took no notice of my booking confirmation from booking com Who made the error certainly not me but I am going to have to wait for an age to get my money back , We were upgraded and received a free breakfast 
13592,Novotel London West, Everything was perfect even if our neighbours were a bit noisy , A really fancy and confortable hotel We had a really great time The staff is very kind and helpful 
13593,Novotel London West, The finish in the bedroom walls looked cheap The bathroom looked old and when we ran the bath water the water was dirty that came out , Location was good
13594,Novotel London West, There is a large and active construction site across from the hotel rendering the noise level occasionally higher than the standard urban level And as is sometimes the case in large capital city hotels there was a large group of still tipsy loud and poorly supervised young adults teens dominating the lobby the day I arrived Still that was par for the course , The staff was supremely professional and courteous they offered to let me check in a bit early once the room was ready clarified and resolved a minor clerical error in the booking and made sure all was set for my partner who was arriving after me to pick up a key to the room The breakfast cost extra but was well worth it plenty of options for carnivores and vegetarians alike The hotel is conveniently located between Heathrow and central London and has excellent public transport connections There are a number of pubs restaurants cafes and shops Tesco Boots etc nearby I would definitely stay here again 
13595,Novotel London West, Minor issue In Room 9026 the overhead showerhead needs descaling London s hard water has caused some of the spouts to be blocked It s not unusual , January 2017 Selected as Guest Of The Day and provided with a complimentary Room Service Upgrade Novotel Hammersmith London UK continues to provide a superbly attentive service friendly beautiful staff a credit to the Novotel brand within a contemporary environment on the outskirts of central London so it s in a quieter location and provides value for money The Premium Room is superbly decorated with a large double bed that is like sleeping on a Nimbus Cloud for seven hours The provision of high quality absorbent towels in the walk in shower were a delight to use after stepping out of the rain storm like overhead shower The free to access Wi Fi is consistent throughout the building rooms The BOSE sound Bluetooth sound system was a pleasant surprise Overall excellent Even if you are not upgraded all the rooms are very good quality and the serve yourself eat as much as you like breakfast is truly remarkable value for money I hate to recommend Novotel Hammersmith to you as it may mean it would be difficult for me to reserve a room in the future But I will wholeheartedly 
13596,Novotel London West, Room furnishing is more like a 3 star hotel, Location near Olympia good for conferences and exhibitions attendees clean nice lounge bar rich breakfast
13597,Novotel London West,No Negative, I was greeted with excellent customer service and I was Guest of the Day meaning my room was upgraded The bed was very comfy and the shower was very powerful Breakfast was lovely but the did have to queue to be seated as it was very busy Staff were very accommodating 
13598,Novotel London West, First impression of entrance area doesn t do hotel any favours felt like a basement Shame because it is a lovely bright place once you suss it out Lift to reception all a bit confusing Whole of that floor could be better laid out , Lovely twin room with larger single beds Spotless and comfortable would have liked extra pillow Nice bar All staff delightful 
13599,Novotel London West, For the 185 for 2 nights a Breakfast included would have given far more value to the deal As a friend of mine was staying in a hotel in Russel Square slightly cheaper but breakfast was included in price For me that was a big let down I do not think I would book with Novotel because of that clause , The attention of staff at reception was great having staff like that at the front of house is a bonus for any business Very helpful and welcoming any questions or requests were attended to which is value to all customers again a bonus to the hotel great staff Don t forget to give them the applause for the good job the do 
13600,Novotel London West,No Negative, The receptionist found out is was my son s birthday and bought up a family sized desert just for him to celebrate and also gave us a room upgrade 
13601,Novotel London West, The rooms are not well cleaned Initially we have given a room which had annoying construction noise but when complained we have given a room on the other side with no noise The room was very hot due to the heating system been controlled by the hotel Water was only supplied on the first and last day of the stay thought as I understand should be on everyday Bed sheet was changed based on request , In a nice area close to the bus and tube station and many shops and coffee shops in the area Close to central London The hotel is very big with nice lobby and nice atmosphere 
13602,Novotel London West, the service from the kitchen 45 minute wait for a minute steak in Ciabatti REALLY little things on customer relations really like getting the attention of the staff in bar for table service more interested in bar service than serving tables also after meal they don t ask if you would like anything else or a coffee you could be making more money and leaving the customer feeling like they have been attended to rather than serviced The breakfast buffet was almost plastic in its appearance a little chopped parsley on top of the scrambled eggs would be nice and well the poached eggs looked like a frizbee and tasted pretty much the same staff setting up and cleaning tables next to you in the rush to get ready for lunch takes away from a leisurely breakfast experience, The bed was very comfy good wifi reception polite staff
13603,Novotel London West, The bed was very very soft Being 6ft 8inc a lot more support was needed didn t get a great nights sleep , Hotel and facilities were great very close to the venue I was working at that night 
13604,Novotel London West, only there one night and didn t fine anything objectionable while staying there, everything in the room was comfortable and clean and the bar area was nice and relaxed after returning from the concert that evening Staff friendly and polite during stay Sorry there is only so much you can do in one night 
13605,Novotel London West, The room was quite cold and the heater didn t seem to make much difference even when on full, They made me a dairy free omelette to order I also had the bacon that was beautifully crispy a rare option in many hotels
13606,Novotel London West, The reception on the first not the ground floor Very pricey but that s London I guess I paid literally half the rate for a similar hotel the next night in Glasgow , Convenience of location for Hammersmith shops tube into central London
13607,Novotel London West, Only the too soft bed , Great location We d taken a 14 hour flight into LHR and arrived at 9am The staff were excellent allowed us to check in early and upgraded our room The bed was too soft for me but that s personal choice The breakfast was outstanding 
13608,Novotel London West, Felt breakfast was a bit unorganised but enjoyable all the same, Beds comfy lots of lovely hot water tea and coffee in room very good always time for a cuppa
13609,Novotel London West, Was advised parking was 15 per night but is actually 1 50 an hour This is the resident rate which you only get if you validate at reception although no one told us that and we had to go back or pay 67 Breakfast was poor quality and chaos , Very clean comfortable and modern
13610,Novotel London West, We liked everything nothing bad to say, I liked that we were chosen as guest of the day and was upgraded to the executive suite The room was immaculately clean tidy and very nice interior The staff were very friendly and very helpful 
13611,Novotel London West, I would have preferred softer and thinner pillows , Rooms were clean and comfortable Great shower facility Breakfast was great and had everything we wanted Staff were very friendly and helpful 
13612,Novotel London West, Restaurant food lack of local knowledge at reception poor English of several at reception noise in corridor most especially expensive parking, Quiet outside from courtyard
13613,Novotel London West, NOTHING , This is our 10th stay at this hotel which should tell you how much we enjoy staying here The room we had had just been upgraded so was lovely and clean as always I know the carpark is 1 50 an hour but it is London Are already planning our next trip to this hotel 
13614,Novotel London West, Building works left the hall to our room dirty Decor to room could do with a refresh Bed hard Only 1 pillow Water splashed out of bowl when flushed Only two teabags , Location 
13615,Novotel London West, We d asked for milk for the room which didn t come but this was a very minor problem, We were upgraded to a premium executive room as their Guest of the Day and we had a free full breakfast each to go with it Couldn t fault the hotel at all 
13616,Novotel London West, Nothing Everything absolutely perfect Will use again whenever I need hotel accommodation , Super service from a very reputable company Nothing I would have expected less from 
13617,Novotel London West, Taxi cabs are not available at the hotel had to go onto the High St and down to Hammersmith pain on a wet day Breakfast is far too expensive at 17stg Gr, Requested extra pillows and got them A female front desk person was very attentive thin with dark hair 
13618,Novotel London West, Poorly signposted from road Reception staff could barely speak comprehensible English On arrival the receptionist chose to check us in on the guest side of the desk and faced away from us throughout so it was almost impossible to understand a word he was saying Supply of tea bags milk in room were stingy Rooms were characterless , Bed was comfortable and room was clean and had everything required Tea coffee making facilities available 
13619,Novotel London West, Room was needing a bit of TLC some fixture and fittings a bit loose tatty but ok , Comfy bed good hot shower good wifi excellent location for Olympia and the Hammersmith area Happy to walk about this area on my own 
13620,Novotel London West, I had two stays in Novotel West London in the past 2 weeks 8 2 days In general my staying was very disappointing The main problem was the noise from the construction site next door Starting at 7am finishing at 6pm Monday to Saturday It was really annoying to get awaken by construction machines every day Other nuisances There were not enough power outlets only in one side of the bed and no USB ones One of the rooms I stayed had only 5 TV channels other one had 30 You need to re log into the wifi network every day which was annoying and unnecessary Toiletries were not consistently provided we went days and days with no bar soap or moisturiser Room temperature was not pleasant we had to open the windows to have some cool air into the room Breakfast for 17 pounds was crazy Last year I stayed at Hilton Kensington and I think it was much better value , Everything was clean This hotel is located right next to my company s building so that was very convenient for me 
13621,Novotel London West, Long walk to room Exits slightly confusing, Beautiful Christmas Decorations Very polite and helpful staff great food in lobby bar and fantastic breakfast Perfect location for Olympia Room had everything including hot shower
13622,Novotel London West, checkin agent confirmed a double bed when we found a twin in the room slow elevators overpriced bad room design light switches shower , close to the underground good restaurant fast wifi
13623,Novotel London West, Very loud music going on til after midnight that stopped me sleeping even when I was on the third floor Rooms clean but very basic only one pillow And 2 of the sockets in the room didn t work , Breakfast was lovely
13624,Novotel London West, Shower very basic and the water temperature could have been hotter, Very comfortable bed Good food Good location for our needs Staff very attentive and helpful Good facilities Nice getaway
13625,Novotel London West, Had to wait around for porter to leave baggage with Cleaning staff knocked once before entering room to see if we needed more water could have knocked a few more times, We were upgraded and given free breakfast
13626,Novotel London West, Only the elec lights worked in my room Kettle TV H dryer plug by TV all dead As I only occupied the room for 7hrs to sleep I just had to cope no time to complain get it sorted All VERY inconvenient I reported it to the desk as I left The room was 4029 I think, Breakfast was good Pillows poor
13627,Novotel London West, I walk with a stick and my room was a really long way from the lifts The ice machine wasn t working and the mini bar was empty The pillows were very hard and quite uncomfortable , The staff were super friendly and helpful The food in the aroma restaurant was incredible and the choice of breakfast was amazing
13628,Novotel London West, Complementaries in bathroom bit sparse would have liked body moisturiser cotton buds cotton wool , Comfortable quiet large room superior facilities for price
13629,Novotel London West, Only two tea bags in room and very little milk Had to ask for rubber bath mat and extra pillows as there was only one half size pillow on each bed arranged a taxi at the check in desk at 1230 for pick up at 1740 this did not arrive until 18 15 and traffic was so bad we had to walk a long way to our destination, If we requested anything extra it was attended to immediately had a small fridge in room which was empty for our use
13630,Novotel London West, The shower took a while to warm up and there was an issue with the food in Saturday but the staff are really nice It just seems a little over priced ,No Positive

13632,Novotel London West, breakfast was good but it can be improved room as in all London not so spacious for an executive room, in general we enjoyed our stay staff very helpful
13633,Novotel London West, Had to call security as there was a disturbance on my floor keeping us awake all night and coffee machine didn t work, Staff and hotel was very good
13634,Novotel London West, Having to wait 25 minutes for tea coffee at breakfast , We were chosen as guests of the day so got an upgrade to an executive room and free drinks in the bar 
13635,Novotel London West, The room was really hot and air con just seemed to blow out hot air Our room key didn t work had to visit reception 3 times before it was sorted this took awhile when you are on the 7th floor Wouldn t go there again , Breakfast was very good
13636,Novotel London West, Nothing, Upgraded to Premium suites on arrival after being advised we were Guests of the Day Free drinks at the bar free breakfast and bigger room also great location for city centre 
13637,Novotel London West, Coffee machine in room didn t work and wasn t attended to Apparent failure of hot water boiler meant tea late at breakfast Restaurant appeared to close 25 minutes early on Saturday evening but alternatives were offered and food and service at the bar were good , Friendly staff at check in general cleanliness and overall efficiency Great location for Hammersmith Apollo which was a key feature of the booking Breakfast good as was meal in Bar 
13638,Novotel London West, We wasn t told that there was a building site just across the way so not a very nice awakening Would of liked the choice of Bath or shower , Room was good and comfortable shower was great Food was very good 
13639,Novotel London West, Rooms were very very hot inside changed rooms twice due to the rooms being stuffy and hot I also started getting heat spots and notified reception over 6 times and nothing was ever done Air conditioning machine did not work Room is to small and compact they claim to call it an executive room there was nothing executive about the room All a marketing spiel Do not fall for this trap,No Positive
13640,Novotel London West, The approach to the hotel is dark and potentially dangerous when wet and without lighting There were street lamps on the walkway but they were never lit There was also a lot of rubbish around which I feel a good hotel would have taken responsibility for cleaning The worst part room 8003 filled the jug on the espresso machine from the bathroom tap it came out bright green soapy with bits floating in it It also had a sewage smell not nice to brush your teeth in Reported to reception twice after it was still smelling horrible the next morning They said they would report it and get back to me by email which hasn t happened I kept a sample of the water in case we became ill Very disappointing service for the price , Great location for eventim apollo theatre Nice walk round Hammersmith bridge a 10 minute walk away Breakfast excellent make sure you spot the regular toaster Lots of channels on tv Nice toiletries Very nice staff in breakfast room

13646,Novotel London West, The only little niggle was when we got back to the hotel at 10 45 we ordered drinks at the bar and then asked for food people around us were eating and the barman told us it was getting busy and to go over to the restaurant to eat We waited for our drinks and headed over to the restaurant which was closed We have a feeling that he was trying to avoid having to work later than possible which we do understand but thought a little cheeky It didn t spoil our stay though , We were upgraded and offered a free breakfast which was very kind When booking I had asked for a top floor room which we were given The car parking discount saved us a lot of money We found the whole experience great and will definitely be using your hotels again thank you so much 
13647,Novotel London West, Power cut for a few hours one morning Not notified Only told when we phoned and asked Therefore no hot water either so wasted half day waiting for a shower No free drink voucher or the like for the inconvenience Asked for extra pillows never arrived Apparently I d booked wrong check out date Saturday instead of Sunday even though on check in the receptionist informed me I could arrange late check out on Sunday if I needed it and so asked to book a further night Was told that they had no rooms and I had half an hour to get my bags Asked for her help but she was completely unhelpful bordering on rude and said well we have no rooms here No suggestions for other hotels in the area etc Would not use again or recommend ,No Positive
13648,Novotel London West, A note under everyonesdoor about the power outage and to say breakfast was still available would have been good Also no apologies given at reception on way out or by email after for the inconvenience, Always friendly
13649,Novotel London West, No electricity due to power cut but very stressful especially as morning of a job interview Paid for breakfast deal but had luke warm tea and cereal instead of cooked breakfast Not hotels fault but no apology or explanation from staff An expensive stay for nothing extra Disappointed , Friendly welcome Room clean and warm 
13650,Novotel London West, Our room key stopped working and it was a long walk back to reception from our room to ask for help We also experienced a power cut which although not the hotels fault proved problematic when trying to use the bathroom early in the morning , The staff were extremely helpful particularly when sorting out problems 
13651,Novotel London West,No Negative, The check in was smooth and the staff were very courteous esp Ms Serena We were given a room upgrade and complimentary breakfast too Breakfast was excellent Overall a very satisfying experience 
13652,Novotel London West, The room was cold There was only one pillow per person with no extra pillows available , The location is good The lobby and reception area are very clean 
13653,Novotel London West, The food Breakfast is fine but the room service dinner I had was very disappointing and room services is never cheap Working away and long hours I didn t get to eat until about 8 30pm Receiving a burnt bottomed rock hard pizza with poor flavours is not what you need after a long travel day I couldn t finish it so for me it was a waste of money , The location staff and facilities were great I had a quick and easy time checking in and the robe slippers coffee machine were a great touch
13654,Novotel London West, Toilet could be prepered better For 3 people just one set 5ml of shower gel and shampoo Some pilows bit hard and not comfy , Great bufet breakfast Clean rooms windows open what is plus Staff kind and helpfull Beautiful reception restaurant Close to central Hammersmith not so far to different areas Several restaurants around 
13655,Novotel London West, Access is not easy and was made even more difficult from the car park as the main lifts were out of order Also no food available after 2300 when many guests are returning from the theatre concerts clubs etc ,No Positive
13656,Novotel London West, Temperature in the whole hotel was too high room especially so even with thermostat set on minimum , Staff very helpful Breakfast hot and tasty Room very clean 
13657,Novotel London West, The breakfast was a little expensive so we passed , We booked as we were going to the Eventim Apollo and the location is perfect just a five minute walk The bed was really comfortable and the bar staff were very friendly Great facilities and a great overnight stay It was a shame we were not staying longer 
13658,Novotel London West, I think the trump When u are going to underground Its either u are going to use stairs or trump If u have luggage u need to use the trump , The best hotel in London The staff were very accomodating Wifi is ok 
13659,Novotel London West, There was nothing that I did not like , Room very spacious Bed very comfortable Staff seemed very friendly Very clean and tidy throughout Would definitely recommend 
13660,Novotel London West, Both pedestrian entrances to this hotel were potentially unsafe after dark being poorly lit and easy for attackers to strike Even as a couple we felt unsafe and we are used to London , The room was very quiet and contained everything necessary for a comfortable overnight stop 
13661,Novotel London West, Continental breakfast poor value for money and some items forgotten on both mornings A la carte restaurant very expensive and poor value for money Double bed was not very comfortable , Easy express check out 
13662,Novotel London West, Breakfast was warm not hot Our room was not serviced during our two nights stay hence no clean towels etc Keycards expired the first evening and we were missing from the breakfast list , Plenty for breakfast
13663,Novotel London West, check in on tablet took si much time porter service not available and noone there to pick up my luggage spent like 20 minutes going up and down with all my bags wifi is unsecured so my business laptop could not connect due to insufficient security Room could be furnished more practically , guest of the day upgrade
13664,Novotel London West, There are very less infact zero dine in options for Muslims We wanted to try fish and chips but even it was cooked in liquor So we ordered food from outside , We booked stayed in Executive Room which was quite nice We were also shown the Twin Room but Executive Room is far superior spacious clean comfortable Great location We used sofa cum bed as our second bed Location is very good We stayed for 3 nights 
13665,Novotel London West, I left behind a bottle of expensive perfume I d just received as a gift However when I contacted the hotel they said the housekeeping team hadn t handed it in ,No Positive
13666,Novotel London West, The check in system is complicated using iPads They get you to sit down with a staff member and it all takes quite some minutes which is annoying when you have pre booked with all the info and are tired from a long flight , The room was spacious and comfortable The location was quiet The hotel is in easy walking distance from the tube station which is on the Piccadilly line so great for arriving from Heathrow 
13667,Novotel London West, The rooms were fine but the decor in our room was very bland could do with a splash of colour Bathroom a bit tired toilet was leaking from the base , Breakfast was excellent one of the best I have ever had in a hotel Staff were lovely We had a problem with the safe in our room and this was rectified very promptly 
13668,Novotel London West, Room was on the third floor and was close to some sort of loud speaker convention that was being held that weekend The staff could have informed us of the event , Great location friendly staff and comfortable room 
13669,Novotel London West, Bar staff could be a bit more friendly and aware of who to serve next Four lifts but not all working , Great Location A warm welcome from Diego Lovely room spacious and clean 
13670,Novotel London West, The queue for breakfast was a little slow otherwise terrific , Very comfortable bed excellent breakfast including veggie sausages and well stocked bar 
13671,Novotel London West, Cleaners started work very early and were very noisy outside the room and woke us We put the sign on the door saying do not disturb and the cleaner still came in , Reception Staff were excellent and friendly
13672,Novotel London West,No Negative, A modern classic hotel with a all round warmth and friendly The staff were excellent in all area s particularly at front desk nothing seemed to be a problem they helped were polite and above noticed other guests waiting and acknowledged them Well appointed room with Comfy bed and crisp white linen This hotel was recommended to us and we will definitely pass on our recommendations See you on our next visit to Cologne Sharon Morgan Sept 2016

13675,Novotel London West, Nothing couldn t fault it at all , The Bed was amazing best nights sleep I ve had in a long time Staff were always polite friendly helpful and very welcoming Perfectly located for all our needs
13676,Novotel London West, A little bit walk from metro 5 min But not so bad Staff not so cheerful , Proper 4 star hotel and relative chap price Bus stop next to it and busses 9 10 will take you to the centre in no time Fair distance from Hammersmith metro Hammersmith is very convenient station many lines intercept 
13677,Novotel London West, The car parking is a rip off and I was very disappointed with my meal at the Artisan restaurant I had a steak which was high on price but low on quality I ve had far better steaks for much less money I ate it because it was my partner s birthday and didn t want any hassle Otherwise I would ve most certainly made a complaint, The whole hotel looked very nice and it was in a very good location close to the underground The room was also very nice and clean Good facilities with internet access
13678,Novotel London West, The room was very very cold The heating wouldn t work No extra pillows I might as well slept on a irioning blared very uncomfortable pillows Duvet was so thin I had to sleep with socks jumper Today I actually feel so ill sleeping like that The charger plug socket wouldn t work properly couldn t even charge my phone next to me Had to getting up in the night to charge it As I came in to check in the girl asked my name then says sorry nothing under your name Needed some sort of proof of booking what like I was lying that s how it felt Went into my emails found the booking ref then realised she made a error how to spell my surname When I actually spent it out for her LAL Is that really hard to spell I dnt Want to made to fell like I wasn t good enough for your hotel don t no what image I had on people , Only thing I liked was how close it was near the tube station Showers were clean
13679,Novotel London West, Being awoken by the local building works at 08 00am Appreciate this is not the hotel s fault but this still put a damper on an otherwise faultless stay , All aspects of the stay were good apart from What didn t you like above 
13680,Novotel London West, The hotel is weirdly arranged at ground level with two entrances both signposted Main Entrance and neither staffed at night reception is on the floor above This caused problems when I booked a taxi home and it went to the wrong entrance , The staff were very helpful whenever I had problems including helping me contact my taxi firm Reception was well staffed at all times When needed there were extra staff equipped with tablets to speed handling The room was spacious 
13681,Novotel London West, Breakfast wasn t included in the price and our coffee machine didn t work , Loved the quality of the hotel and the comfort of the beds Was impressed with the facilities in our room although the coffee machine did not work At 159 per night it would have been great if breakfast was included Overall I was impressed with the hotel and would definitely stay there again 
13682,Novotel London West, Cleaned our room at 3 30 pm just when we had come back for a rest after being out all day before going out to a show so we had to wait in reception for 15 minutes, Buffet breakfast nice bar area very friendly staff and got a room upgrade with a good view and a great little coffee maker
13683,Novotel London West, Thought booking com indicated breakfast included on prices before I booked but it wasn t I have stayed here before breakfast was good so this was a factor in booking here again We didn t have breakfast this time as would have been 4 x 17 50 extra , Perfect for Eventim Apollonius gig
13684,Novotel London West, Bathroom was old and uncomfortable Loud construction outside of the hotel Most of the furniture was worn out Too expensive for whay they offer superior room , Very good breakfast and lovelly breakfast area Nice receptione 
13685,Novotel London West, Founds stains on the towels Sleeper couch was poor Had arranged late checkout but the staff checked us out prematurely and we were unable to get back into our room Very rudely they said they had no record of our late checkout request I contacted Novotel directly and they promised to look after us at our next stay the following week Unfortunately they didn t fulfill this promse Price per night was poor value for money , Check in and Breakfast staff we re amazing A lady by the name of Felicia specifically was really warm and made our breakfast really special In room dining was great 
13686,Novotel London West,No Negative, The breakfast was just amazing the best I ve ever had in a hotel and the bed was really comfortable I do not have any cons to add I had a great experience 
13687,Novotel London West, The room charge of 20 for breakfast when waiting time was incurred in the dining room Also laundry charges very high for holiday guests with no other choice ,No Positive
13688,Novotel London West, Breakfast was very poor greasy bacon was hard all left under lights too long had to ask for milk bread fruit etc to be filled up both mornings not wot we expect from your hotels,No Positive
13689,Novotel London West, Had to wait to be seated a while No cups cutlery on table Think this is because it is just very busy, Plenty of food on offer There are a few buffet tables as there are a lot of seatsso didn t have to wait 
13690,Novotel London West, A little awkward to find entrance from the Underground station though the road layout doesn t help , After a long and difficult journey being told I was Customer of the Day and given an upgrade to a great room with a view across to central London was wonderful Even without that this seemed good value compared to many other hotels I ve stayed in in London Clean and crisp well furnished room comfy bed great staff and a good breakfast Thank you 
13691,Novotel London West, view was of the car park parking very very expensive the a la carte restaurant was very expensive for what it was , rooms were very clean liked the technology in room bose speakers that played in your bathroom breakfast was fantastic 
13692,Novotel London West, System at Reception If busy it can be quite a wait to get hold of staff That said once it is your turn staff couldn t be more helpful , Excellently situated in central London Easy access to bus and tube stations Very helpful staff I will definitely use this venue again 
13693,Novotel London West, Internal lock missing from the door into the room Although this was fixed when I pointed it out to the girl who cleans the room No water bottles and no shower caps anymore Only 2 pillows for 2 beds Apparently we the customer don t want or use these items so if you want them you have to ask house keeping , Large Comfy beds Nice shower gel and shampoo Every room has a small fridge 
13694,Novotel London West,No Negative, We were chosen as guest of the day and got an upgrade Breakfast was great so I d book it in future We always enjoy this Novotel the staff are very friendly and the rooms are comfortable 
13695,Novotel London West, restaurant staff at breakfast herded us like cattle and even tried to take plates we were still eating from without a single word or eye contact Sadly we couldn t make use of free drink at the bar as there was a convention on and nowhere for us to sit Bed was uncomfortable , Fantastic reception staff and room service staff and wonderful to be upgraded on arrival Lovely spacious room 
13696,Novotel London West, At check in I was asked if I had stayed at the hotel before The receptionist then went into a back room for a very long time and I was left standing at the desk When she returned I was asked if I had any outstanding balance to pay from my last visit which I did not I was made to feel very uncomfortable by the delay and felt as if I was being accused of something underhand , excellent breakfast location and staff
13697,Novotel London West, Petty annoyance was the mattress was too soft so I couldn t sleep well That s personal preference though as each to there own , The staff were fantastic and the location was just right for where we were 
13698,Novotel London West, Place could do with tidying up paint job there was plaster peeling off in places Very expensive for what you get Breakfast is great but service was lacking at times Had to ask for coffee 3 times before service and that wasn t on the busy day Had a conference on on one of the days but we hadn t been warned ended up queuing for breakfast not what we expected If they had said been warned we would have come down earlier or atleast wouldn t be mentioning it here Car parked 1 50 an hour We parked up at a tube station for our duration and paid 5 a day Unlikely to use again , It s close to a tube station 
13699,Novotel London West, Not a lot really Bedding looked a little worn in places but was perfectly clean Very minor , Staff friendly room clean and tidy Quiet Well organised Great breakfast Perfect location for tube also ideal having a car park under the hotel Second visit to hotel Will definitely use again when coming to London 
13700,Novotel London West, The room size the lighting is not enough in the room The bed is not that comfy I didn t like the attitude of one of the staffs who brought me a dental kit Its NOT value of money , The reception area and the other facilities in the hotel 
13701,Novotel London West, An extra pillow and extra blanket per bed would have been perfect Could have asked but didn t want to bother anyone It s not a deal breaker , Location location location Friendly helpful staff 
13702,Novotel London West, Very busy place bit of a wait for the lift at times The gym was hot smelly and poorly ventilated and the Wifi wasn t always overly reliable , Handy for that end of London Staff very helpful and friendly The room was clean and well equipped 
13703,Novotel London West, On arrival no soap shampoo etc in room Quickly remedied after informing staff , Mostly friendly and efficient staff On a couple of occasions staff were too busy to offer timely service Room was a good standard everything was presented well and worked as it should A no hassle enjoyable stay 
13704,Novotel London West, Was on a group tour and we had no wifi was told we had wifi in the lobby but this was very limited Also the room keys kept locking us out twice I had to go down to have the keys reset , Breakfast was amazing so much variety of cold and hot food 
13705,Novotel London West,No Negative, Arrived at reception after a hectic day of travelling to be told that as a first time guest I was one of their Guests of the Day which meant a free upgrade to an executive room and free breakfast As surprises go that s hard to top Staff were excellent throughout rooms were splendidly clean and comfortable I d happily come back again 
13706,Novotel London West, The price of breakfast plug on bath, The facilities were good hair dryer in both room and bathroom The TV could be moved so to be seen anywhere in the room
13707,Novotel London West, Slightly expensive with NO breakfast included Have stayed often and normally have breakfast included , No Breakfast included the bed was really comfy and room really great
13708,Novotel London West, Hotel took my bank card details on check in I thought as a guarantee pay the balance on checkout but then when I had left the hotel to head into London for the afternoon tried to take payment without me being present entering a PIN number My bank Santander blocked the request and 3 others from the hotel All different amounts with the first being nearly 200 more than the total amount for the weekend Santander then blocked the card Couldn t unblock until the following morning Praise to Santander not happy with the hotel and told them so Got apologies and 2 free drinks at the bar I would use the hotel again but just clarify on check in WHEN they want payment and don t hand over your card like I did , Room was clean bed was comfy enough and big selection for breakfast 
13709,Novotel London West, Despite having 4 lifts we seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time waiting for them , Room was excellent save for the under pressured shower which tended to run hot lukewarm hot lukewarm 
13710,Novotel London West, the bathroom could be more cleaner but it s really just a hotel chain with a lack of personality, Nearby Hammersmith the hotel have all the things you need No negative surprises 
13711,Novotel London West, There weren t enough staff to handle check ins outs We d been waiting in the queue for 10 minutes and were next in line to be served A pilot walks up to the side of us and is served immediately We were told the pilot was late for the airport Sure , The room was decent size and clean The bed was comfortable We were only in the room to sleep as we had a busy evening and an even busier following day We were on the other side of the hotel this time facing the street rather than the motor way so it was quieter 
13712,Novotel London West, Room 3083 extremely noisy above wedding party when I had particularly requested quiet room Was offered another room at half past midnight not convenient to repack move and no reply to my complaint via email bad customer after service Put off booking again, Serena and bar staff exceptional friendly and helpful
13713,Novotel London West, N a, We loved everything it was our anniversary and we were made to feel very special even given a free upgrade and free drinks Staff were helpful happy and polite We had an amazing time thank you
13714,Novotel London West, The room was uncomfortably hot and changing the aircon did not make any difference The shower is so uncomfortable and water was going everywhere You cannot properly stand in i The room is perfect for persons with special needs but for us it was really uncomfortable We stayed in room 8035 , Staff service was great It was clean and location was perfect 
13715,Novotel London West, The entrance to the hotel was not clearly marked and was difficult to find In addition there we not signs around the building that were easy to view from the street so travelers coming from the underground station would have difficultly identifying the building , Very nice inside and the room was comfortable
13716,Novotel London West, If I m being really picky it would have been useful to have had some hooks in the bathroom to hang things up Also we only had one bathrobe and one pair of slippers for a double room but this was rectified once we notified reception , Great bar serving really nice food Good gym breakfast was lovely bed very comfortable Fabulous location if you re attending the Eventim Apollo Overall a very lovely modern and stylish hotel 
13717,Novotel London West, The fact that the hotel is in a concrete jungle Coming in the back as the front was closed was a bit scary at night The hotel is very big and the corridors are long and samey , Breakfast bar area and you could sit out doors and watch the European championships Bar food was reasonable Staff were helpful 
13718,Novotel London West, A conference of some 700 delegates held in the hotel made it extremely difficult to access areas such as the bar or to even find a place to sit This resulted in seeking food and drink outside the hotel , Food both bar meals and breakfast are excellent 
13719,Novotel London West, Breakfast should be included as standard for the price of 170 pn wasn t going to pay an extra 17 for it when i can get a 3 sandwich around the corner , The bed was great as was the water pressure an temperature 
13720,Novotel London West, It s huge long corridors But it is a big hotel so there is not a lot you can do 0 , Was really pleased with the room both size fittings Bar service was quick friendly efficient Check in staff were excellent
13721,Novotel London West, The staff replaced my towels every night which was nice but not really necessary , The restaurant was able to cater for my dietary requirements which made my stay much easier 
13722,Novotel London West, Hotel charges are abnormal and also the necessities are also being charged by the hotel such as plug for charger which i feel should be provided by the hotel, Hotel is situated at the centre whereby market and the train station are at a walking distance 
13723,Novotel London West, There was no hotel information in the room usually there s a little book or folder Only a little thing if I had to put a negative , Staff were excellent especially the guy who checked us in We flew in to Heathrow so the location on the Piccadilly line was perfect easy for us to get to from the airport and just as easy to get into London
13724,Novotel London West, Dreadful awful directions really infuriating Impossible to work out where the residents car park is when you arrive just looks like a normal paying car park and it is NOT clear that it is for residents Once the car was unloaded we headed to the signs for Reception and the lift but the lift was not working and the sign saying use alternative stairs lift points to a wall It took ages to find stairs as there are no signs We found some stairs and then we had to walk up numerous flights with all our luggage Awful start to our stay Breakfast the staff that cleared away the tables need to be more courteous the lady who cleared the table as we were shown to our seat seemed very unhappy and did not want to be there Then when I had finished eating but my husband was still half way through a cooked breakfast a waiter came and cleared everything away apart from his plate and knife and fork teapot side plate cups and glasses everything He was still eating very rude I also don t want to see a manager stood there with her arms folded looking everyone up and down as they pass through very unprofessional and then give a member of staff a dressing down in front of everyone If you have an issue with a staff member take it out the back please When checking out there were no signs showing how to get to the car park wandered aimlessly for a good few minutes the reception bar area has signs for everything except the car park and we had no idea where we came in So frustrating in the end we had to ask Sign your hotel better Novotel I stay in hotels all over the world regularly and this was a poor show , Loved the location ideal for the concert we had at the Apollo Hammersmith Good choice at breakfast staff a bit miserable and I don t want to see a manager dressing down a member of staff in the breakfast hall do it out the back please and make them a little more courteous Room clean and comfortable with a great view Excellent Reception staff when we checked in wish I could remember his name 
13725,Novotel London West, There was nothing to dislike everything was fine , Excellent hotel we last stayed here some 19 years ago and was very impressed then but was even more impressed this time what with the refurbishments that have been done since our last visit The room was very comfortable and the shower is one of the best that I have experienced in a hotel room Likewise the breakfast and dining area was too 
13726,Novotel London West, We booked an Executive room The decor was a little dated and bathroom bit tired but nothing to detract from enjoyment of our stay there, The location was ideal for anyone visiting the Hammersmith Apollo within easy walking distance or wishing to explore further afield Plenty of places to eat near the hotel We only ate breakfast in the hotel which was plentiful and very good choice of continental or cooked So cannot comment of quality or value of hotel s restaurant for dining
13727,Novotel London West, Didn t receive any slippers bathrobes etc and wasn t informed of where to get them from but was told that that was what our room would include , The staff were friendly and checking in out was incredibly swift Room service was great too 
13728,Novotel London West, Our room had a problem with the sockets I reported it early evening to one of the chambermaids came back from a concert nothing resolved told reception who were unable to fix it Offered another room at 12 45am but husband was asleep nothing worked not television hairdryer or kettle Would not have expected this when we paid 159 for the room , Staff location
13729,Novotel London West, The shower in our room could be bigger I found it a bit claustrophobic Lifts are slow The two lifts going to street level were out of order which was a bit of a nuisance The bar could stay open a little later at weekends with bar snacks available until close , The hotel is in a great location Staff are really polite and helpful the standard of the hotel is high and the food is excellent I especially like the buffet dinner menu The beds are extremely comfortable 
13730,Novotel London West, It s not the easiest hotel to find your way in to and when we did find an entrance the lift was not working so we had to phone reception who told us how to find the main entrance of the hotel , We were lucky enough to get a free upgrade to an executive room and also with a free full breakfast 
13731,Novotel London West,No Negative, A nice surprise to be upgraded for both rooms I d booked and guest of the day status Staff were friendly and helpful Location so close to Apollo is a good reason for staying Comfortable with good bar and restaurant facilities 
13732,Novotel London West, No TV in public rooms ie no Wimbledon My cc was swiped at noon without me being present despite the fact that I told reception that I wasn t leaving till the afternoon I had checked out of my room And left my car in the garage and my suitcase with the porter, breakfast was good
13733,Novotel London West, Reception area There seemed to be no system as some staff were behind a desk and others seemed to approach guests to check in or help I was waiting for a while and was overlooked by two staff before I went to a free receptionist behind a desk , Very nice comfortable room
13734,Novotel London West, Unable to get an answer from the hotel telephone to revise my reservation and so forfeiting my payment but in particular with using booking com who did not help in resolving the issue which was in minutes of making the reservation through booking com who reserved two rooms under different conditions as advertised Maybe a very small part of this was my error but still not acceptable ,No Positive
13735,Novotel London West, Car parking too expensive My room was 147 and my car parking was 98 very dis satisfied with this and will not stay again due to car park price which is a shame , Very friendly staff lovely hotel very nice room and service throughout 
13736,Novotel London West, A little off the main street , Within walking distance of nearest Underground station Hammersmith each connecting to centre of the city and to Heathrow all terminals
13737,Novotel London West, I asked to only pre authorize my credit card as I was going to pay whole accommodation and extras on cash They said ok but they finally charged my card as they said by mistake I requested to have my shirts ironned but they told me that they do not offer this facility and that I should do it by myself as I had an iron and ironboard in my room despite the fact that inside the room they had a laundry list including a price for ironing shirts For a 4 hotel they had no bathrobes slippers bathroom amenities only shampoo shower gel and soap felt that I should use them very carefully as they would have not replace them if run out in the room Food is average 4 00 sterling for Room Service charge Are they serious Better say I don t want to offer this service do not order Reception staff did not give any information upon check in E g available restaurants breakfast hours e t c I even had to ask for directions to my room , Breakfast was fine Service staff was good and with a smile
13738,Novotel London West, Nothing it was all good and just what we needed If I am being picky the bathroom could do with a bit of a freshen up but thats it , Fantastic staff who showed us a good way to get to the Apollo or our concert Shower in the room was fab Comfortable bed as well Oh I have to mention the burger we bought from the Room Service menu it was AMAZING I am tempted to go back just to have another We used the bar after the concert and it was lovely All in all if we have another concert at the Apollo we will definitely stay here 
13739,Novotel London West,No Negative, The staff where extremely helpful an polite Evening meal was fantastic quality as was the breakfast Had the buffet dinner and breakfast lots to choose from again fantastic quality Would highly recommend and will stay again The room was excellent and very clean 
13740,Novotel London West,No Negative, I particularly liked the excellent customer service The hotel maintenance guy David fixed the retractable handle of my carry on luggage that got detached It was very much appreciated because we were just starting our holiday and my other option was to find a Samsonite service center in London to take it to and I m not sure if they were going to be able to repair it quickly The reception staff was always helpful and accommodating The breakfast buffet was great and the best we had in the hotels we stayed in during our 3 week holiday in London and Europe 
13741,Novotel London West, Service rooms are run down our room basin was not draining was not fixed till next day Breakfast was a very poor quality the servers were very rood I have lot to say but terrible experience that s all I want to say , Terrible poor bad service worst than 3 star motel 
13742,Novotel London West, The fact that we had to pay 1 50 per hour for parking after paying 150 per NIGHT to stay in the hotel was shocking and also our power went off whilst we were getting ready in the morning and the staff didn t seem bothered Lastly a 50 charge was added to the bill incase we used room service which we wasn t told about luckily we didn t have to pay this at the end ,No Positive
13743,Novotel London West, The parking fees are extortionate The staff at the hotel forgot to validate our ticket and when brought to his and the managers attention it took an hour to sort and we didn t even get an apology ,No Positive
13744,Novotel London West, Room could have done with a little decorative updating but nothing major wrong with it really , Large hotel just off the main road in Hammersmith Hotel has underground parking and it s just 2 mins walk to the tube station Great view of central London from my room 
13745,Novotel London West, restaurants on premises too expensive could not get in and out of shower easily could not figure out how to turn on shower, bed was great close to shopping Staff was tremendously helpful from the time we checked in

13747,Novotel London West, There were very few power sockets in the room The drinks in the fridge and bar were very expensive , The staff were very friendly and helpful There was a problem with my door lock and the maintenance guy fixed it very quickly 
13748,Novotel London West, The sound of the ice machine just outside our room would benefit from a quieter running motor However when we mentioned this to the staff on our arrival we were offered a change of room We declined because this room had views over the central London skyline , We had a Superior room Everything we needed for our stay was available Room was kept perfectly clean each day You can get a good quality quick buffet evening meal Hotel well placed for the tube bus station and the Eventim Apollo where we were seeing a concert 
13749,Novotel London West,No Negative, The staff were lovely and went the extra mile to welcome us They even sent a cake and birthday card to our room whilst we were out at a concert as the stay was part of our daughters 13th birthday celebrations Breakfast was amazing too such a fabulous variety 
13750,Novotel London West, Location Atmosphere No real gym for the size of the hotel No sauna at all, Staff was very helpful Huge room with very comfortable bed and pillows Huge bathroom
13751,Novotel London West, The lift was out of order a cleaner tried to enter the room at 9 30am and parking was too expensive 39 for overnight and that was with a discount , Staff
13752,Novotel London West, Nothing, Location for the Hammersmith Apollo Friendly staff especially Christian Maurice in the bar Being upgraded for being Customer off the day
13753,Novotel London West, Scruffy run down approach to hotel Room was very Spartan in decoration definitely no frills Air conditioning is just a fan totally ineffective and couldn t open windows due to traffic noise so room was extremely hot and stuffy Spot of fresh blood on one of our pillows Just one small bottle of water in room Barely adequate toiletries in bathroom 17 50 for breakfast is outrageous Overall impression is penny pinching meanness, Helpful friendly staff at check in Good sized room 
13754,Novotel London West, 1 The Ice maker wasn t working on our floor 2 There wasn t an ice bucket 3 The mini fridge didn t work 4 The outlet by TV didn t work so we only had one working outlet 5 There wasn t any wash cloths to wash our faces so we used the hand towels 6 The extra lock to prevent someone getting in located on top half of the door was broken See picture, The staff was kind and the Lounge restaurant was great The bed was comfortable 
13755,Novotel London West, The hair found inside the sausage at breakfast and some of the hot food trays were empty The car park pricing way too much for an overnight stay , Comfortable room
13756,Novotel London West, Queue very long and slow for breakfast Bed pillows not the best Bluetooth speaker in room didn t work One of the plug sockets in room didn t work, Good location for Olympia Bar staff really good and friendly
13757,Novotel London West, I got called ma am when I m a Sir there were cracks in the paintwork and tiles in the bathroom and the shower went from luke warm to scolding hot by it s own volition , The location was absolutely ideal and the staff were friendly 
13758,Novotel London West, Breakfast was excellent but pricey compared to cost of stay and bar prices No pool , Room and en suite very well set out and very clean with great shower hairdryers beside mirrors large and comfortable single beds and no feather pillows Good staff attitude helpful and friendly yet respectful which made for a relaxed stay Very convenient for the Hammersmith Apollo and the Piccadilly line 
13759,Novotel London West, When we walked into the hotel there was no reception desk it was up another floor and no one helped us to find the reception floor even though staff were around It was a rather business hotel which did make us feel slightly uncomfortable as the staff didn t help us as much as we weren t clients or there for meetings Everyone should be treated individually it wasn t only us staying there who felt this way The Breakfast was also at a ridiculous price , The room was clean as was the whole hotel and it was very comfortable and relaxing 
13760,Novotel London West, Value for money not great Breakfast is way too expensive at 17 50 for a cooked English breakfast and not very nice If you want it delivered to your room they tell you it s only a four pound supplement on top of a continental breakfast but then say there is a 10 poind tray charge which is a ridiculous claim to make why not just admot you re charging 27 50 to bring a cooked breakfast to the room Bath was tiny too Overall though we were satified with the hotel , Lovely and comfortable staff are a credit to the place and location is handy enough Clean hotel also 
13761,Novotel London West, I stayed with my cousin in a twin room and once again we found the heating was far too stifling even when turned down the system isn t easy to control , Yes the beds are very comfy and the breakfast is excellent The staff really are the star people immensely courteous and helpful 
13762,Novotel London West,No Negative, The whole stay abliet 1 night my 50th was excellent and the breakfast was awesome Thank you and we very much look forward to another visit Lesley Dean
13763,Novotel London West, Signage to the reception area from outside was not very clear my taxi driver had to go around the car park area to distinguish the conference entrance to the hotel entrance as from the outside it is not clear that reception is on the first floor Buffet dinner was nice but the desserts were disappointing they tasted like defrosted cakes , Room was very clean and bed very comfy except for the pillows but that may be a personal thing I was given a free upgrade on check in which made my stay Staff were friendly and helpful at all times The location of the hotel to the tube and bus station was amazing being less than a 5 minute walk I would certainly return 
13764,Novotel London West, the price of car park this shouldn t be an extra cost Showers very dangerous as the temperature fluctuates regularly which left me with a burn on my shoulder The temperature goes scolding hot then cold Could be very dangerous if a baby infant was using , beds very comfy staff were lovely and helpful
13765,Novotel London West, Tv didn t work but we didn t stay in the room to use it as we travelled down for a gig , Fantastic from check in to check out Attentive staff and a lovely welcoming atmosphere Absolutely loved my stay 
13766,Novotel London West,No Negative, Perfect place to stay as we were only minutes away from the Apollo where we needed to be that evening Staff were lovely and breakfast was excellent 
13767,Novotel London West, Booked an executive room Air conditioning did not work shower had a mind of its own and decided to cycle the temperature between ice cold and burning hot no matter what setting The carpet in the room was very dirty hairs everywhere , Friendly staff nice design and had a great meal in the la carte restaurant 
13768,Novotel London West, Stained carpet in room 8069 All in all carpets in rooms and corridors could do with an up grade Very dingy No shower caps in bathrooms en suite , Comfortable bed 
13769,Novotel London West, unmanned reception ie not enough staff for the number of people checking in nobody made an executive decision to call for help I therefore stopped a walking by member of staff and asked them to help at reception which reduced the queue by half ,No Positive
13770,Novotel London West, My wife not liking lifts and we were on the top floor However once the receptionist learnt of this they immediately offered to move us, Very comfy clean and modern room friendly forward polite pleasant and professional staff Always on hand and happy to help
13771,Novotel London West, The only thing I don t like is the view but it s not that important , Pretty good hotel and a very convenient location to commute from Heathrow and to the centre of London Friendly staff and comfortable bed I have been there many times in the past years also with my family and we all like it there 
13772,Novotel London West, Access to reception is poor Access either via a dark undercroft and take a lift to the first floor reception or via external poorly maintained stairs and a dated upper paved area But once inside it s fine ,No Positive
13773,Novotel London West, No bin liners in bins must have been forgotten no big deal Wifi speed was slow but connecting was simple , Lovely reception staff Dual head shower for full overhead or standard showering without fuss Comfy bed Quiet room top floor not facing roads Bluetooth Bose speaker in room Good coffee machine in room Ironing board iron and hair dryer also 
13774,Novotel London West, Room service should really have been collected Leftover food was left in room overnight If the tray needs to be put outside of the door for collection then perhaps this needs to be made clear , Very helpful staff Breakfast was very good indeed Food for room service was delivered very hot and food portions were great Windows had secondary glazing so the room was nice and quite even though on third floor near to main road Very handy for Eventim Apollo 
13775,Novotel London West, The bed was too hard and the shower head wouldn t stay upright Breakfast although very nice was expensive , Bluetooth speaker in the room Size of room 
13776,Novotel London West, Nothing to do with the hotel but we were on a floor with alot of noisy and rowdy youngsters who did wake us up a fair few times , Very clean and fairly modern
13777,Novotel London West, No bad things to say at all would highly recommend, Rooms lovely as they were very modern and nice and roomy I liked the steam resistant mirror and the docking station Also very handy to the tube so the location was great 
13778,Novotel London West, Overall a comfortable stay Only thing was the carpeted room smelled a bit old , Exceptional service Friendly and helpful We arrived from the airport much earlier than the expected check in time but the staff member was very accommodating and allowed us to check in Very much appreciated after a long haul flight 
13779,Novotel London West, Bed was huge but was a bit on the firm side, The staff were very pleasant and helpful We also had a free upgrade which was most appreciated The location was good with the tube a few minutes walk away
13780,Novotel London West, I was not very impressed with the breakfast food but variety was ok For a 4 star hotel food could be better quality and tastier , Hotel bar is really good great for a drink and chilling Location was great connection with 3 tube lines Staff was friendly house keeping staff was great Rooms are very clean matresses are very comfortable 
13781,Novotel London West, Cleaners in the morning kept knocking on my door a few just let themselves in while was present, staff was very friendly and I would recommend that again
13782,Novotel London West, It is a bit far from everything really big building with no pleasant atmosphere rather small rooms with very basic equipment The bathroom was small the toilet did not work properly and staff was not very helpful I came here because it was close to my meeting point , Not much it is close to Hammersmith tube station and bus station
13783,Novotel London West, Location was good for the event at the Apollo however a little way out of central London , Hotel was great nice public areas and bar and they have us an upgrade which was nice of them Really good selection at breakfast 
13784,Novotel London West, The parking was a little pricey for a weekend stay it was a flat 1 50 per hour so an overnight stay when you checked in a little early was nearly 40 00 they should look to have a 20 night cap for residents or something similar just a thought , Great hotel nice lobby and bar area check in was very quick and efficient We stayed previous and they double scanned our card and took additional money that took some time to work out and have put back in our account so I would recommend paying upfront and NOT presenting a card for extras Room was good size with comfy bed and good bathroom and shower facility good location a five to ten minute walk to Hammersmith Apollo and a five to seven minute walk to Hammersmith Tube station all in all a good stay 
13785,Novotel London West,No Negative, Both the reception and convention staff were helpful welcoming and superbly efficient Requests were responded to swiftly and effectively Nothing was too much trouble Extremely well trained highly commendable 
13786,Novotel London West,No Negative, On arrival we were greeted by Aurelia at reception She upgraded us to an Executive room and we were given vouchers for a free glass of prosecco each at the bar We instantly felt quite special thanks to her and her excellent service We ate at the bar in the everning We had the mini burgers The chicken ones were too pink for our taste so we sent them back They brought us new ones but these were the same I guess that s just how they do them Our waiter did tell us he knew they were cooked because they were finished in the microwave We were given a free glass of wine to compensate us for the dissappointment The room was super comfortable excellent bed great shower and fabulous view of the city skyline Having a Nespresso machine that we were free to use was a lovely touch too We had breakfast in the Aroma buffet and it was excellent There was no shortage of food and fresh food kept arriving all the while Overall a very good experience would visit this hotel again 
13787,Novotel London West, The bed was a bit hard for me maybe that s a personal choice but I like beds a little softer Bedding all very nice though and otherwise everything was very comfortable , Reception staff were very friendly and helpful I left my purse in a restaurant and they were very sympathetic looked up the local police station and I actually got it back Aurelia checked us in and saw us later but not sure who the other member of the team was called Both lovely though 
13788,Novotel London West, Oh my days the beds are so hard They make a big thing about how fantastic there new beds are but boy don t think anyone who made the decision to purchase them have ever tried sleeping in them , Fantastic staff and efficient service
13789,Novotel London West, The restaurants are not structured The bar manager didn t really have a clue I would definitely recommend sorting the staff and menu out as the food was delicious it just weren t put on menu as it should be , We had a really warm welcome and felt at ease at the hotel 
13790,Novotel London West, The bar menu not explaining what is in a meal and the staff not saying either resulting in an over ordering of food , The bed was comfortable The breakfast was good Staff were helpful 
13791,Novotel London West, Poor room insulation and hotel was very busy with large groups of noisy neighbours Rooms on hot side and ac very noisy , Spacious room for London hotel Good value for money for London 
13792,Novotel London West, It was really really warm at night even with the windows open as much as they could go It made for restless sleep , Perfect location for where I needed to be Very central Drinks in the bar were lovely 
13793,Novotel London West, We didn t pay for food as 17 50 per person per night for breakfast is a ridiculous amount to pay , The hotel was situated in a convenient place and was very nice 
13794,Novotel London West, Smoking rooms would have been desirable as it was a long trip to go up and down to smoke , The room was spacious and included many useful features close to elevators which was a huge bonus Was able to leave luggage safely and securely after check out Staff were friendly and helpful 
13795,Novotel London West, Coffee cups were dirty drip marks still on them after room had been cleaned , Staff were extremely helpful fixed a thermostat problem when they said they would when we went to the restaurant at 10 30 one night just for dessert it had closed but David restaurant manager ordered room service for us and looked after us brilliantly Although hotel was very busy the bedroom areas were quiet and we slept great Very comfy beds and pillows Breakfast was very good and again the service from staff was spot on The location also worked very well for us 
13796,Novotel London West, Bed was not comfortable and room carpet was very stained and needed replacing not just cleaned We were told that tv had pay per view channels but not the case Ordered a lamb curry from room service and a veggie curry was delivered This was taken off our bill but only after complaining twice , Staff very good
13797,Novotel London West,No Negative, Good value for money close to the venue we needed and the underground stations good friendly staff clean rooms and very comfy and warm we wanted for nothing
13798,Novotel London West, I didn t like how loud it was at night I didn t know whether to complain to reception as our neighbour was talking loudly until 2am in the morning , Huge spacey room Excellent customer service main reception Bottom reception less so Nice modern hotel with great location to all central tube lines and to Victoria coach station 
13799,Novotel London West, Room service was appalling Dirty dishes from evening meal left in corridor until after 4pm the following day Food mediocre Delivered to room uncovered Tried to call room service to complain about wrong order but rang and rang no answer Rooms dismal Staff sparse Not a relaxing stay at all Given a small double at first when I clearly showed my pre paid reservation for a superior with sofa bed complained and moved to the correct room type Don t know what their 4 star rating is based on Housekeeping made up beds left clean towels but dirty glasses were left in room Heat in room unbearable during the night despite air con , Bed comfy Good location 
13800,Novotel London West, Only 1 robe and slippers when the room was for 2 adults Temperature in the room was far too hot , Staff very friendly nothing too much trouble room was spacious bed very comfortable Breakfast was excellent
13801,Novotel London West, We waited over an hour to be served at the bar due to a massive queue and there only being two people on Several people complained at reception but they didn t do anything about it Also breakfast is ridiculously expensive at 17 50 per person, Really close to the apollo
13802,Novotel London West, I found the bath a little too narrow at the one end , Pleasant staff easy to check in Room was nice and clean Plenty to choose from for breakfast and good opening times for breakfast Close to the tube station Given a choice of which floor we like to stay on 
13803,Novotel London West, Walking back to the hotel The entrances were a bit dark on the same floor as reception some lights were not working bushes need cutting back and it felt a bit unsafe walking back from the tube in Hammersmith , We liked the bar and the food in the bar The staff were very helpful when we arrived late and we ate in the bar area 
13804,Novotel London West, The TV couldn t get most of the channels the safe was broken the price in the room for a bottle of water was ridiculous at 2 75 for a small bottle of Evian on what planet do they think that is acceptable There was no extra blanket in the room either so I was cold Also as a guest I was really disappointed to note the horrendous price for parking We booked a superior room nothing about this room was superior except the high price at 115 per night Not worth the money try Airbnb instead , I liked the bathroom
13805,Novotel London West, Parking is extortionate to be charged at an hourly rate even when staying overnight which in my opinion is wrong when you are paying 100 pounds per night to stay staff were obviously not too sympathetic and said as it was a weekend we could park out on the street for free this was not my preference at all had to park a few streets away which was a bit of a walk in very cold weather I think a flat rate should be charged to park overnight Carpet in our room was covered in stains of all shapes and sizes apart from that it was clean enough, Nice reception bar restaurant areas
13806,Novotel London West,No Negative, Stayed before But my last stay topped that Breakfast was delicious the room was beautiful and the bed was the comfiest I would have happily paid double of what I paid for my stay 
13807,Novotel London West, Looked sketchy from the outside so was anxious on arrival but as soon as walked in to reception my concerns disappeared Would definitely stay again , Absolutely loved this stay The bathroom and modern decor in the rooms was right on point for us Loved the shower too 
13808,Novotel London West, Having stayed here a couple times was disappointed with our 1st room door hanging of toilet and carpet filthy went to reception and they moved us overall just needs a bit of a face lift , Location good and staff helpful and hotel overall nice 
13809,Novotel London West, The view from the room was awful And the coffee in the breakfast room was pretty weak Also the prices were very high 5 for a sandwich , The room was very comfy and the breakfast was plentiful and a good choice Every single member of staff I encountered was polite and friendly 
13810,Novotel London West, For the money the rooms were poor quality Very old and out dated Very worn out Staff and cleanliness were top notch but lack of investment in the rooms really let it down You can get a lot better for a lot less, staff were top notch very polite and efficient Check in at reception staff were exceptionally welcoming Some of the best I ve experienced recently 
13811,Novotel London West, Arrangements for breakfast We had to miss the breakfast that we had payed for because the queue was horrendous We didn t even arrive downstairs late Breakfast facilities need an overhaul , Clean luxurious rooms Super convenient for Hanmersmith Apollo 
13812,Novotel London West, Bar staff too busy spinning and dropping bottles and glasses rather than just dealing with the queue , The location was perfect for our night out at the theatre 
13813,Novotel London West, There were only 4 plug sockets in the room 2 by the desk 1 by the mirror and 1 next to the bed which was broken annoying , Reasonable price for 1 nights stay for a couple in London Room was very big which included a sofa and TV which was nice The hotel was an excellent walking distance from the restaurants and apollo theatre 
13814,Novotel London West, Very poor slow wifi Extremely expensive breakfast about 18 each Don t know how good it was we just bought a bacon butty from a shop, Good location across road from the tube station about 10 minutes from central London 
13815,Novotel London West, room d cor a bit dated , Very comfortable bed quiet room no noise from neighbouring rooms or outside The staff were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was tasty with a decent selection of food 
13816,Novotel London West, the carpets in our room were disgusting with stains all over they need changing or at least cleaning had to keep shoes on, everything was good apart from the carpets which were disgusting
13817,Novotel London West, The room was a bit warm and we couldn t work the air con , Came to see Billy Connolly at the Hammersmith Apollo Our check in check out were both hassle free and easy with helpful friendly staff Room was clean comfortable and we had a good nights sleep There was a really good choice at breakfast and plenty of seating Well located for the underground too so we could do a little sightseeing Would definitely stay again 
13818,Novotel London West, Found the staff frosty at times and constantly talking between themselves one other guest commented he had been interrupted three times ordering from the bar Check in was reasonably quick but having an I pad check in to speed things up looks a little daft when you have to be taken to 4 chip and pins devices to find one that works Bathroom was very clean but not great when the door doesn t really close the bath shower was a bit disappointing , The bedroom was okay but only marginally better than local competitors bed was reasonably comfortable The food was very good and excellent variety of eating facilities and a decent menu to support Breakfast was well managed Other facilities in the hotel internet caf gym etc were very good 
13819,Novotel London West, The one and only fault was that we had a power failure in our room in the morning which was a slight inconvenience but it was resolved quickly and efficiently , The standard of the hotel was exceptional considering the size and amount of guests Service was excellent and the food and beverages were of a high standard The new evening buffet in the Aroma restaurant was top draw and delicious We were glad to be one of the first guests to experience it I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel for another stay 
13820,Novotel London West, Coffee at b fast shower was a little temperamental , Location was great for the Apollo and very easy for public transport underground and buses Room was very clean breakfast good and staff were very attentive and friendly Would definitely stay here again 
13821,Novotel London West, we both found the bed and pillows not very comfortable Mind you that could be that we are used to a Tempur mattress and pillows Expensive for just a room and no breakfast , Staff friendly and helpful Good food Great to have an expresso machine in the room 
13822,Novotel London West,No Negative, Great location to Eventim Apollo easy check in and out clean and comfortable room and a fabulous breakfast in the morning couldn t ask for more 
13823,Novotel London West,No Negative, Perfect for a concert at the Hammersmith Apollo Hotel is huge but quiet no external noise Breakfast was good although as its a buffet the food is generally lukewarm Staff are very friendly helpful Would definitely stay here again if in the area again 
13824,Novotel London West,No Negative, Everrything was excellent The staff could t have been anymore helpful As a disabled customer I would recommend this hotel to any disabled traveler visiting London 
13825,Novotel London West, Was disappointed that there was a charge for the car park as we were staying at the hotel didn t expect to pay It was not clear on the site I booked on I chose the hotel as my husband is disabled and can not walk far , The breakfast was good staff helpful beds comfortable 
13826,Novotel London West, Not enough tea and coffee in the room shower went hot and cold , Very friendly and helpful staff Arrived early and was asked for any preference of room to which they catered for high up and overlooking the city Not enough tea and coffee in the room but asked reception and 5mins later it was all replenished
13827,Novotel London West, The room was freezing Couldn t take a shower because the bathroom was too cold I had to put my coat and cloths over the bed as there was no spare blanket The heater was useless I could not be bothered to call anyone at the time because it was gone 11 30pm when we went to our room It s the only thing that spoilt an otherwise good hotel , It was close to Hammersnith Apollo Loved the decor and the look of the public areas 
13828,Novotel London West, The room was a little dated and for a 4 star hotel the cleanliness of our room should have been considerably better Whilst the car park was very convenient the concessionary charge for guests of 1 50 hour for the car park seemed excessive it cost us 27 for an overnight stay , Just around the corner from the Hammersmith Apollo which was ideal as we were going to an event there and having a secure underground car park was a plus Good and varied choice for breakfast 
13829,Novotel London West, n a, Great location only a few minutes walk from Hammersmith Underground and bus stations On site carparking available Despite being a large hotel the desks were always fully manned resulting in very little waiting when checking in or out Good access to free computers and unusually in my experience a working printer 
13830,Novotel London West, Only one teabag each in the room When I asked for another teabag they gave me some but could not supply any milk Very odd Also when ordering drinks at the bar we were waiting for 30 minutes as there was only one person behind the bar two others just walking about and he was pratting around making a cocktail while flicking left and right , Location is ideal for the Appollo and it is clean 
13831,Novotel London West, Nothing as completely happy , We were upgraded upon arrival staff were incredibly friendly helpful and professional The room was very clean and comfortable and convinient to the Apollo We will use again and recommend 
13832,Novotel London West, The rude resident who was not very pleasant to one of your waitresses in the bar area , Very helpful and friendly staff the lady who booked my wife and I in and out was very professional and friendly and made my wife s birthday a very memorable one The bar staff had to put up with a rude resident which I felt was totally unjustified but she was polite at all times when she probably would ve been with in her rights to reply In the same manner but she didn t so well done to her I wish I had names but both served me in reception and the other in the bar plz trace them and thank them on our behalf Julian Lloyd room 9025 stayed on 23rd Jan Thanks again
13833,Novotel London West,No Negative, Stayed in room 6001 at the end of the corridor and was really quiet Usually at hotels we are kept awake by banging doors but we had a great night s sleep Also had an amazing vodka martini in the bar 
13834,Novotel London West, Room had been smoked in although it was a non smoking room in fact there was still a packet of Marlboro sitting on the table when we went in Each time you go into a hotel room you should feel like you are the first to use it this spoiled that illusion considerably Guys at the bar after the show were being really fancy with their cocktails which was quite entertaining for a few minutes then I just wanted my pint of beer and G T and its took forever to get to the front of the queue especially after a busy show at the Apollo Maybe you could have separate cocktail queues somehow , Location Weel trained friendly staff Special mention to Diego I think who checked us in 
13835,Novotel London West, The cleanses of the room was almost nill The bath badly designed there is no place to put your soap champion etc , People who are working on the reception restaurants and every where s warm reception 
13836,Novotel London West, That for 135 a night it didn t include breakfast Also the cost of parking in the hotel car park , The room was wonderful Fab view across London and only minutes from the Hammersmith Apollo
13837,Novotel London West, Our room was a little noisy with people walking past the room and there was somesort of banging noise but not a problem for a 1 night stay , This is a great hotel for attending an event at the Hammersmith Apollo Only 5 minutes walk and there are plenty of pubs around the apollo The room was clean and spacious enough for a 1 night stay The breakfast was also excellant with loads of choice and was very tasty Staff are alos very friendly and efficent 
13838,Novotel London West,No Negative, Brilliant welcome we won guest of the day and had a free room upgrade which was fantastic the room was excellent The receptionist was welcoming and friendly She gave us drinks vouchers as we were celebrating my husbands birthday The room was lovely the little extras were a nice touch
13839,Novotel London West, front desk seemed a bit confused with payment card pre authourised but took payment at leaving full payment outstanding for another 4 days and showed on my a c as a debit even though paid in full Sorted but no need for this hassle View of a hotel roof , convenient for the apollo and tube short walking distance
13840,Novotel London West, Withdrawal of money from visa debit card for a deposit of 50 which l was informed the morning after will not be back in my account until the next week I m extremely angry about this not being explained , Location
13841,Novotel London West, lots of space but very little seating in bar restaurant we wished to eat here but were unable to do so , excellent location for the hammersmith apollo
13842,Novotel London West, No negatives for me , Very friendly staff at Reception and the bar Facilities were very good and the rooms were clean and well maintained There was a problem with the heating when we returned in the evening of our first night but I would add that we were allocated a new room very quickly and given a voucher each for a drink at the bar to apologize
13843,Novotel London West, In the restaraunt where we were sitting when my partner stood up the light was too low and he bumped his head on it , The hotel was in a fantastic location for the train station and the apollo theatre We both enjoyed our stay very much abd just wished we could have stayed longer
13844,Novotel London West, Outside lighting deplorable Dangerous even Lift from car park not working sign AT the lift with no directions to another Car park very expensive Bar staff slow and spoke together in a foreign language Seemed very rude Hardly any tea or coffee and a tiny biscuit each in our room I paid to have a bath and then couldn t use it as plug inefficient even when i stood on it and yes i do know how to use that type of plug Wifi should not need time consuming e mail details Awful view from window , Being close to where we were going The bed was very good 
13845,Novotel London West, Approach to the hotel was dowdy and litter strewn with patches of not recent vomit on the steps The surfaces were uneven and had many insecure bricks or holes whet paving was missing We did not feel particularly safe when approaching it in the dark , Very convenient for venue Apollo 
13846,Novotel London West, Staff s grasp of English on reception was poor Had to wait a long time for breakfast whilst staff milled about not clearing loads of vacant tables, Clean modern well located hotel
13847,Novotel London West, Artisan restaurant was slow service and bland food Rooms were like saunas We had an executive room so god knows how bad the standard rooms were Paid for breakfast but service was that slow on the buffet breakfast that the queue was out the restaurant and passed reception I paid 130 to stay here and quickly wanted to check out cause I was disgusted and then got hit with a 27 car park bill and that s with hotel occupants discount Won t be staying here again , Closeness to the Apollo
13848,Novotel London West, Only minor issue was that the TV wasn t working on the machines in the gym but all was not lost I had my iPod , Staff were friendly got an upgrade to an executive room Really comfortable room with everything I needed for my stay Bar facilities great and very popular on a Saturday night fantastic location when visiting the Apollo 
13849,Novotel London West, restaurant and bar couldn t cope with busy times and queues were long Best breakfast in Hammersmith which is 3 mins walk away The adjoining rooms meant we could hear neighbours talking in next room , Location
13850,Novotel London West, We thought the price of 19 50 each was excessive for a breakfast when you can get a full breakfast down the road for 6 each Didn t try it so maybe its the best breakfast you ll ever have it should be for that price anyway , Checking in staff were very helpful and friendly room was cleaned daily to a good standard The bed was comfortable and the room was warm with a thermostat allowing us to chose the temperature Only a 2 minute walk from restaurants and the tube very convenient 
13851,Novotel London West, Huge queues at the restaurant and bar Both things obviously not big enough for the size of the hotel Must be a recurring problem because they advertise that there will be delays, Good location friendly staff
13852,Novotel London West, Seemed unready for the post show rush in the bar Breakfast was plentiful some it of questionable quality Pancakes for example were old and hard Very Limited room service menu choice after 11pm Also very poor quality , Great location for the Apollo
13853,Novotel London West, The complete palava at trying to get a drink from the bar at getting in late As a resident I am used to being able to get a drink at the bar if it is open Having to bring staff in from another area to come and pour a drink was a joke But the joke was on me being charged 25 for two gin and tonics London or not a complete rip off , Proximity to the Hammersmith Apollo 
13854,Novotel London West, It was freezing in our room Bed felt damp it was so cold Heating on to 30 degrees and still cold Couldn t shower bathroom too cold Heating only worked with blower which was too loud Slept in clothes with coats on the bed as no extra blankets in the room , Location staff decor 
13855,Novotel London West, Staff were not very accommodating to rectify a mistake I had made with the booking One room did not have slippers and robes and the coffee machine did not work I have emailed a complaint about this but did not even receive the courtesy of a reply,No Positive
13856,Novotel London West, No bad experience all smiles , We found the hotel to be ideally located near to bus and tube stations and the Hammersmith Apollo all of which are in walking distance Our room was large with a comfortable king size bed There was an adequate choice on the dinner menu and plenty of choice for breakfast catering for most nationalities The receptionists and waiting staff were very friendly

13862,Novotel London West, We got upgraded but got given the standard room key and didn t have time to say anything before we went out they asked us if wr would like to move to the upgraded room when we got back at 12am And our standard room key wouldn t work , The location was perfect as we needed to be close to the apollo
13863,Novotel London West, The food tasted fine but I did end up feeling poorly It was very noisy I don t think there is any sound proofing at all as we could hear a family next door singing happy birthday in the early hours of the morning The room felt a little dated , The staff were friendly the hotel was clean and it was a great location for what we required 
13864,Novotel London West, Only negative is that customers are expected to queue in single file at the bar or you don t get served Experienced staff would not have needed this sort of queue to determine who to serve in turn whether in a queue or stood at the bar , Easy access to Hammersmith Apollo and the tube station Easy access to other facilities eg restaurants pubs Comfortable room which had everything you would want Friendly staff and easy check in Cleanliness excellent Cannot comment on the food as we did not eat there

13866,Novotel London West,No Negative, Hotel was clean and staff very friendly and helpful It was located only 5min walk from Hammersmith underground station so very handy for travelling into central London We flew into Stansted which was about 50mins train journey to Liverpool Street then a further 30mins to Hammersmith on underground The hotel was also close to a shopping centre and places to eat however the restaurants in the hotel looked very nice Our room looked like it had recently been decorated and the rest of hotel was under going renovation during our stay Would definitely recommend for anyone visiting London 
13867,Novotel London West,No Negative, The hotel and its staff cannot do enough Me and my wife visted London for her 30th birthday Once Guest relations knew the reason of our stay they gave us certain little perks to make our stay the best it possibly could be and they did not disappoint Thank you to Novotel certainly the only hotel in London I will stay at from now on 
13868,Novotel London West, Due to type of coffee machine in room it failed common fault with that brand the type of drop plug in the bath was damaged as shower was above it and people stand on it damaging the mechanism again a common fault but not unique , Excellent location for what we needed Service and staff excellent and friendly 
13869,Novotel London West, If i had to be picky one barman left us standing at the bar whilst he was making drinks only to eventually ask us to take a seat and wait for table service we didn t mind but we wish that he had told us straight away so then we weren t stood there waiting , The staff were lovely and friendly and the rooms were beautifuly clean and the food was delicious

13878,Novotel London West, My room was on a floor where there were repairs being carried out The corridor was in such a mess that I would ve preferred to have had a room on another floor , The service and staff efficiency bar and restaurant are always good at this hotel in my experience 
13879,Novotel London West,No Negative, Check in was quick and efficient Concierge was helpful and took our cases for us as we arrived early at the hotel and could not check in until later Checking out was also easy and the receptionist booked us a taxi to take us back to train station which arrived promptly Hotel was a great location for Olympia where we were attending the Olympia Horse Show Room spacious and comfortable and breakfast was lovely
13880,Novotel London West, Sink and bath didn t drain properly and the shower guard on the bath wasn t fitted correctly so the bathroom floor flooded when you took a shower Air conditioning didn t work room was really hot but the streets were too noisy to have the window open at night , Reception staff were amazing so friendly and helpful
13881,Novotel London West, Faulty bathroom door that staff had no urgency to fix What seemed like v un organised staff working on checkin desks as queues were v long upon arrival and check out Asked for a bathmat sat AM never turned up and we checked out sun so another delay When I made the booking it was for a special occasion for my wife our her best friends 40th I asked for a bunch of flowers upon arrival or balloons etc to make it more memorable and i didnt mind paying for the extras upon arrival unfortunately this never happened If I would of been advised that this is something you would not do I could of arranged something myself and got there earlier to arrange , Value for money
13882,Novotel London West, The only thing was no soap in the bathroom , I was taken by surprise by the style and choice of bars seating areas and activities for children Apple Macs 
13883,Novotel London West, Grill staff who were slow and didn t understand basic English , Reception staff were excellent and charming Room was simple but functional and very comfortable 
13884,Novotel London West, Breakfast was 17 50 which I thought was a bit steep Room was a bit small for a superior room Only thing that made it any different to a normal room was a mini fridge with 4 bottles of water in it , Located right next to a tube station which was great to get in and out of the city centre about 20 mins on the tube Bed was very comfortable Staff were extremely helpful 
13885,Novotel London West, The hotel lobby and bar restaurant area were extremely hot It would be more comfortable in a cooler atmosphere We have used this hotel twice now and both times need to queue a fair time to book in at reception , The room was a good size clean good tv internet The breakfast waitresses were helpful and friendly The breakfast was lovely with a very good choice of items 
13886,Novotel London West, IN ONE OF THE ROOMS THERE WAS A SMELL OF SICK COMING FROM THE DRAIN IN THE BATHROOM VERY UNPLEASENT , A VERY BRIGHT AND MODERN HOTEL STAFF IN BAR AREA WERE VERY PLEASENT AND FRIENDLEY I WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN 
13887,Novotel London West, Way too warm thermostat useless Took ages to check in despite repeatedly telling the girl that we had my Brother s Wedding in 45 mins and were running late , Comfortable Bed 
13888,Novotel London West, I ordered a taxi for the morning but the guy in the reception forgot to book the driver Was waiting for more than 30 minutes, The room size and the bathroom
13889,Novotel London West, We travelled with three teenage children and three adults on a special trip to Olympia all booked separately via booking com My friend booked on the same day as us and got a much better deal including breakfast 105 00 we had to pay 120 per night We were staying two nights and the hotel wanted to charge 17 00 each for breakfast which for a buffet style meal and in particular for a child is ridiculous We were not in a position to pay this amount of money and were left with our children being split from their friends at breakfast time I did mention it to the reception and they offered us a coffee as compensation which falls far short of what I think they should offer Why are Novotel offering such extreme rate differences We used the restaurant on a separate occasion the previous night we opted for the restaurant and quite honestly the food was appalling , The location and cleanliness the hotel was good
13890,Novotel London West, Room very warm couldn t open windows very much Air con did not cool room , Nice rooms comfy Nice staff Good facilities Quick check in and out Good baggage facilities Great location for Olympia 
13891,Novotel London West, Staff were rude and not very informative Had to ask where and when breakfast was Booked as supposed to be 4 star Room basic and carpet all marked and stained Only 2 teabags in room Advised taxi to olympia when could have walked and would have been quicker , Was just a short walk from olympia which is were we were visiting Able to leave bags pre and post check in

13901,Novotel London West, Most things Once you passed the lobby it was a different hotel Tired dark hallways with cracked broken ceiling tiles preceded a room which was sad and dark Shower knobs were missing pieces light switches covered in grime a window that looked directly into another guest room window hot sticky air pumped into the room and overall cheap furniture and finishings It s not an expensive hotel but you can get so much more for your money elsewhere , The lobby seemed recently refurbished 
13902,Novotel London West, Laud fan in the room because of blowing wind outside thin walls so you could hear doors open ect And we even had a big stain on the sheet But Im sure it had been washed so I didnt complane But for 149 pounds , Good location nice beds Very good location for conserts at apollo theatre And rest of London Close to the tube Great with a hairdryer both in bathroom and bedroom

13905,Novotel London West,No Negative, Excellent location for what we required courteous staff and clean comfortable room not a complaint but the hotel overall is very hot and quite stifling good breakfast and service

13914,Novotel London West, the bath shower looked a bit tired and the room was very warm We couldn t get the room cooler without opening the window which then made it quite loud due to general London traffic , The room size was good very comfy and clean and staff very friendly Great location for the Apollo and links for getting into central London

13918,Novotel London West, Air con in room didnt work so room was too warm in november Car park was offered at over 50 discount which sounded good until we were billed at 35 per day That is normal for centralish london but they tried to convince me they charge 87 for non residents so we had got a cracking deal Hmm, Location and convenience to get in and out of london Legendary full english buffet breakfast
13919,Novotel London West, As we were walking from Fulham it was difficult to locate and poor signage We had to walk through the bus park and shopping centre to find the entrance , Welcoming and comfortable and clean Great facilities in the room Comfortable bed

13921,Novotel London West, Lift from car park to reception area is woefully small and slow Car park charges for hotel residents are very high Room could do with a refresh carpet dirty walls need repainting , Staff very welcoming and helpful Breakfast was good and plentiful even at the busiest times 
13922,Novotel London West, Didn t like that had to pay for car park thought it should be included , I liked the close proximity of the Olympia The underground car park and the shop onsite
13923,Novotel London West, No bad experience as such but the room 8060 where I stayed at the end of my trip there appeared to be some sort of fizzing noise coming from one of the sockets close to the bed Forgot to mention it in my hurry to catch a train, The location was great and the staff fairly friendly and welcoming 
13924,Novotel London West, Long wait to register only 2 staff on general desks Very busy reception area Need a quick access desk for pre booked guests, The quietness facilities and comfort of the room were great

13926,Novotel London West, Carpet was absolutely filthy dirty and badly stained did not want to take my shoes off Shower broke complained x3 never was fixed smell of sewage when using bathroom tap disgusting ,No Positive
13927,Novotel London West, Registration on arrival was a shambles no order nobody knew where the queue was we complained and were taken to a desk ahead of other confused people We had pre paid and this was not a good start to our stay , Proximity to my appointment location 
13928,Novotel London West, Heard a lot of sirens I am aware that this can t be controlled by the hotel staff but it was the only thing that ruined the stay slightly by being woken up early Also it would be useful to have more plug sockets , The bed was comfy and I have no complaints about the cleanliness of the room The WiFi worked perfectly 
13929,Novotel London West, Very odd experience had to ask housekeeping for more tea bags only 2 in room was immediately quizzed as to what time I was checking out Explained check out was 12pm so would be gone before then but was pushed to give an exact time to the lady Whilst I totally appreciate she has a job to do please let me enjoy my stay first , Check in was fantastic lovely gentleman Deigo couldn t have been more helpful or friendly warm welcome which we loved Best reception we ve had on the 4 occasions we ve used this hotel Worth noting all staff are extremely pleasant helpful shout out to bar manager his crew always really nice Breakfast as always was top notch Room are always fresh good comfy 
13930,Novotel London West, I didn t like the cost of the carpark even at the reduced rate I appreciate this is standard for London but even so , Excellent breakfast although I wouldn t pay 17 50 for it we got it as a package The best soundproofed Windows I have ever seen Comfy and large bed 
13931,Novotel London West, The let down of the hotel was the lack of staff at reception the whole of the weekend we were there there were only two desks manned and there was constantly a queue of guests waiting , The staff throughout the hotel were very helpful and polite nothing was too much trouble We were allocated a room on arrival which was not suitable but the lady on reception was so accommodating in finding us another room really quickly so that we could enjoy our weekend visit

13940,Novotel London West, terrible beds really bad back ache never had in a hotel before insane prices in restaurant which why restaurant empty all the time totally stupid unacceptable waste of prime space even staff agree it is ludicrous charge for car park come on, great position for London excellent staff
13941,Novotel London West, The parking It is ridiculous It says parking avaliable chargers may apply Definately aplly and at 1 50 an hour Absolute joke I paid 129 to basically sleep there and paid 27 for parking If I knew this I wouldn t have booked it and find this very dishonest , The hotel was nice but 
13942,Novotel London West, The bar staff Absolutely terrible the male staff member shouted at us on two separate occasions as well as other customers He should not be working there The young girl turned the TV off when we were watching it in the bar and refused to put it back on lifting tables over ours and people s heads We had no choice but to leave 10pm , The location and the Grill room had great food 
13943,Novotel London West, Rooms were basically furnished and tired looking Bed linen had holes in it Free WiFi was intermittent and often ineffective, Helpful staff at reception and the bar
13944,Novotel London West, had requested a high level floor but got room on level 3 first level for rooms typical basic hotel room although paid for a superior room had asked at reception for a good room but the view from the room was a flat roof between buildings at 2 30pm on Saturday in fairly empty lounge ordered a BLT took nearly 5 hour to arrive cold waitress without apology said the kitchen had been busy but no one was ordering food except us the hotel has 2 restaurants one buffet but closed on Saturday night limited cosmetics in bathroom no conditioner or shower cap only one night but had we stayed longer would have requested to be moved to a better located room , on the way to Heathrow airport
13945,Novotel London West, Breakfast frozen bread and cold food told one member of staff and they only said they would let someone know Saturday night was in bar for drinks lady bar manager was not very nice to other guest told them to go to bed or leave if they were not staying in hotel no way to treat guest, Dinner good nice bar

13952,Novotel London West, I didn t like the fact you had to pay for parking it added an extra 33 on to our bill which was 155 already for one night with no breakfast I think if you are paying for a room in the hotel the parking should be free or a standard rate of 15 20 per night The breakfast was 17 50 per person which I though lt was really expensive so we went to Weatherspoons which was only a 5 minute walk and was really nice , The hotel was nice I do think it was quite expensive for what you got though I liked the fact you had free wifi a gym and there was a couple of restaurants to choose from And I would visit the hotel again
