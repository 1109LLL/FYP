450118,Simm s Hotel, Wish there would have been better toiletries provided combined body wash shampoo and a nail file was all that was provided but there s a supermarket next door where you can buy essentials if needed Also not a major issue or anything but I had put out the do not disturb sign so I could get some rest housekeeping knocked and then opened the door anyway but she immediately apologised and left , Excellent location close to several bakeries cafes cheaper alternative to their in house breakfast U Bahn subway literally right next door but still quiet and the tram station just a few steps away Clean and comfortable room with decent air conditioning Pillows were particularly delightful low not bulky and soft I didn t get any neck pain 
450119,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is located far from the centre but very close to the metro station which is a good solution if you want to pay less for your stay in Vienna The room was comforable and clean Nice design of the interiors I would definately stay there again 
450120,Simm s Hotel, The glass walls outside the building were so dirty I thought the taxi driver missed the hotel I didn t belive that it was open and so dirty The booking picture promissed a room with the view I got dungeon , Breakfast was great 
450121,Simm s Hotel, Breakfast coffee was not good in my opinion, Decent variety at the breakfast buffet the rooms are very modern and with AC subway and tram station right outside of the hotel free parking in the smaller streets next to the hotel
450122,Simm s Hotel, another programme in English on tv kettle in cupboard but no cups coffee or tea so could have done with tea making coffee facilities in bedroom, Nice big shower big bedroom
450123,Simm s Hotel, although it is stated that parking is available under the hotel it is not clear that is not free of charge cleaning stuff rushed into the room at 8 30 on Sunday and has wakened us air condition is not automatic, Good public transports at the location Silent room 
450124,Simm s Hotel, Coffee at breakfast was terrible, Clean and simple helpful staff Great location despite being out of city centre but was very easy to get anywhere using tram or underground
450125,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, Location is excellent next to the UBahn so simple to get from the Airport train UBahn also goes straight into the city Easy quick check ins secure lift spacious well lit rooms clean Breakfast is everything one needs great selections Value for money 
450126,Simm s Hotel, Found 4 silverfish insects on the wall of the bedroom and in the washroom which ruined the overall experience The shaggy carpet was nice to look at but after finding the insects we didn t want to step on the ground with bare feet Its a bit further out from the centre We had a car but the metro is right outside the door , The modern look and feel of the hotel was nice The king size bed TV with English channels and spacious washroom were highlights 
450127,Simm s Hotel, Rather cold and standard reception Far from city centre but compensated with being very close public transport No water in room , Clean and comfortable Basic room like its supposed to be but nothing more Very close to public transport right under the hotel 
450128,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, A very well situated hotel near the metro station clean rooms and a very quiet environment The staff was very kind and helpful A totally great experience 
450129,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, All the staff were excellent and all very helpful if you needed anything down to how to get to places making cups of tea and drinks when needed would definatley stay again excellent customer service
450130,Simm s Hotel, We didn t get the room that we booked We were told that there had been overbooking and we had to go into the next type of room down That meant that we had paid for a specific room but had to be satisfied with a room that would have cost 30 euros less per night but received no repayments When I showed my dissatisfaction I was told that I had got the room at a reduced price when I booked it My impression was that the rooms had been advertised at a lower price on that day and other people might have paid more for the same room and I had to be satisfied with a room of lower quality while they got the room I was not impressed by this type of attitude and will not stay in that hotel again , Breakfast was very good and room was clean 
450131,Simm s Hotel, Room door card needed to operate lift which often was unsuccessful , On tram 71 route and next door to U3 Zippererstrasse Nice rooms Reasonable choice at breakfast

450133,Simm s Hotel, There s no restaurant nor room service and the bar which closes at 1 am has only waffles breadsticks and peanuts The AC works great but the windows can t be opened if you prefer that , Super friendly staff Nice well equipped room although missing an electric kettle 
450134,Simm s Hotel, The hotel is not exactly in the centre of things but it s right next door to the Viennese underground Line 3 U Bahn station Zippererstra e Air conditioning can be a bit too loud when in use One of the elevatrors refused to read my card twice and I had to use the other one , Very friendly and helpfull staff comfy bed and stable wifi Clean rooms a lot of space in shower I booked this hotel since it takes mere 23 min to get to the airport from there S Bahn train S7 
450135,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, very clean and modern all facilities were new metro station 3 meters away tram station 5 meters away friendly and helpful staff multiple parking option available either underground or pulbic
450136,Simm s Hotel, Nothing to do around the hotel there is a very small like shopping center even no good pubs or bars around , Location is outside of the central part but the U bahn station is just next to the hotel and you can go anywhere for 10 15 mins Nice clean and modern environment good breakfast 
450137,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, Great location outside of Vienna center and yet so convenient Tram stop and Underground station next to hotel Small food stores and a very nice restaurant nearby 
450138,Simm s Hotel, It would have been nice if there was tea and coffee making facilities in the room We love our bed coffee specially on a cold day Light switches were a bit complicated and no idea how to turn up heating aircon , The room was large and so was the bathroom Comfortable bed and very pleasant and helpful staff Excellent location as the metro was practically next to the hotel Lovely patisserie in front Breakfast was great too 
450139,Simm s Hotel, The variety of breakfast could be higher It s hard to find a parking place around the hotel if you don t want to use a private parking place , The hotel is next to an underground train station Easy to reach town Excellent price quality 
450140,Simm s Hotel, Expensive garage parking Quite far from downtown but close to metro station Strange hotel design unfinished room ceiling , Comfortable beds Quiet room good soundproofing Very clean Well maintained Rich breakfast Very close to the metro station Good and free WiFi 
450141,Simm s Hotel, The curtains and blinds don t block all the light Just to know for the people travelling with kids who tend to wake up at 5 AM if it s too bright , The nearest metro station is right next door as well as a super market and a pharmacy The breakfast wasn t that generous but it had everything needed it was fresh and the food didn t run out So I count it a good breakfast Our room was very nice and clean free Wifi everywhere in the hotel I d definately book this hotel again for the same price it was some sort of secret offer for members 
450142,Simm s Hotel, Could use a kettle and the room size a bit small , It was very clean tidy and felt new Staff is nice and friendly We took a breakfast option and enjoyed it a lot comfortable opening hours variety of food very tasty The room has an AC TV double windows could be opened nice clean bathroom shower The WIFI is super fast no pass required U bahn is just next building S bahn is a 10 min walk Tram stop is right there also A cheap tasty restaurant serving a good schnitzel is nearby 
450143,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was clean and the staff was kind The hotel is next to the metro station and is only one station from Gasometer We were there because of Adam Lambert concert It was a good choice 
450144,Simm s Hotel, My only concern was that the heating could be only adjusted by 3 degrees Celsius and the temperature 21 C is too low for me so I was a bit cold in my room ,No Positive
450145,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location subway station just a few steps away from front door nice rooms friendly staff free apples for guests Will totally choose again 
450146,Simm s Hotel, I would have preferred a double bed in my room instead of two single beds , It was very easy to get to the city center from here the nearby metro station was very helpful We had a suite on the 8th floor and the views were excellent 
450147,Simm s Hotel, The surrounding area is not really friendly for a walk during the night but it was ok , Location is in the uptown but the underground station is next to the hotel The staff was very nice the hotel was fully booked and we got a bigger room for the same price The bigger room was clean and comfortable equipped with Nespresso coffee machine The breakfast is fresh and more than enough The staff was quick and helpful during the breakfast they had a nice world to everyone 
450148,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, Location just by the U3 station 10m so easy to go everywhere in Vienna You can park your car at Edberg Park and Ride 3 4euros per day and you have only 2 stations to the hotel The hotel is clean nice breakfast 
450149,Simm s Hotel, Nil, Good position next to U3 metro station and on tram 71 route both take one to the city centre Quiet location Across road is excellent eating place 
450150,Simm s Hotel,No Negative, Convenient location close to the event I have attended and also directly next to a metro station The rooms were spacious great view on the city and also excellent breakfast 
450151,Simm s Hotel, The premium room picture on the booking hotel web sites does not match the actual room It s one of the rooms but it s normally not available and it s likely that you ll get a simpler one The ceilings are not painted unpainted concrete design decision Hotel does not have a restaurant , The hotel is clean beds are comfortable location is next to the underground station and there are some shops around 
450152,Simm s Hotel, Nothing bad everything was just as we want it , The hotel is new so it s very clean and stylish The room was exelent with great view on the city The girls at the reception were just amazing very cute and kind We stayed for the weekend and the great thing was the breakfast until 12 00 so you can sleep a little more The food was also good The hotel has free wi fi and it works very well Another great thing about this hotel was the underground station U3 right next to the hotel 10 meters from hotel door 10 minutes with U bahn and you are in the center of Vienna at Stephansplatz And the hotel also have a underground garage so eveything is great The grocery market is also right next to the hotel We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would definetely recommend it 
450153,Simm s Hotel, It s somewhat unbelievable that the hotel doesn t keep any irons in the entire facility To me that is simply outdated The shower area is strangely designed There s no possibility of keeping the foot towel close to the door which leads to water spillage in the bath room It s a simple issue of designing the door or the floor in a way that allows close contact between the towel and the door thereby absorbing the water from the shower , Great connectivity by train proximity to the train station Of course the staff was friendly and generally very courteous 
450154,Simm s Hotel, Maybe it was just a human mistake but despite the sign do not disturb on the door houskeeper still was srill trying to enter the room , Location of the hotel is great In the next building is entrance into subway which brings you direcrly to the city center Near the hotel there are a lot of caffes Internet was working perfectly in the hotel and it is for free Very clean room and nice comfortable bed 
450155,Simm s Hotel, When we first entered the room there was a very bad smell inside like a dirty wet cloth We opened the window In 5 minutes problem fixed , We were given an extra bed with no aditional costs Friendly Staff
