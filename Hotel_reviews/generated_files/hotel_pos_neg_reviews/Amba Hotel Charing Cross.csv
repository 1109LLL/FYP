465852,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Everything was wonderful except some of the reception staff seemed a bit snooty at times However perhaps I m spoiled to Asian hotels I live in Singapore where in general reception staff seem to smile more , Main reason for wanting to stay there was next door to tube and Trafalgar Square Couldn t have been happier I ll stay there again I wasn t able to try restaurant but I had room service and the food was delicious 
465853,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, A separate walk in shower would have been nice but I m being picky , Comfy bed complementary minibar free water good cocktail bar with knowledgeable bartenders 
465854,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Bain Marie eggs hard and unappetising Selection of breakfast buffet foods small , Great location helpful reception and concierge staff Room comfy and for a London hotel spacious 
465855,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The carpet in our room has seen better days The breakfast room for the excecutive room customers is too small and the atmosphere is weird It would be more appropriate to have that service in the dining room upstairs that overlooks Charing Cross , Reception staff and Concierge staff were great You can t beat the location Grocery store Train and Subway Station just seconds from the hotel and the National Gallery Trafalgar Square Thames and the Eye just minutes Restaurants and shopping also nearby 
465856,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, It was all good , Everyone was so friendly and helpful and helped make my 80th birthday celebration a wonderful one The hotel suite was comfortable and had everything we might ask for A great visit we ll come back 
465857,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Beds hard Lots of vagrants loitering outside of entrance , The location is perfect easy walk or underground to everywhere in London Rooms clean great noise proofing from very busy noise street with parade and marathon great hair dryer extra pillows nice size bathroom lots of USB charging outlets Staff friendly and helpful 
465858,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Cleaners missed things when preparing my room There was a cell phone and a piece from a condom wrapper left in the room from the previous guests , The location is very central The room was quiet 
465859,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The staff in the amba lounge ignored us when we walked in so we wernt are if we needed to wait to be seated for breakfast We sat ourselves down and no staff came so we attempted to make ourselves some coffee but then we we re finally noticed and shooed away from the machine , The exec suite was amazing The free snacks and drinks in the room the drinks in the amba lounge the effort to provide cake and a hand written note for my partner as it was his birthday 
465860,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, From the time we booked our room until the day we checked out our experience was fantastic Jesus who handled our reservation could not have been more helpful making sure we had the perfect room I would definitely recommend the AMBA Hotel 
465861,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, Perfect location centrally located 2 min walk to trafalgar square and 8 10 min walk to Piccadilly Circus Lovely big room which is a rarity in London Clean modern rooms with all the amenities Strongly recommend it 
465862,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, Stephan and Lotte were outstanding with their service They went over and beyond to celebrate my daughters birthday and accommodate our needs We ll be back for sure Excellent location and service 
465863,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, There are 2 diff levels of elevators you need to take from the reception to the 5th floor it s sort of confusing , Property was well located staff was promoted to address any issues raised rooms were decent sized and fully equipped 
465864,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Not a lot , Our trip was for a wedding anniversery visit to the theatre and as soon as the staff found out we were given a free glass of champagne each in the bar which was very nice and a big bowl of fruit which did us for breakfast along with a charming hand written card The room was very chic and overlooked the Thames and we were within easy walking distance of our Theatre We will be back without doubt No more rushing or hanging around for late night trains 
465865,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Hotel is very busy with events but we stayed in the other building attached which was very quiet , Location is excellent very central Excellent breakfast Helpful staff and Concierge Would recommend and stay again 
465866,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, If you were the type to complain there was really nothing to complain about, Location excellent for our purpose Staff very very friendly and eager to please Decided to have breakfast on wakingup in the morning We did not book in or pay for breakfast on booking in No problems Breakfast very good value for money and when checking out we were even given a bottle of water for our onward journey The whole building was excellent and reminded me of the standards of years ago 
465867,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, There was nothing I didn t like about the Amba Hotel I just wish I had stayed longer , The staff were very welcoming and helpful I was upgraded to an executive suite which was luxurious The room was in a quiet location and comfortable I had a bathtub and a separate shower in a large bathroom Everything was perfect 
465868,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Expensive, Stayed here last year four four nights at which time they kindly upgraded us to a junior suite which was fabulous Stayed this time one night in a classic room No upgrade this time so we paid an extra 30 for an executive room This made the price of our room nearly 300 for the night Location the best Executive lounge disappointing this time waiting around awhile for service and ended up getting things ourselves as other did The reception staff are outstanding so friendly 
465869,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The Amba Lounge breakfast experience was poor there were not enough staff with nobody on hand for long periods of time and very slow clearing tables Food was not replenished in a timely fashion Also rather cramped The bathroom facilities were a little tired shower seal torn for example and the fact that vagrants were allowed to congregate on the steps close to the main entrance was off putting and unsettling , The bed was extremely comfortable and the air conditioning a very welcome break from the sweltering heat outside Breakfast was exceptionally good quality and the location of the hotel could not be better i e close to the underground Covent Garden Trafalgar Square Westminster Buckingham Palace Easy to find restaurants cafes and many attractions within walking distance 
465870,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, very friendly and helpful staff All the staff were very personable Jennifer checked us in on the Saturday afternoon she recognised us the next morning as we arrived to check out and beckoned us to her She offered to store our luggage and when we reappeared for our luggage later on she came out from behind the counter and offered to retrieve our luggage for us Very impressive and personable Whilst we did not encounter other staff my observation of them with other guests was the same Well done to you all you are our first choice hotel for nights out in London 
465871,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Only 2 chairs in room Short of desk some of our luggage had to be put on the floor , Location is good The outside decoration is classic inside is fashion The reception is friendly and considerable The surprise is all things free in mini bar

465873,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, The hotel was very comfortable wonderfully located and their offer of a free upgrade made it even more special The staff were all friendly and helpful and it made our theatre weekend really special Breakfast was also quite good A particular thank you for the calm reassuring way that the reception and concierge staff handled the news about the London Bridge attack our visit was during that weekend We felt well informed and safe

465875,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The room is very small for such a high value You feel yourself as if you are in a cupboard You cannot even find a place to put your belongings , The staff is good Room service is fast and facilities in the room is good 
465876,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, See beeakfast above, Very quiet room away from the busy street As always with an Executive room one will get a very non executive breakfast at the lounge unless one pays for additionally for breakfast at the common area I simply do not understand it this hotel with lounge facilities is not alone in offering very limited breakfast for Exclusive room guests 
465877,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The room was small for a family with a baby You have to check what you order The walls are thin and you hear every noise from above or near We were with a baby and I am sure that residents of the nearby town were not happy to hear tears either , The hotel is centrally located and easy to get around A courteous staff helps in any request with patience There is a 24 hour service and tickets and transfers can be booked through the hotel Breakfast On the terrace with city views there is a selection including special requests 
465878,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, We had outside room facing street The Strand Noise was quite loud at times until after 2 am Attempted to order late dinner at bar 10 PM Staff was inadequate for number of people By the time we attempted to order was told they were no longer serving food , Staff was very friendly and informative Buffet Breakfast was excellent Facilities were beautiful and very clean 
465879,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The only thing I could fault was that housekeeping did not re stock teabags after the first day and I love a cup of tea after a long day of shopping and sightseeing , The staff were very friendly The breakfast was the best I have tasted in London and I have been coming here for over 30 years I was thrilled to find on arrival that I had been upgraded from a double room to an Executive King room It was my birthday that day but they hadn t known that The staff member who checked me in Cam sent me a lovely note to my room wishing me a happy birthday and a great holiday with vouchers for champagne when I told him 
465880,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The expense I wasn t always sure that the facilities were worth the money , The property was very convenient The event we were attending took place in the hotel 
465881,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The room It was too small for two people We had to request another chair The bathroom was bijou The bed was very comfortable We are senior citizens this was our third visit as we love the Hotel staff We requested a room near lift as my husband has limited mobility We were offered another room but we had unpacked this was too much hassle as it was only for one night We think that the price we paid for this was over priced , The helpfulness of the staff was excellent as always The cleanliness excellent Location very good We had a snack after our theatre visit It was excellent beautifully served 
465882,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Nothing, A lovely quiet room with a little surprise in the form of a lemon tart truffles and two vouchers for a glass of champagne for my birthday I loved the free mini bar and Nespresso machine The staff were lovely and very professional 
465883,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Bed was a little hard and no secure wifi For business secure wifi at least requiring a passcode is important , Got upgraded on arrival and the room and hotel were just gorgeous Great location easy access to trains tube food is good staff are great and the places is spotlessly clean 
465884,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Everything was perfect in this hotel From the rooms to it s staff Will definitely recommend this hotel We have found a place to stay in everytime we re in London , The room upgrade was well worth it Bed is very comfy Breakfast isn t bad at all But what truly makes this hotel outstanding is it s excellent staff very accommodating and welcoming Great job Special commendation to Filipa and Lavinia

465887,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, I drink hot water and lemon at breakfast and one little glitch was the pot used for the hot water had a slight tinge of tea smell but that was an absolutely minor thing , Staff were professional and friendly eager to help in any way they could Cleanliness of room and hotel was the best I have experienced in London no dust in corners and bed bathroom linen and towels fresh and clean 
465888,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Nothing, Visited London to celebrate my birthday Hotel very central for the theatres tour buses underground etc We upgraded to a suite on arrival and it was lovely Mini bar being free was a wonderful bonus and the free use of the Amba bar for breakfast and free drinks and refreshments during the day was superb and makes booking an executive room worth the money However the absolute joy of this hotel is it s staff Wonderfully polite helpful smiley people who were a pleasure to be around Noah in the Amba bar was a particular joy and his smile always made my day start well Thank you all we will return and we would fully recommend this hotel 
465889,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Liked everything The IPad in the room did not work at first didn t charge but the staff fixed it within one day which was nice , This was the second time we stayed at the hotel and loved it again This time we had an Executive Room with lounge access the lounge was a nice bonus with free breakfast great selection and free drinks and snacks throughout the day The bed was really comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet facing the inner court towards the train station Could not hear any trains to the 4th floor Location is the best you can get in London All in all a great hotel 
465890,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Nothing , We didn t have to ask for anything everything was offered but we never felt under pressure Loved the Nespresso Great shower Great touch with candles on the staircase we visited the Terrace bar after evening out at a show and there was a really nice atmosphere with a mixture of ages 
465891,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Service in the Amba Lounge was very uneven bordering on neglectful for the afternoon service Love the waterfall shower head staff need training on how to clean it so it functions properly, Reasonable priced upgrade for corner executive room looking out onto The Strand Location Location Location Staff was professional and helpful Free minibar in room also very nice touch
465892,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, I left on a Sunday morning early 0500 Clubs in the area were just letting out and it was a It loud and rowdy in the neighborhood, The location is fantastic right on the Strand and immediately next to Charing Cross station The staff was extra helpful and nice The room was larger than I expected and the wifi was fast 
465893,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The only problem I had was that there was a lot of noise on the street outside the hotel and the noise carried all the way to the 6th floor where I was There was first someone playing a saxophone and then someone else playing loud music till well after midnight It disturbed my sleep Even though everything was great in the hotel the noise outside is the reason why I probably won t be staying at this hotel another time , I got a free upgrade and got a fantastic room It had a lot of space and there was a bathtub in the bathroom Staff was very friendly and helpful Location is excellent as the hotel is right at the center of London 
465894,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Difficult to find my room which was in a separate wing Came in late and tired and got lost Signage IN the lift as opposed to outside would be helpful , Great location near Charing Cross Tube and less than 5 mins from the theatre we were going to Very nice Terrace Bar on 1st floor Staff helpful and friendly 
465895,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, nothing, I booked three rooms and I asked to have all the three rooms in the same floor with transport arrangement from to the airport i found a car waiting for us in the airport and all three rooms next to each other that was perfect Hotel location is excellent supermarket pharmacy and coffee shop are next to the hotel charging cross station is attached to the hotel bus stop in front of the hotel tourist attractions are within walking distance The staff are helpful and smiling all the time check in and out was fast Rooms were clean and comfortable well furnished and the Wi Fi connection was fast

465897,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Very very minor but I hate having to get greasy fingers opening those silly little butter packs Considering the cost and all the other excellent features I m surprised that we have to endure this cheap inconvenience , Staff efficient and very warm and friendly location perfect for our purposes comfort good night s sleep and quiet ambiance right in the middle of London 
465898,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The price but of course you have to pay to stay in a location like this , The staff were some of the nicest hotel people we ve ever encountered They were always ready with a greeting and asking if there was anything they could help us with Amazing breakfast Yummy food from the restaurant for dinner Our room was well appointed and attractive And best of all is the great location with the center of London right outside the door

465902,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The wifi wasn t very good and it s supposed to be superior wifi Some of the staff at breakfast weren t very nice at all one in particular The ipad in the room didn t work properly and kept turning on by itself at odd hours i e in the middle of the night , The room was spacious and the bed was comfy Breakfast was delicious Great location 
465903,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The room that we were in on the 4th floor suffered from the rumble of trains something we were not aware of on our previous visit when we were higher up , If you re in London for the Theatres or The National Gallery The Amba is an ideal place to stay It is modern clean and the staff are excellent If anyone wants to complain about the price it s central London But it is much better value than many others Would we go back YES

465905,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Unfortunately there is no onsite parking however when I contacted the hotel they directed me to Q Parks trafalger car park which was about 5 minutes walk 40 for 24 hours , The hotel was at the heart of London across the road from Trafalger Square a short walk form the Embankment and London Eye yet quiet at night We went to the Faulty Towers experience at the hotel which was well worth the visit

465920,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The price was a little bit high but its worthy due to the location , I booked the room of this hotel from Booking com and stayed here for 2 days during our trip in London The location is so awesome that the majority of attractions could be reached within 20 mins by tube or even by walk The stuff of this hotel is professional as well especially a waiter Rico who is not only approachable polite and assist us a lot during our stays When it comes to the room the one we stayed was so clean spacious and comfortable that it is hard to believe this hotel has already opened for 150 years To sum up this is a hotel that we would like to visit again in the future

465927,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, First impression the finishes decoration of the lobby and surrounding areas look cheap and walls in need of painting Fresh flowers instead of plastic or silk ones would make a huge difference , The staff were very responsive to our needs brought up extra coffee and hangars within minutes for both requests the internet was reliable the bathroom was roomy and floors were heated proper overhead lighting in the room which is rare for hotel rooms the concierge Angel arranged to mail a letter without charge and another guy gave us very detailed and helpful directions about which tube stop to take

465984,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, At 9 00 in the morning the cleaner let themselves into our room No knocking before entering and we had to yell NO don t come in to stop them from fully entering the room The manager at reception defended the cleaner and told us that the cleaner had knocked and waited a moment before entering He also told me that I can use the extra lock to lock the door so no one can enter A very disappointing ending to out time in London , I asked for a quiet room since my partner can t sleep with noise and this was made possible for us We also had champagne and chocolate left for us since I had told them that it was a birthday present for him

466002,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The room was facing a back street with a night club It was quite loud during the night Breakfast is ok but not overly luxurious given the price , The location of the hotel is very nice at Charing Cross station very close to National Gallery and in walking distance to Buckingham Palace There are a lot of restaurants and theaters around this area The Hotel itself is very nice given London standards

466026,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Not the hotels fault but a cycle race shut the roads around the hotel for two days making access difficult Would have been good to know in advance but the staff at the hotel did everything they could to minimize the impact it had on our stay and travel plans, Perfect location amazing staff really helpful 
466027,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, There only two negative comments I can make We only ate at the resturant one day our server seemed to be annoyed and very slow but this was only one visit The TV in the rooms do not have recent movies and channel guides non existent Although there is so much to do in this area of London not much of an issue, Great location and an outstanding friendly staff It s nice to be in walking distance to so many theaters and sights The staff are attentive and friendly and go out of their way to be sure you have everything you need

466039,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Just want to caution travellers that if you book non cancellation the hotel will still charge you Some properties will waive the penalty depending on your circumstances or perhaps charge you for one night but the Amba will charge you for the entire stay They do have the right to do that based on policy however I had hoped for better customer service given I was unable to travel They did offer to allow me to book a room in the next 4 months if I booked within a week of cancelling however I will not be able to travel for at least 6 months Ideally a refund would have been the best option or at least a partial refund , In fairness to the hotel I am unable to provide a relevant score based on my stay as I had to cancel it just prior to my departure due to medical reasons resulting in the cancellation of my trip but I was charged for the room as I had booked non cancellation rate I won t do that in the future I booked this hotel based on location and travellers comments so disappointed I was unable to stay here

466049,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Room images are a little clever the rooms are a little on the small side we paid for a deluxe room and thought we d be getting a room similar to ones on site pictures but think they are executive suites but at the end of the day it s just somewhere to sleep and get ready and it was perfect for that, Staff are very attentive definitely stay there again and a great location too
466050,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Issues with bathroom the first night toilet was not cleaned and sink was backed up However the hotel promptly addressed these issues , Incredibly professional and courteous staff Went out of their way to address issues and ensure we had a pleasant stay The location is also excellent 
466051,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The checkin process took a little too long Perhaps they could streamline it to be quicker although they did offer their guests water and drinks while we waited , The staff and management were extremely helpful and friendly Even though I had not paid for breakfast with my reservation they were very courteous and extended it to me

466059,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Since amba took over the hotel has been stripped of all its character and homogenised to look like all the other amba hotels Brand Amba What a shame , Staff extra friendly
466060,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Everything was great and I really can t think of anything at this moment that needs improving Just keep your staff always as helpful and courteous and keep smiling when you greet your guests Sure to keep them happy , I particularly liked the whole front office staff They were accommodating and friendly and so helpful right up to the manager Miguel The lady at the lounge was also sweet and helpful And your restaurant staff was always right there to assist you and so courteous 
466061,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The only fault I could give is that we could hear next door very clearly not a problem because they weren t noisy late into the night but if you had neighbours that were up way later than you it could cause difficulties , Room was fabulous clean comfiest beds lovely shower Like the nespresso machine in the room and bottled water available all the time in the reception area 
466062,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, The staff at the Amba Charing Cross is first class they reacted to anything that we needed in a quick concise and friendly manner I travel quite a bit for business across the globe and can say that this hotel is easily one of the 1 to 2 best I ve ever stayed at 
466063,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Can t think of a single thing , We loved the welcome we received from the staff Everyone was fabulous the whole time we were there They were attentive welcoming and friendly and remembered that we told them it was my sisters birthday while we were there We came back from the theatre on the birthday night to find a birthday card a bottle of champagne a birthday cake and some chocolates How fantastic was that We loved the place which has just been renovated and Also used the Amba lounge one evening before going out 
466064,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, If your room faces the square you will likely hear some noise It didn t go late into the night but be aware if you re sensitive to noise Views facing the square are great though so for us it was well worth it , Absolutely loved this hotel Would definitely be back Staff was super friendly room was amazing

466067,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Hard to think of anything If pushed at all i would say 20 for 2 spirits and mixers is a little steep but then i am in one of the worlds greatest capitals so it is bound to be , Staff always smiled which makes me feel good no waiting at reception for check in or out which makes arrival and departure a pleasure So nice to be given a few snacks and water etc in the mini bar instead of being made to feel like a cash cow for the smallest thing i would definitely recommend this note thel Location could not have been better I left my watch which was duly collected and put in the safe for my friend to collect the day after my departure no fuss just great service 
466068,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Thought everything was fantastic there was nothing we disliked , Everything was excellent Friendly and welcoming staff Great room Comfy bed Good bathroom with great shower and nice toiletries Can t fault this hotel

466070,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Honestly nothing, My husband and I stayed here on the London leg of our honeymoon trip The staff was so friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable The concierge was also very helpful in making reservations for dinner and arranging transportation The room offered great views of the city and a very comfortable bed the minibar is also all complimentary which was an added bonus

466074,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Disappointed that the porter escorted us to our room on arrival but didn t offer to assist with luggage, Location cleanliness of hotel and overall appearance
466075,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The only downside was that the bed for some weird reason wasn t that comfortable and I didn t really sleep well throughout the night I do allow it the doubt of me being here for only one night and for a single visit so I assume it was either me or a case in which they d love to switch my room had I given them the chance, The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming It looks great in a well designed historic building

466082,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The bathroom was in need of refurbishment the shower cubicle had discolouration at the bottom of the screen although the shower it s self was very good The plug in the sink was difficult to release and had to be prised to let the water out It was difficult to open the bedroom window to let some fresh air in , The hotel is very well situated within easy walking distance to the embankment Trafalgar Square Covent garden and Theatre The staff were extremely helpful and polite The bedding and towels were very clean Very enjoyable free nibbles with our night cap after the theatre

466086,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, The staff couldn t have done more to make us welcome and gave us free extras like champagne as it was my husbands birthday They were also very supportive when my husband became ill the day we were leaving and made a room available to us even though we d already checked out technically VERY IMPRESSED THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH

466088,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The view nothing special we could just about see the Thames We d booked breakfast on arrival rather than at the time of booking and when we arrived at the Terrace in the morning we were shuffled in to the drab bar area as if we weren t worthy of being in the main restaurant Breakfast was nothing to write home about hot buffet not overly hot , We needed a place to stay for one night to accommodate a couple of musical events Our room was very well appointed clean and comfortable We requested a relatively quiet room with ease of access and a shower all of which we were given

466098,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Although well appointed and with everything one could need the room lacked atmosphere the furniture was a little utilitarian except for the bed which was lovely Breakfast was plentiful but out of a packet which was a little disappointing for such a well appointed hotel , Very friendly staff on reception room service and breakfast room The bedroom looked newly appointed was quiet and very clean as was the bathroom Beds were exceptionally comfortable and plenty of quality pillows We arrived back from the theatre after the restaurant had closed so ordered dinner from the in room menu which had plenty of choice The food itself was very good steak and sea bass

466106,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The only downside is this type of Ibis does not include little extras such as tissues in the bathroom but that is reflected in the price you pay , The location is great if you want to get a seat on the u bahn as you board it 2 stops before the Hauptbahnhof The staff are outstanding 
466107,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, I found the bed a little hard A make up mirror in the bathroom would have been useful, I liked the situation the friendliness of the staff the decor and our room

466144,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The decor and furniture in the room didn t match the warm and grand staircase and lobby area Felt too plain in rooms however still very comfortable Also the free mini bar is a good idea but i think they should provide a few more items e g 2 packets of chips 2 chic bars orange juice bigger selection of soft drink other than coke and diet coke should add some biscuits too , All the staff were amazingly friendly and greeted every one on arrival and departure from the hotel They went above and beyond for my partners birthday as they gifted us a bottle of prosecco cake truffles and a card which made our night that much more special 
466145,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The reception area can be slow and get overcrowded this is not a criticism of any of your wonderful staff who do everything to elevate the issue its just the design that can t be changed the introduction of refreshments has improved the situation , The overall ambiance and impressive interior and layout of the hotel that gives you the feeling of staying somewhere special 
466146,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, King size bed was zip lock not a full mattress would expect better in a suite room Pillows were a little tired, Friendly polite and helpful staff even when busy Excellent location for Covent Garden and south bank Superb room including free mini bar and use of executive lounge

466158,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Tiny gripes Pillows too hard for us we should have requested house keeping to find us some softer ones and the room was cold despite our having set the heating temperature high again we weren t there long enough to ask someone to fix it They were such a good crew I m sure they would have solved both issues neither of which spoiled our one night stay , Best staff and welcome we have ever received at any hotel anywhere in the world This will be our hotel of choice when we visit London again 
466159,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, No heating in the room on our arrival on a really cold day Hotel provided a portable heater that solved the problem Also gave a decent discount due to issue, Nice location lovely and clean Room was plenty good enough

466161,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Having to leave , This was by far the best hotel we ve ever stayed in out of very many worldwide some of them were at the same stars and price level and also in the centre of London so it s a fair comparison Apart from the friendly attitude we received from every member of staff be it the concierge or the cleaner and the lovely and spacious room there were many things about that were thoughtfully place to make us feel at comfortable and we felt very pampered throughout our stay It was definitely worth every penny and we hope to be back again

466171,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The only down side was it was a little noisy but couldn t be helped, The location was brilliant Literally out of the hotel into underground The hotel was a real treat I would certainly pay a return visit
466172,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Bed was a little hard for my taste, Well appointed rooms The hotel acts like a host offering a drink at check in providing some snacks drinks in the mini fridge which were nice touches The location was central to being able to get to different parts of the city for both walking and taking the Tube 
466173,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Leaving The location put you within easy access to all London landmarks and our 4 days just wasn t enough, The staff were ALL brilliant They were friendly and seemed happy to help I can t rave enough about how welcome the staff made me feel it was fantastic
466174,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, The room was warm and clean the shower was excellent We were on the sixth floor and it was beautifully quiet It is located very close to The London Tube There are numerous restaurants and of course Covent Garden is on your doorstep The staff were pleasant and helpful

466178,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Squeaky floorboards Couldn t get on the super fast wifi Found the staff to be a little over friendly , Fantastic location Very comfortable bed Brilliant shower Complimentary mini bar snacks a lovely touch 
466179,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Room was ok but had only a shower no bath No mention of this at check in The room was such a long trek from Reception that once we arrived we were too tired to go back and request a room change Not great though considering we paid 219 00 for one night just for the room , Very close to Vaudeville Theatre which was the reason for our stay 
466180,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, I was struggling to carry 2 massive luggage and no one was there to help me carry my bags inside the hotel I can see the receptionist see me struggling and she could have made an attempt to help me or even call someone to give me a hand , Location very convenient next to the tube and the hotel is very modern 
466181,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, our room was a good size for two alas the bathroom was not big enough for one there wasn t enough room to towel yourself dry nor enough room for my toiletries let alone my husbands I had also booked no feathers My daughter had feathers Very noisy good job I took earplugs should be offered by hotel , location excellent Breakfast excellent and good value Staff very friendly and helpful Lovely building Very close to the Portrait Gallery restaurant Theatre Royal Drury Lane and Wyndhams Theatre What a weekend

466184,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Mistake on final invoice but quickly resolved , Excellent location decor furniture equipment stylish new Staff friendly but professional 
466185,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The space between connecting elevators near a restaurant was nauseating , Great staff Beautiful room Complimentary upgrade as well as champagne and brownie for our honeymoon 
466186,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Nothing to dislike, We had a really lovely stay at The Amba Hotel The staff were amazing very informative about the surrounding area and they were very observant too The lovely young lady who checked us in asked if there was a reason for our visit and I explained that we were celebrating my husbands and my birthdays as they both are in September and then a bit later on a lovely gentleman arrived at our room with the most delicious chocolate dessert and a bottle of champagne on ice Totally unexpected and such a lovely surprise Things like this go a long way the fact that the lady on reception took notice There was a lovely birthday card too written by the reception staff The breakfast was delicious too and there was smoked salmon available as part of the buffet Unfortunately I didn t see this until after I had my breakfast but my own fault for not investigating all the options Such a fantastic weekend and we will definitely be back 
466187,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, only teeny fault as an older traveler i would like to see a grab bar in the shower, staff was superior in every way loved complimentary mini bar a gracious welcoming hotel exceeded expectations in every way
466188,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Nothing at all , Wonderful staff nothing too much trouble and everyone friendly no matter where we were in the property Excellent location for sightseeing and theatres We enjoyed both breakfast and dinner which was superb value and quality Bedrooms very comfortable and replenishing fridge free of charge every day was a pleasant touch A beautiful hotel 
466189,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, Excellent staff and very helpful food was superb We were celebrating our anniversary and my wife s birthday and when we checked into our room there was a bottle of sparkling wine and a birthday cake with a personal message which was very thoughtful
466190,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Only two things to note checkin took an extraordinarily long time no line just whatever they were doing I am unsure After 14 hours travel we were so weary and just wanted to quickly get to our room Also due to the busy location convenient and the adjacent train station lots of litter crowds and sales stalls just outside the front door do not make a good impression coming and going Probably not within the hotel s reach to improve that lack of ambiance but it is significantly trashier than anyplace else we have stayed in London , Warm welcome and fantastic service in the breakfast room Food was well presented and offered quality and choice Breakfast room full of light and lovely view Our room was spacious with an excellent bathroom NO view In fact we looked right into close unattractive block wall and office windows Our room however was QUIET And the bellman noted that when I showed a bit of disappointment looking out the window We will fondly remember Amba for their kind and sparkling contributions to our 46th wedding anniversary At the end of a day out we returned to iced champagne artfully arranged glasses chocolate and a large chocolate raspberry truffle cake served on a gray slate with an anniversary greeting inscribed in white chocolate This was a grand gesture but we were REALLY surprised the next morning when two beautiful flutes of berries and sparkling champagne were delivered to our table with a flourish Well done Amba 
466191,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, No smoking area so had to stand outside hotel, Staff excellent very clean throughout excellent breakfast good wifi comfortable beds good showers no room service charge if you wanted to eat in your room
466192,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The staff in the reception tried to overcharge the price for the room with 200 according to the booking it was 391 including VA first time was when we checked in second when we were to check out Luckily I had printed the booking confirmation so they had to charge the original price I was surprised that this could happen in such a highrated hotel and also that no apologize was made , Clean spacious room Nice touch with the free minibar Extremely good location 
466193,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Nothing, Lovely room great location friendly helpful staff nothing was too much trouble complimentary drinks in room would definitely stay again Really appreciated the gift they left in my sons room as we were in London as he was getting his duke of Edinburgh award 
466194,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The bed was a king but it was 2 combined and as a result the middle was not comfortable Other than that I would not complain Nice hotel , Nice breakfast options and location Most hotels are high prices in London but this was my second time there and I would stay here again If you want quiet this hotel is in a busy street so maybe not your best option However for me I liked the fact it was near the train and underground located near Soho theatre Covent Gardens and Piccadilly all within walking distance A good choice Free internet Enjoy 
466195,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, To be a little picky the hotel bar was a little small but the staff were very professional and attentive , The Staff were fantastic and very welcoming on arrival The location of the hotel and the room were excellent 
466196,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Only the very smallest niggle and scarcely worth a mention Poached eggs that came with in room breakfast were slightly undercooked and watery , Staff were really friendly and professional First rate facilities and the perfect location for our stay within walking distance of top attractions 
466197,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, I did feel that the staff at Front Desk were rather stiff upon check in out unnatural in their communication and super stereotype cookie cutter in the approach The worst was the thin flooring between floors where its super disturbing annoying tat you can hear footsteps from movement above your head Room had a backyard view , I loved the look and feel of the Hotel as well as its amazing location Housekeeping was amazing and the staff were accommodative 
466198,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, My breakfast card was not collected in the night and I had to arrange my own on the first day The staff really went out of their way to compensate for this and I quickly forgot the inconvenience Cleanliness unfortunately there were a few long hairs in the room and in the bathroom so a double check of this in the future would be helpful , The hotel is beautiful and in a great location an oasis in a very busy area I stayed 2 nights in the Buckingham wing which was less glamorous than the main building but still well appointed My request for a room on a higher floor was honoured and I loved that the windows opened for fresh air The staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
466199,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Almost nothing Just a style of the decoration in the room that I think it s not attractive However it s comfortable , The Amba Lounge that guest can have free breakfast snacks and drinks from 7 am to7 pm That service was fabulous 
466200,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, None, EVERYTHING Staff location complimentary stocked bar fridge accommodating staff comfortable beds cleanliness value for money 5 star treatment
466201,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, Ideal location for this trip but would stay there again when I visit London as so close to underground Also free snacks and soft drinks in the room a nice touch 
466202,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, The bed is super comfortable like at 5 resort hotels We had executive room so it was large and bright The breakfast could have a bit more variety though as for London is very good quality Staff is very attentive and accommodating Location is brilliant as you can easily walk towards Big Ben House of Parliament Westminster Abbey London Eye Buckingham Palace Covent Garden Soho basically everything is at your doorsteps 
466203,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Nothing everything was perfect , Very charming and stylish hotel in a superb location just one block from Trafalgar Square Underground and train station at 10 metres distance Excellent free internet access Very attentive staff They were so kind as to upgrade me to spacious suite Super comfortable bed with all necessary room amenities for a relaxed and pleasant stay Excellent room rate for London standards All in all a spotless unforgettable experience 
466204,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, No full length mirror No shoe shine sponge and couldn t find the hair dryer but these are the most minor of issues and I would most definitely recommend this hotel , Superb location friendly staff Maaike on reception had the biggest smile and was extremely nice and very helpful Nice touches eg welcome drink at reception free Wi Fi inbuilt USB charging ports next to plug iPad to use in room not to keep good size safe free iron all inclusive mini bar and access to the all inclusive lounge Breakfast was delicious and bar made pleasant cocktails

466211,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, My only regret is that we couldn t stay longer , First of all I just love London And the Amba Hotel is the perfect spot to enjoy being in the center of it all The hotel has so much to offer free WiFi even has an ipad in the room for guests to use refrigerator which is restocked daily with great drinks and snacks very friendly staff comfortable beds and a lovely restaurant on site 
466212,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, One cannot really complain about huge thick bath towels except to say the bathrooms need extra towel rails to accomodate It was a battle each day trying to get at the towels that were crammed onto a single rail but a struggle worth facing D, It s all excellent Largest thickest bath towels ever good breakfast helpful gracious staff perfect location for exploring London fast reliable wifi 
466213,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, Great location Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff Well worth the upgrade to an executive room to take advantage of the included breakfast and access to the Amba lounge with free hot soft and alcoholic drinks plus snacks from 7am to 7pm 
466214,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, We were Grandparents with two of our grandchildren We felt happy and relaxed at the hotel The staff were pleasant and helpful at all times and welcoming to the children The breakfast was full of choice and delicious Our rooms were clean well equipped and comfortable Being offered water to take out with us was a bonus too The hotel is in a good location to walk to a lot of places and was only a stroll away from the Theatres We liked many things about the hotel and will be back 
466215,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The room rate was a bit above average for a hotel of this class but I needed a room in that area and needed it for only one night I would have stayed there all eight nights of my trip had the rate been a bit more reasonable , Laura at the front desk was AWESOME The interior space is the best I ve seen in London especially for an hotel with an historic exterior 
466216,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, We had to leave , We loved everything about this hotel We got a free upgrade card bubbly for my Fianc e s birthday It s the first hotel we ve stayed in where everything in the fridge is free beer wine water coke chocolate crisps more The staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for us Despite the busy location the noise was barely noticeable at night Most importantly the room was very nice and and the stay overall was outstanding 
466217,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Not bad but the bed was a little old had indents on each side where people had slept and mattress was a little hard Time to replace it Food was not fabulous but perfectly edible , Location staff helpfulness were excellent Free wi fi water condiments in room It s a hotel from the late 1800 s but has been entirely modernized So you get the best of both worlds Well priced for London and perfect location right above the Charing cross station 
466218,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, nothing, Location is prime Access to public transport Superb front desk Room size is excellent Manager offered a reduced second stay due to mix up in bags Very attentive
466219,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Small room nowhere to open luggage Had ipad in room but staff didn t explain why it was there then the battery was flat could not see the point of it , Good location 
466220,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Couldn t find fault other than that we had a fairly chaotic check in experience However the extremely friendly and chatty receptionist apologised for this and explained why it was unusually busy , We loved this hotel which I thought was luxurious without being ostentatious and our highlights were Arriving to find a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate truffles in our room having mentioned that we were in London to celebrate my husband s birthday and our wedding anniversary both on the same day The absolutely first class location on the Strand next to Trafalgar Square The lovely spacious room with all our favourite little luxuries including fresh milk in the complimentary mini bar a Nespresso coffee machine great shower cosy bed with crisp white linen free wifi The super friendly staff The delicious breakfast We paid a little more than we would normally do as this was a special occasion but we are really glad we did and hope to return Highly recommended 
466221,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, I only wish that the perky North American style pop music would be abandoned in favour of something a little more subdued or better yet that breakfast music would be abandoned altogether This I must stress is our only complaint and it is a minor one at that , We stayed at the Amba Charing Cross for ten nights in July and we would return in a heartbeat I have never experienced a hotel staff as friendly and helpful as that of the Amba Charing Cross At check in we were offered a glass of bubbly and the celebratory atmosphere was a constant throughout our stay It s hard to imagine a more perfectly managed hotel Each afternoon or early evening staff came to our room to ensure that we had everything that we needed Our room was large and well appointed with a complimentary mini bar laptop and perfect Hypnos mattress The bathroom was modern and beautifully appointed with a glass shower as well as a great soaker tub There was plenty of storage and it felt good to unpack and find room for everything We paid an additional 20 GBP for an upgrade that included an upgraded room complete breakfast and free drinks in the Amba Lounge in the early evening Breakfast in the lovely conservatory overlooking the Strand and St Martin s was good and the service was excellent The Amba Charing Cross is extremely well located for walking to Trafalgar Square Covent Garden Westminster the South Bank and even as far as St Paul s Rail connections Charing Cross and Waterloo in particular are excellent Tube connections Charing Cross and Embankment Stations couldn t be better Great restaurants within a five minute walking distance abound Finally one of the things we most appreciated was the inclusiveness of the price We never felt nickeled and dimed I m not sure what the British equivalent to that expression is We have stayed at a number of great hotels in Central London This was our hands down favourite 
466222,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,No Negative, Loved the location and the rooms were very comfortable and roomy Loved that the mini bar was included and the Amba lounge Was so nice when we would come back from sightseeing that we could have refreshments

466228,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, As I had to leave quite early I didn t get to have the breakfast Maybe there could be some sort of alternative for people who need to leave early , Beautiful place and so close to everything The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful Sad that I could only stay one night Would recommend Amba Hotel to anyone 
466229,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, The room was extremely small with no drawers Only 2 hangers were in the wardrobe although I m sure more would have been provided if we d asked We were awakened at 3 15 AM on our jet lagged first night with yelling and LOUD rhythmic drumming directly outside our building which marked the end of Ramadan It lasted until dawn Our earplugs didn t make a dent to block the noise and we got no sleep at all Definitely not the hotel s fault but we would have loved a head s up , The location was outstanding Literally right next door to the Charing Cross tube station and steps away from Trafalgar Square We were several long blocks away from Westminster and Leicester Square This hotel was centrally located to EVERYTHING Every staff member that we came in contact with was courteous and amazingly helpful The bathroom was large and the walk in shower with detachable shower head was wonderful Comfy robes were provided and so was a coffee maker 
466230,Amba Hotel Charing Cross, Breakfast is unchanged and so simple during our 4 night staying Price is high compared to other famous chain like InterContinental or others, Perfect location close to everywhere you want to go Big ben Covent Garden Leicester Square Soho just walking distance Send my thanks to Tony he s so helpful with our lugguages while checkout
