250467,Hotel Daniel Paris, No gym they offer access to a gym close by We just went for a run to the Eiffel Tower and back instead , Very friendly and helpful reception staff who went out of their way to help us with restaurant suggestions make the restaurant bookings and organise our Palace of Versailles entry tickets Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them Central but quiet location Extremely tasteful decor Very comfortable bed 
250468,Hotel Daniel Paris, There are two issues that surprised me and that could be worked on to make the hotel perfect 1 The wifi connection is too weak The staff tried to work on it and it improved slightly but not really I had to use my data connection via my sim card for what s app Hence free wifi was simply not true This is a common issue in many smaller hotels who need to accommodate their data connection needs between an everyday household system and a professional and costly set up with their own servers While I understand that decent bandwidth does cost something I expect that from a hotel at this price At least what s app emails and written news have to run without delay 2 I had a single room with a French bed The bed had two mattresses making it impossible to lie comfortably in the middle of it At this standard I would expect one mattress Otherwise the bed was very comfortable but I would have wished to have more space again particularly at this price , With its mixture of Asian and old French styles high quality materials and attention to details this hotel is an interior design work of art which still manages to provide the feeling of being in a home Service is attentive but not too attentive and the staff is professional very friendly and ready to find solutions to all your needs and little problems
