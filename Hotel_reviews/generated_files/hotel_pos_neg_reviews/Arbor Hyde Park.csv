161414,Arbor Hyde Park, Air con in room was either freezing or hot don t think the thermostat worked sheets on bed were poorly fitted otherwise very good, Great staff lovely rooms and a good continental breakfast
161415,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Excellent location next to the Hyde Park very good connection bus tube it is even possible to walk to from the city center Surprisingly good breakfast Top class Italian caff next to the park entrance Friendly staff 
161416,Arbor Hyde Park, Front desk staff was terrible Rude and not helpful Actually they were not accommodating to a family with children at all I would not stay here again with a family If you are a couple or business traveler and stay without asking for anything in addition it would be okay The hotel really needs to work on their customer service and attitude towards their customers Both my wife and I left feeling almost guilty for staying there with children Would not stay here again considering the amount of money you spend per night , Great location Good size family room in Europe 
161417,Arbor Hyde Park, Children slept on sofa bed which wasn t so comfortable No restaurant on site , Stylish decor and great location right on bus route to Oxford Circus and Picadilly Circus The continental breakfast was excellent Double bed was big and comfortable Lovely bathroom 24 hour desk

161419,Arbor Hyde Park, Maybe we could have an electric kettle in the room , Good spacious room with air conditioning We switched over from a very horrible accommodation long story late at night Arbor staff was very helpful got us a baby cot and hot water at midnight Great service great value for money 
161420,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, We took the Heathrow express to Paddington and the hotel was a short walk away It was right beside Hyde Park and numerous tube stations We actually walked to Oxford Street without realising it Hotel was beautifully decorated and the staff were very willing and helpful Breakfast was a buffet or a full English for a few pounds extra If returning to London I would stay at this property again 
161421,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Spacious comfortable room beautifully decorated including a couch Excellent bathroom Quiet location close to public transport Courteous staff Substantial breakfast 
161422,Arbor Hyde Park, Bed was very hard and the bed linen was so old it had pilled quite significantly Staff were friendly at checkin but a little rude after that Lift was also super noisy whenever anybody used it I was woken up by the noise , Bathroom was nice Good location
161423,Arbor Hyde Park, The desk was too small there was a lack of storage and no radio , The location was great with good transport close The room had great scale and we didn t mind the stairs to the bathroom
161424,Arbor Hyde Park, Our nespresso machine was not working and the hotel is in the middle of two tube stations so it depends if you want to be right at the door of a tube station or a ten minute walk , Our room was spacious by London standards considering we had 4 people in one room Breakfast was a nice benefit and staff were friendly all around Being right at the foot of Hyde Park is a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the city 
161425,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The Hotel is Located in Square no traffic noise close to Hyde park and tube station in walking distance of Oxford Street Rooms immaculate Continental Breakfast excellent will defiantly go back 
161426,Arbor Hyde Park, Room wasn t ready until nearly 2 hours after advertised check in time, Staff were very friendly and helpful upgraded the room as hotel busy at no extra charge
161427,Arbor Hyde Park, We stayed at the Arbour for 5 nights Our room was on the ground floor at the front of the hotel and was very noisy locals stood right outside our bedroom window on the street every day talking from 6 30am so it was impossible to sleep in The room service was lacking Every day the bed throw was left lying on the chair the dressing gown lying on the floor dirty glass next to the bed tea sachets often not replenished Considering this is a 4 star hotel I believe the room service was sub standard , Very comfortable bed and delicious breakfast Staff were very friendly
161428,Arbor Hyde Park, I think a small fridge would be very useful The second door between the entry door and the bedroom was a nuisance and limited movement around the room especially with suitcases etc room was serviced daily but sometimes tea coffee and milk was not replaced and I noticed a bit of dust on lamps , Lovely quiet and elegant neighbourhood Very safe and close to Hyde Park and Paddington Station Breakfast was very good and the service was excellent Nice selection of continental goodies with the addition of hard boiled eggs Bed was very comfortable and bathroom is very good Big window that opens Really nice guest lounge area downstairs with easy listening music playing Staff very accomodating in regard to ice and ice buckets due to hot weather Transport into London was excellent 
161429,Arbor Hyde Park, Attitude of the staff Rude Small rooms Not value for money Breakfast is mediocre , Cleanliness of the hotel Close to Hyde Park and 10 minute walk from train station 
161430,Arbor Hyde Park, Room service quality of food Tea coffee in room could have been of a better quality No hair conditioner either , Bedroom was comfortable and good size especially for location Staff were warm friendly and professional 
161431,Arbor Hyde Park, Not a great brekky but adequate have to pay extra for cooked food , Stayed here once before werent happy got different rooms this time much better handy to paddington station and heathrow express bed comfy showers good heated towel rack to dry washing not far from hyde park and restaurants 
161432,Arbor Hyde Park, Room felt a bit bare and empty not really welcoming Bed was fairy comfortable but quilt was not fluffy but more like a thick blanket pillows were not comfortable at all , Good location
161433,Arbor Hyde Park, Better directions bit hard to find No parking Tiny bar , Cute boutique hotel ina quiet corner near to Bayswater and Hyde Park Comfortable and clean with friendly attentive staff 
161434,Arbor Hyde Park, Was placed in a very cramped room in the basement Under the bed was filthy there was toe nails sweet wrappers and dust The wardrobe did not have enough storage space for a 4 night stay TV and remote control did not work I requested an iron and ironing board which took an hour to arrive Shower head kept falling down so had to hand hold the shower head Was not worth the money Highly disappointed , The public areas are well designed 
161435,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The boutique nature of the hotel was refreshing and attention to detail by staff was always on display The location is great for catching public transport to the West End or further afield Great alternative to a large hotel stay 
161436,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Nice hotel with a good atmosphere Only minor thing is that it was very easy to hear neighbors and staff early in the morning Great location and very good continental breakfast I would surely come back 
161437,Arbor Hyde Park, The continental breakfast was adequate but uninspiring Not all of the food was replenished throughout the service , The hotel was within easy walking distance of Kensington Gardens and Bayswater tube station Our room was spacious and quiet ideal for a stay with two young children 
161438,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, What a gem a friendly welcome a central yet quiet location and a super room spacious and luxurious We loved it and thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
161439,Arbor Hyde Park, Slow staff in reception Asked for wine and decided to skip it after waiting 10 minutes for receptionist to find out whetether they actually had Sauvignon Blanc , Lovely small boutique hotel in Kensington Quiet close to Kensington garden Nice breakfast friendly staff Close to Lancaster gate station 
161440,Arbor Hyde Park, the breakfast menu to be more clear or just leave it on the table for us to choose from , the Hotel location was away from the main road place nice and quite 
161441,Arbor Hyde Park, The reception did feel a bit regimented A credit card deposit which takes 3 days to be cleared when there was no mini bar restaurent and breakfast was included seemed excessive It would also be better having a key card rather than having to drop off and collect keys , The hotel was clean The breakfast included in the price was plentiful and although the reception was a bit fussy in needing a refundable credit card deposit staff were friendly 
161442,Arbor Hyde Park, Can t find anything really , Perfect location quiet at night but very close to Hyde Park Oxford Street and Notting Hill The staff was absolutely lovely Ordered room service on the first night great quality 
161443,Arbor Hyde Park, The first receptionist we met was not very welcoming and her English was not great Other receptionists were very good It is a lovely boutique hotel but not cheap , The view from the room was lovely good choice of continental breakfast
161444,Arbor Hyde Park, I have no complaints at all, Very clean modern rooms good bathroom toiletries most comfortable bed and bedding excellent air conditioning and very quiet Continental breakfast fresh and good range additional menu available on request I would strongly recommend the Hotel great location good public transport and Hyde Park within short walking distance 
161445,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, This is a lovely hotel in a great location my room was very large and very nicely furnished and had a great view in a very quiet location and the breakfast was delicious and the waiting staff delightful I will stay there again for sure 
161446,Arbor Hyde Park, This is a good shot at being a slightly different and personal hotel but the rooms aren t quite up to standard for the price Staff are helpful but reception is understaffed and check in check out is too slow That said we liked it overall for convenience and would probably stay again , Great location for the West End Knightsbridge Hyde Pk and Albert Hall Helpful staff very good breakfast 
161447,Arbor Hyde Park, Not competitive in terms of value for money Didn t feel like a 4 hotel Room was small and at basement level so felt claustrophobic Bathroom also very small We were given an introduction to the room by the front staff which was odd as it had very few facilities , Great location good breakfast comfortable bed 
161448,Arbor Hyde Park, No fridge in room but they let you store your perishables in their bar fridge , Breakfast was wonderful Our room was huge Quiet property surrounding neighborhood 
161449,Arbor Hyde Park, The steps in the room were too steep and the step into the bathroom enoying fell over it twice The room felt like it had been shoehorned into a space not designed for a room Breakfast was ok toast was more like warm bread would have expected full English breakfast to be included for the cost of the room It would have been nice if someone could have cleared away the mess and vacuum cleaner left outside the room during our stay , Room was clean tidy and well appointed and very quiet bed was comfortable 
161450,Arbor Hyde Park, The rooms have poor light and functionally not laid out well as there are inconvenient doors that don t open all the way Smelt musty and poor light always an extra cost like coffee for breakfast , location to hyde park continental breakfast was very good Staff were friendly and helpful 
161451,Arbor Hyde Park, Staff and breakfast Breakfast was poor and they pushed so much to get extra food for extra money , Place is very nice well designed but staff is unfortunutly not friendly Not all staff but most of the staff for first two days were extremely unfriendly which did not make us welcomed 
161452,Arbor Hyde Park, all are very bad foods are not fresh reception guys are really stupid my room was dirty smells like a toilet beds were dirty too I asked for a flipper they said they don t have wifi is not working even mobile phone connection is weak can t make any phone call , nothing 
161453,Arbor Hyde Park, Staff not really friendly the breakfast is bad and the price is too high for the quality offered No room service , Location is great and rooms are comfortable
161454,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was awful with two doors separating blocking me from the bathroom via the dressing room Nowhere to sit an work comfortably form a laptop , The bed
161455,Arbor Hyde Park, Lobby reception a bit small awkward , Great breakfast helpful staff Great location right on Hyde Park perfect for a morning run And best of all a Nespresso machine Great value for a family of 4 
161456,Arbor Hyde Park, After all the location was just ok for us There isn t much anything around this bit of town between notting hill and marble arch Thus though it s not very far from interesting places it s not very close to anything either , The hotel was tidy and the breakfast was really good The room was spacious 
161457,Arbor Hyde Park, Lack of 13 amp electric sockets in room so not great for working Charge of 50 when checking in to cover room expenses , Friendly staff Quiet Modern bathroom 
161458,Arbor Hyde Park, The room in the basement was nothing special The furniture was a bit ruined the wardrobe very small It didn t look like a 143 room There was a strange smell in the basement The green light on the ceiling above the bed was a bit annoying during the night , Breakfast included but I asked for a cappuccino and It d been extra charge so I said no thanks Nice and quiet place
161459,Arbor Hyde Park, The hotel staff does not have information of the city they do not know the area Very junior staff with no experience in dealing with clients They asked for a 100 deposit and gave us a handwritten receipt on a sheet of paper and told us that if we lost the receipt they could not return the deposit it s a shame that they do not invest in more prepared staff , The hotel is in a good situation close to the parks and tourist attractions next to the public transport and easy acces to any point of the city 
161460,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel is in an excellent position and all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful We were given an upgrade to a larger room which was very comfortable and well furnished with a lovely modern bathroom Although only continental breakfast was included there was plenty to fill us up for the day with lots of choice 
161461,Arbor Hyde Park, Breakfast is nice but still just continental would be nice to include classical English breakfast in price to feel real British atmosphere , Very nice location clean and modern facility 
161462,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing to note , The bed was very comfortable and there was a very good selection for breakfast If needed it was possible to order food in the evening by room service 
161463,Arbor Hyde Park, We chose this location on purpose but not for those who want to be central theatre district in particulier The closest tune line was closed for or during our stay which meant we had to walk a bit more to get to the tube As we had a child in our party we ended up taking taxis quite a bit , Great location close to Hyde Park We loved the calm and neighborhood feel Lovely renovation of this property We were upgraded to a very spacious well appointed room on the top floor Hotel kindly arranged for a transfer with private chauffeur to the train station upon our departure 
161464,Arbor Hyde Park, The wifi didn t work not that it is a necessity There was no coffee in the room only tea A bit noisy being on the basement floor as we could hear the people above us , Staff were really pleasant helpful Hotel is decorated to a nice modern standard Very clean The bed was really comfortable the room was a good size Not too far from Oxford Circus 
161465,Arbor Hyde Park, terrible lighting in room with eye piercing fire alarm above beds broken TV control poor quality bedding and sheets not of good standard no flat sheets and room stuffy and small i get the impression booking com given low priority and suggest this discussed as a nice room was requested , nice breakfast and good service
161466,Arbor Hyde Park, The rooms are very small with a very small cupboard with no shelves or drawers We had to keep some of our clothes in the suitcase The towels are worn out and damaged I really didnt feel comfortable using them I am sharing a picture of the towel The bedlinen were also old and worn out In breakfast when i asked that the boil egg to be a bit warn they told me that it will be extra charge The check in and out time is too long This hotel still uses normal key that you have to give to the front desk before leaving the hotel instead of smart cards Definitely it is not considered a 4 stars although we paid for a 4 stars ,No Positive
161467,Arbor Hyde Park, Noisy room above ours hotel quiet overall , Friendly helpful staff bag storage room upgrade location to public transport and where we wanted to be Natural History Hyde Park fab breakfast
161468,Arbor Hyde Park, Little thing but the shower was too powerful for the bath plug so the water built up in the bath during the shower , Nice comfortable room good size and well decorated 5 minutes walk from either Gloucester Road or South Ken tube stops I was upgraded to an exec room so not sure what the standard room is like but this was ideal for a short business stay Would definitely stay again 
161469,Arbor Hyde Park, Not that close from public transportation 8 10 minutes walk but it s due to the fact that Lancaster Gate s station is closed until July 2017 One of their receptionists was quite unpleasant with us not helpful at all and spoke in a very rude manner to one of her colleagues who was very nice btw Wifi was not working in our rooms bad signal, Very nice bedding Quiet location Fancy decor Great breakfast
161470,Arbor Hyde Park, The fact that they asked for an additional 50 pounds cash deposit in addition to payment for the room In advance, The fact that the staff prepared a take away breakfast bag for me as I left the hotel very early
161471,Arbor Hyde Park, Last minute communication from the hotel that the nearest tube station Lancaster Gate was closed when they d known for weeks was a bit naughty Didn t give us time to cancel and choose somewhere else And we would have cancelled so perhaps that s why they didn t contact us We knew that the hotel was a stop away from Marble Arch so thought we d be able to get everywhere we wanted easily However as tube station was closed we jumped on a bus and it took over an hour and a half to get to the hotel from Regent Street Our late arrival at the hotel meant we had just time to change to get a taxi costing 40 to get to the theatre in time We weren t up to walking to another tube station so taxi it was So hotel fab but management informing us of Lancaster Gate closing poor Costing us taxi there and back 80 , VERY SMART NEWLY REFURBISHED AS DESCRIBED staff lovely and breakfast excellent
161472,Arbor Hyde Park, Most breakfast typically include basics like scrambled eggs and bacon This was missing and had to be paid for Secondly it is the first hotel I have seen without fridges and I am still baffled as to reason Finally they have to retire some of their towels They don t fit the hotel or the service culture they represent , The hotel has the best collection of service people I have ever encountered and I have been to hotels in 3 continents Katarina front desk has to be the most helpful person in the city of London It is easy to recommend this hotel The room was large and the toilet bathroom was spacious The restaurant was really well laid out and the staff were attentive and super helpful 
161473,Arbor Hyde Park, Not a lot of facilities at the hotel Advertised room with sattelite tv only has freeview and after booking a executive double the bed is actually 2 single beds zipped together and you can feel the zip in the middle of the matress which was very disappointing Also the tv was really old and in need of upgrading , Very nice location Quiet and peaceful Very clean and stylish hotel 
161474,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Breakfast is very good and you can order some hot prepared food from the list and extra pay but is not necessary bicouse they offers plenty delicious food Check in and check out is the very fast Personal is great 
161475,Arbor Hyde Park, 2 sets of doors to get to what was an ensuite bathroom Very odd indeed and probably one of the smallest bedrooms I have slept in ever , Great location Very close to a bike hire station Santander used bike to travel everywhere I liked the continental breakfast Good options Did not miss the hot food element at all personally 
161476,Arbor Hyde Park, The staff are very stuffy and not helpful They ask at sign in for your passport and your children s passports I didn t bring them but I had other forms of identification but they were insistent on having your passports and almost wouldn t let me check in There are not many plugs in the room there were two in mine above a desk far from the bed or anywhere convenient The breakfast is okay at best and my family and I all got sick shortly after eating You have to turn in your key to the front desk anytime you depart the room That s a security concern for me While there s safes in the room I ve never had to turn in a key just to step out of the hotel Also there isn t much around the hotel or to do in the hotel There s a pretty lounge at the entrance but it looks merely for show not for comfort Won t stay here again , Beautifully decorated 
161477,Arbor Hyde Park, Not hotel s fault but nearest underground station Lancaster Gate is closed until Jul 2017 which made commuting a little harder , Room was a decent size and very comfortable which is hard to find in London city centre View from the room was great 
161478,Arbor Hyde Park, They tried to upgrade us to a basement room I guess they try until some guest don t dare to say no to the basement and they actually call it an uppgrade We didn t accept and got a nice superior room as we expected on second floor , Really nice breakfast Good location Fresh bathroom Tidy 
161479,Arbor Hyde Park, If this hotel were better managed it could be great The terrible coffee and soggy toast at breakfast reminded me of boarding school in the 70s The hatchet faced and border line rude staff at reception whose mission is to eke every last possible penny out of your credit card before you even step inside your room make the experience feel like an interrogation not a reception I particularly appreciated returning to my room at 10 in the evening to find the staff had put the air conditioning on at 17 C at the beginning of February Grey net curtains fraying bath mat and the fact that Lancaster Gate tube is closed for renovation added the final touches to a lousy stay , Not a great deal Won t be returning 
161480,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Excellent location hidden from the rush street just 150 m from Kensington Gardens entrans towards Alberts Memorial spacious room Trully enjoyed my stay here
161481,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing to fault , We have stayed here several times and really love it It s a good boutique hotel in a great location very close to the west end We drive into town usually and its just outside of the congestion zone plus there is a car park around the corner at the Thistle which is 20 for 24 hours We got our room at a great rate and were given an upgrade to a suite on arrival which was gorgeous Very comfy spacious room and bed Fabulous walk in rain shower The staff here are always very friendly and helpful Continental breakfast is included and is a very good selection if you want something cooked it is at a reasonable price too not a hefty price tag The hotel is in a quiet location yet just off the Bayswater Road Will always make this our first choice if we can 
161482,Arbor Hyde Park, We could hear the guest in the other rooms it was a little noisy Perhaps it had to do with the fact that we had a room that could be connected to another room , The location of the hotel was very convenient the staff was very nice and the rooms super comfortable 
161483,Arbor Hyde Park, hard pillows , great place and area if you want to be away from the city madness In a few steps you walk into Hyde park not exactly a punishment though and you walk your way to Oxford Regent st and Mayfair 10 15 min Nice spacious room however small but clean and newly decorated bathroom but not an issue at all Breakfast buffet is nothing to complain on 
161484,Arbor Hyde Park, A little tucked away but a lovely quiet location Heating wasn t working on our floor but we were offered a few acceptable solutions to resolve the problem Booking com said the hotel had a restaurant but it only served breakfast There are plenty of nearby places to eat , Comfortable bed Good size bedroom and bathroom for London Very clean Quiet location Helpful staff The heating didn t work on our floor but the staff offered to supply us with an electric heater or move us to another hotel at their expense including the taxi fare We felt the staff did the best under the circumstances They also gave us free cooked breakfast in the morning 
161485,Arbor Hyde Park, Just very minor thing there could have been cotton pads available in the hotel , We stayed in the Executive room and it was super spacious and modern Great value for money in Central London 
161486,Arbor Hyde Park, The windows are not closing tight and it was a very cold night The room could not get into a confortable temperature for me , Brand new decoration with very good taste 
161487,Arbor Hyde Park, During our stay the lift did not go down to the breakfast room located at the Basement floor Only accessible via stairs, Very friendly and helpful staff both at the reception and in the breakfast room customer oriented and efficient Breakfast good but with the surcharge of 7 GBP reasonable price you can get an abundantly English breakfast Fabulous location Hyde Park within walking distance quiet location Our request was considered and fulfilled quiet room on the highest floor possible 
161488,Arbor Hyde Park, air conditioning in the room did not work Although we mentioned it at the front desk was not repaired so the room was pretty cold to stay in, nice room and comfortable bed beautifully designed hotel and friendly service surroundings also beautiful with easy access to attractions
161489,Arbor Hyde Park, It is far most of the staff are not friendly or helpful Internet was down several times Phone was out of order Rooms are very small It is not value for money Disadvantages are numerous to count , The facility is clean and this is the only advantage over there 
161490,Arbor Hyde Park, Upon checking in we were told that the central heating wasn t working and were given a small heater for the cold room Then we discovered that the bed wasn t changed from the last guest and there were hairs all over under the sheets While we were waiting for the change the receptionist who hasn t seen the room tried to play down the situation by saying that it might have been hairs from the cleaners Innocent perhaps but this comment definitely did not help with soothing our mood On the positive side we were offered complementary drinks and breakfast upgrades However upon checkout we were asked to pay 7 pounds for the drinks When we explained that these should have been complementary the receptionist the one with the glass was more busy with telling us what information she had on the computer than with correcting the situation After repeating herself for the 4th time we asked her to stop and simply check us out She replied I m not going to argue with you for 7 pounds which we found were completely rude and inappropriate given the situation was created by the hotel staff in the first place All in all while the room was okay and there were quite other friendly and helpful staff this is not the experience one would expect from a four star hotel Additionally the soundproof was pretty bad towels were old Would not recommend it nor consider staying there again ,No Positive
161491,Arbor Hyde Park, A separate kettle and a fridge , Good sized room on the ground floor next to reception comfortable bed nespresso maker though unbranded coffee tasted a bit decaff good sized bathroom with tub and shower over Lots of lighting desk and chair and several mirrors nice modern but comfortable d cor Fairly quiet location and ten minutes walk to Paddington or Queensway Lancaster Gate tube is shut until July 2017 Nice little bar area breakfast room is downstairs Continental breakfast good with fruit yoghurts cereals meats and cheeses bread Coffee tea and toast included jams available as are hot breakfasts at extra charge All in all a good find close to Hyde Park and bus tube transport into central London but a quiet place at night 
161492,Arbor Hyde Park, Heating not working in room eventually moved to another room Very noisy at night as walls thin floors above creaky Ordered salad from snack bar very poor quality and poor value for money TV reception went off at night waited 20 minutes for it to come back on but it didn t so went to bed very early , Friendly and helpful staff
161493,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was very cold the room service menu was very limited cooked breakfast was at an additional charge, Modern clean large room good location for Paddington station
161494,Arbor Hyde Park, No kettle to get water hot enough for tea , The continental breakfast was excellent fresh and plenty of choice Bed and pillows very comfortable first place we ve stayed where the pillows have suited us both Room was cleaned so well every day Good location for using buses could get everywhere we wanted easily 
161495,Arbor Hyde Park, English style serve of cold toast on a rack just as you sit down but if asked the staff were happy to deliver it later, The freshness of the fruit yoghurt and patisserie items
161496,Arbor Hyde Park, I want to point out rude and inappropriate behavior of girls on reception desk and especially the dark haired with glasses On the contrary the boys that work on reception were very polite and helpful Also 4 star hotel without PC for customer , The breakfast was good Room was warm and quite comfortable Two blocks form Hyde Park and 3 underground stations Many restaurants and pubs nearby 
161497,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing not to like , My second stay here Friendly staff great location because it s set back from main roads and really quiet but easy access to Kensington Paddington and West End Good continental breakfast with additional extras should you need a cooked breakfast Powerful hot shower too 
161498,Arbor Hyde Park, rooms are quite noisy bath products were insufficient 30 ml bath gel for 2 adults 2 nights very clean bathroom but also very small not possible to place a toiletries bag the bed was hard the pillows were not comfi no minibar available, the concept of the hotel free coffee and water in the room the cleanliness good continental breakfast
161499,Arbor Hyde Park, The bedroom doors and corridors were very noisy and could have been an issue with less thoughtful or partying adjacent occupants The breakfast staff should learn how to break into a smile occasionally , A very comfortable bed was the highlight in this well run no frills hotel The continental breakfast had a good selection of food and gave us an excellent start on a damp and miserable morning 
161500,Arbor Hyde Park, The staff are extremely rude Shortly after I checked out of this hotel I received a phone call from reception accusing me of stealing there pillows The breakfast was very poor quality There was not a kettle provided in our room to make a cup of tea So upon asking reception to solve this issue they told us to use the hot water from the coffee machine We attempted this and was completely disgusted with the results it looked like the water was taken from the river nile , The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is that it had a nice interior
161501,Arbor Hyde Park, Room was very awkward to get to from with luggage from the lift it was up a set of stairs through a door down a set of the stairs and then strangely down another set of stairs once you open the bedroom door Towels were not good worn and off white No hand soap only a small shower gel and shampoo , Big room for London Nice spacious bathroom and rainhead shower Quiet room at the back Nespresso machine Breakfast was included but didn t get the opportunity to try it Free wifi 
161502,Arbor Hyde Park, No sound proofing between floors I get that it is an old building but if you are going to create a Boutique Hotel you must sound proof properly I could hear the person above walking around their room the floorboards were creeking and I could hear everything they were doing which was really irritating , Near to Hyde Park and the West End and the Tube 
161503,Arbor Hyde Park, Breakfast is rather poor For an hotel of that class it s inappropriate to ask supplements for hot foods or cappuccino, Good position in a quiet area 
161504,Arbor Hyde Park, No dinner available at the hotel but easy walk within 10 mins to local great restaurants although limited choice in area , Compact room but clean with every amenity I required and in a lovely quiet location 
161505,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing, What an absolute gem of a boutique hotel Lovely quiet location beautiful decor and ambience Friendly helpful staff The family room was huge compared to other London hotels lovely little added extras from sweets on the landing to nice bathroom accessories We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will visit again without a shadow of a doubt 
161506,Arbor Hyde Park, My room was in 3 sections a tiny entrance space containing the wardrobe and tea coffee maker The shower went off one way and the bedroom another It felt too tight and the doors very heavy going in and out I had and early start on Sunday morning and breakfast was not available until 8 00am even though it was only a buffet So just grabbed a quick croissant and coffee , The shower was lovely new and good water pressure not always the case in London The bed was comfortable crisp cotton sheets 
161507,Arbor Hyde Park, The receptionist did not want to acknowledge that my card was charged without my authority and kept on stating that it is hotel policy I did explain that I should be made aware and as far as I was concerned I selected to pay at the hotel I booked on those terms This was something she could not comprehend Was very upset about this as I wanted to charge another card of mine , Great hotel with a lovely room 
161508,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was tiny with hardly even any space to fully open the suitcase The bathroom was through 2 doors and a corridor and the doors wouldn t stay opened which was a bit inconvenient The staff were quite helpful but a bit slow sometimes No slippers and bathrobe no hair conditioner only shampoo , The continental breakfast was ok quite good everything fresh and tasty The location is very good Quite and close to the centre park and tube Bathroom very clean and looked quite new 
161509,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Room was lovely and comfortable and they gave us a free upgrade we didn t ask for We had just arrived in London after a 13 hour flight so it was definitely a much welcomed and restful stay 
161510,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing to not like Only a couple of things that we thought was that although the mirrors by the bed are lovely and antique effect they are not really practical when it comes to drying your hair as that is where the plug is There is a plug under the TV however no mirror There is a lovely Nespresso machine to use however only 4 of those little milks which hardly do anything in a cup of nice proper coffee , Fabulous location just a very short walk from Hyde Park Very quiet road Lovely personal welcome and taken to the room Very quiet room just for me and sister fabulous layout and very spacious Nice added touch of a chocolate on the bed and extra bits outside the room if you feel peckish Great under floor heating in the bathroom with a huge walking shower 
161511,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing to fault , Excellent breakfast and everything about the hotel was brilliant The location was very quiet yet very convenient for everything in London
161512,Arbor Hyde Park, It s an old building that s been converted into a hotel so the layout is a little unconventional , The room was nicely decorated clean and fresh 
161513,Arbor Hyde Park, Room described as a Club Double was too small for two people The wardrobe was only 13 cm wide There were no shelves or drawers in which to place clothes to allow suitcases to be unpacked ,No Positive
161514,Arbor Hyde Park, No restaurant and I arrived after working all day very hungry There were room snacks such as paninis but not much else Only continental breakfast unless you paid extra , Lovely boutique hotel 
161515,Arbor Hyde Park, Shower was a bit weak The floorboards above us creaked The walls were not very well soundproofed, Only 5 minutes from Lancaster Gate tube station Very nice quiet street Breakfast was good Bed very comfortable 
161516,Arbor Hyde Park, Towels are getting worn no longer soft and fluffy but frayed around the edges Would prefer kettle than confusing coffee pod machine, Fourth stay at this lovely hotel good location near Hyde Park bus stops tube etc but situated in a quiet square Staff very helpful 
161517,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was outstanding cold Nobody inform us that the hotel was taking deposit despite that we were paying before our arrive Now 24 hours after return deposit didnt come back Joanna, A continental breakfast was quite good 
161518,Arbor Hyde Park, Don t use the hotel to call a taxi Faster better and cheaper to stop one on Bayswater Road Hyde Park 300meters, Located in a very quiet location but still very close to Hyde Park and thereby easy get a taxi Breakfast simple but good 
161519,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Gem of a hotel The staff are super friendly and helpful the room was comfortable and the bathroom beautifully clean and recently renovated Situated in a lovely traditional terrace of similar properties within easy walking distance of Lancaster Gate tube station Rate is very reasonable for the quality in this part of London especially as a tasty continental breakfast is included We would definitely stay again 
161520,Arbor Hyde Park, Room was very tight not much space especially when going out of the bedroom towards the bathroom caused by the amount of fire doors We only stayed for 1 night so wasn t too bad , Fantastic location walking distance from Paddington station and to Hyde park we walked to winter wonderland and the royal Albert hall cutting through the lovely parks very clean hotel excellent healthy breakfast and very friendly staff 
161521,Arbor Hyde Park, Investment needed urgently to improve the quality of beds which were very hard and the replacement of much needed good quality duvets and plllows The bed linen was especially shabby with yellow staining and torn pillowcases , The location is excellent being so close to Hyde Park 
161522,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, This hotel is in an excellent location close to amenities underground park It is very well equipped The rooms are ample and well furnished Bathrooms look recently refurbished Staff really friendly and helpful 
161523,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing, Not in your face Slightly off the main drag but a great location Very smart decor and staff very helpful and welcoming Room excellent Executive Club Top marks this will now be our first choice 
161524,Arbor Hyde Park, We d been travelling around Europe for six months and this was by far the most expensive hotel we stayed at Perhaps our expectations were too high but this hotel was far from being good value for money The room was large enough but even though there was a cubicle for it there was no fridge so if you wanted to have a cold drink you had to buy it from the hotel The wardrobe was barely eight inches wide The lounge chairs were the formwork type and there was no table to go with them The workbench for computers had only one chair Perhaps this hotel is just indicative of how little you get for your money in London , The location was good two tube stations nearby and a relatively easy walk to the main attractions 
161525,Arbor Hyde Park, Interconnecting door in our room made the noise from the next room a bit louder than normal but didn t affect sleeping , Comfy bed Very clean Spacious room Staff friendly and service prompt Had to ask for bath robes but they were brought within 5 minutes 
161526,Arbor Hyde Park, nothing, Staff were nice friendly and helpful Continental breakfast was excellent Room was cosy Location excellent Round the corner from tube station Near some nice restaurants Next to Regent Park Walking distance to Albert hall Good value Quiet and comfortable 
161527,Arbor Hyde Park, lovely coffee machine but had to ask for a kettle which seemed a bit strange considering that everything else was there but I m stretching for something to say here because it was so minor and they delivered it right away , Comfy bed beautiful reception lobby room Fabulous breakfast Friendly staff Great last min deal Loved it Wish I could have stayed longer 
161528,Arbor Hyde Park, Room could have been a bit bigger for the price and breakfast was only continnental which at 15 each seems quite high , Comfortable beds and Nespresso very welcome 
161529,Arbor Hyde Park, The interconnecting room and the cost of it , The location is fantastic breakfast is great and keeps you going for those busy days in the City The beds are amazingly comfortable 
161530,Arbor Hyde Park, It miss a veritable bar for a good draught beer but two pubs are at proximity, The staff was very helpful and flexible We have liked our room family executive The room was clean and enough spacious for 4 2 adults and 2 teenagers with a modern bathroom The situation is good with the central line tube at proximity and Hyde Park for a quiet moment also at proximity 
161531,Arbor Hyde Park, Disappointing views from hotel room Very small rooms even when upgraded Reception lady was unfriendly , great breakfast good location good Wi Fi 
161532,Arbor Hyde Park, The only thing we could suggest was something is needed to put shampoo bottle and soap maybe a mini shelf, Breakfast really nice staff helpful lovely decor bed really comfortable
161533,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, everything was great we got an upgrade in a biggee room which was perfect with our baby a baby cot was also provided thank you to the staff that helped us with everything 
161534,Arbor Hyde Park, They take a 50 security payment I am not sure why however this was refunded as soon as i checked out I was on th eground floor which was a little noisy but to be expected , The room was very comfortable clean and spacious The location is great and the breakfast choice was extensive I woul ddefinately reccomend this hotel in future 
161535,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was small but perfectly good for a short stay , Very comfortable bed and choice of pillows Room was spotless Hotel is 100 yards from Hyde Park north side and a short walk from Marble Arch Continental breakfast choice was excellent muesli granola fruit salad and choice of pastries 
161536,Arbor Hyde Park, The room is a bit small Only standard breakfast is included You have to pay for full English breakfast , The location is very central Bathrooms spotless and new Nespresso machine in the room with no extra charge 
161537,Arbor Hyde Park, The room actually not fitable for 4 Persons too small The litter bin in the bathroom is also too small for daily use , Location is pretty good you might take only 5min walk to Hyder Park Lancaster Gate But it still take more than expected time to Paddington Station Breakfast is pretty nice 
161538,Arbor Hyde Park, Hotel was very small Room was a fair size but the bathroom sink was tiny and not much of a view or natural light , Location is perfect Close to transport and walking distance to Hyde park and the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street
161539,Arbor Hyde Park, No room service when I arrived quite late best I could get was a takeaway pizza not cheap , I got a free upgrade to a larger room with sofa and desk Very friendly and helpful staff
161540,Arbor Hyde Park, Its definitely not for bussiness people much smaller then it seemed to be according to pictures for expierence in other hotels in London I would say not worth for value its cost , Location is ok but no much eating out posibilities in nearest area I liked big window and light in my room 
161541,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Room and bathroom were nicely updated and so clean The entire hotel was spotless The breakfast room was so cozy and very well decorated Breakfast was good and the staff was quite professional and polite Hotel is in a quiet area convenient to shops restaurants and Hyde Park and the subway 
161542,Arbor Hyde Park, If you re looking for egg breakfast plan some additional time and rather stay with the classics , Great rooms executive or superior with good size and ideal area to start your day in London for leisure or business 
161543,Arbor Hyde Park, The location is a bit off from Paddington station Not that you can walk there easily but it will take you at least ten minutes Nearest tube is actually Lancaster Gate , Room was surprisingly spacious for London Extra plus for coffee machine with Nespresso quality coffee in the room Breakfast was good with a variety of food to choose from 
161544,Arbor Hyde Park, the a c did not work well strange entrance to our room a door with steep steps and then another door, nice rain shower good location to Hyde Park snacks were available in the hallway very close to the tube station
161545,Arbor Hyde Park, none , quite silence place room is big and beautiful nice staff warm and good air condition just five minutes to subway they upgrated my room type for free 
161546,Arbor Hyde Park, Being asked to pay for all five nights stay prior to being let into room Weeks prior to our stay we emailed informing the hotel we would be arriving around 7pm Tired from driving from Wales then a train trip we were informed after 2pm the first night had already been charged to our credit card this was acceptable But we were then asked to pay for the remaining four nights up front before being let into the room this has never happened in any hotel we have stayed in before We were told this was hotel policy I wanted to pay with my bank issued travel money card which was loaded with GBP which I paid my hotel bill in Wales etc rather than a credit card which was would carry transaction fees The receptionist refused my card as my name didn t appear on It sent to then find cash very tired and unhappy now couldnt withdraw full amount from service station cash point said I would withdraw balance from the bank next day requested to be let into our room as the night was paid for she was completely inflexible and still wouldn t let us into the room even though first night was fully paid for Finally another staff member arrived I then proved the money card was mine by logging onto NetBank and matching card account number he then showed some flexibility and allowed us to pay with a card we had used successfully all month throughout UK Europe This left a bad first impression which spoiled our hotel stay also asked for fifty pound deposit on room key , Beautiful Street near Lancaster gate 
161547,Arbor Hyde Park, Small wardrobe No fridge No cupboards or shelves for storage No kettle just coffee machine Only one person on reception to check in and out , Good quiet location with easy access to Queensway and Hyde Park Room 107 was lovely with a fantastic rain shower Breakfast room was neatly laid out and excellent service I would recommend this hotel highly 
161548,Arbor Hyde Park, Doors slamming from 6am Bathroom had not been properly cleaned from last guest hairs in shower towel rail really dusty Bed could be comfier, Short walk from Lancaster gate tube Staff carried bag to the room Air con Nice decor Personal service at check in Modern bathroom with good shower
161549,Arbor Hyde Park, Odd room layout with bathroom in a separate room It would have been good to have a security chain on the door , Good breakfast polite and helpful staff I recommend 
161550,Arbor Hyde Park, The shower was superb however I am a bath person and would have loved a tub We were offered another room but we liked the one we had , The experience was lovely stayed in London many times this was the best To look out the window at a beautiful garden it also was lively and quiet 
161551,Arbor Hyde Park, Worst hotel experience in my life First of all they ask you for a 50 pound deposit for damages and they don t have a mini bar The staff Worst staff I ve had to deal with except for one tall dark bell boy at the front desk talks to the guests in a patronizing way Got upgraded to a room Number 007 the noisiest room I ve ever stayed in on the ground floor and next to the kitchen so you hear everything on the street even if someone is just walking and you hear them preparing breakfast from I don t know when The room has 10 flight of stairs that lead to the bathroom so if you have to go to the bathroom you go to an upper floor imagine doing that in the middle of the night I d rather sleep Finally You have to leave your room key when you leave , Nice decor
161552,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing major The location was a bit further from Paddington than I had thought, Modern bathroom fittings extremely quiet location comfortable bed good breakfast
161553,Arbor Hyde Park, Stairs required to get to most rooms Foreign staff with little local knowledge , Large room modern new bathroom Good breakfast selection Near Hyde Park 
161554,Arbor Hyde Park, Surprised that if we wanted a hot breakfast scrambled egg an omlette we would have to pay extra Disappointed with that surprise at our first breakfast No individual reading lamps on each side of the bed which made reading in bed difficult if one of us wanted to sleep And the coffee machine is not a replacement for a good kettle it just doesn t boil the water to the degree required for a cup of tea , Staff were great The room was bright and the bathroom facilities excellent 
161555,Arbor Hyde Park, The room allocated was the smallest even though I payed for a superior room This changed because I booked and payed for an additional night However the subsequent room had internal stairs and was not very comfortable , The staff were polite and helpful 
161556,Arbor Hyde Park, Sound insulation poor between rooms slept very badly as a result could hear TVs and other sounds from the night owls in neighbouring rooms, Lovely boutique hotel great location comfortable and welcoming
161557,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Fantastic small hotel in great location Although very central location it was quiet and calm which made for a good night s sleep Lovely room which although small was very stylish and had comfortable bed and well equipped bathroom Great breakfast and friendly helpful staff 
161558,Arbor Hyde Park, There is a dearth of places to eat nearby without quite a walk Two pubs and two Greek restaurants that s it The chairs in the room had a budget feel and although there was a couch something like an occasional bed it was very hard and too high to be a comfy sitting area , Lovely quiet spot close to Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate tube No noticeable noise at night Style led furnishings Air conditioning that worked properly Staff very friendly and helpful Extremely comfy bed and the room was beautifully clean Great large shower and a cascade as well as a rainfall option Continental breakfast was very nice indeed and plentiful Most people wouldn t really need the cooked option as there was so much choice 
161559,Arbor Hyde Park, Slightly irritating rule at the reception as I booked the room for my parents who live abroad I live in London and each time had to sign in to spend time with them in their room as if I was some shady intruder , Excellent breakfast room and cleanliness Booked this room for my parents who thoroughly enjoyed the hotel its facilities and their stay Great touch with a water dispenser on the ground floor with cucumbers lemons inside Free fruit at reception Great comfortable seating and decor at reception 
161560,Arbor Hyde Park, Despite the fact that we were 2 adults plus a child the hotel had only queen bedrooms available and no facilities were made available to accommodate ,No Positive
161561,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff are to be congratulated on their sunny dispositions and are always polite and eager to help The continental breakfast is varied and fresh catering for a range of diets We have stayed here in the past and look forward to returning 
161562,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful for example bringing an ice pack every night for my twisted knee printing boarding passes for our flights and booking a cab for early morning The hotel is 5 minutes from Lancaster Gate station and an entrance to Kensington Gardens I highly recommend this hotel 
161563,Arbor Hyde Park, Beware to choose a room with few stair steps as we ve been offered a room that has a lot of stairs to climb and decent as well in order to reach it in which we totally refused and we were offered a room with 3 steps to climb only the elevator was working fine The room lacked a refrigerator all rooms don t have it but we were offered to keep our water bottle in the bar refrigerator downstairs The water pressure in the shower was weak The room was part of a connected rooms system in which we could hear our neighbours clearly through the connecting door as well as their cell phone on viabration mode , Very near to the Hyde Park located in a prestigious and quite neighbourhood Have access to the bus system and very near to the underground as well Helpful staff and good basic breakfast served by professional people 
161564,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Quiet location near Hyde Park but with good transport options Close to Lancaster gate underground and buses running along Bayswater road Pleasant clean hotel 
161565,Arbor Hyde Park, Don t book the club room The room was quite small The bed was too small for me The closet was too small for two persons , Location was good Staff was friendly 
161566,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, This hotel is very conveniently located close to the Bayswater Road and Lancaster Gate tube It is clean comfortable and the continental breakfast is excellent 
161567,Arbor Hyde Park, Option of dinner to save going out, Extremely helpful and efficient staff shown to room very good continental breakfast plenty of staff peaceful and relaxing

161572,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Comfortable room with lovely bed and brilliant shower Breakfast gave lots of choice and was well presented and delicious Professional friendly staff Very happy to recommend 
161573,Arbor Hyde Park, Noise from adjoining room could hear practically everything Staff were informed and we asked that they speak with the occupants or new people checking in However the only advice they could give was to call reception if there was a problem but this would have been in the middle of the night We would have preferred the occupants to have been spoken to when checking in and or a notice put on the adjoining doors to advise people that noise between rooms is an issue , Quiet corner of Lancaster Gate 
161574,Arbor Hyde Park, Mattress was very firm Also I was traveling with an elderly family member only family suites available had stairs which made it challenging when I spoke to management they stated I should have emailed them How would I have known there were stairs there was no mention of that in the hotel description One reason I chose the hotel in the first place it had a lift , Nice hotel friendly staff Great location short walk to the underground Hyde Park just down across the street Several nice pubs within walking distance 
161575,Arbor Hyde Park, Breakfast was ill equipped for anything other than continental even though they offered cooked it was not available when we ordered and had to leave without as food served was hard cooked poached eggs after a very long wait and NO bacon available Should not offer cooked if not available , Room whilst tiny was perfectly adequate Front of house staff very nice and helpful It breakfast staff lacking in communication skills 
161576,Arbor Hyde Park, You can hear footsteps from people live above you and sound from the room next door Shower pressure in our room was low There was a green security light on the ceiling cannot be turned off at night which was a bit disturbing for sleep , Excellent location cosy room and quite neighbourhood 2 minutes walk to Hydepark and Lancester Gate train station 
161577,Arbor Hyde Park, Through the street was quiet the other guests were not No fault of the hotel however there was much running about and slamming doors , Quiet street beautiful decor and friendly staff Warm welcome Good size room Shower room small but great rain shower Would concider staying again 
161578,Arbor Hyde Park, No complaints , Nice sized room modern shower and toilet facilities Good continental breakfast with cooked available for additional cost Walking distance from Lancaster Gate tube station Would definitely book again 
161579,Arbor Hyde Park, Given how excellent the rest of the hotel is the breakfast is merely very good The buffet that is included with the room rate is very nice but a little bit limited in choice , As with previous visits this was a very nice stay It isn t cheap but reasonable value in context of similar options It is a very comfortable upscale hotel 
161580,Arbor Hyde Park, Room wasn t ready when arrived which was slightly annoying as we didn t get time to freshen up as we were due elsewhere shortly afterwards but they did put our bag in our room which was nice , Large room loved the shower extra large bed overall excellent
161581,Arbor Hyde Park, An extra key per room would be great , The location is in a quiet neighborhood great for wanting to sleep in It s a few minutes walk from Hyde Park Also close to a metro station and a bus stop The hotel is very quaint and designed beautifully 
161582,Arbor Hyde Park, Only marked the bed down as there was plenty of room for a super king although the king was comfortable , The hotel was well out of way of the hustle and bustle of london very quite The staff were all very freindly and helpfull We we be staying there again 
161583,Arbor Hyde Park, Wifi seemed a bit slow , Warm welcome rooms very nicely decorated extremely clean everything seemed new Hotel was calm and staff were very nice Overall a great experience 
161584,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was small so if you re travelling with a lot of luggage like we were pack the gear you wi l need in a small bag to keep with you and stow away the rest , The bed was very comfortable There was a lift The breakfast was good The surroundings were beautiful houses and the park There were good restaurants and little pubs close by as well as the hop on hop off bus stop The bus stop is near the Thistle hotel but be careful there are two of them really close to each other on Bayswater Road 
161585,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Hotel was amazing So close to Hyde park but in a quiet beautiful street The staff were lovely and the continental breakfast was AMAZING This is a hidden gem of a hotel if you re looking for something a little special but at reasonable rates Would recommend this place 
161586,Arbor Hyde Park, We booked a club room This is the smallest room and our experience was that this was very small We ended up changing rooms 2 times in a two night stay maybe we were too fussy but I don t think so once to move away from a room next to the lift once to move to a room with a decent sized bed some have only standard doubles In fairness the staff were very accommodating and we did end up in good sized club room Breakfast is included but on Booking com it is not clear that this is continental breakfast and there is a surcharge for a cooked breakfast , The location was perfect for us as we were attending a concert in Hyde Park The rooms are all clean and well equipped The staff were very friendly and helpful Continental breakfast gives you plenty of choice 
161587,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing , We had a beautiful clean double room The shower was fabulous The staff are professional charming and polite The breakfast was one of the best we ve had when staying in London fresh fruit and beautifully baked croissants The staff are by far the best we ve encountered and a credit to the Hotel We ll definitely be back to stay 
161588,Arbor Hyde Park, The hotel signboard is small for the first time you might pass next to it without seeing it, Nice hotel 5 minutes walk from Lancaster underground station and Hyde park also by taxi it cost you max 7 from London paddington station if you are using the Heathrow express train
161589,Arbor Hyde Park, Breakfast was included but apparently continental only and a surcharge applied to my bill Needs to be clearer when offering this as breakfast included should not be limited to a type in my opinion , Location friendliness of staff and quality of food 
161590,Arbor Hyde Park, Cooked breakfast is not included in the price No fridge minibar in the room , Great rooms great location friendly staff The hotel is tastefully decorated quiet and just 450m from the tube station Rooms and bathrooms are clean and beds very comfortable 
161591,Arbor Hyde Park, The noise from the room above was annoying all night long but the hotel refunded our breakfast to compensate, The breakfast was yummy although it arrived an hour earlier than we had asked for 
161592,Arbor Hyde Park, Just a small issue the bathroom is quite slippery one should take good caution there , We pretty much liked everything The location was amazing Since we have a 1 5 old he wakes up early enough so the closeness to Hyde Park was great for us every morning we would just cross the street and spend there an hour or two before all the attractions are opened up The hotel s breakfast starts at 7am which was also perfect The room was great comfortable big clean we enjoyed it The staff were amazing very helpful and nice One of them even informed us of something out of her working hours we crossed her by in the street Really lovely Hopefully we ll come here again sometime in the near future 
161593,Arbor Hyde Park, Cannot think of a thing , The location was perfect just a short walk to the tube Central Line and to Hyde Park The room itself was very comfortable The breakfast room was lovely and the Continental Breakfast quite nice with an option to upgrade 
161594,Arbor Hyde Park, The sound proofing from overhead adjacent rooms was a bit poor This time although the continental breakfast was fine the cooked breakfast was not up to the usual standards , As usual great staff and a comfortable room This is a great location coming in from Paddington with good connections and a park just opposite I will keep using this hotel when I can get in 
161595,Arbor Hyde Park, There was no mini bar fridge in the room This made it hard to store any food or drinks in the room , Staff were amazing helpful and very accomodating They didn t mind that we had young children and were very understanding and made us feel right at home The in house continental breakfast was of the highest standard and plentiful Finally the location of the hotel was in a great spot near Hyde Park All of the main attractions in London were close by 
161596,Arbor Hyde Park, Thought breakfast was included but had to pay extra if wanted cooked , Pleasant comfortable room Nespresso machine was a welcome addition Good breakfast Good late evening glass of wine Excellent service throughout 
161597,Arbor Hyde Park, No gym breakfast quite limited extra items at a cost were underwhelming nonetheless these are very trivial , Superb location very clean top customer service wifi problems were fixed in a few minutes very caring staff sophisticated lovely croissants Thoroughly enjoyable stay 
161598,Arbor Hyde Park, We could here our upstairs neighbors Room was tiny not that did not bothered us because at the end of the day you just sleep , Bed was super comfy tea and nespresso coffee in rooms Breakfast was delicious great location walking distance to everywhere Shower was great heated towel rack in bathroom which was great as you could dry your smalls 
161599,Arbor Hyde Park, The breakfast buffet offered boiled eggs but they were cold hard boiled eggs We asked the hotel to order a cab and whichever company it used charged us almost twice what a black cab would have charged Would suggest the hotel find a company that doesn t rip off its customers, The room was very spacious and clean Good location Really nice touch was free treats on each floor and in the foyer coffee and water was on tap Really nice reception area the quality wasn t reflected in the room although it was adequate for our purposes The bathroom was great 
161600,Arbor Hyde Park, Unable to check in before 2p m although allowed to leave luggage Then had to queue afterwards to check in Staff very efficient but not very warm Modern shower too intense unable to regulate very well , Facilities good and bed very comfy Great location and quiet Liked the expresso coffee machine in room Brilliant breakfast choices and service 
161601,Arbor Hyde Park, At breakfast we only got 3 slices of toast for 4 people had to wait a long time to get some more sorted the following morning and requested more as we were served first lot of toast , Fantastic staff lovely hotel
161602,Arbor Hyde Park, Even though Booking com clearly stated that the credit card detail provided is ONLY for security purposes and that the Card will NOT be charged BEFORE arrival the hotel went ahead and charged the first night of stay to the card When I asked them to reverse the charge as I am paying by Cash they refused citing silly excuses I had also clearly stated that I will be paying by Cash for the entire stay on arrival but alas NOT good VERY STIFF FOM Duty Manager , Lovely cosy room VERY CLEAN Very Quiet area of Central London Great for a morning walk in the Hyde Park Perfect for a Business trip 
161603,Arbor Hyde Park, Price for the offered room too high, Rooms are a little bit small Double bed small 1 4 m width Breakfast good Location direct at Hyde Park Kensington Park Underground within 5 min walking distance
161604,Arbor Hyde Park, Squeaky floor in our room , Charming staff very well trained Nice design everywhere real flowers Very clean Good quality breakfast Fab Lights and sculptures Fantastic marble fireplace in the sitting room Comfortable convenient to Paddington and for getting around town delightful view out the back onto pretty gardens An excellent hotel 
161605,Arbor Hyde Park, What s not to like , Great hotel Really friendly staff Quiet comfortable room with everything you need Good breakfast Good location for Hyde Park and for getting around London on the Tube and bus I have no hesitations in recommending this hotel 
161606,Arbor Hyde Park, A serviceable lift would have saved our legs especially at check out time with luggage , The absence of traffic noise was a bonus The guests night pantry stocked with snacks and accessible at any time was a nice touch 
161607,Arbor Hyde Park, No complaints at all something very rare , I never gave this high rating to any hotel at this class This one is really flawless Way more comfortable than many hotels two times more expensive than this one Room size superior bed coffe machine perfect ac location all wonderfull
161608,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Fabulous boutique hotel well located close to Kensingon gardens hyde park many cafes and restaurants Loved the decor the comfy bed and spacious quiet room excellent breakfast friendly helpful staff and basicaly everything was just perfect for our stay in London 
161609,Arbor Hyde Park, Room had door to another adjoining room so it was rather noisy Could hear every word of their conversation , Great location and decent comfortable room The breakfast was pretty good too and the wait staff friendly 
161610,Arbor Hyde Park, Elevator wasn t working almost for a week and you have to climb up the stairs Air Conditioner in my room was broken For 6 days they haven t changed a bed and even a soap Some staff personnel are helpful and friendly but manager is not Obviously she is incompetent to arrange smooth operation of the hotel , Location
161611,Arbor Hyde Park, Feels like a 2 star hotel that has been given a 5 star re decoration job but a few corners have been cut hence some of the fixtures furnishings will date quickly In the meantime it is a nice place to stay Pillows could be of better quality , Very helpful and courteous staff remember your name and are going the extra mile good location near Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate tube station free tea and coffee in the room the hotel is newly decorated and clean 
161612,Arbor Hyde Park, We re accustomed to small hotel rooms overseas but this one was microscopic Wanted a bit more square footage for our money , Location is a priority for us and this place didn t let us down It s an easy walk from Paddington and practically on top of Hyde Park It s a very clean quiet boutique hotel and has everything you need 
161613,Arbor Hyde Park, Kettle on room Had to use coffee machine , Fantastic location peaceful Lovely staff very clean Lovely breakfast Would recommend and will definitely return when visiting London Thank you for a very lovely stay

161624,Arbor Hyde Park, Just one recommendation if you ask the front desk personal to call for a taxi make sure they call a taxi with meter Otherwise they will call a company that charges almost twice as much for a ride than regular taxis not nice , Very comfortable room good breakfast

161627,Arbor Hyde Park, The only thing we would have liked at the end of the long day is to have a sociable drink together but the hotel staff said you couldn t drink alcohol in the lounge , The hotel is located in a lovely quiet area but right on the doorstep on Hyde Park There was 12 of us in our party and the staff were very accommodating The d cor was really beautiful and the bathrooms were spotless The breakfast was superb and all in all many of us will be returning to this little gem 
161628,Arbor Hyde Park, We booked a superior double room for 3 nights and got a downstairs one with no daylight and a smelly rug In the second evening when we got back from town and my girlfriend fell down the stairs in the room I asked to change rooms but the hotel was fully booked Only in the third night we got the room we paid for which was very nice ,No Positive
161629,Arbor Hyde Park, did request a higher level room but that was never offered lots of stairs to tranverse to our room 10 Didn t worry us and help was available for luggage but older travellers may struggle , good included breakfast comfortable beds close to subway

161636,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The room was very comfortable for the four us Everyone slept great after full days seeing the sights The staff could not have been more accommodating and welcoming My girls particularly liked the pantries with snacks and the breakfast was delicious A charming property just a block from Hyde Park 
161637,Arbor Hyde Park, The staff were uninviting and seemed a little dissatisfied with anything I asked for I am usually a happy traveller and used to smiles and courtesy I felt like I was staying in a boarding school rather than a hotel Where I was briskly told off for not handing keys The atmosphere was cold The hotel is not the pretty boutique hotel I thought it would be It was cold predominantly because of the staff , The hotel was in a great quite yet central location close to Hyde Park in a beautiful converted house 
161638,Arbor Hyde Park, There was nothing we didn t like but continental breakfast I thought cold meats didn t look fresh, Traveling by train it was very easy to get to from Paddington The hotel is very tastefully designed and very clean 
161639,Arbor Hyde Park, Staff seemed robotic almost like they were told to be friendly rather than feeling the need to be friendly, Comfort of hotel was good staff were friendly and quality of the food was good
161640,Arbor Hyde Park, the rooms are not soundproofed i could hear word perfect the next rooms conversation and the tv playing till the early hours of the night in addition to that my room was 1 room away from the common corridor with banged open and closed all night really disappointing nights sleep in particular as i was having meetings early the next morning , the bed was comfortable and the room was exceptionally clean and gave the feeling of being quite spacious Good location for tube and a short walk to restaurants etc 
161641,Arbor Hyde Park, Once I d turned the heating down the only downside was the really creaky floor boards woken at night from other guests moving around plus could hear the water pipes too , Quality furnishings and a lovely breakfast included nice staff great location handy for walking to the tube or bus or Oxford st Kensington palace 
161642,Arbor Hyde Park, Supposed to be Club Room but was tiny very hot Got very poor nights sleep , Nice location close to Hyde Park Coffee machine in room good quality 
161643,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Excellent location several tube stops one block from the park short walk to Paddington and Heathrow Express Very nice to walk around away from the busy areas 
161644,Arbor Hyde Park, I was shocked with the reservation manager s attitude He told me to treat him well and then he can treat me well and help me The issue is about our 2 5years old daughter could not stay with us even not asked for a baby cot after I shared my disappointment about it they discussed and he told me that we could stay together but told us that we had breakfast for two only so my little daughter could not this is the most strangest thing I have ever faced in my life after being asked that I have to treat him well and its a prerequisite for us to get help from them is exactly is a threatining thing so strongly not recommended and please be careful with the reservation manager because he was so close to attack me following his threatining sentences , Location and a few hotel employee 
161645,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The location of the Hotel is ideal Close to Lancaster Gate tube Station Great for walking in Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens Continental Breakfast is very good 
161646,Arbor Hyde Park, We liked everything although due to being there on a few warm days the heating was still on so the communal areas were really hot and the bathroom was boiling with the underfloor heating , The bedroom was spacious bathroom was a good size although had a large shower instead of a bath There was a good selection at breakfast Enjoyed extras like the pantry idea where you get snacks fruit crisps and chocolate at no additional cost 
161647,Arbor Hyde Park, Its sounds silly but we had a little green light on the ceiling which was very bring during the night and woke me up a few times Also found the room really hot as we were in the lower ground room , Location was good but a little further then Oxford Street then first thought Continental Breakfast was lovely
161648,Arbor Hyde Park, The room very bad carpet smell No clothes cupboard no drawers we left all personal stuff in the suitecases Very uncomfortable light system can t control the lights from bed No kettle no tea bags The hotel charge 4 pounds for cappucino at breakfast The Under Line Very bed value for money , Nothing 
161649,Arbor Hyde Park, Room on the small side and with standard sized bed On the wrong side of Hyde Park Kensington Gardens for the museums Albert Hall so don t forget to add travelling time although a walk through the park is pleasant on the right day , Spotlessly clean apparently refurbished a year ago and well decorated with excellent bathroom Very obliging staff Continental breakfast a cut above the average with really good quality ingredients Proper coffee maker in the room a nice touch once you ve found out how to use it Very quiet location Reasonable restaurants within a short walk Reasonable value at a large discount 
161650,Arbor Hyde Park, The walls are paper thin You can hear everything that happens in a room next to yours and I do mean everything Snoring talking the lot Add to it old wooden floors and you can say goodbye to a good night of rest It is a shame if not for this serious problem the hotel would be a gem , Lovely and clean hotel with attentive staff and nice interiors 
161651,Arbor Hyde Park, Bath room was small and we may have been more comfortable if we could have a towel hanging rail near the basin , Among the nice staff Ms Virag was in particular kind and helpful Location was good and we felt safe even when we were back to the hotel late in the evening 
161652,Arbor Hyde Park, It could have been better if cooked breakfast was included in the room price , Staff was polite and showed us to our room We stayed in a family room which was very spacious and clean The breakfast was continental with many choice lovely service We will love to book again in the near future 
161653,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing really Everything thing was spot on , Everything was just lovely excellent continental buffet breakfast included in the price location ideal for buses and tubes very friendly staff noyhing was too much trouble Can highly recommend this hotel 
161654,Arbor Hyde Park, Chairs in the room were hard and not very comfortable , Very comfortable bed room and bathroom spotlessly clean continental breakfast first class plenty of choice and plenty of food on offer No need to pay anything extra for a cooked breakfast Staff friendly efficient and accommodating 
161655,Arbor Hyde Park, Would have been better to have a kettle rather than a coffee machine Minor issue though We had a club room which we could not fault apart from the fact that it had a connecting door to another room French girls in that room very noisy coming in at night talking laughing banging bathroom door until 2pm 3 nights Not the Hotels fault probably should have complained they would have sorted it , So very clean very friendly helpful staff excellent breakfast Lovely location quiet very close to Hyde Park underground Would stay here again 
161656,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Bed was very comfortable and the d cor was modern and fresh plenty of very nice white towels and a Nespresso coffee machine in our room was a nice little touch 
161657,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, A nice boutique hotel which is a welcome break from the big chain locations Situated in a quiet location with transportion links only a stones throw away Very pleasant staff and also a nice continental breakfast just ashame the full English is not included 
161658,Arbor Hyde Park, Reserved a 28sqm executive double room which would have been perfect Site said kids welcome Called in advance and was told that coming with two kids 8 and 5 was no problem On arrival manager said it would have been ok if the younger child was 2 or less and appeared to only want to make us pay more at all price Felt disgusted and trapped and decided that if I had to pay more at least they won t benefit so we decided to split my wife and kids stayed and I booked a single room in a cheap hotel within walking distance Talk about ruined vacation There are lots of other nice hotels in the area I know I ll avoid this one in the future , The location
161659,Arbor Hyde Park, The food was average Room service dinner was edible but not great breakfast had great parts lovely breads and granola but cut fruit was not ripe selection of fruit in fruit bowl was not great and small things like only a cup of tea not a pot etc But it was fine and did not detract much from our otherwise happy stay , Excellent location very helpful and friendly staff Very big executive family room spotless and comfortable 
161660,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing to ask for , The Arbor at Hyde Park was a very good hotel The service staff was great there was good elevator My room was upgraded without my request I felt safe and comfortable The pillows were very good which is not common in hotels now The breakfast was outstanding I would definitely go back again 
161661,Arbor Hyde Park, Breakfast took ages to arrive but the staff were very understanding and offered to reduce the cost so i was happy in the end , Coffee machine in the room was great Nice spacious room 
161662,Arbor Hyde Park, The fact that we could only stay one night , From the moment we arrived your staff could not do enough to make our stay perfect nothing was too much trouble also the continental breakfast was of the highest standard 
161663,Arbor Hyde Park, Although there was an Nespresso machine with pods to have coffee there was no kettle for the tea Nothing major though , The staff were very attentive and even upgraded our room upon arrival at no extra cost The continental breakfast was also of a very high quality Nespresso machine in the room was also a nice touch 
161664,Arbor Hyde Park, Breakfast was just ok you had to pay extra for most everything Did not receive a smile from the staff once smaller room than anticipated based on pictures and description Was expecting more with this customer rating , Loction was excellent nice bathroom
161665,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing, Excellent hotel in a great location by Hyde Park for this part of London good value for money Rooms are clean and comfortable and staff welcoming and helpful

161667,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, This is a great hotel quiet clean modern comfortable and very close to Hyde Park The staff was very kind and helpful Luckily we had the chance to be upgraded to the executive room which was perfect for two large luminous and very very comfortable Good to know for European travelers in each room there is one socket that is compatible with European plugs The hotel is less than 5 min walk from the Lancaster Gate underground station and less than 2 min walk from a bus stop I strongly recommend this hotel 
161668,Arbor Hyde Park, N A, The staff was incredibly helpful and accommodating I felt so comfortable and relaxed The rooms were adorably modern and fashionable and the neighborhood was quaint quiet and very centralized Snacks were spot on for a late night craving and breakfast was delicious Perfect choice 
161669,Arbor Hyde Park, No breakfast variety and you have to pay for cooked food, The location is perfect quite hyde park is just around the corner lancaster gate is so near the staff is amazing sure will come back again

161675,Arbor Hyde Park, The elevator sucks big time After we arrived in this hotel we saw them working on it already but after few days it was terrible They should replace the elevator my sister got trapped inside and the bell was not working luckily she brought her phone with her and she called me up through Facebook messenger while she was inside it it took some time for them to get her out The room was not that clean I know if the place is dusty because I keep sneezing they didn t replace the sheets everyday The water pressure was very poor one of reason I like to stay in hotel because of water volume but that s not the case here in this hotel I choose this hotel for good review and well for the price but I should have stay in some well known hotel if I can turn back the time so problems like this won t be encountered by me I have a small baby and climbing to 4th floor in the stairs was hell The reception said sorry about it but not sincerely and according to him sometimes this kind of event will happen to anyone given it s gonna be but atleast the bell still working so someone can ask for help And seems like if someone will die inside they won t take accounts with it Upon arrival we were so tired to eat outside so I decided to order a pizza and they served us a pizza where it was still cold in the center We put a note and they gave me a note as well apologizing for it and box of chocolate That was sweet of them But they should be more professional enough to sell their services and products so the money paid in exchange will be well compensated If this will be the life in London oh well I won t dare to go back and if I do I will book in some reputable hotel where the percentage of this events will be so unlikely to happen , Polite staff i like the bed and the smell of the handsoap 
161676,Arbor Hyde Park, Staff are largely disinterested The room I had 004 was tiny at the back of the hotel and smelt of cannabis The room service was really bad A very limited menu of about 4 sandwiches which weren t all available The fresh soup was cold in the middle and the homemade crusty bread was two pieces of toasted sliced white bread Not what you expect from a high quality hotel at all The first time I stayed here last year it was lovely though I didn t eat there then and there seems to be an overall decline in quality since then , It s clean and well decorated etc 
161677,Arbor Hyde Park, Our room had an adjoining door where I think you could choose to have the next door room for friends or kids On one or two occasions the Italian couple next door were a little too audible whether sorting out their work or ahem pleasure That was all though over a 5 day stay , Location is great very near to the park and only a couple of minutes from the Central Line tube Inclusive wifi and continental breakfast unlike some more expensive local competitors Rooms well equipped and comfortable 
161678,Arbor Hyde Park, Biscuits in the room would be a bonus also a kettle as water in coffee maker doesn t boil sufficiently to make a hot reviving cuppa , The hotel has a lovely atmosphere due in large part to the friendly staff and comfortable surroundings The rooms are well maintained clean and comfortable Breakfast is plentiful and buffet service allows for personal choice 
161679,Arbor Hyde Park, Some of the staff is rather unpolite unable to smile make you feel like a burden NO MINIBAR , Large room and bathroom spotlessly clean small but good breakfast near to Paddington quiet
161680,Arbor Hyde Park, The expresso coffee maker does not work as well when you would like tea Put a kettle in the room , The hotel room and staff were very nice and polite The rooms are very well decorated and clean Located near to the underground so travelling in London was not a problem 
161681,Arbor Hyde Park, I d have liked a king bed rather than a double as it was a superior room In fairness it probably would ve fitted in that part of the room , Superb staff Nice design Lovely coffee maker in the room Breakfast was great too Definitely recommended I would happily stay here again 
161682,Arbor Hyde Park, The staff I didn t like the seriousness of them also when asking them to order a taxi the lady at the desk said a car would be cheaper it wasn t a car was 18 and a taxi from the same place back was 10 after 12oclock also it s only a continental breakfast included in the room price You are in LONDON ENGLAND Full English breakfast should be mandatory when including breakfast with a room I say , The room was clean and pretty as was all of the hotel
161683,Arbor Hyde Park, Only negative for us was high cost of cooked breakfast option Cheaper hotels offer more extensive range for breakfast No children s cereal option was disappointing too , Lovely hotel with very clean comfortable rooms and nice added extras in room 
161684,Arbor Hyde Park, Parking is a bit of Spain round here and staff weren t too clear on options, Generally staff were very helpful room was very comfortable clean and very spacious we were upgraded to executive family room Breakfast was lovely too Close to subway 
161685,Arbor Hyde Park, The floor is making sound hallway carpet needs an upgrade , Small but functional room The bed is very comfy fast Internet which is rare in Europe the breakfast is ok It s an upscale residential area very quiet neighborhood yet convenient to everything and the Paddington station is in walking distance ideal for LHR travelers using Heathrow express 
161686,Arbor Hyde Park, It was difficult to access the clothing storage space which was in the entry way , Great location Ideal for getting about in central London Friendly and helpful staff an excellent breakfast Very clean and comfortable with modern decore It was a big room for a London Hotel plus a very comfy bed Nespresso machine is always a big plus with me 
161687,Arbor Hyde Park, Water pressure in the shower and not having the room so hot , Good location within 10 minutes of Lancaster Gate tube Staff very helpful and friendly and plenty of them Comfortable room although a bit on the small side Nice and quiet hardly believe you were in the centre of London 
161688,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing loved it, Everything So well designed they had thought of everything even a make up mirror and the staff were lovely We ve already booked to go back 
161689,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing, Tucked away but close to Hyde Park this hotel is superb The staff were all friendly and obliging the room was spacious for London West and the continental breakfasts were wonderful As it is not a large hotel there was a feeling of intimacy and the personal touch It is truly bijou a gem 
161690,Arbor Hyde Park, Breakfast Manager did not listen to my needs and was very imposing of what he thought I wanted , Location was 5 mins from my client Nice boutique hotel Very nice welcome Help with my luggage to the room 
161691,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was small for two people We had some noisy neighbours on our floor , Location and lovely new hotel The breakfast is very good They had some nice touches such as free fruit and snacks 
161692,Arbor Hyde Park, Very loud lift we were woken up in the middle of the night and early morning every time when the lift was used We were given every day just one small bottle of shower gel per two persons Was definitely not enough The bed in the double room is far too narrow for two people , Decent hotel in a nice area
161693,Arbor Hyde Park, Continental Breakfast included but it doesn t include cooked dishes extra pay for them as well as for an espresso Windows completely closed in the room no possibility in opening for some fresh air , Quite close to the tube reception open 24 hrs
161694,Arbor Hyde Park, Espresso machine in room very difficult to work and not very effective A kettle would be much better Facilities basic We were supposed to be in an executive room but it was very small Not sure what a basic room would be like , Location good and nice quiet road Clean room Pleasant staff 
161695,Arbor Hyde Park, No mirror above the desk dressing table, Great location Excellent furnishings Very powerful shower Clean Delicious breakfast lots of choice even the continental
161696,Arbor Hyde Park, Reception staff were extremely rude The room was ridiculously small and you could hear people in the upstairs bedrooms as well as screaming children running up and down the corridors Our room was also located right opposite the lifts so we the sound of the sliding doors opening and closing constantly , Nothing
161697,Arbor Hyde Park, Very small bathrooms Some rooms like mine are interconnected and this was annoying since you hear lots of uncomfortable noises from the other room , Nice rooms well decorated Location is good Continental breakfast is OK
161698,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing, Excellent continental breakfast included in our room rate A rare find in London Staff helped us find a restaurant for dinner and were very happy to phone and book for us Great service lovely hotel just off Hyde Park I will use it again Easy 5minute walk to Tube or just walk across Hyde Park for Kensington shops and Museums 
161699,Arbor Hyde Park, No issues , Really friendly and helpful staff Very nice modern room Good continental breakfast Excellent value for money I would definitely stay again if I could get the room at that price No hesitation in recommending this hotel 
161700,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing at all , Staff were consistently excellent and breakfast was really good quality For size of hotel facilities were great Coffee machines very good too 
161701,Arbor Hyde Park, There were strange and very disturbing cracking sounds coming from all over the room all day even at night of which wakes you up It was terrible experience , Location
161702,Arbor Hyde Park, The doors dont have an additional lock so they close automaticly At around midnight someone walked into our room and my girlfriend woke up and started screaming and offcourse I woke then up aswell but just saw the guy leaving our room We called the staff to complain and he said nothing is wrong with the door and he cant do anything Great Service Then I tried to put some chairs and luggage in front of the door so its not going to happen again After what happened we couldnt fall asleep anymore The hotel is very noisy and anytime we heard some noice I checked the door Honestly just not right After I needed to sent 2 emails to complain I finally got an answer They said Its my fault that and I probably didnt close the door right Remember the automatic closing and looking door But its my fault So after I said that I want my money back they offered me a crazy discount of 25 for my next stay in their hotel No customer Service We really stayed in alot of different hotel around the world but I never had such a bad customer service and experience , The Room itself was ok

161712,Arbor Hyde Park, When we booked the room months ago we mentioned that we have a child of 8 years old and wanted a family room On arrival they put us into a basement room which is damp and smelly We naturally asked for transfer to a room upstairs The Manager insisted that we pay 60 Pounds more before we could move upstairs In such case we had to do so I am unhappy as we travelled with family and friends Breakfast staff was not hospitable , Location

161728,Arbor Hyde Park, Check in was very automated not many pleasantries very quick and regimented The receptionist that checked us in and out also answered the phone to someone else on both occasions After working in hotels myself I would expect her to ignore it or at leats say Do you mind if I answer this Rather than just doing it and making the guests in front of her wait and not have a great impression of the customer service Once at our room and the concierge helping with our luggage I shortly saw that our room was awful not what was shown on the website that we had booked at all As soon as I walked into the room and the concierge had left I told my partner I would not be staying in the room I went back down to reception and explained how disappointed I was the room was cramped not an executive as we had booked dark and not what we expected especially as it was a special occasion for us our 1 year anniversary A very kind gentleman called Gabriel showed me to another room although the same type of room executive it was more spacious lighter and the little seating area had enough room for 2 to enjoy the space opposed to just room for one in our original room Once moved we just relaxed in our room before making our way to Winter Wonderland our reason for going On return I asked for 2 champagne glasses and a bottle opener to be bought to the room within 5 minutes we had it and that was it for the night Breakfast was included in our room rate although not cooked so we still had to pay for this very confusing on booking and also on check in We got given a voucher for 12 for breakfast so we didn t have to pay full price neither of us really understood as it wasn t explained very well but we used it anyway My boyfriend ordered the Arbor breakfast full English and was very happy Unfortunately I cannot say the same I ordered Eggs Royale English muffin smoked salmon poached egg and hollandaise sauce , Close to Hyde Park and a tube station to take us directly to Westfield Couldn t hear any traffic so getting to sleep was easy without outside noise what we are used to after travelling from the Cotswolds 
161729,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, We were upgraded to a suite on arrival for free after booking a double executive room The room was very clean with a comfy bed and great shower Free Nespresso coffee machine in the room with complimentary sweets and snacks just outside the room The staff couldn t of been friendlier Highly recommended and will stay here again 
161730,Arbor Hyde Park, We liked everything , The staff were very professional friendly and efficient The continental breakfast was fabulous with a wonderful selection of fresh food The room was lovely and quiet coffee maker comfortable bed scrupulously clean excellent shower iron ironing board hairdryer 
161731,Arbor Hyde Park, Room might be a little bit small but it was totally understandable as to its ace situation , The staff was brilliant and very caring We lost our purse and they were concerned and paid extra attention to our emotional state which I highly appreciate Bed was so comfy the facilities in the room were impeccable at least according to our need The breakfast was a definite plus even it was cold buffet it was sumptuous and the ham was yummy We also enjoy the toast and fruits and fresh juice there The decor was elegent and relaxing A ten goes to Arbor Hyde 
161732,Arbor Hyde Park, The lobby hotel signage was not distinct enough from the street missed it on the way there , Friendly staff great decor quiet area and yet within walking distance to Lancaster Gate underground and Paddington train station 
161733,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Comfortable beds lovely bed linen Bath robes slippers Coffee machine and snacks Staff friendly and helpful Decor wonderfully festive Superb breakfast
161734,Arbor Hyde Park, All staff are very new They do not know much information about the hotel They were not able even to print my invoice when I was making my check out , Location
161735,Arbor Hyde Park, Room was much smaller than anticipated for a club room Also walls are thin and noise from rooms aboce, Friendly staff great breakfast comfortable beds and lovely bathroom
161736,Arbor Hyde Park, Reception not very welcoming they tried one day before arriving to move me to another hotel Very strange and unusual Had to really convince them that that would not be acceptable room was very noisy Could hear neighbors completely, Location is excellent
161737,Arbor Hyde Park, Unfortunately I was in an interconnecting room which meant that I could hear every movement in the room next door what was on their TV and when they went to the bathroom This meant I had a very poor night s sleep , Lovely hotel in a nice quiet part of London yet still central enough Good value and friendly staff 
161738,Arbor Hyde Park, It sounded like the people in the neighbouring room were actually in the room with us , Lovely room very clean and quite spacious Excellent breakfast 
161739,Arbor Hyde Park, Hotel is quite new but it s joint by two buildings we have to take lift to 2nd floor and walk through a door and walk down to staircase to reach our room and after open our room there is another staircase you have to walk down to get into your room very troublesome if you have heavy luggage , Location is ok 5mins walk from train station 
161740,Arbor Hyde Park, Hotel was a little noisy the walls are paper thin , Clean well appointed rooms if a little small but with nice high ceilings Very friendly staff particularly at breakfast A decent selection of food on offer at breakfast too 
161741,Arbor Hyde Park, Only criticism is bedside lights set on wall do not switch off independently However as everything else rated high scores we have not marked down, The welcome from Gabriel who was kindness itself and so very helpful All other staff were great but our dealings were mainly with Gabriel 
161742,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was small and without a view would ask for a first floor room next time, The hotel is in an excellent location within walking distance of Knightsbridge It is a 5 minute walk to the tube and from there only 10 minutes to Euston by tube The area is very quiet and it is nice to be able to walk in Hyde Park and get to different attractions like Kensington Palace on foot The staff are charming 
161743,Arbor Hyde Park, Room just a bit too small made it uncomfortable even though bed and linens high quality also walls not that think so snoring next room was audible , Clean and stylish nice lobby and public areas bathroom good
161744,Arbor Hyde Park, An old building so expect some creeks and squeaks Also some noise from guests above Also the additional 15 each for breakfast was just a continental selection Cooked options are in addition , The decor and finish to a high standard throughout Great bathroom facilities room well designed Staff extremely helpful and friendly 
161745,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was too small It was very difficult to move in and there was no space for the luggages It would be just ok for single use , Nice small hotel in a very good location 
161746,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Love the location of this hotel nestled in the corner of the square but only a short walk to park entrance bus stop and tube Staff are always polite and welcoming Continental breakfast offers a range of goodies too 
161747,Arbor Hyde Park, Impossibly tiny room even for one person Hence I felt my stay was overpriced Apparently family and executive suits are bigger , Very helpful hotel staff good service Central location 
161748,Arbor Hyde Park, The cooked breakfast was not great but we really enjoyed the continental breakfast thereafter , The staff were all very friendly the room was clean decent bed and the aircon ensured it was comfortable The bathroom was good with a spacious powerful shower The continental breakfast was tasty and sufficient 
161749,Arbor Hyde Park, nothing, Location is top Friendly staff Hotel is absolutely spotless and stylish bed very comfortable rooms rather on the small size but bathroom surprisingly big and very modern will stay again if in the area
161750,Arbor Hyde Park, our room was very small and below street level felt a bit claustrophobic, Great staff decor very well done new and beautiful Bfast was great for a cold buffet Really nice boutique hotel
161751,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, A lovely small boutique hotel A warm welcome and a nice to be given an upgrade on the room I had booked by London standards the room was huge It was very comfortable and peaceful Then continental breakfast in the morning was also of a good quality Also a good position next to Hyde Park and just a few minutes walk to the nearest tube station 
161752,Arbor Hyde Park, No bad experiences , Location love the neighbourhood feel of the area Good restaurants within walking area Close to underground Hyde Park and Paddington Station Great boutique hotel very funky decor Very comfortable Very clean Good value for London London hotels are very expensive Arbor Hyde Park is in the same price range as Quality Inn and Best Western and MUCH nicer 
161753,Arbor Hyde Park, rooms are quiet small I was upgraded to a Club room and it was pretty small good for one night but more than that would be a pain also why isn t there an iron in the room , good location easy to get to from Paddington 10 mins walk close to restaurants and pubs 
161754,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Good location Easy walk from Paddington Two minutes to Hyde Park Genuinely helpful staff Felt safe as a solo female guest Very clean Great service at breakfast which was fresh and plentiful Could have had full English for extra 7 Smart boutique style reception area 
161755,Arbor Hyde Park, I booked the hotel because it appeared to be a boutique hotel offering comforts such as an espresso machine but then the room had no fridge and cheap nasty long life milk Breakfast service did not start until 7am weekdays far too late and I ordered a takeaway breakfast on a day I had to leave early and received a stale sandwich orange juice and a banana When I was asked what the breakfast was like I said the sandwich was stale and perhaps some dry biscuits with ham and cheese would be a better option and I was told bad luck There seems to be a like it or lump it attitude with the staff I did leave my luggage in storage at the hotel for the day after checking out I had left some toiletries in my room but when I returned to collect my luggage this was not mentioned Surely it is the hotel s responsibility to notify a customer if they have left something in their room There is a much better value hotel currently being refurbished a couple of blocks away and I will stay there next time I am in London , The Location was very good just down the road from Lancaster Gate Tube station and opposite Kensington Gardens which leads through to Hyde Park One staff member was particularly helpful checking my flight cancellation on the computer and assisting me with locating a book store 
161756,Arbor Hyde Park, In the room there was a pungent smell of both mold and sewer This has been tried too hide by spraying there massive amount of some type of air freshener Especially the corners smelled so badly that you coud not even go close We tried to keep windows open but even that did not help In order to prevent the smell to stick to our belongings we had to move all our personal belongings into the bathroom for this one night we stayed there , The location is very convenient The bathroom was new and tidy The bed was clean 
161757,Arbor Hyde Park, Housekeeping not at level Didn t change towels or sheets even when they saw they have to be changed Poor breakfast Small rooms, Nice location nice and helpful people at reception renovated 1 5 year ago so everything is nice Comfortable beds and pillows this is very important for some people 
161758,Arbor Hyde Park, No drawers for underwear etc Water in coffee pot never reached boiling to make tea , Staff were fantastic particularly Slava Gintare and Aiste All staff were very professional friendly and helpful A minor problem was sorted out very quickly We would highly recommend this hotel 
161759,Arbor Hyde Park, For a superior room it was a tad small only one chair for example Expresso machine lovely coffee but no kettle, Very comfortable bed fab breakfast 
161760,Arbor Hyde Park, There was nothing I didn t like , The hotel is in a fantastic location but tucked away so very quiet The staff were all very helpful and efficient Breakfast was excellent We would definitely stay at the hotel again 
161761,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The location was just five minutes walk from Hyde Park and between two Underground stops There were plenty of choices for dining nearby Our room was very comfortable the breakfast was very good value and all the staff were extra helpful from our arrival through to breakfast and on our departure 
161762,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, We liked the location Especially liked the d cor The room was fairly small but very well designed and very comfortable Breakfast was just fine Staff very pleasant and helpful 
161763,Arbor Hyde Park, The only negative was the lack of a small fridge in the room , Location The size of the room Good natural lighting well lit bed comfortable Quiet room no noise transfer from other rooms Good breakfast A bonus was apples snacks on each floor Loved the coffee machine in the room 
161764,Arbor Hyde Park, This is a relatively expensive hotel It is therefore unfortunate that the soundproofing is so bad I could hear everything everything that was going on in the room next door Not conductive to good sleep , Excellent breakfast very nice staff
161765,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing , The room was very quiet being off a main street but close to the tube and Paddington station The continental breakfast was more than adequate with the additional meats cheeses and hard boiled eggs 
161766,Arbor Hyde Park, There was no mini fridge in the room Old door key system Breakfast choices were very limited No bellboys Walking around the room I heard noise from the floor , Executive Double Room was Spacious compared to other hotels in London friendly staff close to Hyde Park and underground stations there was Nespresso machine in the room Housekeeping staff was doing such a great job keeping the place very clean 
161767,Arbor Hyde Park, The low score here is due to the fact that the hotel could not accommodate me due to maintenance issues They arranged alternative accommodation for me but this establishment was a much lower standard than the Arbor which I have enjoyed staying in before ,No Positive
161768,Arbor Hyde Park, This was quite a biggie unfortunately I had four packages delivered for a conference On arrival I was told only one had arrived The next morning they found another one but two had apparently not arrived I left for the conference without them but when the courier company confirmed they d been delivered they found them in another storeroom , It was a very quiet location The hotel was spotless and the breakfast was excellent 
161769,Arbor Hyde Park, we booked an executive double didn t like the layout split level and a very small double bed nice and clean though, staff very helpful good location
161770,Arbor Hyde Park, The rates were quite high But that is more a general problem in London and not specific to this Hotel, I had a very pleasant stay at the Arbor Hyde Park Location is great room was big clean and very quiet Staff was very friendly 
161771,Arbor Hyde Park, Staff seem to be a bit stand offish Did not like the double level room , The location is excellent and the hotel is always extremely clean Breakfast very good 
161772,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, I needed an urgent letter sending and the staff sent someone to the nearest post office They also provided a packed breakfast as I had an early morning start Great service 
161773,Arbor Hyde Park, Having to give the key back each time you leave the building was a bit of a nuisance but it s their policy , Very friendly staff Comfortable bed and proper pillows I was upgraded to a better room had booked several months in advance A good location between tube lines and great for walks in Hyde Park Very clean Stored bags before check in and after check out so I could enjoy London while waiting for flights Excellent shower Beautifully renovated Recommended 
161774,Arbor Hyde Park, Staff were not entirely polite Cost was higher than what I would consider good value , Beautifully designed lobby comfortable and really clean rooms Great location 
161775,Arbor Hyde Park, Very decent breakfast, Fairly acceptable price at this time of year in comparison with other very costly hotels Nice location near Lancaster gate Hyde park 
161776,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing to complain about , We loved everything about The Arbor Hyde Park The room was lovely and big fabulous bathroom with underfloor heating and great location just a short walk to Hyde Park Breakfast was great and even had snacks supplied outside our room 
161777,Arbor Hyde Park, Room was very compact but for the price and just for a one night stay was fine , Really friendly staff good location Great value for money perfect for a short stay Decor of hotel was lovely had a boutique feel about it 
161778,Arbor Hyde Park, The capsule coffee wasn t really nice to drink so had to get out and buy coffee from outside instead of having one in the room before heading out , i love the morning reception desk lady It was really nice of her to offer peppermint tea when I was feeling a bit under the weather that morning 
161779,Arbor Hyde Park, Rooms and beds are to small Staff is not service minded We mentioned that on the confirmation of the booking from booking com the rooms where bigger and had two windows The staff said that this was impossible All the club rooms are the same they said we only could get an other room with an additional payment We where with six and payed already in february Than we expect more service With the same staff we never go back , it was a nice location Every thing was modern and clean 
161780,Arbor Hyde Park, A little hard to find tucked away in the corner of the square I also had the bedroom next to the lift shaft which was noisy , Clean and quiet hotel with friendly staff Very convenient for tube and central London Coffee machine and treats a nice touch 
161781,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Location in a quiet corner so close to Hyde Park and the underground Room had everything we needed and big fluffy towels in the bathroom Continental breakfast was more than enough 
161782,Arbor Hyde Park, close to hyde park great location however still a bit of a walk from tube slight inconvenience if you have big luggage wifi a bit slow connection unstable, charming hotel near hyde park prime location clean comfortable best complimentary continental breakfast i ve seen in a long time
161783,Arbor Hyde Park, I had a basement room 001 which is only accessible by stairs although stairs aren t extensive I was helped with my luggage on arrival I did have to make a point of asking for help on other occasions of my stay due to carrying luggage back forth to meetings in out of hotel as a designer carrying many garment samples There was also some confusion at check in that my boss had booked the reservation when i told them several times in fact I had made the booking myself on both our behalfs that I found was quite rude my name was on booking so it was clear I made reservation in a way as i felt they weren t taking me seriously as a business traveller Room service menu has good selection although standard of food was poor for a hotel of this price rating Can t comment on breakfast as I didn t have time to try it Upon leaving hotel at any time you are required to hand in keys at reception which i found a little extreme Although well presented hotel feels like you are in someone s home rather than an actual hotel Was woken up several times on 2nd night by the resident in the room next to me walls are thin i could hear them talking knocking the walls repeatedly trying to put a plug in the wall presumably possibly drunk worse for wear as I could hear staff coming up down to attend to them slamming doors etc , Hotel is obviously new well presented very clean Decorated to a high standard Location is convenient for central London 5 min walk to Lancaster tube Wifi is ok for business travellers although this hotel isn t really geared up for business needs Room was fairly small Club Double I think but adequate no view as in basement apart from brick wall with slugs on wasn t really value for money as 200 GBP per night However London prices are always high Smoking area is handy if you smoke but I think it is mostly there to stop you smoking outside of hotel as this is probably frowned upon 
161784,Arbor Hyde Park, 12 for two to upgrade from continental to cooked breakfast Cooked breakfast should be included in a room in this price bracket , Quiet area with spotlessly clean modern room and very comfy bed Nespresso coffee machine in the room was a nice touch 
161785,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Hotel in quiet safe neighborhood close to several good pubs easy walk to Paddington Hyde Park and the Underground only blocks away Staff was very professional helpful and courteous The continental breakfast that was included was excellent 
161786,Arbor Hyde Park, The room was extremely small and bed was very hard it seemed far from all the sights that we as tourists came to see but able to get around on the tube, The hotel was very clean and staff very polite the area seemed safe and was close to the tube
161787,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Good room size not too small modern bathroom comfortable bed quite location Could open the windows and not be disturb by traffic noise Convenient for Hyde Park proms 
161788,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The room and hotel were fabulous and staff on reception very welcoming Breakfast was OK but very slow and food was not replaced when it had run out Otherwise a fabulous stay and would thoroughly recommend as perfect location
161789,Arbor Hyde Park, They only offer a coffee machien and no kettle so the water for making tea was not that hot, Excellent location Attentive staff Lovely continental breakfast Very comfortable room Powerful shower 5 mins walk to tube station
161790,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing , Excellent hotel couldn t fault it The staff were extremely friendly and helpful Breakfast was excellent I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in central London We were made feel so welcome form the minute we entered the hotel Staff couldn t do enough to make us feel comfortable and at home A real gem of a hotel We will definitely be back Thanks you all at the Arbor for making our stay so magical 
161791,Arbor Hyde Park, The staff is not very kind Especially the people of the reception do not know to give instructions such as the buses restaurants etc It seems that they are only trained to charge and don t care about giving other kind of services They really need to get more information about this I found the relation cost versus quality of the service very poor I asked for a wakeup call and they just forgot about it I think this is the minimum you can get for the price of the room I paid Fortunately I put my alarm otherwise I would have lost my train It seems that they are just starting to be trained however the cost of the rooms are high so we should get the equivalent in the service , I liked the location the style of the hotel and size of the hotel 
161792,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Staff was so accommodating Helping us find our way around the city letting us get an early start on breakfast bringing us ice helping us work the AC and stowing our luggage when we arrived early Ultimate service hotel 
161793,Arbor Hyde Park, Avoid the recommended chauffeur service that the hotel is offering when you ask for a taxi and insist on standard london taxi cab service Their chauffeur service is almost twice the rate of the standard it takes longer for them to show up at the entrance we had direct comparison and they come with drivers who have no clue about London and don t even know how to operate the navi or even speak proper English Room and bathroom too small A staircase behind our room s door that takes you straight into the bed , Quietness Proximity to Kensington Park we took a nice walk over to South Kensington Rather modern interior design Very very friendly staff I would specifically like to mention Lina Boreise at the reception desk 
161794,Arbor Hyde Park, lounge and room service but no drinks menu in rooms , The room and facilities were excellent we did not use the free wifi and were unsure about the additional cost for a cooked breakfast in terms of value for money But we enjoyed the stay and will probably return 
161795,Arbor Hyde Park, I would have preferred a kettle in the room rather than a coffee machine I found the pods not very nice and I love my coffee Although the staff were friendly and helpful I found them a little clinical and rigid at times , Great location for Hyde Park both train stations and bus stops Very clean and comfortable and the room was cleaned and made up daily which was always lovely to come back to at the end of the day When booking I asked for a quiet room and that s exactly what we got I sometimes wondered if there was anyone else staying as it was so lovely and quiet Breakfast was plentiful and delicious with an option for a cooked breakfast which we never had as the buffet style breakfast was more than enough Would definitely choose Arbor Hyde Park to stay in again and recommend to anyone planning a trip to London 
161796,Arbor Hyde Park, The building acoustics weren t that good We were wakened annoyingly early by walking in the room above us and other noise around the hotel doors closing etc , The overall modern vibe was very pleasant The proximity to Hyde Park was good a fairly quite location despite being close to the busy Bayswater Road 
161797,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, The atmosphere of the Arbor is relaxed and the welcome received at the front desk is always friendly The location is brilliant close to a bus stop and tube 
161798,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, Warmly welcomed and shown to room Everything spotless Loved the help yourself treats and the coffee machine in the room Only a short walk to Lancaster gate tube station and various bus stops so easy to get around London Good selection of continental breakfast 
161799,Arbor Hyde Park, Breakfast was good however the coffee not so good and staff a little slow but overall good experience and acceptable breakfast , The hotel was excellent on the morning that we were leaving we had some very sad news and it was a difficult situation for us the staff were amazing and so so caring and helpful this was sooo appreciated and i would like to say a big thank you yet again you were wonderful 
161800,Arbor Hyde Park, The double bed in our Club Double room was actually a double most hotels we ve stayed in have queen size beds described as doubles Can t fault this as the bed was correctly described The hotel requires guests to hand in their room key each time they leave the hotel then ask for it on return to the hotel This isn t ideal when there is only one person on reception they are already serving a guest One day my partner I came to uplift the room key found reception busy We each took turns visiting the bathroom still had to wait to get the room key It was an inconvenience seems a little silly , Fantastic location about a 10 minute walk from Paddington Station Heathrow Express minutes walk from Kensington Gardens Hyde Park The hotel was spotless The breakfast room staff were very friendly Little snack treats were available for guests on levels 2 4 which was a nice touch The bathroom was probably the best I ve encountered in any UK hotel in terms of being fresh modern with good water pressure a selection of shower head options All in all an enjoyable stay 
161801,Arbor Hyde Park, I have nothing bad to report , Arbor Hyde Park is the perfect boutique hotel There is no sign outside the reception area is like a living room The receptionist will happily make you a espresso or pour you a glass of wine Guests leave their keys at the front desk when leaving 
161802,Arbor Hyde Park, The hotel is well appointed but it felt a bit clinical and not particularly warm and welcoming No designated smoking area so we had to stand out in the street in all weather with no ashtrays etc We had to ask for extra supplies eg coffee pods tea bags as minimum were provided Bathroom supplies weren t always replenished either Small things really as it is a lovely boutique hotel in an excellent location, Excellent location close to Hyde Park Kensington Gardens local shops and restaurants tube station bus routes Great continental breakfast selection The free goodies shelf on the floor was a lovely gesture with fresh pastries or cookies available through the day
161803,Arbor Hyde Park, Staff were quite cold and rigid We had a dungeon room with a view of a wall down a tiny hallway The ceiling creaked constantly and when we advised staff the reply we received was well it s an old building ,No Positive
161804,Arbor Hyde Park, Despite being in England you ll have to pay 15 pounds for an English breakfast Continental breakfast was good but this is something to consider , Beautiful small scale hotel in a quiet part of the bustling centre of London with very friendly and helpful staff 
161805,Arbor Hyde Park, Cramped mean looking basic room and amenities no wardrobe hardly enough space to open your cases Just a horrible atmosphere and a characterless place to stay if you are on holiday in London The staff are surly and unhelpful everything is too much trouble for them There are extra charges for everything hidden in the small print at check in Definitely not recommended and it does not deserve a high rating The reception appeared to be constantly busy handling complaints from clients , Arbor Hyde Park is a bit cheaper than some of the boutique hotels near Hyde Park but this is a basic hotel with no character or cheer more like an expensive pension It is not good value for money and does not deserve a high rating for comfort or service Probably ok for a no frills business stopover in London Definitely not recommended as a holiday stay in London 
161806,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, All staff here are 110 customer focused At check in we were offered an upgrade to an executive room to make it more comfortable for the length of our stay which was for seven days That was most appreciated Staff at breakfast were welcoming courteous and super efficient Cooked breakfasts were available at an extra cost which we declined but there was a superb range of items to select from at the continental breakfast which was more than adequate The hotel is located in a quiet area just five minutes walk to Lancaster Gate Underground and a couple of local pubs the Swan on Bayswater Rd and the Mitre on Craven Terrace Recommended 
161807,Arbor Hyde Park, I found the staff at this hotel to be rather cold and suspicious of the guests They seemed very anxious that we were going to break something or not do something according to their rules No one who worked in the hotel was English all staff seemed to hail from Eastern Europe They were professional but there was not a sense of a warm welcome and that they would try to accommodate the needs of the guest They made us hand in our keys each time we left the hotel which was a bit concerning regarding privacy and lent itself to the general feeling of they were watching us and suspicious of our behavior One had the impression it was being run by the Russian mafia I also had problems with the plumbing it smelled like a sewer on the entire floor and I called it to their attention and they didn t get it fixed Rooms carry a lot of noise between and between floors poor sound proofing Expensive for this level of service , The location of this property is right next to Hyde Park which is lovely good for jogging picnics early morning walks and is in a very quiet block of London so no problems sleeping due to street noise It is 2 block walk to Underground and close to restaurants in the neighborhood and Paddington Station Rooms were quite large for London Great shower bath 
161808,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, We stayed here for 2 nights and we loved it Compared to many hotels in London of the same category this was far better The rooms are a bit small but as the average in London but clean and with all the comforts including a Nespresso machine biscuits tea a kettle and water all complimentary The breakfast is included and it is very good quality The staff is always very nice and trying to help The position is great as 3 mins walk from Lancastergate tube station right in front of Hyde Park We will definitely come back and recommend it to anyone 
161809,Arbor Hyde Park,No Negative, the bed was excellent So was the breakfast Great situation a few hundred meters far from tube station and the Hyde Park Surprisingly the bathroom components towels soap etc were fantastic and this must be the first time I have such a positive impression and feeling about such a detail but the type of details that change your trip from a good one to a great one 
161810,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing, the hotel is very clean The location is good near Hyde park and underground station The breakfast is good The staffs are very kind The hotel is very quiet 
161811,Arbor Hyde Park, It took 3 days to have the Iron sent to my room The towels smelled like they were used to dry a wet dog and the room was more fitting of Antman in the micro universe Too small by far , The Location is great Having a Pantry with tea cakes was a novel idea High standard of cleanliness 
161812,Arbor Hyde Park, Nothing, Amazing room
